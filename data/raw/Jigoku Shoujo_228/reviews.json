            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo takes place in modern Japan where the internet has filled the lives of many people in this bustling world of technology and sins. This anime portrays the cruelty of the human race, and shows that there are many people in this world that suffer terribly and that, indefinitely, most people wish those that are making their lives miserable would just die and go to hell. And, of course, Jigoku Shoujo, or Hell Girl, is there to exact their revenge.\rThe storyline is wonderful. The anime itself is mainly episodic, and each episode focuses mainly on one person, and the suffering they're experiencing due toone person. As you read more into the character's lives, and just how badly they're treated, you, yourself, will want to see that red string pulled, just so that person can suffer what he/she's had coming to them, and you'll be anxious to see their horrifying experience before they're ferried off to Hell by Enma Ai, the Jigoku Shoujo.\\n\\n\rYou won't always see the the person's experience in hell, nor will you always see the person being carried off by the Jigoku Shoujo. The main experience of this anime is coming to know and feel sorry for the characters that are desperate enough to call forth the Jigoku Shoujo to end their suffering. If you're looking for humor, this isn't a series to watch. Though it does have it's moments, it's more for the people that enjoy supernatural and paranormal related anime, such as Ghost Hunt and XXXHolic. In fact, if you enjoyed either of these, though the two of them are more humorous than anything else, I recommend putting Jigoku Shoujo, and Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori on your plan-to-watch list.\\n\\n\rAnyway, this anime is one of those where you'll either love it or hate it. This is a series that got me hooked on the first episode, but if you aren't enjoying it by the third or fourth, then you most likely won't get into it. I hope this review has helped you and convinced you to look into this wonderful anime. Have fun and enjoy.",

(MAL doesn't allow retroactive changes to episode count)]\r\nIt's like a badly chosen present. The outside wrapping is perfect, with a pretty ribbon to top it off. When you look inside though, the contents of the box aren't very impressive. You'll probably never use it or end up giving it to someone else.\r\nThese are the words I'd use to describe Jigoku Shoujo, a series strongly recommended to me by a friend. I was told the artwas amazing, and it was. The story, however, is far from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are what constitute as the wrapping paper. Every detail is immaculate, the character designs are vibrant, and every time Ai says \"Want to try dying once?\" it sends shivers down my spine. It deserves a warm hand of applause in that department.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where the animators succeeded, the writers failed spectacularly. It's not that the story is unappealing or lacks interest. There's plenty of that. Who wouldn't be intrigued about a girl sending evil wrong-doers to hell? The problem arises when each episode's format becomes obviously and unbearably identical. Upon watching the second episode, warning bells were sent ringing through my head when I realized that the mechanics were the same each time.\\n\\n\r\nBasically: A person is abused or wronged by someone else who is unapologetic and is unable to see their own acts as unjustified. The victim seeks a solution and calls upon Ai for help. However, they hesitate when she reveals that they too would be dragged down into hell when they died. In the end though, the victims are driven to the point of desperation by their tormentors and give in. Jigoku shoujo then proceeds to carry out the revenge. Evil person is sent to hell. Former victim is emancipated, but each look at the scar that appears on their chest as a reminder of what will happen to them when they die.\\n\\n\r\nThere. Shoot me. I just spoiled at least 20 episodes for you.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is episodic, but it's episodic to the extreme. Each episode presents a different set of characters and circumstances, but will almost always follow the storyline I presented above. So it wasn't until episode 22 that I saw a new type of plot as the season started to wind down to a close.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this sort of plot greatly disappointed me. I basically fell asleep on episode 4 and simply skipped 15 episodes. Now this is where I shoot myself in the foot. So, if I haven't watched the majority of the show, how can I really rate this as mediocre? ... True. I don't have complete authority on this matter, but it simply represents my opinion. I did end up taking the time to read the individual episode synopses on wikipedia, and it indicated that I didn't really miss much.\\n\\n\r\nI realize there are those who will be completely enraptured by Jigoku Shoujo's plot. It's simply a matter of taste. I prefer a plot that progresses in great strides, while some love to watch a well formed plot system that simply changes its details while laughing sadistically at the misfortunes that befall the characters. But as always, it's up to you, the viewer, to choose.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope I wasn't too forceful with my bitter commentary. o_o.",

            "content": "Its obviously a very sensitive subject. Personally i think nothing in RL could be any worse than hell, but that doesnt seem to be the case in this show. Considering how many users complete the contract, it almost gets out of hand . Getting cursed to hell because some lady kills your puppies? Thats a little extreme. But for the most part, most of the stories are pretty cruel and unusal \"train wreck\" stories that range anything from grade school bullies to betrayal to medical malpractice. Considering the main theme of the story being revenge, they could easily make 100 episodes out of thin air.That is also the problem of this show, the theme starts to get repetitive after about the 7th show. Its the same formula again and again: Tragic story --&gt; Hell request --&gt; Retribution. But just when you think its going to be the same formula over and over again, they throw in a curve ball of a plot twist and introduce 2 new main characters: Hajime and Tsugumi Shibata.\\n\\n\r\nThats when the show really starts to pick up, sortof. The story finally starts to pickup. No more spoilers here but if you lasted this long to reach this point in the series, then you shouldnt have any problem. The artwork is also a little mixed as well. At times its very artistic and beautiful and others it looks like your standard anime artwork. Even the art gets bitten by the repetative bug just like the story. Granted watching Enma Ai get out of the pool dripping wet in her white robe never gets old, but it hardly changes every episode. She even says the same lines over and over again every time as well, it wouldnt be a problem to me except hearing the same 20 sentences over and over and over again almost makes you think youre really in hell. There are plenty of characters drawn up for this show and they all look fine except for one trait... THE EYES. It takes a while to get used to the eyes...those damn eyes...\\n\\n\r\nI managed to keep my self awake for every episode and not even once fell asleep from the boredom (only once out of necessity). I think its because i always thought because the eyes were watching me. But I think it really means they at least did a good job feeling something for the characters in each story. On one side, you want to know if they\\'re going to get what they wished for, or you want to know why somone (i.e. tweenie) would want to pour so much hate agaisnt someone. And on the other side you want to know how the person whos being targeted is going to die. Kind of like the train wreck theory (ppl slowing down on the highway just to look at accidents). Aside from the ending, the episodes that interested me the most was EP6, 13, 15, 21, and 23&lt;--very sad alert.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are one thing that was constant, everything from screaming from terror to the enviromental sounds realy helped create tension and atmosphere. My favorite was in episode 5... you\\'ll know what im talking about when you hear it. Things like that get stuck in you memory banks. All thought the music is always the same as in every anime, meaning they use the same chase music and the same action music in every episode. But the music doesnt intrude to the show, its hardly annoying and it defintitely keeps your atten to whats going on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show wasnt half bad, given the train wreck sadness theme of the story and a very small dose of lolicon, i would say this show isnt half bad. But it isnt half good either with the overuse of catch lines and and animations. It also kept me at the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and it was good enough to garner a new season (Futakomori). So the goods outwigh the bads in my opinion.\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "If you have not tried Jigoku Shoujo or as it is known in America, UK and Australia \"Hell Girl\", then all I can say is that you're missing out. Hell Girl is a very unique anime , each episode of the series focuses on another character going through a tough time before they turn to the legendary girl everyone is whispering about. Of course there's a price and even that doesn't stop the protagonist. The story's weakness is that it's very repetitve which doesn't rock everyone's boat as most of the time the protagonist will pull the string off the doll. However, the story getsmore intense when a detective and his daughter is involved to try to stop people contacting Hell Girl. There are surprises in this series, times when the audience is fooled that the ending might be a happy one. The art is brilliant. The character designs are amazing, especially of Ai and her assistants. The scenes of the Eternal Twilight world are beautiful. The sound is addictive, it's very hard not to resist the soundtrack after hearing some of the music from this series especially Snow's Opening Theme \"Sakasama No Chou\".The characters were very well thought out, even though the main character send people to Hell you can't help loving them. Most of the time you enjoy it unless again it's not your thing. Hell Girl is also a good series for discussing and bringing up the issues of bullying, stalking, murder, blackmail, slander, adultery, lying etc... The ending of the series was brilliant and I really can't say anything as to why because you have to watch it. Overall, an unmissable series.",

            "content": "Title: Jigoku Shoujo\r\nManga, Live-Action Drama, Anime: Jigoku Shoujo was adapted into a manga after it finished its original TV run, with art and story done by Miyuki Eto.  It began running in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine in the October 2005 issue, is still running, and has, for the most part, had an original story line and plot changes, though some episodes from the anime do get their own manga chapters.  Del Rey has licensed it Stateside, and the third volume is due on August 5th, while it stand at six collected volumes in Japan currently.\r\nA live-action spinoff consisting of twelve half-hour episodes began runningon TV on November 4th, 2006, and finished its run on January 27th, 2007.  There's not a lot about it, so I don't know how similar or dissimilar it is to the original anime.  It will also not be covered in this review.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Jigoku Shoujo was originally a twenty-six episode anime, and ran on Japanese TV from October 4th, 2005 to April 4th, 2006.  It was produced by Studio Deen (famous for their work on Fruits Basket and Fate/Stay Night) and directed by Takahiro Omori (famous for his work on Baccano! and Gakuen Alice).  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, and the sixth and final volume was released on May 20th.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There is a rumor that if there's someone giving you absolute hell and you want to get revenge on them, there's a website that you can access only at midnight, known as Hell Correspondence.  Once the name is submitted, Ai Enma (aka Jigoku Shoujo/Hell Girl) will appear to the client and give them a straw doll with a red string wrapped around its neck.  If the client wishes to take revenge, then all they have to do is pull the string and Ai and her helpers will ferry the person to hell.  However, there is a small catch to all this: Once the compact is made with Ai, the person who took revenge will go to hell once they've died as well.\\n\\n\r\nJigoku Shoujo is, at it's heart, a Revenge of the Week episode.  Once you've seen two or three episodes, you have the basic outline of every episode: Introduction to person being tormented and torment, tormented accesses Hell Correspondence, Ai and tormented meet up and she tells them the conditions and such, tormented ends up debating/angsting over whether or not the deal is worth it, things are escalated in some way, and the tormented pulls the string, sending the tormentor to hell.  Rinse and repeat for twenty-three or so episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm really kind of disappointed, because there's almost no background about Ai until the last three or so episodes of the show, and even that is minimal, not to mention that the background of her helpers doesn't even get mentioned.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the set up doesn't change one bit throughout the entire show, even when the show introduces two people who try and thwart Ai (the reporter Hajime and his daughter, Tsugumi, who has a psychic connection to Ai) does not help the show at all.  Hajime and Tsugumi were only really vital to the plot of five episodes total; with the others, they could've not been around, and the same thing still would have happened, which makes their existence kind of useless.  Also, the fact that Hajime has a tendency to come off as an incredible bastard at times, not to mention a bit of a hypocrite, doesn't help things. I understand what the creators might've been trying to do, here, but they missed the mark with these two.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality for the Revenge of the Week stories average out to about half and half; half are excellent and have incredible writing and twists, and the other half are kind of... eh.  The characters are always memorable, though.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is a second season, Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori, that can hopefully rectify these mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art that has to do with the world that Ai occupies when she's not working, the revenges that they take on the tormentors, and to do with her helpers' and her own character design are absolutely stunning.  The colors for these are incredibly rich, and the designs in general are beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the part that has to do with our world... eh.  The backgrounds are done well, and the character designs for the people of the week start to blur together after a certain point and become incredibly generic, but they manage to remain slightly distinct.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some stock footage, but it isn't all that bad.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music for this is absolutely amazing, in my opinion, and one of the first things I really noticed about the series.  There are several recurring themes throughout the show, and they are extremely memorable.  The music is a mix of Western orchestration, rock numbers, and traditional Japanese instruments that always seems to catch my ear.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's a pretty standard J-Pop female upbeat number, but is still pretty catchy, all things considered.  The ED is absolutely amazing, though; a typical J-Pop female ballad that uses cello and traditional Japanese instruments for instrumentation, and has lyrics that very directly relate to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: The seiyuu for this show did a good job, as always; no voices that seemed out of place or painful.  Though I do kind of pity the seiyuu who had to play Ai, as her lines were mostly the same throughout all twenty-six episodes; hopefully, they'll vary up the dialogue for her next season.\\n\\n\r\nLength: If they cut out the crappy half of the show, we have a show that could easily have fit within thirteen-ish episodes, and still been a pretty good show.  That cut probably should have been made, as most of the good part of the show doesn't really start to happen until the halfway or so mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A really good concept that ended up lacking a bit in its execution, and in the long run, would've benefited from cutting the actual amount of episodes in half, so that the best parts of the show stayed intact, with beautiful art and music, and seiyuu that could have used more varied lines, really.  But maybe its issues can be rectified in the second season, Futakomori.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8\\n\r\nLength: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 40/50; 80% (B )",

            "content": "Prior to buying the box set, I had watched the first ten episodes; I got the first two R2 volumes for a few quid. I found the series to be very watchable simply because revenge stories are always involving and each episode provided a new story, but there wasn't enough connecting the dots for me to love it - there hadn't been any character development whatsoever for Hell Girl and her crew. The quality also went up and down a lot; as expected of an episodic title. \r\nThe first half of Hell Girl focused on black and white revenge. What made the victims vengeful wasshown, the victims then went on the net and entered the name of the person they wanted to die, Hell Girl then appeared and gave the victims the tool required to cast the curse, the victims then received one last push from the person they hate required to make them want to give up their own soul for revenge and, finally, Hell Girl and her servants ended the episodes by first punishing (often unintentionally comically) and then ferrying the cursed, evil people to hell on a small boat. Very repetitive; even the same dialogue was repeated by Hell Girl when giving instructions and the like. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half mixed things up slightly by introducing a private detective (of sorts) called Hajime and his daughter; a daughter that shares a connection to Hell Girl that lets her see through Hell Girl's eyes from time to time - allowing her father to track down Hell Girl's 'clients' in each episode. Her father, as luck would have it, sees revenge as wrong and, at first, felt the need to try to stop Hell Girl. The new investigation angle did freshen up the stories, with them told from the viewpoint of Hajime rather than the victims - adding mystery. There were other changes, too, such as the revenge stories no longer being black and white; sometimes 'good' people got sent to hell in order to justify Hajime's anti-revenge/Hell Girl ramblings, these 'good' people not getting the cosplay punishment sequences. But the best thing about the introduction of Hajime and his daughter was the inclusion of recurring characters with actual development; not just faces with nothing below the surface. Hajime even got an episode to himself that explained his back-story and why he was so against revenge - it made me feel sorry for him. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the reappearances of Hell Girl, her three servants and the father and daughter duo, there weren't any connected episodes in terms of story until the last three, which were all about Hell Girl's past, finally revealing a little about her to the viewers. Until that point, she'd been no more than a doll; there to punish upon request and repeat the same lines without any emotions. Seeing her tragic background and seeing her show an emotion - anger - transformed her from a blank slate and into an actual person. And, as an added bonus, her story connected Hajime and his daughter to her, making their inclusion not as random as it appeared - I thought they were no more than characters threw in to extend the story. \\n\\n\r\nIf not for some very poor episodes which departed from the usual formula, mixing in unnecessary extra supernatural elements - like a talking doll with control of plant monsters and Hell Boy (don't ask) - I'd have rated it higher. Those few episodes added nothing, only lowering the overall quality. There were also some standard revenge stories that weren't very good, but most of the 'normal' episodes were at least watchable, and even if they were poor there was always another, totally different story right around the corner. \\n\\n\r\nOne non-plot/character point that deserves to be mentioned is the music. It's unique to my ears; some kind of eerie techno/rock stuff. Whatever it's classed as, it's very good, and it made the talking sections of the episodes even more watchable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, providing you don't mind episodic series that aren't comedies and are forgiving enough to excuse a few drops in quality and silly punishment sequences, it's a must watch. It gets better the further you progress. It did bug me that little was revealed about Hell Girl until the end and how school girls always seemed to be playing the roles of victims (school girls sell DVDs), but I came out of the series thinking highly of it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7.5/10",

            "content": "Bring out your inner sadist with the new and improved, Hell Girl!  Available in three designer colors: red, blood-of-your-enemies red, and YOUR-blood red!\r\n...\r\nAnyways, I was serious:  This series will probably bring out your inner sadist.  Read below and find out.\r\nStory: 8.  The premise is quite interesting and different.  However, I don't appreciate the episodic nature used for 90% of the episodes.  The only REAL story occurs in the last 3, where you actually learn about Ai herself.  Until then, the episodes are predictable and formulaic:  Person gets wronged, person goes to Internet to contact the Hell Correspondence,person receives doll, person angsts over whether or not to pull the thread, eventually does, then the evildoer is sent to hell.  They switch it up a bit in between, but for the most part, this is pretty much what you can expect.  (Until Hajime, the reporter, starts trying to meddle; not like he can stop the inevitable.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.  Very hit-and-miss.  The animation in the \"real world\" (where most events take place) is mediocre; it's quite disappointing when you compare it to other anime of the time.  A lot of it is sheer laziness, specifically in the areas of generic, bland, repetitive character design, poor facial expressions, and inconsistent proportions.  However, the visuals when we get to visit Ai's \"world\" (or whatever you want to call it), or see someone on their trip to hell, or just anytime Ai is present on the screen at all, you can expect to be dazzled.  Also part of said formulaic-ness of the series is the overuse of stock footage--specifically in the sequence where the thread has been pulled and Ai is on her way to \"fetch them.\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.  The music as a whole is pretty good.  The OP is a generic J-pop piece that doesn't really fit the series at all; the ED, on the other hand, is a great, solemn piece called \"Basting\" with lyrics and tone that perfectly match the mood.  Even its NAME is suiting.  The soundtrack has some memorable gems, too.  The sound effect synchronization with actions occuring on screen is kind of off at times, though, and they could be better.  The voice actors (English) are pretty decent, but Brina Palencia as Ai DEFINITELY steals the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.  Like I mentioned, most of the character designs are pretty bland.  By FAR the most attention was obviously given to Ai (which I'm totally fine with, but it DOES make looking at the supporting cast pretty boring).  Some characters are easier to sympathize with than others.  They do a pretty good job painting the picture so you end up wanting them to pull the string too.  The characters generally can provoke a decent emotional reaction from you and, in spite of generic character design, are somehow able to remain memorable in their own ways--in spite of said generic-ness.  (Not like I really care to remember most of them.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.  Like I said at the beginning, this show may bring out the inner sadist you never knew you were.  It's very easy to hate the evildoer, and when the time finally comes, you *may* find yourself yelling, \"YOU DESERVE IT, MO' F**KA!\"  I always looked forward to the bastards that abused/wronged the character in focus to get what they deserved and couldn't wait for that string to be pulled.  By far the most enjoyable part for me was the torment/torture sequence the offender was usually subjected to before actually being ferried to hell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.  Hell Girl was on the fast track to being a 7, but saved itself at the end with the 3 episodes at the end about Ai's back story.  It does some things really well (premise, enjoyment, and Ai herself), but severely lacks in others (animation, a lot of the characters).  I wouldn't have minded the episodic nature if it had only taken up ~6 of the episodes and the rest was focused on Ai, Hajime, and Tsugumi.  It would also have been nice to actually get more in-depth back stories on Ai's helpers (all we get to hear is \"she saved us from eternal damnation\" or whatever, and is never mentioned again).  Maybe this will be fixed in season two.  We'll see though.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, they seemed to have tried to cram some aesop about vengeance not being worth it in at the end, but honestly, the majority of the series was indicative of the exact opposite (bar a couple cases).\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all:  Definitely watch this if you like seeing justice being served--evil people getting what they deserve.  Just don't expect an amazing overarching plot.",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW : Not really scary but nice\r\nI was expecting something more dark and creepy, sort of like xxxHOLiC or maybe even Death Note, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case. I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s better than I expected, but it was enough to entertain me.\r\nFor the first episodes, I thought it was too formulaic. The episode would start presenting the background of that episode&rsquo;s petitioner (the one who seeks revenge), who are usually teenage girls, by the way. We see what&rsquo;s making that person ask for revenge from the Hell Girl, or Enma Ai. Finally, that person finally asks for help from EnmaAi through the Jigoku Tsushin (Hell Correspondence) site, and shortly after, Enma Ai appears, hands the straw doll over to the petitioner and explains her deal. At first the petitioner hesitates, but he or she pulls it anyway at a moment of desperation. Enma Ai and her posse &ldquo;delivers vengeance&rdquo; and everyone&rsquo;s happy at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat was the standard formula throughout the whole series, but when Hajime Shibata and his daughter, Tsugumi Shibata came into the picure, things became more interesting. These two try to stop Enma Ai and her killing spree, and in the process, we find more about them. They&rsquo;re a good pair to add to the mix of already fascinating characters. Enma Ai, of course, is very mysterious and captivating. You can&rsquo;t help but observe her every move to find more about her.  Her three companions are just as intriguing. My favorite is Ren, but I also like Hone Onna and Wanyuudo. I just wish that more background on them was given throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe &ldquo;antagonists&rdquo; were great as villains too. They really were evil, that you would think that they deserved to be punished and sent to hell. It makes you want to become a better person and hope that no one thinks of cursing you.\\n\\n\r\nA fine cast of voice actors for this one. Mamiko Noto isn&rsquo;t really one of my favorite VAs, mostly because most of the characters she plays are kind of boring or dull (at least for me &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t like Yakumo from School Rumble and Hecate from Shakugan no Shana). I did like her work as Shimako in Marimite, because her soft voice fit that role perfectly. I guess that soft voice worked for Enma Ai as well, because when Enma Ai&rsquo;s not sending anyone to hell, she does seem like a delicate and soft spoken girl. I also liked Masaya Matsukaze&rsquo;s work. Ren Ichimoku has to be my second favorite character that he played, next to Kyouya Ootori of Ouran High School Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was a bit inconsistent. Enma Ai&rsquo;s face would change at least three times each episode, and towards the end, the same thing happened to Tsugumi. Although I have to say, I love the character design. No weird hairdos or hair colors for this one. The character design is also current and fresh. As for the colors, mostly dark colors, as well as colors that would go well with black (such as red and purple) were used a lot. It really fits the feel and mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I like the opening song a lot. It&rsquo;s also very current and trendy, but I can&rsquo;t say the same for the ending song. Truth be told, whenever I get to the ending sequence, I take a little nap and wake up just in time for the preview. I just don&rsquo;t like sad and mellow songs. The BGM was good, and it does intensify the scenes (specially the one that&rsquo;s played whenever they get on when the vengeance) but sometimes the BGM is too much, as if it&rsquo;s over the top. Good job with the SFX too &ndash; the bells and the chimes coupled with creepy humming is very eerie.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I would say I liked it, but I would&rsquo;ve liked it more if it didn&rsquo;t stick so closely to the formula I was talking about in the beginning of my review. I plan to watch the second season soon, and I hope it&rsquo;s better than the first season.",

            "content": "Fleeting thrills, occasional chills, definite cringes. That's what I would succinctly wrap up Hell Girl as. The main crux of the issue is this; Hell Girl is a morally and intellectually lazy at best, disingenuous at worst, show, that manages to stay partially afloat with a couple good lead characters and some occasionally deviously twisted stories. \r\nLet me get out of the way that the art, voice acting, and sounds are all wonderful. Distinct and atmospheric, they often times accentuate the best parts of the show.\r\nHowever, Hell Girl suffers perhaps most greatly from being very formulaic and repetitive. Most episodes boil down thusly: we have,\"Persona A\" and \"Person B.\" \\n\\n\r\nPerson A is wronged by person B.\\n\\n\r\nPerson A gets Hell Girl and her cronies to kill and send Person B to hell immediately.\\n\\n\r\nPerson A, as a result of this, goes to hell when he/she dies.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of this show is setup just like that; episodic in nature, new stories each time. At first, this manages to be a fairly convincing and exciting setup, because the stories seem fresh and relatable. After a while though, the show wears out its welcome. The structure gets too repetitive, the people, too unsympathetic, the stories, too hard to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I am not entirely sure what this show is trying to say, if anything. For Hell Girl to take on such a serious and close topic to many people (afterlife), it damn well better to a good job of broaching the subject. I don't think it really does. Most characters in the show are comfortable with the idea of not only sending another person to hell for eternity, but going themselves. This is tough to swallow, especially when, as is the case in Episode 10, there isn't much wrongdoing between the two people involved! \\n\\n\r\nIs this a show a twisted look at karma? Do wrong, and you'll have wrong done to you? If so, it's over the top. Sure, some of these characters are cruel, but an eternity in hell? That's harsh! And what does it say about the character who sends them to hell? They're being even more cruel if you ask me!\\n\\n\r\nSo, maybe the whole show is about trying to get us viewers to think on the old Gandhi quote \"an eye for the eye makes the whole world blind.\" Well, that doesn't work either, because just about every character is perfectly willing to not only trade an eye for an eye, but enjoy it too. Not only that, they usually get a huge short term benefit! Blind my ass!\\n\\n\r\nAnd what about Ai (Hell Girl) and her gang? They swoop along to enact revenge by torturing their victim in their final moments, before killing them and sending them to hell. We never really learn anything about them until the very end of the show. It's too bad, because it makes them out to be much worse villains than I think the show creators intend.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the conflicts in each episode could also be healed with some communication and time. Physical abuse is one thing, and certainly bad, but a lot of the conflicts in the shows are monetary in nature, which, while potentially crippling, is not permanent for a lot of these people considering how young they are. If Person A thought about their predicament for a few days, they probably wouldn't be so quick to pull the proverbial trigger. Unless the show is trying to completely slam immediate emotions for being irrational or some such, in which case, whoopdee do. Not particularly riveting nor well displayed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the problem with this show. I don't know what it's trying to do. Maybe it's not trying to say anything, which seems really bad, especially considering the nature of what the show deals with; revenge, death, afterlife. Not stuff to be scoffed at, in this case. If you're going to present a show with people lining up left and right to send a rival to hell forever and themselves too, you better have a pretty good thematic core. There isn't any here. It feels almost like some dude just wants to piss all over people and take revenge on people through an anime he is creating. Haha, enjoy hell, characters!\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I am reading too much into this. Maybe I need to look at this simply and try to enjoy it. In that case, it fares a little better. When the show finally gets some continuity going, we are introduced to Hajime, a disheveled, freelance journalist who learns of Hell Girl and seeks to stop her. He is a wonderful character; flawed but likeable, morally strong but conflicted. His struggle with his young daughter, who begins to feel sympathy for the people choosing to send their enemy to hell, becomes a well-done, central conflict. Their bonding and relationship is an excellent display of subtleties that the rest of the show seems to lack.\\n\\n\r\nCertain episodes are generally thrilling. Others are generally boring. It's indicative of the show as a whole having an inconsistent pace. Some episodes are allowed to naturally develop, showing a gradual buildup of a characters wrongdoings. Others take 20 minutes to set up a scenario, then instantly drop a bunch of cruelty on a character in a matter of seconds.\\n\\n\r\nStill, some of the stores are cynically enjoyable, certifiably twisted in a thrilling manner. It's just too bad that the show falls short elsewhere, and can never get a consistent level of thrills going. It's a watchable show, but also, ultimately, a forgettable one.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

            "content": "Oh Hell Girl, you have disappointed me. I somehow managed to sit through 20 episodes, which was an absolutely dreadful experience because every episode might as well have been the same thing. \r\nThe main problem with the series comes from the fact that the story uses its basic structure as a crutch for damn near every episode. Every time it gets anywhere near leaving its crutch behind, it suddenly gets scared and races back to the crutch and clings on to it with dear life. This might not be a problem if the stories themselves were well written with interesting characters, but half of thetime I was just yelling at the unbearable stupidity of the characters for maybe not trying to go to the authorities with their problems because half of the time that would have worked just fine. For the times where I could understand why the use of the Hell Girl was necessary, it was still laziness on the part of the writing because every single episode ended the same way anyway. Even after going to the authorities, one girl still pulled the string to summon Hell Girl even though by the time she did it it was too late to change anything and the person she pulled it against was already going to jail for life. Most of the villains are only moderately evil and not a single twist occurs where someone admits they were wrong. The story introduces a father and his daughter (who oddly enough refers to her father by first name) as they try to discover who Hell Girl is, but it basically amounts to them watching the episodes occur around them because nothing they seem to do prevents the Hell Girl from being summoned. After having nothing but the same thing happen for 20 episode, it's really hard to want to continue. I expected to care about the character of the episode and look forward to him or her (mostly her and they're pretty much all young adults or high schoolers) pulling the string, but I was just looking forward to the end credits because the series failed to convince me his or her reasons for pulling the string was completely necessary. As a result of not writing the characters in a way to make me care, every episode made me wish I'd gotten a nice calming tooth filling instead.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, the stories themselves as individual episodes just aren't very interesting. I'm assuming it wants to be a horror genre show, but it comes off as more cheesy than anything else and as a drama, it's just too rushed to be properly dramatic. There's really no other genre it could fall into, it's not just \"average\" in its genre, it's pretty damn bad.\\n\\n\r\nRidiculous amounts of footage are reused, and it's not particularly interesting footage, it's ritualistic footage and once you've seen it once, it's boring. Brina Palencia is a voice actress I normally like, but either she was terrible as the Hell Girl herself or Hell Girl really was written to sound as boring and wooden as humanly possible in which case Palencia nails it. Nothing else in the dub stands out, but the Japanese seemed just as uninteresting, it's not very good at engaging the audience either way.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no good reason to watch this show, it wants to be so much more than it is and it's nothing shy of painful to watch instead. Avoid this at all costs or watch a few episodes online first to see for yourself why this is a title to be avoided.",

            "content": "Just as a preliminary note, I am writing this review only having seen Jigoku Shoujo, NOT Jigoku Shoujo Futakumori. There are also minor plot spoilers ahead. With that out of the way, lets get right into it:\r\nStory: For an episodic anime, the story was fairly engaging for the first ten or so episodes. Seeing different people in difficult circumstances and how they feel they must resort to contacting Jigoku Shoujo to send their enemies to hell is fairly amusing at first, but after seeing it over and over, it is hard for it not to become repetitive. The first ten stories are executed quite wellas the viewer definitely feels sympathy for the people in such desperate situations. This pathos engages the viewer, especially if the viewer can relate to some of the different characters' stories in any way. With so many different stories, there should be at least one that the viewer can relate to. However, after episode ten, the stories become less and less convincing to the point where people are sending each other to hell for pathetic reasons that the anime tries to make seem important and reasonable. This mind-numbing repetitive quality of the anime is definitely its greatest downfall. Luckily, the story revives itself in the last four or so episodes in the series, where we finally see some the main characters' back-stories. It is also exciting to see how the two groups of main characters (Jigoku Shoujo &amp; co. and the reporter Hajime &amp; his daughter) interact with each other in the final episodes. This alone makes the series worth watching even though I felt that the series could definitely have been about ten episodes shorter to produce the same effect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I wasn't really feeling the art in Jigoku Shoujo. The way many of the characters were drawn/portrayed was fairly boring in my opinion. Virtually everyone (except Enma Ai and co.) was dressed in regular street clothes, had normal coloured hair (usually brown or black), and did not have many distinguishing features whatsoever. While this lends the series a sense of realism, as it is set in modern-day Japan, a lot of the characters' stereotypical personalities are not convincing enough to give this style of art any credibility. Backgrounds in the series are fairly bland as well; even when they were supposed to more elaborate than your average Japanese cityscape. An example is the artist's depiction of hell, which came short in my opinion due to static, boring colours and scenery that did not come across as frightening or scary in the least. Stronger, bolder colours of red, yellow, and black for negative space would have created a more memorable setting for hell. On the other hand, the artwork used in the character designs for the main characters (Enma Ai and co.) was great. The main characters really stood out from everyone else because of their numerous distinguishing features, including awesome red eyes that seemed both sad and slightly moe, unique hairstyles, traditional Japanese clothes, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I believe the sound in this series was above average. There are at least a few memorable background melodies, including one that I heard in one of the final episodes that really moved me. I'm not sure what it is called, but it had a definite traditional Japanese flavour to it. Both the opening and ending are suited well to the show. They both feature cryptic lyrics relating to Enma Ai's situation and have soft, under toned melodies that charm and haunt the audience at the same time. A pleasant listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I was disappointed in the lack of character development of Enma Ai's dolls/guardians, which marginally brought my rating for character down. Luckily, a good deal of character development was given to Enma Ai herself, Hajime (the reporter) and his daughter, Tsugumi. Without giving away spoilers, I can safely say these characters receive a decent amount of emotional and psychological development despite seeming relatively two-dimensional at first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Obviously, the repetitive quality of this episodic anime brought down my enjoyment ranking. Virtually every episode follows the simplistic formula of: bad things happen to someone, someone contacts Jigoku Shoujo, someone's enemy is eventually sent to hell. Luckily, Hajime and Tsugumi show up to provide some insight into this process (Hajime believes it is wrong and unjust and Tsugumi believes it's OK for people to enact revenge on such people), which lends the anime a degree of intellectual appeal. Then, as Hajime and Tsugumi's back stories are revealed, the plot truly becomes interesting as it intertwines nicely with Enma Ai's back story, leading to a satisfying conclusion in which the main characters all are forced to interact with each other. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Despite the anime's repetitiveness, I still believe it is worth watching, if you have the patience to make it the end of the series, that is. I look forward to watching Futakumori soon!\\n",

If you want to know what's the plot, read the SUMMARY, and don't mark me down for not saying anything about the story. I tell you what elements are impacting in the story and what my opinion is. ANYWAYS...\r\nJigoku Shoujo, or Hell Girl, is an anime that gets the viewers into thinking about their morals, an idea similar to Death Note, but not like the concept of controlling fate. Rather, this anime has you searching for why one would wish ill-will against another, and whetheror not you would send somebody to hell if you were in their position. Basically this anime embellishes on it's supernatural feel and does that very well. I had chills in some scenes were glimpses of Hell were portrayed. The plot idea was fantastic and characters were very interesting. However, there was room for improvement. The beginning was somewhat slow and really didn't have anything going, until maybe the 9th or 10th episode. Plus revenge plots began to look the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10, don't get me wrong, this anime was pure gold and should be in the check-off list for all otakus!",

            "content": "Nothing was making me to expect much from Jigoku Shoujo as there is not so many good horror anime, being relatively old, like 11 years (now it is 2016)\r\nI had a thought that there is no point in reviewing this anime as all the ideas were mentioned like hundred times,\r\nbut after checking a bunch of reviews I found out the lack of some important ideas featured in this anime.\r\nIn this review I am not urging everyone to watch it saying \"it is a must watch series\", however this anime really impressed me. It is a sad story and it may remind you of the worsttime in your life, but it is teaching very important moral \"revenging you dig two graves, one for your enemy and another for yourself\"\\n\\n\r\nSo the main idea of this anime in most episodes is hate driving people mad, mad enough to agree on a contract that in their afterlife they go to hell, as a result the object of their hate is immediately send to hell. To do so just untie the red thread on this straw doll. Unfortunately being filled with hate people cannot think clearly and understand the consequences of this contract. So these people hate someone enough to kill at cost of own life. Fortunately there is Hell Correspondence at your service and you do not have to get your own hands dirty. You can get rid of a person you hate and leave a happy life (may be). On the other hand you keep that knowledge that after you die Jigoku Shoujo is going to send you to hell. In my opinion bearing this tough thoughts cannot become a happy life.\\n\\n\r\nBefore taking the decision to untie the red thread people have very perplexed thoughts for a moment understanding that being send to hell is like the worst thing happening to them. Some try to resolve the problem on their own and at some points you can see a shine of hope, faint, but visible way to salvation is just not to untie this cursed red thread...\\n\\n\r\nArt. For me in this anime art looks like one of the strongest sides of this anime. Enma Ai in here kimono is so beautiful that you do not get bored of seeing her again and again for many episodes. Keep in mind that this anime has rather dark atmosphere and a lot of dark scenes are set pretty impressive. Effects illustrating supernatural phenomena for me looked splendid despite that it is more than 10 years old anime.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I do not say much about music, music is just fine here, it creates the right atmosphere and almost perfectly fits the situations. Some people might say that it is not  so good and soundtrack variation is not rich, but I assure you while watching all the series the idea that music is bad never got to my mind. OP, ED soundtracks are superb and fitting this anime conceptions. Also various characters are voiced by famous seiyuu like Fukuyama Jun, Sawashiro Miyuki and more.",

I was looking for a horror-ish anime, and then I remembered reading a review for Jigoku Shoujo. So I figured that it couldn't hurt to check it out.\r\nI was captivated by the simple plot that grew and progressed as the story developed. But it moved to slowly sometimes and then forced a lot on you as you moved towards the end. I also though that the side characters leading the story were a little weak or sometimes down right obnoxious. \r\nThere are soundcues in it that remind you of the event or begin to symbolize events all together. \\n\\n\r\nSuprising the lead characters were well designed and had more personality then I would have expected. The dialogue was was either dark and humorless to sometimes being downright funny. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, everything was well polished and time was spent on the details of the little things. The opening was amazing, it was really beautifully done, more to captivate though then to open it. \\n\\n\r\nAltogether thought, \\n\r\nit was a really nice anime, clever for there is nothing like it.\\n\r\nI would suggest it, but get about half way though before you find out it isn't for you.

            "content": "Ok....To start of my first review, i'll be brief and frank. I expected much more from Jigoku Shoujo. Sure, the series was ok but it could have been better.\r\nLet's go into more detail...\r\nThe concept of the story was unique, i'll admit that. My only problem was HALF the series was VERY repetative. Half of the total number of episodes focused ONLY on random people asking Ai Enma for their vengance to be granted. Half the series went something like this: a.) Random person wants someone sent to hell. b.) They ask Ai Enma for help. c.) Random person gets their revenge. It wasn't until someoneactually tried to stop Ai Enma did the story get more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was also suppossed to be scary or frightening to some degree. Personally, I didn't find it to be any of these. It lacked the impact to terrify me for more than 1 milisecond. Although, I found Ai Enma's way of sending people to hell very amusing.....not scary......amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was ok. It wasn't eye candy like Kanon or Clannad. It was just average.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs were well done and deserve praise. I loved the opening and the ending song. The bgms of the series also go well with the situations they're played at.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development could have been improved. While Ai Enma and the recurring characters in the story were presented very well, the series failed to focus on the three dolls/spirits who assist Ai. I expected to know exactly who they were and exactly what kind of spirits they were by the end of the series but I ended up consulting wikipedia in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Jigoku Shoujo is average. It's postive points equal its negative points. It is enjoyable but there is room for impovement. The second season is a lot better.",

I wont tell u more, i u want to know then watch it ;).\\n\r\nBut if we take off the first episodes, i can say the story is great..so dont think this 7 means its bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8.2): Very good, the design is good, the characters are fine..in overall i think this aspect is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7.8): Sound is neither great or bad..if fits well with this style of anime, so i give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7.3): Characters are not well develloped as they should. At the end of 15 episodes i knew almost nothing about the main characters, and thats bad. Thankfully, things chage with the introduction of 2 new characters, Hajime and Tsugumi, who makes the anime much more interesting than it was before. So in the final 11-10 episodes we get to know something about the characters, and that makes me give a 7 and not wors than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.4): The best aspect in my opinion. It has a lot of suspense, is a lot psychological and some action. I didn&acute;t really got bored while watching, with the exception of the first one that were a little repetitive. So its a very high 8 for this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.0): A fine anime to watch, could be better its true, but still i can recommend this one for someone who likes this kind of misterious and psychological anime. I am now curious and i will start soon with the sequel, wich i hope to be just a little better than this one :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "--This is a review of the ENTIRE THREE SEASONS of Jigoku Shoujo--\r\nAfter discussing the apparent absence of \u201ereal\u201c horror in anime in general in one of my clubs, I decided to look up a few so called horror series  and finally stumbled across Jigoku Shoujo. This series definitely has a lot to offer on the supernatural/mystery sector with its 72 episodes distributed over three seasons airing between 2005 and 2009, but would it also offer the horror I was searching for?\r\nIn a nutshell, this series is about a mysterious girl named Ai Enma who, over the course of the whole series, fulfills people\u00b4s wishesto send another person they have a grudge against to hell with the help of her three henchmen. It is a very episodic show where every episode follows the same routines and patterns. We learn about a person suffering from torture, see how they log on to the internet to access the \u201cHell Correspondence\u201d and then get to witness all the events leading up to the victim to finally decide to send his tormentor to hell for a costly price. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, the above described scenario repeats itself for the first eight episodes to introduce the viewer to all the characters. By episode 8, an overarching plot featuring a reporter and his daughter who get increasingly involved with Hell Girl as they try to stop her gets established, and this is exactly the point in the show where it gets extremely good. The way the story then builds up from there and increases tension until the epic climax in the last three episodes is just very well done and kept me on the edge of my seat. I marathoned the first season within two days and couldn\u00b4t wait to continue the rollercoaster ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season, Futakomori, manages to keep up the high level of entertainment without blending in an overarching storyline as it offers hands down the best and most cruel hell-sending cases of all three seasons. Futakomori  also blesses us with episodes telling the story of Ai\u00b4s mysterious helpers, who by the way are all valuable assets to the show, and how they became her companions one by one until finally in the end, her own moving and tragic past is revealed to the viewer. \u201cHajime-chan\u201d, the reporter from season 1 as well as his daughter are definitely missed on the other hand as their replacement Kikuri, a strange little girl, is no way near as interesting as the pair from the first season. Anyway, like in season  1, the build-up to the ending is simply amazing and in my opinion remains the biggest strength of this generally great series.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3, Mitsuganae, unfortunately cannot keep up with the high quality of its predecessors. While I will not call it an atrocious show, it still is more than a little disappointing after watching all the amazingness that happened before over the course of 48 episodes. The main focus in this season is on a high school girl named Yuzuki who gets possessed by Ai.  While this is not necessarily a bad idea, Yuzuki\u00b4s personality is as uninteresting as it gets and the same goes for Hell Girl\u00b4s new helper Yanawaro, who for some reason is introduced out of nowhere and is totally unimportant to the season. Not only is Mitsuganae a step backwards in the character department but the hell-sending cases within the high school are just completely ridiculous. While the writers were able to really tell superb stories that made the audience lose their sense for what\u00b4s wrong and what\u00b4s right for two seasons, it seems like they lost inspiration here as people are just going to hell for basically nothing all of a sudden. The only thing coming remotely close to the quality of the first seasons is the ending once again. Thank god they were able to remain the drama and close out Jigoku Shoujo well as this saves the third season to some extent along with the improved quality of animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was once again not able to find the horror elements I was looking for and it seems like the ability to scare me to death will forever be an absolute monopoly to live-action movies. However, as a mystery/supernatural show Jigoku Shoujo does very, very well indeed and I totally recommend you watch this if you like mystery. The best thing about it is that the show does not require you to watch all three seasons. Each season has a satisfying ending to it that concludes the anime and the ending of season three is not more or less \u201copen\u201d then the other 2, so feel free to skip Mitsuganae. The first two seasons are definitely a must watch!\\n\\n\r\nTo close things out I also recommend you watch this series subbed unless you don\u00b4t mind getting used to new voices from Futakomori onwards as only the first season has been  dubbed unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI give Jigoku Shoujo an overall score of 7.5 points, but it would be a 9 for the first two seasons! \\n",

As many people have stated and I'm sure any viewer will notice after a few episodes is that this series is VERY repetitive.  I would say that there is a reason for it in giving viewers a small taste of the hell Ai has endured for many years.\r\nThe music is wonderful, animation is stunning, and the characters are a real treat.  Some of Ai's team it was easy to guess where in Japanese mythology they came from and one of them was areally tough one.  Don't worry you'll get your answers... by watching ^_^\\n\\n\r\nSo if you have the patience this is a very good anime.",

            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo takes place in modern Japan where the internet has filled the lives of many people in this bustling world of technology and sins. This anime portrays the cruelty of the human race, and shows that there are many people in this world that suffer terribly and that, indefinitely, most people wish those that are making their lives miserable would just die and go to hell. And, of course, Jigoku Shoujo, or Hell Girl, is there to exact their revenge.\rThe storyline is wonderful. The anime itself is mainly episodic, and each episode focuses mainly on one person, and the suffering they're experiencing due toone person. As you read more into the character's lives, and just how badly they're treated, you, yourself, will want to see that red string pulled, just so that person can suffer what he/she's had coming to them, and you'll be anxious to see their horrifying experience before they're ferried off to Hell by Enma Ai, the Jigoku Shoujo.\\n\\n\rYou won't always see the the person's experience in hell, nor will you always see the person being carried off by the Jigoku Shoujo. The main experience of this anime is coming to know and feel sorry for the characters that are desperate enough to call forth the Jigoku Shoujo to end their suffering. If you're looking for humor, this isn't a series to watch. Though it does have it's moments, it's more for the people that enjoy supernatural and paranormal related anime, such as Ghost Hunt and XXXHolic. In fact, if you enjoyed either of these, though the two of them are more humorous than anything else, I recommend putting Jigoku Shoujo, and Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori on your plan-to-watch list.\\n\\n\rAnyway, this anime is one of those where you'll either love it or hate it. This is a series that got me hooked on the first episode, but if you aren't enjoying it by the third or fourth, then you most likely won't get into it. I hope this review has helped you and convinced you to look into this wonderful anime. Have fun and enjoy.",

(MAL doesn't allow retroactive changes to episode count)]\r\nIt's like a badly chosen present. The outside wrapping is perfect, with a pretty ribbon to top it off. When you look inside though, the contents of the box aren't very impressive. You'll probably never use it or end up giving it to someone else.\r\nThese are the words I'd use to describe Jigoku Shoujo, a series strongly recommended to me by a friend. I was told the artwas amazing, and it was. The story, however, is far from it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are what constitute as the wrapping paper. Every detail is immaculate, the character designs are vibrant, and every time Ai says \"Want to try dying once?\" it sends shivers down my spine. It deserves a warm hand of applause in that department.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, where the animators succeeded, the writers failed spectacularly. It's not that the story is unappealing or lacks interest. There's plenty of that. Who wouldn't be intrigued about a girl sending evil wrong-doers to hell? The problem arises when each episode's format becomes obviously and unbearably identical. Upon watching the second episode, warning bells were sent ringing through my head when I realized that the mechanics were the same each time.\\n\\n\r\nBasically: A person is abused or wronged by someone else who is unapologetic and is unable to see their own acts as unjustified. The victim seeks a solution and calls upon Ai for help. However, they hesitate when she reveals that they too would be dragged down into hell when they died. In the end though, the victims are driven to the point of desperation by their tormentors and give in. Jigoku shoujo then proceeds to carry out the revenge. Evil person is sent to hell. Former victim is emancipated, but each look at the scar that appears on their chest as a reminder of what will happen to them when they die.\\n\\n\r\nThere. Shoot me. I just spoiled at least 20 episodes for you.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is episodic, but it's episodic to the extreme. Each episode presents a different set of characters and circumstances, but will almost always follow the storyline I presented above. So it wasn't until episode 22 that I saw a new type of plot as the season started to wind down to a close.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, this sort of plot greatly disappointed me. I basically fell asleep on episode 4 and simply skipped 15 episodes. Now this is where I shoot myself in the foot. So, if I haven't watched the majority of the show, how can I really rate this as mediocre? ... True. I don't have complete authority on this matter, but it simply represents my opinion. I did end up taking the time to read the individual episode synopses on wikipedia, and it indicated that I didn't really miss much.\\n\\n\r\nI realize there are those who will be completely enraptured by Jigoku Shoujo's plot. It's simply a matter of taste. I prefer a plot that progresses in great strides, while some love to watch a well formed plot system that simply changes its details while laughing sadistically at the misfortunes that befall the characters. But as always, it's up to you, the viewer, to choose.\\n\\n\r\nI just hope I wasn't too forceful with my bitter commentary. o_o.",

            "content": "Its obviously a very sensitive subject. Personally i think nothing in RL could be any worse than hell, but that doesnt seem to be the case in this show. Considering how many users complete the contract, it almost gets out of hand . Getting cursed to hell because some lady kills your puppies? Thats a little extreme. But for the most part, most of the stories are pretty cruel and unusal \"train wreck\" stories that range anything from grade school bullies to betrayal to medical malpractice. Considering the main theme of the story being revenge, they could easily make 100 episodes out of thin air.That is also the problem of this show, the theme starts to get repetitive after about the 7th show. Its the same formula again and again: Tragic story --&gt; Hell request --&gt; Retribution. But just when you think its going to be the same formula over and over again, they throw in a curve ball of a plot twist and introduce 2 new main characters: Hajime and Tsugumi Shibata.\\n\\n\r\nThats when the show really starts to pick up, sortof. The story finally starts to pickup. No more spoilers here but if you lasted this long to reach this point in the series, then you shouldnt have any problem. The artwork is also a little mixed as well. At times its very artistic and beautiful and others it looks like your standard anime artwork. Even the art gets bitten by the repetative bug just like the story. Granted watching Enma Ai get out of the pool dripping wet in her white robe never gets old, but it hardly changes every episode. She even says the same lines over and over again every time as well, it wouldnt be a problem to me except hearing the same 20 sentences over and over and over again almost makes you think youre really in hell. There are plenty of characters drawn up for this show and they all look fine except for one trait... THE EYES. It takes a while to get used to the eyes...those damn eyes...\\n\\n\r\nI managed to keep my self awake for every episode and not even once fell asleep from the boredom (only once out of necessity). I think its because i always thought because the eyes were watching me. But I think it really means they at least did a good job feeling something for the characters in each story. On one side, you want to know if they\\'re going to get what they wished for, or you want to know why somone (i.e. tweenie) would want to pour so much hate agaisnt someone. And on the other side you want to know how the person whos being targeted is going to die. Kind of like the train wreck theory (ppl slowing down on the highway just to look at accidents). Aside from the ending, the episodes that interested me the most was EP6, 13, 15, 21, and 23&lt;--very sad alert.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects are one thing that was constant, everything from screaming from terror to the enviromental sounds realy helped create tension and atmosphere. My favorite was in episode 5... you\\'ll know what im talking about when you hear it. Things like that get stuck in you memory banks. All thought the music is always the same as in every anime, meaning they use the same chase music and the same action music in every episode. But the music doesnt intrude to the show, its hardly annoying and it defintitely keeps your atten to whats going on.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this show wasnt half bad, given the train wreck sadness theme of the story and a very small dose of lolicon, i would say this show isnt half bad. But it isnt half good either with the overuse of catch lines and and animations. It also kept me at the edge of my seat 80% of the time, and it was good enough to garner a new season (Futakomori). So the goods outwigh the bads in my opinion.\\n\r\n6/10",

Hell Girl is a very unique anime , each episode of the series focuses on another character going through a tough time before they turn to the legendary girl everyone is whispering about. Of course there's a price and even that doesn't stop the protagonist. The story's weakness is that it's very repetitve which doesn't rock everyone's boat as most of the time the protagonist will pull the string off the doll. However, the story getsmore intense when a detective and his daughter is involved to try to stop people contacting Hell Girl. There are surprises in this series, times when the audience is fooled that the ending might be a happy one. The art is brilliant. The character designs are amazing, especially of Ai and her assistants. The scenes of the Eternal Twilight world are beautiful. The sound is addictive, it's very hard not to resist the soundtrack after hearing some of the music from this series especially Snow's Opening Theme \"Sakasama No Chou\".The characters were very well thought out, even though the main character send people to Hell you can't help loving them. Most of the time you enjoy it unless again it's not your thing. Hell Girl is also a good series for discussing and bringing up the issues of bullying, stalking, murder, blackmail, slander, adultery, lying etc... The ending of the series was brilliant and I really can't say anything as to why because you have to watch it. Overall, an unmissable series.",

            "content": "Title: Jigoku Shoujo\r\nManga, Live-Action Drama, Anime: Jigoku Shoujo was adapted into a manga after it finished its original TV run, with art and story done by Miyuki Eto.  It began running in Kodansha's Nakayoshi magazine in the October 2005 issue, is still running, and has, for the most part, had an original story line and plot changes, though some episodes from the anime do get their own manga chapters.  Del Rey has licensed it Stateside, and the third volume is due on August 5th, while it stand at six collected volumes in Japan currently.\r\nA live-action spinoff consisting of twelve half-hour episodes began runningon TV on November 4th, 2006, and finished its run on January 27th, 2007.  There's not a lot about it, so I don't know how similar or dissimilar it is to the original anime.  It will also not be covered in this review.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, Jigoku Shoujo was originally a twenty-six episode anime, and ran on Japanese TV from October 4th, 2005 to April 4th, 2006.  It was produced by Studio Deen (famous for their work on Fruits Basket and Fate/Stay Night) and directed by Takahiro Omori (famous for his work on Baccano! and Gakuen Alice).  It has been licensed Stateside by Funimation, and the sixth and final volume was released on May 20th.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There is a rumor that if there's someone giving you absolute hell and you want to get revenge on them, there's a website that you can access only at midnight, known as Hell Correspondence.  Once the name is submitted, Ai Enma (aka Jigoku Shoujo/Hell Girl) will appear to the client and give them a straw doll with a red string wrapped around its neck.  If the client wishes to take revenge, then all they have to do is pull the string and Ai and her helpers will ferry the person to hell.  However, there is a small catch to all this: Once the compact is made with Ai, the person who took revenge will go to hell once they've died as well.\\n\\n\r\nJigoku Shoujo is, at it's heart, a Revenge of the Week episode.  Once you've seen two or three episodes, you have the basic outline of every episode: Introduction to person being tormented and torment, tormented accesses Hell Correspondence, Ai and tormented meet up and she tells them the conditions and such, tormented ends up debating/angsting over whether or not the deal is worth it, things are escalated in some way, and the tormented pulls the string, sending the tormentor to hell.  Rinse and repeat for twenty-three or so episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nI'm really kind of disappointed, because there's almost no background about Ai until the last three or so episodes of the show, and even that is minimal, not to mention that the background of her helpers doesn't even get mentioned.  \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that the set up doesn't change one bit throughout the entire show, even when the show introduces two people who try and thwart Ai (the reporter Hajime and his daughter, Tsugumi, who has a psychic connection to Ai) does not help the show at all.  Hajime and Tsugumi were only really vital to the plot of five episodes total; with the others, they could've not been around, and the same thing still would have happened, which makes their existence kind of useless.  Also, the fact that Hajime has a tendency to come off as an incredible bastard at times, not to mention a bit of a hypocrite, doesn't help things. I understand what the creators might've been trying to do, here, but they missed the mark with these two.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality for the Revenge of the Week stories average out to about half and half; half are excellent and have incredible writing and twists, and the other half are kind of... eh.  The characters are always memorable, though.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, there is a second season, Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori, that can hopefully rectify these mistakes. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art that has to do with the world that Ai occupies when she's not working, the revenges that they take on the tormentors, and to do with her helpers' and her own character design are absolutely stunning.  The colors for these are incredibly rich, and the designs in general are beautifully done.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the part that has to do with our world... eh.  The backgrounds are done well, and the character designs for the people of the week start to blur together after a certain point and become incredibly generic, but they manage to remain slightly distinct.\\n\\n\r\nThere is some stock footage, but it isn't all that bad.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The music for this is absolutely amazing, in my opinion, and one of the first things I really noticed about the series.  There are several recurring themes throughout the show, and they are extremely memorable.  The music is a mix of Western orchestration, rock numbers, and traditional Japanese instruments that always seems to catch my ear.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's a pretty standard J-Pop female upbeat number, but is still pretty catchy, all things considered.  The ED is absolutely amazing, though; a typical J-Pop female ballad that uses cello and traditional Japanese instruments for instrumentation, and has lyrics that very directly relate to the show.\\n\\n\r\nSeiyuu: The seiyuu for this show did a good job, as always; no voices that seemed out of place or painful.  Though I do kind of pity the seiyuu who had to play Ai, as her lines were mostly the same throughout all twenty-six episodes; hopefully, they'll vary up the dialogue for her next season.\\n\\n\r\nLength: If they cut out the crappy half of the show, we have a show that could easily have fit within thirteen-ish episodes, and still been a pretty good show.  That cut probably should have been made, as most of the good part of the show doesn't really start to happen until the halfway or so mark.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A really good concept that ended up lacking a bit in its execution, and in the long run, would've benefited from cutting the actual amount of episodes in half, so that the best parts of the show stayed intact, with beautiful art and music, and seiyuu that could have used more varied lines, really.  But maybe its issues can be rectified in the second season, Futakomori.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nMusic: 9\\n\r\nSeiyuu: 8\\n\r\nLength: 7\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 40/50; 80% (B )",

            "content": "Prior to buying the box set, I had watched the first ten episodes; I got the first two R2 volumes for a few quid. I found the series to be very watchable simply because revenge stories are always involving and each episode provided a new story, but there wasn't enough connecting the dots for me to love it - there hadn't been any character development whatsoever for Hell Girl and her crew. The quality also went up and down a lot; as expected of an episodic title. \r\nThe first half of Hell Girl focused on black and white revenge. What made the victims vengeful wasshown, the victims then went on the net and entered the name of the person they wanted to die, Hell Girl then appeared and gave the victims the tool required to cast the curse, the victims then received one last push from the person they hate required to make them want to give up their own soul for revenge and, finally, Hell Girl and her servants ended the episodes by first punishing (often unintentionally comically) and then ferrying the cursed, evil people to hell on a small boat. Very repetitive; even the same dialogue was repeated by Hell Girl when giving instructions and the like. \\n\\n\r\nThe second half mixed things up slightly by introducing a private detective (of sorts) called Hajime and his daughter; a daughter that shares a connection to Hell Girl that lets her see through Hell Girl's eyes from time to time - allowing her father to track down Hell Girl's 'clients' in each episode. Her father, as luck would have it, sees revenge as wrong and, at first, felt the need to try to stop Hell Girl. The new investigation angle did freshen up the stories, with them told from the viewpoint of Hajime rather than the victims - adding mystery. There were other changes, too, such as the revenge stories no longer being black and white; sometimes 'good' people got sent to hell in order to justify Hajime's anti-revenge/Hell Girl ramblings, these 'good' people not getting the cosplay punishment sequences. But the best thing about the introduction of Hajime and his daughter was the inclusion of recurring characters with actual development; not just faces with nothing below the surface. Hajime even got an episode to himself that explained his back-story and why he was so against revenge - it made me feel sorry for him. \\n\\n\r\nIgnoring the reappearances of Hell Girl, her three servants and the father and daughter duo, there weren't any connected episodes in terms of story until the last three, which were all about Hell Girl's past, finally revealing a little about her to the viewers. Until that point, she'd been no more than a doll; there to punish upon request and repeat the same lines without any emotions. Seeing her tragic background and seeing her show an emotion - anger - transformed her from a blank slate and into an actual person. And, as an added bonus, her story connected Hajime and his daughter to her, making their inclusion not as random as it appeared - I thought they were no more than characters threw in to extend the story. \\n\\n\r\nIf not for some very poor episodes which departed from the usual formula, mixing in unnecessary extra supernatural elements - like a talking doll with control of plant monsters and Hell Boy (don't ask) - I'd have rated it higher. Those few episodes added nothing, only lowering the overall quality. There were also some standard revenge stories that weren't very good, but most of the 'normal' episodes were at least watchable, and even if they were poor there was always another, totally different story right around the corner. \\n\\n\r\nOne non-plot/character point that deserves to be mentioned is the music. It's unique to my ears; some kind of eerie techno/rock stuff. Whatever it's classed as, it's very good, and it made the talking sections of the episodes even more watchable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, providing you don't mind episodic series that aren't comedies and are forgiving enough to excuse a few drops in quality and silly punishment sequences, it's a must watch. It gets better the further you progress. It did bug me that little was revealed about Hell Girl until the end and how school girls always seemed to be playing the roles of victims (school girls sell DVDs), but I came out of the series thinking highly of it.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 7.5/10",

            "content": "Bring out your inner sadist with the new and improved, Hell Girl!  Available in three designer colors: red, blood-of-your-enemies red, and YOUR-blood red!\r\n...\r\nAnyways, I was serious:  This series will probably bring out your inner sadist.  Read below and find out.\r\nStory: 8.  The premise is quite interesting and different.  However, I don't appreciate the episodic nature used for 90% of the episodes.  The only REAL story occurs in the last 3, where you actually learn about Ai herself.  Until then, the episodes are predictable and formulaic:  Person gets wronged, person goes to Internet to contact the Hell Correspondence,person receives doll, person angsts over whether or not to pull the thread, eventually does, then the evildoer is sent to hell.  They switch it up a bit in between, but for the most part, this is pretty much what you can expect.  (Until Hajime, the reporter, starts trying to meddle; not like he can stop the inevitable.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7.  Very hit-and-miss.  The animation in the \"real world\" (where most events take place) is mediocre; it's quite disappointing when you compare it to other anime of the time.  A lot of it is sheer laziness, specifically in the areas of generic, bland, repetitive character design, poor facial expressions, and inconsistent proportions.  However, the visuals when we get to visit Ai's \"world\" (or whatever you want to call it), or see someone on their trip to hell, or just anytime Ai is present on the screen at all, you can expect to be dazzled.  Also part of said formulaic-ness of the series is the overuse of stock footage--specifically in the sequence where the thread has been pulled and Ai is on her way to \"fetch them.\"\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.  The music as a whole is pretty good.  The OP is a generic J-pop piece that doesn't really fit the series at all; the ED, on the other hand, is a great, solemn piece called \"Basting\" with lyrics and tone that perfectly match the mood.  Even its NAME is suiting.  The soundtrack has some memorable gems, too.  The sound effect synchronization with actions occuring on screen is kind of off at times, though, and they could be better.  The voice actors (English) are pretty decent, but Brina Palencia as Ai DEFINITELY steals the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7.  Like I mentioned, most of the character designs are pretty bland.  By FAR the most attention was obviously given to Ai (which I'm totally fine with, but it DOES make looking at the supporting cast pretty boring).  Some characters are easier to sympathize with than others.  They do a pretty good job painting the picture so you end up wanting them to pull the string too.  The characters generally can provoke a decent emotional reaction from you and, in spite of generic character design, are somehow able to remain memorable in their own ways--in spite of said generic-ness.  (Not like I really care to remember most of them.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.  Like I said at the beginning, this show may bring out the inner sadist you never knew you were.  It's very easy to hate the evildoer, and when the time finally comes, you *may* find yourself yelling, \"YOU DESERVE IT, MO' F**KA!\"  I always looked forward to the bastards that abused/wronged the character in focus to get what they deserved and couldn't wait for that string to be pulled.  By far the most enjoyable part for me was the torment/torture sequence the offender was usually subjected to before actually being ferried to hell.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.  Hell Girl was on the fast track to being a 7, but saved itself at the end with the 3 episodes at the end about Ai's back story.  It does some things really well (premise, enjoyment, and Ai herself), but severely lacks in others (animation, a lot of the characters).  I wouldn't have minded the episodic nature if it had only taken up ~6 of the episodes and the rest was focused on Ai, Hajime, and Tsugumi.  It would also have been nice to actually get more in-depth back stories on Ai's helpers (all we get to hear is \"she saved us from eternal damnation\" or whatever, and is never mentioned again).  Maybe this will be fixed in season two.  We'll see though.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, they seemed to have tried to cram some aesop about vengeance not being worth it in at the end, but honestly, the majority of the series was indicative of the exact opposite (bar a couple cases).\\n\\n\r\nSo all in all:  Definitely watch this if you like seeing justice being served--evil people getting what they deserve.  Just don't expect an amazing overarching plot.",

            "content": "5 WORDS OR LESS REVIEW : Not really scary but nice\r\nI was expecting something more dark and creepy, sort of like xxxHOLiC or maybe even Death Note, but that wasn&rsquo;t the case. I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s better than I expected, but it was enough to entertain me.\r\nFor the first episodes, I thought it was too formulaic. The episode would start presenting the background of that episode&rsquo;s petitioner (the one who seeks revenge), who are usually teenage girls, by the way. We see what&rsquo;s making that person ask for revenge from the Hell Girl, or Enma Ai. Finally, that person finally asks for help from EnmaAi through the Jigoku Tsushin (Hell Correspondence) site, and shortly after, Enma Ai appears, hands the straw doll over to the petitioner and explains her deal. At first the petitioner hesitates, but he or she pulls it anyway at a moment of desperation. Enma Ai and her posse &ldquo;delivers vengeance&rdquo; and everyone&rsquo;s happy at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat was the standard formula throughout the whole series, but when Hajime Shibata and his daughter, Tsugumi Shibata came into the picure, things became more interesting. These two try to stop Enma Ai and her killing spree, and in the process, we find more about them. They&rsquo;re a good pair to add to the mix of already fascinating characters. Enma Ai, of course, is very mysterious and captivating. You can&rsquo;t help but observe her every move to find more about her.  Her three companions are just as intriguing. My favorite is Ren, but I also like Hone Onna and Wanyuudo. I just wish that more background on them was given throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe &ldquo;antagonists&rdquo; were great as villains too. They really were evil, that you would think that they deserved to be punished and sent to hell. It makes you want to become a better person and hope that no one thinks of cursing you.\\n\\n\r\nA fine cast of voice actors for this one. Mamiko Noto isn&rsquo;t really one of my favorite VAs, mostly because most of the characters she plays are kind of boring or dull (at least for me &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t like Yakumo from School Rumble and Hecate from Shakugan no Shana). I did like her work as Shimako in Marimite, because her soft voice fit that role perfectly. I guess that soft voice worked for Enma Ai as well, because when Enma Ai&rsquo;s not sending anyone to hell, she does seem like a delicate and soft spoken girl. I also liked Masaya Matsukaze&rsquo;s work. Ren Ichimoku has to be my second favorite character that he played, next to Kyouya Ootori of Ouran High School Host Club.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was a bit inconsistent. Enma Ai&rsquo;s face would change at least three times each episode, and towards the end, the same thing happened to Tsugumi. Although I have to say, I love the character design. No weird hairdos or hair colors for this one. The character design is also current and fresh. As for the colors, mostly dark colors, as well as colors that would go well with black (such as red and purple) were used a lot. It really fits the feel and mood of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the music, I like the opening song a lot. It&rsquo;s also very current and trendy, but I can&rsquo;t say the same for the ending song. Truth be told, whenever I get to the ending sequence, I take a little nap and wake up just in time for the preview. I just don&rsquo;t like sad and mellow songs. The BGM was good, and it does intensify the scenes (specially the one that&rsquo;s played whenever they get on when the vengeance) but sometimes the BGM is too much, as if it&rsquo;s over the top. Good job with the SFX too &ndash; the bells and the chimes coupled with creepy humming is very eerie.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I would say I liked it, but I would&rsquo;ve liked it more if it didn&rsquo;t stick so closely to the formula I was talking about in the beginning of my review. I plan to watch the second season soon, and I hope it&rsquo;s better than the first season.",

            "content": "Fleeting thrills, occasional chills, definite cringes. That's what I would succinctly wrap up Hell Girl as. The main crux of the issue is this; Hell Girl is a morally and intellectually lazy at best, disingenuous at worst, show, that manages to stay partially afloat with a couple good lead characters and some occasionally deviously twisted stories. \r\nLet me get out of the way that the art, voice acting, and sounds are all wonderful. Distinct and atmospheric, they often times accentuate the best parts of the show.\r\nHowever, Hell Girl suffers perhaps most greatly from being very formulaic and repetitive. Most episodes boil down thusly: we have,\"Persona A\" and \"Person B.\" \\n\\n\r\nPerson A is wronged by person B.\\n\\n\r\nPerson A gets Hell Girl and her cronies to kill and send Person B to hell immediately.\\n\\n\r\nPerson A, as a result of this, goes to hell when he/she dies.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of this show is setup just like that; episodic in nature, new stories each time. At first, this manages to be a fairly convincing and exciting setup, because the stories seem fresh and relatable. After a while though, the show wears out its welcome. The structure gets too repetitive, the people, too unsympathetic, the stories, too hard to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I am not entirely sure what this show is trying to say, if anything. For Hell Girl to take on such a serious and close topic to many people (afterlife), it damn well better to a good job of broaching the subject. I don't think it really does. Most characters in the show are comfortable with the idea of not only sending another person to hell for eternity, but going themselves. This is tough to swallow, especially when, as is the case in Episode 10, there isn't much wrongdoing between the two people involved! \\n\\n\r\nIs this a show a twisted look at karma? Do wrong, and you'll have wrong done to you? If so, it's over the top. Sure, some of these characters are cruel, but an eternity in hell? That's harsh! And what does it say about the character who sends them to hell? They're being even more cruel if you ask me!\\n\\n\r\nSo, maybe the whole show is about trying to get us viewers to think on the old Gandhi quote \"an eye for the eye makes the whole world blind.\" Well, that doesn't work either, because just about every character is perfectly willing to not only trade an eye for an eye, but enjoy it too. Not only that, they usually get a huge short term benefit! Blind my ass!\\n\\n\r\nAnd what about Ai (Hell Girl) and her gang? They swoop along to enact revenge by torturing their victim in their final moments, before killing them and sending them to hell. We never really learn anything about them until the very end of the show. It's too bad, because it makes them out to be much worse villains than I think the show creators intend.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the conflicts in each episode could also be healed with some communication and time. Physical abuse is one thing, and certainly bad, but a lot of the conflicts in the shows are monetary in nature, which, while potentially crippling, is not permanent for a lot of these people considering how young they are. If Person A thought about their predicament for a few days, they probably wouldn't be so quick to pull the proverbial trigger. Unless the show is trying to completely slam immediate emotions for being irrational or some such, in which case, whoopdee do. Not particularly riveting nor well displayed.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the problem with this show. I don't know what it's trying to do. Maybe it's not trying to say anything, which seems really bad, especially considering the nature of what the show deals with; revenge, death, afterlife. Not stuff to be scoffed at, in this case. If you're going to present a show with people lining up left and right to send a rival to hell forever and themselves too, you better have a pretty good thematic core. There isn't any here. It feels almost like some dude just wants to piss all over people and take revenge on people through an anime he is creating. Haha, enjoy hell, characters!\\n\\n\r\nMaybe I am reading too much into this. Maybe I need to look at this simply and try to enjoy it. In that case, it fares a little better. When the show finally gets some continuity going, we are introduced to Hajime, a disheveled, freelance journalist who learns of Hell Girl and seeks to stop her. He is a wonderful character; flawed but likeable, morally strong but conflicted. His struggle with his young daughter, who begins to feel sympathy for the people choosing to send their enemy to hell, becomes a well-done, central conflict. Their bonding and relationship is an excellent display of subtleties that the rest of the show seems to lack.\\n\\n\r\nCertain episodes are generally thrilling. Others are generally boring. It's indicative of the show as a whole having an inconsistent pace. Some episodes are allowed to naturally develop, showing a gradual buildup of a characters wrongdoings. Others take 20 minutes to set up a scenario, then instantly drop a bunch of cruelty on a character in a matter of seconds.\\n\\n\r\nStill, some of the stores are cynically enjoyable, certifiably twisted in a thrilling manner. It's just too bad that the show falls short elsewhere, and can never get a consistent level of thrills going. It's a watchable show, but also, ultimately, a forgettable one.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n",

            "content": "Oh Hell Girl, you have disappointed me. I somehow managed to sit through 20 episodes, which was an absolutely dreadful experience because every episode might as well have been the same thing. \r\nThe main problem with the series comes from the fact that the story uses its basic structure as a crutch for damn near every episode. Every time it gets anywhere near leaving its crutch behind, it suddenly gets scared and races back to the crutch and clings on to it with dear life. This might not be a problem if the stories themselves were well written with interesting characters, but half of thetime I was just yelling at the unbearable stupidity of the characters for maybe not trying to go to the authorities with their problems because half of the time that would have worked just fine. For the times where I could understand why the use of the Hell Girl was necessary, it was still laziness on the part of the writing because every single episode ended the same way anyway. Even after going to the authorities, one girl still pulled the string to summon Hell Girl even though by the time she did it it was too late to change anything and the person she pulled it against was already going to jail for life. Most of the villains are only moderately evil and not a single twist occurs where someone admits they were wrong. The story introduces a father and his daughter (who oddly enough refers to her father by first name) as they try to discover who Hell Girl is, but it basically amounts to them watching the episodes occur around them because nothing they seem to do prevents the Hell Girl from being summoned. After having nothing but the same thing happen for 20 episode, it's really hard to want to continue. I expected to care about the character of the episode and look forward to him or her (mostly her and they're pretty much all young adults or high schoolers) pulling the string, but I was just looking forward to the end credits because the series failed to convince me his or her reasons for pulling the string was completely necessary. As a result of not writing the characters in a way to make me care, every episode made me wish I'd gotten a nice calming tooth filling instead.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, the stories themselves as individual episodes just aren't very interesting. I'm assuming it wants to be a horror genre show, but it comes off as more cheesy than anything else and as a drama, it's just too rushed to be properly dramatic. There's really no other genre it could fall into, it's not just \"average\" in its genre, it's pretty damn bad.\\n\\n\r\nRidiculous amounts of footage are reused, and it's not particularly interesting footage, it's ritualistic footage and once you've seen it once, it's boring. Brina Palencia is a voice actress I normally like, but either she was terrible as the Hell Girl herself or Hell Girl really was written to sound as boring and wooden as humanly possible in which case Palencia nails it. Nothing else in the dub stands out, but the Japanese seemed just as uninteresting, it's not very good at engaging the audience either way.\\n\\n\r\nThere is no good reason to watch this show, it wants to be so much more than it is and it's nothing shy of painful to watch instead. Avoid this at all costs or watch a few episodes online first to see for yourself why this is a title to be avoided.",

            "content": "Just as a preliminary note, I am writing this review only having seen Jigoku Shoujo, NOT Jigoku Shoujo Futakumori. There are also minor plot spoilers ahead. With that out of the way, lets get right into it:\r\nStory: For an episodic anime, the story was fairly engaging for the first ten or so episodes. Seeing different people in difficult circumstances and how they feel they must resort to contacting Jigoku Shoujo to send their enemies to hell is fairly amusing at first, but after seeing it over and over, it is hard for it not to become repetitive. The first ten stories are executed quite wellas the viewer definitely feels sympathy for the people in such desperate situations. This pathos engages the viewer, especially if the viewer can relate to some of the different characters' stories in any way. With so many different stories, there should be at least one that the viewer can relate to. However, after episode ten, the stories become less and less convincing to the point where people are sending each other to hell for pathetic reasons that the anime tries to make seem important and reasonable. This mind-numbing repetitive quality of the anime is definitely its greatest downfall. Luckily, the story revives itself in the last four or so episodes in the series, where we finally see some the main characters' back-stories. It is also exciting to see how the two groups of main characters (Jigoku Shoujo &amp; co. and the reporter Hajime &amp; his daughter) interact with each other in the final episodes. This alone makes the series worth watching even though I felt that the series could definitely have been about ten episodes shorter to produce the same effect.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I wasn't really feeling the art in Jigoku Shoujo. The way many of the characters were drawn/portrayed was fairly boring in my opinion. Virtually everyone (except Enma Ai and co.) was dressed in regular street clothes, had normal coloured hair (usually brown or black), and did not have many distinguishing features whatsoever. While this lends the series a sense of realism, as it is set in modern-day Japan, a lot of the characters' stereotypical personalities are not convincing enough to give this style of art any credibility. Backgrounds in the series are fairly bland as well; even when they were supposed to more elaborate than your average Japanese cityscape. An example is the artist's depiction of hell, which came short in my opinion due to static, boring colours and scenery that did not come across as frightening or scary in the least. Stronger, bolder colours of red, yellow, and black for negative space would have created a more memorable setting for hell. On the other hand, the artwork used in the character designs for the main characters (Enma Ai and co.) was great. The main characters really stood out from everyone else because of their numerous distinguishing features, including awesome red eyes that seemed both sad and slightly moe, unique hairstyles, traditional Japanese clothes, etc.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I believe the sound in this series was above average. There are at least a few memorable background melodies, including one that I heard in one of the final episodes that really moved me. I'm not sure what it is called, but it had a definite traditional Japanese flavour to it. Both the opening and ending are suited well to the show. They both feature cryptic lyrics relating to Enma Ai's situation and have soft, under toned melodies that charm and haunt the audience at the same time. A pleasant listen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I was disappointed in the lack of character development of Enma Ai's dolls/guardians, which marginally brought my rating for character down. Luckily, a good deal of character development was given to Enma Ai herself, Hajime (the reporter) and his daughter, Tsugumi. Without giving away spoilers, I can safely say these characters receive a decent amount of emotional and psychological development despite seeming relatively two-dimensional at first.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Obviously, the repetitive quality of this episodic anime brought down my enjoyment ranking. Virtually every episode follows the simplistic formula of: bad things happen to someone, someone contacts Jigoku Shoujo, someone's enemy is eventually sent to hell. Luckily, Hajime and Tsugumi show up to provide some insight into this process (Hajime believes it is wrong and unjust and Tsugumi believes it's OK for people to enact revenge on such people), which lends the anime a degree of intellectual appeal. Then, as Hajime and Tsugumi's back stories are revealed, the plot truly becomes interesting as it intertwines nicely with Enma Ai's back story, leading to a satisfying conclusion in which the main characters all are forced to interact with each other. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Despite the anime's repetitiveness, I still believe it is worth watching, if you have the patience to make it the end of the series, that is. I look forward to watching Futakumori soon!\\n",

If you want to know what's the plot, read the SUMMARY, and don't mark me down for not saying anything about the story. I tell you what elements are impacting in the story and what my opinion is. ANYWAYS...\r\nJigoku Shoujo, or Hell Girl, is an anime that gets the viewers into thinking about their morals, an idea similar to Death Note, but not like the concept of controlling fate. Rather, this anime has you searching for why one would wish ill-will against another, and whetheror not you would send somebody to hell if you were in their position. Basically this anime embellishes on it's supernatural feel and does that very well. I had chills in some scenes were glimpses of Hell were portrayed. The plot idea was fantastic and characters were very interesting. However, there was room for improvement. The beginning was somewhat slow and really didn't have anything going, until maybe the 9th or 10th episode. Plus revenge plots began to look the same.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10, don't get me wrong, this anime was pure gold and should be in the check-off list for all otakus!",

            "content": "Nothing was making me to expect much from Jigoku Shoujo as there is not so many good horror anime, being relatively old, like 11 years (now it is 2016)\r\nI had a thought that there is no point in reviewing this anime as all the ideas were mentioned like hundred times,\r\nbut after checking a bunch of reviews I found out the lack of some important ideas featured in this anime.\r\nIn this review I am not urging everyone to watch it saying \"it is a must watch series\", however this anime really impressed me. It is a sad story and it may remind you of the worsttime in your life, but it is teaching very important moral \"revenging you dig two graves, one for your enemy and another for yourself\"\\n\\n\r\nSo the main idea of this anime in most episodes is hate driving people mad, mad enough to agree on a contract that in their afterlife they go to hell, as a result the object of their hate is immediately send to hell. To do so just untie the red thread on this straw doll. Unfortunately being filled with hate people cannot think clearly and understand the consequences of this contract. So these people hate someone enough to kill at cost of own life. Fortunately there is Hell Correspondence at your service and you do not have to get your own hands dirty. You can get rid of a person you hate and leave a happy life (may be). On the other hand you keep that knowledge that after you die Jigoku Shoujo is going to send you to hell. In my opinion bearing this tough thoughts cannot become a happy life.\\n\\n\r\nBefore taking the decision to untie the red thread people have very perplexed thoughts for a moment understanding that being send to hell is like the worst thing happening to them. Some try to resolve the problem on their own and at some points you can see a shine of hope, faint, but visible way to salvation is just not to untie this cursed red thread...\\n\\n\r\nArt. For me in this anime art looks like one of the strongest sides of this anime. Enma Ai in here kimono is so beautiful that you do not get bored of seeing her again and again for many episodes. Keep in mind that this anime has rather dark atmosphere and a lot of dark scenes are set pretty impressive. Effects illustrating supernatural phenomena for me looked splendid despite that it is more than 10 years old anime.\\n\\n\r\nUsually I do not say much about music, music is just fine here, it creates the right atmosphere and almost perfectly fits the situations. Some people might say that it is not  so good and soundtrack variation is not rich, but I assure you while watching all the series the idea that music is bad never got to my mind. OP, ED soundtracks are superb and fitting this anime conceptions. Also various characters are voiced by famous seiyuu like Fukuyama Jun, Sawashiro Miyuki and more.",

I was looking for a horror-ish anime, and then I remembered reading a review for Jigoku Shoujo. So I figured that it couldn't hurt to check it out.\r\nI was captivated by the simple plot that grew and progressed as the story developed. But it moved to slowly sometimes and then forced a lot on you as you moved towards the end. I also though that the side characters leading the story were a little weak or sometimes down right obnoxious. \r\nThere are soundcues in it that remind you of the event or begin to symbolize events all together. \\n\\n\r\nSuprising the lead characters were well designed and had more personality then I would have expected. The dialogue was was either dark and humorless to sometimes being downright funny. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, everything was well polished and time was spent on the details of the little things. The opening was amazing, it was really beautifully done, more to captivate though then to open it. \\n\\n\r\nAltogether thought, \\n\r\nit was a really nice anime, clever for there is nothing like it.\\n\r\nI would suggest it, but get about half way though before you find out it isn't for you.

            "content": "Ok....To start of my first review, i'll be brief and frank. I expected much more from Jigoku Shoujo. Sure, the series was ok but it could have been better.\r\nLet's go into more detail...\r\nThe concept of the story was unique, i'll admit that. My only problem was HALF the series was VERY repetative. Half of the total number of episodes focused ONLY on random people asking Ai Enma for their vengance to be granted. Half the series went something like this: a.) Random person wants someone sent to hell. b.) They ask Ai Enma for help. c.) Random person gets their revenge. It wasn't until someoneactually tried to stop Ai Enma did the story get more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThe series was also suppossed to be scary or frightening to some degree. Personally, I didn't find it to be any of these. It lacked the impact to terrify me for more than 1 milisecond. Although, I found Ai Enma's way of sending people to hell very amusing.....not scary......amusing.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was ok. It wasn't eye candy like Kanon or Clannad. It was just average.\\n\\n\r\nThe songs were well done and deserve praise. I loved the opening and the ending song. The bgms of the series also go well with the situations they're played at.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development could have been improved. While Ai Enma and the recurring characters in the story were presented very well, the series failed to focus on the three dolls/spirits who assist Ai. I expected to know exactly who they were and exactly what kind of spirits they were by the end of the series but I ended up consulting wikipedia in the end.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Jigoku Shoujo is average. It's postive points equal its negative points. It is enjoyable but there is room for impovement. The second season is a lot better.",

I wont tell u more, i u want to know then watch it ;).\\n\r\nBut if we take off the first episodes, i can say the story is great..so dont think this 7 means its bad.\\n\\n\r\nArt(8.2): Very good, the design is good, the characters are fine..in overall i think this aspect is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7.8): Sound is neither great or bad..if fits well with this style of anime, so i give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7.3): Characters are not well develloped as they should. At the end of 15 episodes i knew almost nothing about the main characters, and thats bad. Thankfully, things chage with the introduction of 2 new characters, Hajime and Tsugumi, who makes the anime much more interesting than it was before. So in the final 11-10 episodes we get to know something about the characters, and that makes me give a 7 and not wors than that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8.4): The best aspect in my opinion. It has a lot of suspense, is a lot psychological and some action. I didn&acute;t really got bored while watching, with the exception of the first one that were a little repetitive. So its a very high 8 for this aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8.0): A fine anime to watch, could be better its true, but still i can recommend this one for someone who likes this kind of misterious and psychological anime. I am now curious and i will start soon with the sequel, wich i hope to be just a little better than this one :)\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This series definitely has a lot to offer on the supernatural/mystery sector with its 72 episodes distributed over three seasons airing between 2005 and 2009, but would it also offer the horror I was searching for?\r\nIn a nutshell, this series is about a mysterious girl named Ai Enma who, over the course of the whole series, fulfills people\u00b4s wishesto send another person they have a grudge against to hell with the help of her three henchmen. It is a very episodic show where every episode follows the same routines and patterns. We learn about a person suffering from torture, see how they log on to the internet to access the \u201cHell Correspondence\u201d and then get to witness all the events leading up to the victim to finally decide to send his tormentor to hell for a costly price. \\n\\n\r\nIn the first season, the above described scenario repeats itself for the first eight episodes to introduce the viewer to all the characters. By episode 8, an overarching plot featuring a reporter and his daughter who get increasingly involved with Hell Girl as they try to stop her gets established, and this is exactly the point in the show where it gets extremely good. The way the story then builds up from there and increases tension until the epic climax in the last three episodes is just very well done and kept me on the edge of my seat. I marathoned the first season within two days and couldn\u00b4t wait to continue the rollercoaster ride.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season, Futakomori, manages to keep up the high level of entertainment without blending in an overarching storyline as it offers hands down the best and most cruel hell-sending cases of all three seasons. Futakomori  also blesses us with episodes telling the story of Ai\u00b4s mysterious helpers, who by the way are all valuable assets to the show, and how they became her companions one by one until finally in the end, her own moving and tragic past is revealed to the viewer. \u201cHajime-chan\u201d, the reporter from season 1 as well as his daughter are definitely missed on the other hand as their replacement Kikuri, a strange little girl, is no way near as interesting as the pair from the first season. Anyway, like in season  1, the build-up to the ending is simply amazing and in my opinion remains the biggest strength of this generally great series.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 3, Mitsuganae, unfortunately cannot keep up with the high quality of its predecessors. While I will not call it an atrocious show, it still is more than a little disappointing after watching all the amazingness that happened before over the course of 48 episodes. The main focus in this season is on a high school girl named Yuzuki who gets possessed by Ai.  While this is not necessarily a bad idea, Yuzuki\u00b4s personality is as uninteresting as it gets and the same goes for Hell Girl\u00b4s new helper Yanawaro, who for some reason is introduced out of nowhere and is totally unimportant to the season. Not only is Mitsuganae a step backwards in the character department but the hell-sending cases within the high school are just completely ridiculous. While the writers were able to really tell superb stories that made the audience lose their sense for what\u00b4s wrong and what\u00b4s right for two seasons, it seems like they lost inspiration here as people are just going to hell for basically nothing all of a sudden. The only thing coming remotely close to the quality of the first seasons is the ending once again. Thank god they were able to remain the drama and close out Jigoku Shoujo well as this saves the third season to some extent along with the improved quality of animation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I was once again not able to find the horror elements I was looking for and it seems like the ability to scare me to death will forever be an absolute monopoly to live-action movies. However, as a mystery/supernatural show Jigoku Shoujo does very, very well indeed and I totally recommend you watch this if you like mystery. The best thing about it is that the show does not require you to watch all three seasons. Each season has a satisfying ending to it that concludes the anime and the ending of season three is not more or less \u201copen\u201d then the other 2, so feel free to skip Mitsuganae. The first two seasons are definitely a must watch!\\n\\n\r\nTo close things out I also recommend you watch this series subbed unless you don\u00b4t mind getting used to new voices from Futakomori onwards as only the first season has been  dubbed unfortunately.\\n\\n\r\nI give Jigoku Shoujo an overall score of 7.5 points, but it would be a 9 for the first two seasons! \\n",

As many people have stated and I'm sure any viewer will notice after a few episodes is that this series is VERY repetitive.  I would say that there is a reason for it in giving viewers a small taste of the hell Ai has endured for many years.\r\nThe music is wonderful, animation is stunning, and the characters are a real treat.  Some of Ai's team it was easy to guess where in Japanese mythology they came from and one of them was areally tough one.  Don't worry you'll get your answers... by watching ^_^\\n\\n\r\nSo if you have the patience this is a very good anime.",

            "content": "\u201cDelivery service to hell\u201c\r\nThe Story...\r\nIt might be a little odd & quite unique in a way that people are getting sent to hell. A story which revolves to a creepy and a psychological way as the main character Enma Ai fulfills someone\u2019s desire to make revenge on someone. As Enma Ai being the Hell Girl and the ones responsible in doing such hideous actions, it brings such mystery to the story as in each episode there are different tales to tell with different personalities to view. The main attraction here would be the procedure of how the person is getting sent to hell, little bylittle, knowing the reasons behind it. With the development of the story, there are minor arcs & major arc to consider, as minor arcs fills up and strengthen the background of the story while the major arc follows the path and the reason behind the whole series. \\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation...\\n\\n\r\nIt is quite good for the art & animation. The series use a dark backgrounds that support the creepiness of the story and animations that is just the right thing to see in a horror genre. They are also drawn and animated based on each scenario including different and detailed sceneries, but sometimes there is similarity to be seen.\\n\\n\r\nSound...\\n\\n\r\nScreams, shouts and other BG music and sounds that pertains to the scenario of the story gives a nice effect throughout the show, The OP song is quite a catchy song and ED that has a melodic and slow tune, also voices of characters is quite okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nEnma Ai, the protagonist of the story, a mysterious and gloomy girl that leaves an expressionless face and grants desires of taking revenge. There are also three helpful followers to help with her, Hone Onna, a not too old or not too young woman, Wanyuudou, a pretty much of being of a wise man, and Ren, has a power to see anywhere he wants. These three people give such little impact throughout the show. While Shibata, Tsugumi and Shibata, Hajime, daughter and father and also have quite similarity on its perspective, these are normal people that has been affected by the actions of Enma Ai, having a great part throughout the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe series is quite fun to watch as different people getting sent to hell as they beg and please to Enma, Ai. Also being quite a humorous show and giving horrific sounds and background music that supports the essence throughout the show, it is entertaining. But the disappointment here might be the usage of the same method that consists of repetition of scenes, which becomes unbearable to watch as the story goes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u2026\\n\\n\r\nA little different way to tell a story which focuses on its horrific and psychological theme, but in the end be wary that this series is kind a repetitive in a way as each episode use the same method which is quite boring to watch, but on the other side, the main story is quite something & unique that contains humorous and strange arcs that might hook you up.",

            "content": "Horror is a genre that strives to invoke fear and dread in people. Many a scare tactic and dark twist have been concocted to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, there are many times when the genre is so focused on scaring its audience that it chooses shock value over humanity. Thankfully, this is not the case with Hell Girl. Though often cold and unforgiving, Hell Girl has a humanistic core, and because of that it is all the more effective as a horror. After all, the most terrifying thing is not some big bad boogieman, but rather the flaws of humanity itself.\r\nRumor has it, there isa website that can only be accessed at midnight. The Hell Corespondents... All you have to do is type in the name of a person you hate, and the Hell Girl will make that person disappear from your life; forever to suffer in the depths of hell. However, everything comes at a price, and the price of your revenge is your very own soul. For when you die, you will also be damned to suffer in hell. It is a steep price, however, the temptation of sweet vengeance might prove too strong for those who truly crave it.\\n\\n\r\nHell Girl is a morbid and sophistic horror. Rather than going for cheap shocks and chills, it relies on slow building dread. Each episode features a tortured individual seeking to escape the cruel fate given to them by removing their torturer from their lives, or maybe simply looking to take revenge on someone who did them wrong. Whatever the case may be, the circumstances are always dire, highlighting the cruelty humans are capable of, and the damage their desires, self-righteousness, and vanity can bring. This is by far the most unsettling part of the entire series, such grim examination of the human heart is endlessly more frightening than any supernatural monster could be. Some of the most mortifying episodes are the ones that involve a neglected friend, an overbearing mother-in-law, and a friendly nurse.\\n\\n\r\nOf course that is not to say that is the only source of the show's scares. Hell Girl herself, Ai Enma, is quite the chilling presence. Her cold, stoic demeanor exudes a menace that an adolescent girl shouldn't be capable of. Her appearance is incredibly beautiful and discomforting at the same time, especially while she is wearing her falling-flower kimono. The show as a whole has a beautiful but deadly look. This is especially true for the surreal landscape of constant sunset where Ai resides. Hell Girl's visuals a are at their best during the vengeance scenes, nightmarish sequences filled with disturbing imagery, which have intricate scenarios of their own. The sound adds to the atmosphere considerably, you can just feel the mounting tension listening to it. The ominous chants and haunting orchestration of the music fits the horrors seen on screen all too well, and lighter bits of music serve well during touching moments or times where people are just going about their daily lives. The show looks good even when it is not in full flux horror mode, and the only real shortcoming is the short occasions of choppy character animation, which are easily forgivable. No doubt this uniformly strong package is due to no small part to the direction of veteran Omori Takahiro, director of great works such as the refined (and discomforting) romance Koi Kaze and the brutal romp Baccano; who once again proves his versatility with this bone-chilling horror.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one big drawback for this show however, its extremely formulaic format for episodes. The show stubbornly sticks to its revenge-of-the-week structure to the point that someone being sent to hell by the end of every episode is as expected as the sun rising in the morning. This makes the show kind of hard to take in big doses, and will wear thin many a viewers' patience. To remedy this the show throws a reoccurring father and daughter duo into the mix, and this might just be the best decision the show makes. Their addition gives continuity to the show, and just as importantly gives voice to the moral debate of the shows themes. Hajime, the father, feels that what Hell Girl is doing is wrong and is determined to talk those who have contacted her to find a different route than revenge. Tsugumi on the other hand doesn't see why her father is so against Hell Girls services, though she still reluctantly helps him find those who have contacted Hell Girl. They are pretty important plot-wise as well, as Tsugumi has a strange connection to Ai, at times getting visions of her. This, as well as Hajime and Tsugumi's relationship, comes to a head in the shows powerful conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nHell Girl is a rare gem, a horror that uses humanity to provide its scares rather than simple shock value. It takes you into the darkest pits of human cruelty and selfishness, giving dark insight on the most frightening things of all. The insistantly formulaic structure does hold it back a bit, and will doubtlessly not fit all tastes. However, strong themes and eerie atmosphere make this a horror not to be missed.",

            "content": "I have already noticed the show Jigoku Shoujo long before I decided to watch it. I knew about Enma Ai already, but only the fact that she was the main character. Because the ongoing animes were so disappointing, I decided to take a break from it and watch an entirely different show. After seeing that there was full episodes of Jigoku Shoujo on Youtube, I decided to watch that and give it a go.\r\nJigoku Shoujo is about different people who wants to take revenge on someone they hate; whether it be a bully, an annoying coworker or even a murderer. They can take revenge andsend that person to Hell, via the Internet (how amazing is that?). The site is called Hell Correspondence, and it rumoured to be only available to access at midnight and to those who want revenge. It is then Enma Ai's job as the Hell Girl to fulfill her client's request with the help of Hone Onna, Wanyuudo and Ren Ichimoku.\\n\\n\r\nJigoku Shoujo's plot is pretty much straight forward - short stories that lasted around one episode usually containing a person they would focus on and an antagonist. The person would ask help from Enma Ai, and throughout the episode would reveal the backstory of that individual and why they want to send someone to hell. By the end of the episode, the antagonist usually dies and sent to hell. This worked quite well for a few episodes, but then started getting a little bit repetitive. It was the same thing over and over again, and in some cases even had the same sort of plot as an earlier episode. However, I do commend them for their creativity in being able to portray different scenarios per episode and except for the few occasions where it was kind of the same, it was generally very well done. At a later stage of the anime there became a distinct plot of Enma's background and why she became the Hell Girl. Another recurring plot was that of Hajime and Tsugumi's and why Hajime tries to do the opposite of Enma and to stop the people from committing revenge. Plot wise, I think Jigoku Shoujo does what it is supposed to, and the finale of the first season was definitely excellent and opened up the possibilities of further seasons.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters of Jigoku Shoujo were quite diverse. There are new characters introduced each episode, but of course, they don't really appear again. However, there are recurring characters such as Enma Ai, who appear every episode. Now, it is really not possible to develop the main characters since pretty much all the episodes were focused on the minor characters each episode. The last 5-10 episodes were the only ones used to really develop them and to provide history on the main characters. Of course, the most interesting character out of the bunch is no other than Enma Ai herself. I asked a lot of questions involving her character and towards the end, I feel like some were answered in great detail, but some were still left a little fuzzy. The other one that struck me the most is Hajime. he is really a love or hate character, and for me, I really hate him. It might not be him and his actual background, but his role as the stereotypical type who wants to \"save\" the people around him. Moreover, he utterly terrible at saving people so I thought, why bother with it? But towards the end, I guess I did start to like him a little bit. Just a little.\\n\\n\r\nNow, Jigoku Shoujo's art is amazing in some parts, but not all the time. Now, I don't know why this is the case though (*cough* Studio DEEN *cough*) but overall it was pretty mediocre. Nothing really stood out for me, but nothing was really horrible about it. I gotta say that the character designs of Hone, Ren and Enma were superb and loved it whenever they were on the scene, especially Hone. The animation as well was pretty mediocre - except Enma's nagajuban. I mean, how can one not like moving flowers on her dress? The musical score of Jigoku Shoujo was impressive too, ranging from the soothing calm nature to the action scenes towards the end of each episode. The opening song wasn't terrible exciting, and really gives off a different feeling to the anime and portrays it so differently, one might think it came from a different anime. As for the ending, I thought it was really entertaining to listen to and loved the transition between the final scene of each episode into the ending song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think that Jigoku Shoujo was an interesting anime to watch. Although it is a little repetitive at the beginning, the ending is truly worth it. The art and animation is mediocre, but doesn't really disturb you from enjoying the show. The musical score is very wonderful and was a pleasure to listen to. Watch it if you like bad guys going to hell :D\\n\\n\r\nRating: A\\n\\n\r\n(81/100)\\n\\n",

I went out one day, planning to look for a Code Geass DVD but it was not yet out, so I decided to buy Jigoku Shoujo instead.

The characters, including the extras, were drawn beautifully, it made meadmire both males and females (^_^). Hone Onna is one of the most beautiful characters I've ever seen.

            "content": "Hell Girl has a dark, original concept that is genuinely interesting and exciting to watch but it comes at the price of a slow, repetitive start and perhaps taking a bit too long to get away from its originally episodic nature.\r\nArt-\r\nI found Hell Girl's art to be absolutely gorgeous. Symbolism is absolutely everywhere, it's quite colorful and this anime's depiction of Hell is artistically beautiful. The visuals aren't flashy but they do not need to be and this anime has an undeniable dark, tragically beautiful feel to it, which fits perfectly with the story.\r\nSound-\r\nThe voice acting here is quite good, with Brina Palencia absolutely nailingher role as the titular character and the supporting cast, with particular props going to Luci Christian's Tsugumi, also delivering strong, believable performances. I'm also a huge fan of Hell Girl's soundtrack and have several of its tracks on my personal playlist. The show emits a sad and ominous beauty throughout and the music is a huge part of that. The sound is definitely one of the highlights of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are hit or miss. Hell Girl herself, Hajime and Tsugumi are far and away the stars of the show whereas other named characters feel both underdeveloped and at times outright unimportant. That said, the story of those three aforementioned characters alone is strong enough and fascinating enough to keep you gripped the whole way through. The problem is, the latter two characters aren't even introduced until episode 8, at which point you may be understandably a bit bored and underwhelmed with what has been, up until that point, an episodic and repetitive experience using the same base formula repeatedly. Had the whole show continued in that way it absolutely would have worn out its welcome, and I feel it took a bit too long (one third of the show) to get away from that, but once it finally does the quality of the story improves dramatically and it never drops off again.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the show takes a while to get to its meat and potatoes and it is initially quite repetitive. After five, six, seven episodes of essentially the same thing it's only natural to feel you don't need fifteen plus more episodes of this and begin to lose interest in the show. However, if you can make it to episode 8 without losing interest, it only gets better and better from there and it'll take you on a journey well worth taking. When this anime concluded I felt quite satisfied and glad I stuck it out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-\\n\\n\r\nDark, beautiful and intriguing Hell Girl is well worth your time if you can make it through the slow, repetitive start without losing interest.\\n\\n\r\n+Distinctly dark, sad, beautiful style resonating from all parts of the show\\n\r\n+Great voice acting from the leads\\n\r\n+Show gets better and better in the mid to late stages\\n\\n\r\n-Initially quite repetitive and formulatic\\n\r\n-Slow to get to the parts truly worth watching\\n\\n\r\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 7\\n\r\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 8",

            "content": "For such an original and intriguing premise, I found myself a little disappointed with how Hell Girl turned out throughout much of its run. This is a series with signs of a grey moral line through the actions of Ai and her companions as they use their Hell Correspondence site to send those tormenting the main character of an episode to hell. This raises some questions on whether or not there is justification in exacting vengeance on someone who causes you to suffer.\r\nThe series mostly runs in an episodic format where we are introduced to a random character suffering from the actions of an antagonistand Hell Girl gives said central character the choice of banishing the subject of their misery to hell at the cost of being sent there themselves at the end of their life. Said character ponders over the decision until they get to a breaking point and then sicks Ai and her group on the antagonist of the episode. This is what ultimately contributes to one of the show's major flaws. While there are twists in some of the episodic stories and two characters (Hajime and Tsugumi) later become entangled in the affairs of Hell Correspondence, the developments essentially play out the same in nearly each episode and they can get repetitious. Also many of the targets of vengeance by a central character in each episode come across as so shallowly evil, that the show forces you not to care for them as they get tormented by Ai's companions before being banished to hell.\\n\\n\r\nPushing through such repetitious developments does have its rewards though. The connection with the two characters introduced to Ai is slowly unveiled throughout the show as they become more familiar with the affairs of Hell Correspondence. Hints are dropped about Ai's past which are eventually fully revealed later in the series to give the viewer enough sense as to why she exacts vengeance for those desiring it, the same also in the case of Hajime and Tsugumi. Some episodes even cast aside the black and white morality setup from most of the show's other episodes reflecting on characters victims of their own tragic circumstances which Ai is shown to have regrets over casting into hell. There isn't any background mentioned about Ai's three companions in the Hell Correspondence, but I guess that is what sequels are for.\\n\\n\r\nHell Girl features gorgeous looking clean visuals with bright colors, vast scenery and plenty of detail with settings and character designs. Animation is mostly consistent shown particularly well with settings as wind is blowing around branches and Ai's group are using their powers to torment the sufferers they are recruited to banish to hell, though some animation frames appeared to be reused kudos to the repetitious plot developments and repeated use of flashbacks hinting to the pasts of Ai and the Shibatas.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I did enjoy Hell Girl, despite running into its major flaws, as the hinted focus on Ai and the Shibatas combined with the grey morality that comes up with the job of Hell Correspondence makes it a decent romp if you can press through the repetitious developments of the earlier episodes.",

The review may have some really slight spoilers!\r\n- Story - 9/10\r\nAt first, the story may look like it is just about a mysterious website that only shows its self at midnight and only to people who has hatred to someone, but in fact, the story is more than that. In every episode, there are repetitive moments and therefore you may find it boring, but repetitive moments are there to show us what Enma Mai's life looks like.\r\nGrieving people, hateful people, desperate people and sinners all over and every day is the same. not only that, she is also immortal. We learnt that there areevidence about her from Azuchi\u2013Momoyama age ( 1573\u20131603 ). All these years she lived in an endless nightmare, and the only thing she could do to help people was taking revenge on their behalf. as much as doing this hurts herself, there was nothing she could do about it. As I said at the beginning, episodes are a bit repetitive to shows us a piece of what Enma Ai lived so far. It is there in order to make the ambience better.\\n\\n\r\n- Art - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEven though there are some cliche features about character's physical appearance, It is still well done. Protagonist's emotions are well reflected and there is no repetition of among the characters.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere is not much to talk about. Ending and opening lyrics are really deep and fits the anime. Also without Enma Ai's theme, atmosphere would be incomplete,\\n\\n\r\n- Characters - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are temporary, they are just there to shows us the real face of the world we living in. And when it comes to main characters, most of them are really unique.\\n\r\nMost of them are from Japan culture, mythological people, therefore they fit each other so well. Even the Jigoku Shoujo, Enma Ai, just a character from mangaka's imagination looks like she is also a mythological person because of the story and character cast.\\n\\n\r\n- Enjoyment - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI know the reason why most of the episodes are repetitive and stationary and I am finding them necessary but still, to be honest, I can not say that they were really fun, they were necessary to make ambience and story complete. Other than that anime was great.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall - 9/10\\n\r\n I find the anime great because of protagonist's mental and physical features and the ambience itself. And I would recommend to people who is into slow paced mystery animes or people who like gothic, haunted themes, ( for example anime called Another )",

I love everything about this horror post-21st century anime, with its stunning animation style, fantastic storytelling, supernatural atmosphere. \r\nNow it's time to rate:\r\nStory- The story is basically where a person has been suffering from torment from an acquaintance and access a site called Hell Correspondence and submits a request to get his or her revenge. Ai Emma appears and gives the person a doll with a string around its neck. When you pulled the string, Ai and her companions appear and pull out a freaky illusion and sentthe antagonist to Hell.

            "content": "What an outstanding anime! \r\nOk, so many reviews brought up the fact that the anime is more like a \"verse\" instead of having a very detailed storyline, and that's what makes it bad. Although I share the same opinion, I think that it displays so many problems of the human behaviour that I cannot help but like it. The fact that it is very fragmented is a way to show that anyone can hate, reasonable or not, and that hatred is a matter of perspective. \r\nThe characters simply make sense. I mean, it may look weird for someone that is new to anime or Japaneseculture, but if you have a bit of cultural experience, everything makes sense. Most of the main characters, however, do not evolve or suffer from an inner fight. Probably the most interesting point of view to follow is Enma Ai's (which was totally expected), but I sure as hell like that little Tsugumi girl. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I must say the soundtrack was chosen wisely. I definitely love both the OP and the ED (been listening to them for a few years now, yet I never knew they were part of an anime), and the BGM fits.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also debatable. Many told me that it looks somehow unnatural and that it is not the \"classical\" anime look, but damn, I love it! So yeah, I guess it's a matter of taste...\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the series and it made me think a little bit more about behaviour and feelings in general. I definitely recommend this to everyone who has had too much of the plotless, fun to go animes and wants something different and eye-opening! ^^",

None of the episodes tie together and each episodes plot seems to be the exact same! It gets so tedious! It goes like this: Introduced to some helpless person, they call Hell girl, more story on the helpless person, Hell girl tortures person, person dies, a little follow up on how the person does once their tormentor is dead- and it's usually not even enough for you to be satisfied.\r\nThe art couldhave been a little better for me to have enjoyed it... when Hell girl rides in the carriage there's always lines going across her and it annoys me so much. However, when tortuing people, they do a decent job at drawing scary things.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty fitting for this anime, but nothing that catches my attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall.. I think this show is just a little to repetitive for me. But, if you're okay with the same thing happening pretty much every episode, just in different scenario's, I say you should watch it. If you're like me and get bored of the same thing over and over again.. I say try a few episodes, but then drop it if it's boring to you.",

            "content": "Hell Girl is a fine example of Japan's expertise in the world of horror. Rather than relying on gory images and the like, Japan's always seemed to specialize in instilling fear through the use of the human mind, combined with an element of folktale, fiction or not. Hell Girl's story comes off summarized as a bland existence- a girl who ferries the souls of people's tormentors into the depths of Hell. All you have to do is ask, essentially. But it was interesting enough to at least pick up when I saw the cheap FUNimation S.A.V.E. release on sale. \r\nI wasn't too disappointed in theend. While yes, the story itself is extremely repetitive (each episode with the same idea- get tormented, summon Hell Girl, and so on), surrounding elements powered together to create a satisfactory experience for me. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very capturing. Aniplex rarely disappoints me with there work, always producing a very traditional anime look. It's simple, crisp, and flows evenly. There are moments, however, during the show, where proportions go a little too far out of place (the size of hands, the width of a torso, etc.) that it became distracting from dialogue, but it's not enough to deter from the show itself. Just a distraction. \\n\\n\r\nOften, the flaws in the image can also be remedied by the music. The soundtrack is well done, and lifts, even completes, the image, but I find it very predictably used. The same songs, the same sounds, the same moments. I know this can't be true, but when I at least consider the soundtrack made for the show, I can only bring to mind two songs and one traditional Japanese sound. It feels insignificant enough in a horror that I wouldn't say it brings down the overall feel of the anime, it just adds to the repetitive nature of each episode. This can be kind of a bummer sometimes. But it's not the poor music's fault, so let's move on.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Hell Girl something short of fascinating is the changing characters. Most of the cast is very fleeting, as the story moves from episode to episode, and each of them are very clearly defined. Maybe it's a childish love of psychology that pushes me to drool over this aspect, but I'm pretty sure it's interesting for most viewers. Each character thinks in their own way, and acts on those individualized thoughts. This means, while the plot repeats, and even some dialogue too, watching people act as people in an anime is refreshing. Good and evil become difficult to distinguish. And by halfway through the series, I stopped rooting for \"the good guy\" and found myself actually considering who was in the wrong. This is something I would say needs to be present in television and movies anywhere, but if it was, maybe it would be less special. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, if you ever feel like kicking back from time to time and popping something into the DVD player (or such) that will give you a few good shivers, Hell Girl is a nice way to go. I wouldn't say it's the sort of thing that would knock a viewer out of the park, but it's something I would recommend watching at least once in your lifetime. It repeats, true, but it is refreshing to see a large and equally complex cast of characters.\\n\\n\r\n-shoujokiss7",

            "content": "This is my first anime review, hope you like it. I tried avoiding spoilers the best I could.\r\nI started watching Jigoku Shoujo with very high expectations. My friend had praised this anime to heavens and the general idea about a girl who takes upon people's revenge and ferries the wrong-doers to hell is very intriguing.\r\nStory: Jigoku Shoujo should be reviewed in two parts, because the second half of the show is just so much better than the first half. The first half of the show is episodic and specially the first episodes until about 10th episode or so, are quite repetitive in their plot. \r\nAbout2/3 of the anime is quite episodic, with each having their own plot and side characters. It is really interesting to see how much people are suffering and what they have to go through in order to contact Ai Enma (Jigoku Shoujo / Hell Girl) and send the person they hate to hell. It often feels even good when the suffering person pulls that thread off the straw doll's neck, sending the wrong-doers to hell. Despite this, the anime is sometimes even a bit dull with the ever-repeating plot line.\\n\r\nTowards the second half of the anime, the cases start to differ more from the basic formula and the cases get even quite bizarre. It isn't always necessarily the evil people who get sent to hell, and for good reasons. This brings up lots of questions about Ai Enma and her past, why is she doing the job of the Hell Girl?\\n\r\nBy the middle of the season, two of the other main characters begin appear more often as well. The journalist Hajime, and her daughter Tsugumi, who has psychic abilities regarding Ai Enma. They are trying to find out the truths behind the Hell Girl's past and reasons for why she's taking people to hell. More and more questions about Ai Enma start to pop up. The story starts to build up in depth and intensity towards the last quarter of the season.\\n\r\nThe episodes past 20 saved the anime for me. Ai Enma's past is revealed and the story loses any of the repetitive dullness it had until that point. After the slow start of the story, the ending wraps it up quite well. Many of the questions about the backgrounds of the characters are answered. Still, many questions remain even after the anime ends, which asks for watching the next two seasons as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Art in Jigoku Shoujo is quite good, even if it's not something never seen before. The art fits the \"dark\" theme of the anime really well and creates the atmosphere the show deserves. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Sadly, Ai Enma and the people (the three magical dolls) surrounding her are pretty much the only interesting characters in Jigoku Shoujo. Because most of the show is episodic, there isn't much of a background created for the ever-changing side characters. The two other main characters, the journalist Hajime and her daughter Tsugumi, who are pursuing the Hell Girl have quite big role in the show, but personally I dislike them, specially Hajime. I despise him specially after his past is revealed.\\n\r\nMore questions about Ai Enma start to arise as the story progresses. Why is she doing her job as the Hell Girl and why does she always take the people to hell, even if they are not bad people? Why is she so emotionless? The past and reasons behind the existence of Hell Girl are intriguing and towards the end of the show there's rapid development in her character and past.\\n\r\nAi Enma is one of my favorite female characters of all time.\\n\r\nHer line \"Care to give death a try?\" gives me the shivers every single time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack (including OP & ED) of Jigoku shoujo is great. I can't say it's one of my favorites, but it fits the show perfectly. I can't really imagine how the music could be better for this show, it really brings the feeling of the anime up a notch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Jigoku Shoujo was a really good anime. Without the slow 2/3 of the story I could have scored this anime 10. The first half wasn't bad but it was a bit too slow for the show to be perfect. Ai Enma and the story surrounding her are really interesting, I just wish they had got deeper into the pasts of the other characters too.\\n\r\nI love all the mysterious and symbolic things in Jigoku Shoujo, the music and art are very good as well. The show wrapped up the end well, answering most of the biggest questions. Despite that, it left too many unanswered questions which I hope will be answered in the next two seasons.",

            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo. Hell Girl in English.\r\nJigoku Shoujo is the answer to the question of \"What if we made the grim reaper weeaboo bait as fuck?\"\r\nBut no that's actually really inaccurate despite your titular character sporting looks that could just bring some japanophiles to hell. \r\nHell girl is an episodic train of 24 episodes, each fleshing out instances of \"People in power\". The \"victim of the week\" (quoted because they're no saints themselves) is given a choice to send their nemesis to hell on the spot.\r\n No form of high horse, no \"necessary evil\", told like how it is; nobody is a saint. That's where majorityof the show's story point's stem from. (I give the show a 9/10 in that aspect) Every episode is chock-full of down-to-earth despair \\n\\n\r\nlike\\n\\n\r\nThink of a bowl of curry. Add prawn paste chili, wasabi and jalapenos and for good luck cook it in Godzilla's fires. If hell girl was curry that would be what hell girl is. Taking despair and giving it power alongside a troublesome decision.(Oh hey I just summarized 90% of the show.) \\n\\n\r\nWhat's keeping it from the perfect 10 is well, the fact that a curry metaphor summarizes 90% of the show. It's rather linear. It's almost a legitimate argument that you're watching the same episode again and again with a few anomalies until  the the final effort to give the show closure of sorts which is great and all but is it perfectly paced? Haha no you need more than 3 episodes if you wanna wrap the show up properly.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art gets a 10/10 just look at the fucking eyes drawn god do you see Enma's lovely red jewels no I don't mean her nipples look at her eyes I actually feel like having intercourse with those rubies and nothing else those red eyes are EVERYTHING about Ai\\n\\n\r\n*ahem*\\n\\n\r\nThe sound's a downer here at a 7/10. While the the Opening and ending songs (ED especially Karinui is amazing) are solid the show provides very little variety of an OST and what's present isn't too powerful on its own. It's (understandably) in relation to the show's \"One-dimensional\" but that doesn't change the fact that it's grating to hear the same pieces when there's at least the decency to come up with new scenarios every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are at a 10/10 here considering if the hell correspondence was an actual thing there would be events that unfold as written in the anime. That's enough to justify the 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nWhat do I say about the enjoyment part? I like watching people get shit on by the Hell correspondence team in their Executions and I especially love all that human jazz that goes on before the victim finally pulls the string. What's stopping me from giving it a 10/10 for enjoyment?\\n\\n\r\nOverall while I'll have it as rationally a 9 I'll always frame it up as a 10 on my list because I'm a faggot lol",

            "content": "Story\r\nJigoku Shoujo is the latest in a long and celebrated tradition of \"horror/suspense\" titles that don't really have either horror or suspense. The anime tend to go for sheer style over things like character development or logic and generally end with gruesome deaths tinged in irony. In the case of some of the shorter works, the formula tends to work: Vampire Princess Miyu, Pet Shop of Horrors, and even the more recent and slightly longerRequiem from the Darkness are all fairly worthwhile titles despite having basically zero character development or coherent storyline.\r\nUnfortunately, this is where Jigoku Shoujo falls short: length. With so many episodes tofill, the show quickly dead-ends into the same exact formula. Just as a magic trick gets less impressive the more times you see it, Jigoku Shoujo'sexcellent premise is bound to lose appeal by the 17th iteration of the same basic episode.\\n\r\nPeople might think I'm exaggerating, but not only is the plot basically identical for each episode, there are in fact entire stretches of dialogue that only change by one or two words. Feeble efforts are occasionally made to mix the show up a little, but adding different-colored sprinkles to the same goddamn cup cake does not make a new experience.\\n\r\nThis wouldn't be so frustrating if the first episode hadn't been so entertaining. The show's actual premise is delightfully creepy, a true example of a modern Japanese ghost story. If the creators had actually continued to come up with original ideas, the storyline could have really shaped up into something special. As is, we're left with a disappointing narrative some people might like but almost no one will love.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe show has a good stylistic feel to the entire thing, but falls short in a lot of areas when you compare it to other contemporary works. The designs of the one-episode characters all begin to blend together after a few episodes, and movement is generally choppy and minimal. There's a bunch of reused (albeit admittedly cool) animation from episode to episode, and the entire visual experience is tainted by an action scene at the end that looks like absolute ass.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nOMG GOGOGOGOGO Noto Mamiko!!!!!!!1111!!!1\\n\r\n...at least, that's what I'd usually be saying, as I love her work in just about every anime I've heard her in. In this case, however, all the director has her do with her character (Enma Ai) is speak the same handful of lines over and over again in a sleep-inducing monotone. The experience is somewhat comparable to hearing a master musician play one note continuously over the course of two hours - a freaking waste of talent.\\n\r\nThe rest of the voice acting is unmemorable either way, and the music does an ok job at setting the mood, but does suffer a little from overuse. I didn't particularly enjoy the OP, either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIn every episode, the anime focuses on a new set of characters, which translates to minimal development or depth. These characters generally fall into one of two archetypes: victim and villain. From there, it's a slow agonizing process of watching them sink into the dull abyss of inevitability. This works for a while, but after a few episodes the total lack of characterization makes caring for them extremely difficult.\\n\r\nThere is a small set of recurring characters, but most of these are even less developed than the ones that go away at the end of every episode. Enma Ai, the title character, remains an emotionless enigma until the final few episodes, at which point her back-story feels decidedly underwhelming.\\n\r\nThe sole beacons of light in an otherwise tedious cast are the \"mortal\" recurring characters, Shibata and his daughter. Their past actually ends up being somewhat touching, and is definitely the high point of Jigoku Shoujo's development. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to save the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThe old clich\u00e9 is that variety is the spice of life, and it certainly applies here, where literally every portion of the anime is reused somehow. Even though the show starts strongly, this becomes irrelevant when the writers refuse to expand on their initial ideas.\\n\r\nImagine your favorite episode of your favorite TV series. Would the series have been half as good if every episode was merely a slight variation of your favorite one?",

            "content": "For years I avoided watching Jigoku Shoujo because the description sounded unimpressive and redundant.  I was somewhat correct in my assumptions.  Jigoku Shoujo is enjoyable, but the repetitiveness in each episode quickly gets boring.  Each episode stands alone, focusing on unrelated characters and situations that focus on bullying, deceit, abuse, blackmail, etc, and the inevitable premise due to the victims decision to pursue vengeance by sending their tormentor straight to hell at the cost of their own soul being destined for hell as well.  \r\nAi Enma's role is fairly small, despite being the focus of the series, and her major roleis to simply do her job without question.  Things only shift almost halfway into the series when a reporter gets involved and takes it upon himself to stop Ai, and somehow persuade these damaged individuals to not enter the covenant with Ai by pulling the thread.  This, too, gets a tad bit redundant after a while, but I stuck with the series, somewhat bored with the pattern, but still intrigued with the personal cases in each episode.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat does make this series worth sticking with are the individual cases in each episode.  They're stand alone stories, and some of them are actually very good and gripping.  The series does a good job creating tension between the characters and using a variety of methods to display different types of evil, or sins, that are worthy of a boat ride to hell.  One thing the series definitely impressed me with is creating that eerie feeling of sacrificing your own soul for instant gratification, and how some people are desperate enough to escape a situation so badly that they would deliberately damn themselves.  At the end of many episodes I found myself reflecting, \"Would I have pulled the thread if I was in their shoes?\"  \\n\\n\r\nIt took me a while to finish the first season, like a few weeks, because I didn't feel the need to keep going after each episode so I took my time and watched it when I felt like it, which was usually while knitting.  I'm hesitant to start the second season, but I heard that the pace has been varied and that it's better than the first.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Jigoku Shoujo is a good watch if you don't want cliffhangers, or just need a series to work as a filler between other shows.",

If you guys have already watched death parade and you guys liked it , this is another anime that is quite similar to death parade except that death parade is much well-done cause of its art and everything . Jigoku Shoujo which means \"Hell-Girl\" tells us a lot about how the story is going to be like. Well , its not really much horror . Every episode almost have a story to tell and which make this anime series really fun and interesting to watch on . There will be some episodes totell background stories about \"Hell-Girl\" and so on to explain her existence. This series is more like a roller coaster ride with all feelings on it . You have to truly feel the characters , what they are feeling in order to feel the punch in your heart and in order to experience the fun in this series . Nevertheless , its a top-notch anime series and is really good to watch. I would recommend you guys watch this immediately. Every anime , there will be people who do not like and i truly can understand that . After all , we are all humans we different preferences and so on . This is just my opinion . If you are into slice-of-life stories i think this suits you really well . After all , the story of every episode is almost about what people are going through and what people experienced . \\n\\n\r\n~Plot~\\n\r\nThe plot is supposed to be like revenge. \"Hell-Girl\" is supposed to revenge your grievances . This means like people want to seek revenge and you just have to tell \"Hell-Girl\" and she will revenge for you. Its quite similar like death-note , just that these people do not die instantly . We were able to witness their pathetic sides and their true human form (except for some). Slowly , instead of revenging . It become hatred. There will be some cases like just because that person hate that person , they decided to call hell-girl. And , worst still . Some random people just curse some random people innocently. There will be 2 other human main characters going through a journey with those people from hell . It makes things become even more interesting when we want to find out about that girl who is link to Hell-Girl. What exactly that human girl is related to Hell-Girl ?

            "content": "When it comes down to the subject of revenge, I'm pretty black and white - you either deserve to be punished, or not. When I picked Hell Girl to be my next watchable anime, after the glory of Death Note, I was pretty sceptic, to say the least. Revenge, as a base of the story, can be done either so, that it's bearable at best, or insufferable, at worst - said in short, I tend to hate revenge-stories. Lucky for me, Hell Girl was that lucky bastard, that slipped between the radar, and managed to actually be something... well, out of this world, to sayit humbly!\\n\\n\r\nThe story, for a 26-episode- show, is actually pretty devided. The first half is episodic, with no actual story involved what so ever, but more like a plot-based formula. Firstly, there's a person, usually some poor, unfortunate high school student, who for some reason or the other, get deep with the sharks. He/she suffers alot, pleads for salvation for their predicaments, hears this rumor about a Hell Girl, who takes revenge on those, whos name she's given, Hell Girl offers her goods and services, but always for a price - nice touch - and the rest, is up to our victims. Take their revenge, or be a good/stupid person, and endure their suffering, as well as the consequenses. Needles to say, that never has revenge not been served - evil is always sented to Hell, and covenant with Hell, is thus made. I truly liked this first half of the story. It was simple, intriguing in both it's morality, themes and it's consept. Revenge comes with a price, but is there ever such time, when the price is too much to pay, no matter what the circumstances? And what if the vengeance doesn\u00e4t bring that long-waited salvation, but even more suffering, than before that? Most of the victims, wishing for a revenge, were just mere children, and it really made me think, would I ever be in a situation, where I would wish for a revenge, with a price being to be sent to Hell myself, after I was dead? Propably, yes, but still... pretty impressive, I'd say!\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series... not so good. Actually, no good at all! There's now this pesky reporter, with his admirably black and white- moralled/naive daughter, searching for anyone, who's even somehow connected with the Hell Girl, and as expected, sticking their ugly noses in where they don't belong, saying that revenge is never a right thing to do, no matter what the cause, or the circumstances! Okay, bullshit on that one! I hated this reporter, and his naive morals, from the bottom of my heart, and I hated, how by intoducing him, we also lost this wonderful, formulaic experience, with it's somewhat perfectly black and white morals, that fortunately, up until now, left out all the hypocrisy, and preaching on and on about values and morals of humanity - I feel like I'm back in 90's for crying out loud! If I were in any of these predicaments, wowing for a vengeance for my grievance, I sure as Hell wouldn't want any goody-two-shoes to stop and tell me, that despite all the wrongs and pains in my life, forced upon me by some sadistic/sosiopathic lunatic, my tormenter doesn't still deserve to be sent to Hell, because \"it just isn't the right thing to do\"! What a absolute rubbish! Atleast the girl was nice supporter for me, saying it straight like it is. If you're a bad person, doing something bad to another, you should be punished, and sometimes, revenge is all that is needed, to cleanse the soul, in order to move on. \\n\\n\r\nAnother serious beefer that I had, during the second half of the story, was the Hell Girl herself. I liked her more, in the first half, when she was just this very emotionless, quiet, lifeless, and overall lacking any kind of free will, motives, or desires, thus being almost completely with no real personality. Sounds crazy, I know, but in order to support this morally black and white story, I truly liked a protagonist, who was just a mere entity, instead of a actual person, not really saying much, nor doing much, only appearing when needed, building up this bearly unseen moral ground of choise, and consequense, and if so chosen, sending people to Hell, for vengeance. I didn't want her to have a tragic backstory, with lost love and sad death! I didn't want to learn her reasons and motives for what she's doing! All I wanted to know of her, was that Hell Girl, is just some not-evil-not-good entity, that'll come to you, who seek for a revenge, gives you a chance to do so, while still demanding full payment afterwards, of course, and sends our tormenters straight to Hell, with no chances for them to atone! That's the Hell Girl that I liked! Not some bitter and vengeful spirit, who misses/hates her lover-cousin! Yeah... japanese, man! Geez...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, despite all it's errors and some unneeded minor details that I never really wanted to learn, I really liked this anime - can't you tell, by the score?! It's serious - definitely not for a weak-minded, or animal-lovers! - with some truly grotesque little stories and tragic, poor unfortunate souls. It's morally interesting, and has some truly facinating points and highlights of humans as a species, that'll always seek for a revenge, no matter how much we want to believe in truth and justice - for some, revenge is justice. Hell Girl isn't really anything groundbreaking, for not ever taking any actual time to process nor judge it's own morals, or ways to deal with sorrow, loss and despair. It just gives us this \"suffer and endure\"- scenario, with a chance to get rid of your griefances easy and simple, with a little price to pay, after you die. It could have worked a lot better as a episodic piece, with no actual story in it, but as it is, it's pretty impressive, considering the themes, morals and values alone.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the problems, wound in the second half, this is actually the best revenge-story, that I've ever seen, and I would gladly recommend it to anyone, who has a taste for a little vengeance.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 9",

            "content": "\u201cIt is difficult to fight against anger, for man will buy revenge with his soul.\u201d  The immortal words of the philosopher Heraclitus have never rung truer than they have with the rising popularity of The Hell Correspondence, a mysterious website that\u2019s been trending among Japanese youth by word of mouth and sworn testimonials from the people who claim to have used it.  If you\u2019ve followed the popular URL to a dead end, it\u2019s likely because you haven\u2019t tried to access it under the right circumstances...  The Hell correspondence website will only appear to those who try to access it at the strokeof midnight, and even then, it will only appear to visitors whose hearts genuinely burn for revenge.  This is because The Hell Correspondence is not a joke.  It\u2019s not just some trend, or a petty game to alleviate minor school yard tiffs.  The business of revenge is real, and like any business, the service it offers does not come cheap.  In order to send the object of your ire screaming into the depths of hell, you\u2019ll have to sell your own soul alongside them.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, after you\u2019ve used the site, you\u2019ll hear all of this when you\u2019re paid a visit from it\u2019s contractor, not the dark lord satan himself, but a beautiful, emotionally detached young girl sporting a black middle school uniform and an untied hime hair-style.  In a voice as cold and lifeless as her eyes, the girl will introduce herself as Ai Enma, and she will offer you a straw doll with a red thread tied around it\u2019s neck.  She will explain her services, as well as the toll they will take on your immortal soul should you choose to employ them, and she will leave you with one simple choice...  Pull the string and send your tormentor straight into the depths of hell, body and soul, or deny the animalistic urge inside you and offer them your forgiveness.  many Japanese souls have become clients of Miss Enma, and only a select few of them have been able to resist the temptation.  But how about you?  Have you ever known somebody who you\u2019d sell your soul to have taken care of?  You only have one soul to lose, but always remember;  Beyond midnight\u2019s veil lies the revenge that you could not exact alone.\\n\\n\r\nOut of all the animation studios I\u2019ve covered in this blog, Studio Deen probably has the worst reputation.  I\u2019ve reviewed some shows of theirs that looked good enough, with Sankarea being the most recent example, but if there\u2019s any show they\u2019ve done that perfectly encapsulates all of the negative criticism they receive, it\u2019s Hell girl.  It\u2019s not the worst looking anime I\u2019ve ever seen, but the character movement on display here is some of the cheapest I\u2019ve ever seen.  It\u2019s embarrassingly bad, and with so many examples of off-looking animation coming to mind, you need only look at the first episode, where the first vengeance victim in the series has to watch a flashback of herself stealing money from a fellow student.  The shot of her past self entering the classroom isn\u2019t even the first questionable visual, and yet it\u2019s so jaw droppingly bad that it\u2019s easy to go into denial, claiming that there\u2019s no way the series could ever look that bad again.  \\n\\n\r\nOh, but it can, and it does so with surprisingly often.  Movements are stiff and unnatural, running and walking cycles look awkward and out of place, and characters\u2019 faces are constantly off-model, making for a show that you could almost say looks best when it\u2019s not moving, and  characters are just sitting around and talking.  I say almost, because the show\u2019s budget was clearly reserved for the show\u2019s various punishment scenes, where Ai boards a flaming chariot and affords her victim one last piece of torment before ferrying them to hell.  Hell girl rarely employs visual effects outside of these scenes, making for a night-and-day transition between the build-up and pay-off of each episode.  I should be impressed by this, as I\u2019ve praised some shows in the past for looking better at the right moment at the expense of quality elsewhere, but they definitely went over-board here.  The climax of each episode does look more or less beautiful, with cg fire, endlessly creative visual imagery, the haunting flower design on Ai\u2019s kimono, and a final parting shot of Ai rowing her victim down what I can only assume is the Japanese equivalent of the River Styx.  \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, as I\u2019ve alluded, these scenes don\u2019t make up for just how bad the rest of the show\u2019s animation looks.  The animation may be hit or miss...  Although it\u2019s really more miss than hit...  But thankfully, the art design is far more decent.  It\u2019s never quite as good as the art cards that came packaged with the original DVDs would have you believe, but it\u2019s still easy to get lost in the detailed, immersive backgrounds, and unlike the animation, this level of care doesn\u2019t just get limited to the hell-related material...  The backgrounds in Ai Enma\u2019s realm and in the torment scenes are beautiful, yes, but the lighting at various points in the day and the level of detail featured in the myriad of different settings are also surprisingly intricate.  As a side effect of the show\u2019s episodic nature, there\u2019s a diverse array of architecture that can often make the series feel more like a tour of Japan than a proper horror title.  Similarly, the character designs are just as varied, and while a select few of the people who appear in this series may be on the generic side, they\u2019re still diverse enough to distinctly stand out against the rest of the cast without ever leaving the spectrum of realistic design.\\n\\n\r\nHell Girl may not be a visual wonder, but where it truly shines is with it\u2019s use of sound.  The soundtrack is limited, and you may very quickly notice a few tracks that keep getting used over and over again, but in it\u2019s defense, I can only say this;  Don\u2019t mess with perfection.  Ai herself is characterized by the chanting of a childlike, disembodied voice, normally accompanied by string music, although there are several other tunes that tell her story.  Due of course to the episodic nature of the series, there are several tunes that get repeated as a formula each episode, from the hauntingly complacent tracks floating around in Ai\u2019s downtime to the climactic Jigoku Nagashi that closes out every individual story, but my favorite track would have to be a certain piano piece called Kakugo, which plays up the tension  whenever one of Ai\u2019s clients makes a game-changing revelation.  It\u2019s unnerving, it\u2019s probably one of the best \u201cOh shit\u201d type tunes I\u2019ve ever heard in an anime, and it has the unique ability to cut in at any point during the episode, whether it\u2019s following dead silence or cutting off another tune.  \\n\\n\r\nThe English dub is an early Funimation offering, having come out about eleven years ago, and at the risk of sounding like a broken record, the show\u2019s episodic nature has left it\u2019s mark on the cast, too.  Hell girl\u2019s dub features what can only be described as a revolving door of 2005 Funimation regulars.  Brina Palencia performs one of her earliest roles as the title character Ai Enma, and while most of her dialogue is repeated in each episode, she\u2019s still able to imbue moire and more nuance and developing emotion into what\u2019s supposed to be an emotionless character, and in some of the most uncertain moments, she can convey that the character\u2019s shell is being broken without letting her voice crack or her delivery betray her true feelings.  It takes an overwhelming level of talent to have her cake and eat it too in this way, and it\u2019s not hard to see why Brina was bumped up to Funimation\u2019s main voice acting roster following roles like this one and Beck.  Her lackeys aren\u2019t quite as dynamic, but they\u2019re distinct enough...  Jennifer Seman is knowing and perceptive, Todd Haberkorn is cocky and laid back, and R Bruce Elliot is wise and authoritative, and they all convey a deep sense of devotion and loyalty for their mistress.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve praised John Burgmeier before for being an outstanding talent behind the scenes who has more than enough voice acting chops to lend credence to his writing and direction, and Hell Girl features one of his unfortunately few starring roles.  After spending eight episodes establishing the kind of entity Hell Correspondence is, we\u2019re introduced to out-of-work reporter Hajime Shibata and his precocious daughter Tsugumi, who has a mysterious psychic connection to Ai.  John Burgmeier remains sincere throughout in his attempts to thwart Ai\u2019s delivery of vengeance, and even though we don\u2019t find out his motivations until the last few episodes, he never really comes off as preachy about it.  Luci Christian, despite turning in a cringe-worthy performance as Ai\u2019s first victim(I blame bad direction), is able to make up for it when she returns later on as Tsugumi, a little girl confused between childish idealism and an adult understanding of consequences and the cost of life.  Their presence in the story gives it the plot that it needs at exactly the right time, and these two actors could be more of a perfect selection.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the assorted revolving door of actors that pass through Hell Girl, there are very few bad performances, but quite a few standouts.  There were a lot of flaws in the first episode, but Laura Bailey was incredibly likeable as Ai\u2019s first client.  Vic Mignona melts into the role of a crooked veterinarian, and Caitlin Glass is spectacular as the duplicitous foul-mouthed actress who will do anything to anyone in order to secure her future fame and fortune.  Jerry Russel turns in a somber performance as an elderly former client of Ai\u2019s who\u2019s accepted his oncoming fate with a mix of hope and melancholy that touches even Ai\u2019s heart.  Kate Oxley and Leah Clark play a pair of twins, and since the fact that there\u2019s two of them is meant to be a spoiler, they\u2019re able to match each others voices to the point that even the most astute voice chasers wouldn\u2019t know they were different people.  Pam Dougherty and Carrie Savage play off of each other wonderfully as a cruel old woman and the poor, unfortunate soul she\u2019s taken in as an indentured servant, with the bitter paranoia of the former feeding into and off of the heartbreaking despair of the latter.  I didn\u2019t see this series in Japanese, but I did see season two that way, and I sorely missed the dub when I did, so I\u2019m going to have to recommend dub over sub.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the most consistent criticisms I\u2019ve heard about Hell Girl is that it\u2019s repetitive...  It has a formula that all episodes must follow, making it something of a monster of the week show, if you were to replace interesting monsters with people beefing with each other.  I can\u2019t in good conscience say that this assessment is entirely untrue, as the show does have a solid formula that you\u2019ll pick up on before too long...  A person is tormented by another, they ask Ai for help, Ai tells them that they\u2019ll have to sell their souls to hell in exchange for her services, the client gets cold feet, the torment kicks up a notch, they relent, and Ai gets to administer brutal psychological torture on the tormentor before maybe or maybe not giving them a chance to repent for their salvation...  Although she never really means it.  This may sound like something that might get tiresome after a while, as several anime with similarly cut-and-paste episodic plots are far too willing to rest on their laurels once they\u2019re assured that people will watch the same story over and over again...  Just look at Sailor moon and Detective Conan, thank you very much...  But there are also several anime that evolve from their formulas.\\n\\n\r\nShows like Princess Tutu and Neon Genesis Evangelion started off just as formulaic as Hell Girl, with the former following the tried and true \u2018Magical girl accomplishes task to collect a piece of something\u201d formula that it probably had to rent from Inuyasha, and the latter established itself as one of the best monster-of-the-week anime of all time before diving headfirst into pretentious bullshit.  Like those titles, Hell girl uses it\u2019s first handful of episodes wisely, fleshing out it\u2019s premise at a smart pace, not only exploring the stakes of what people will be doing to each other, but also the extent of Ai\u2019s power and the different ways that usage of the Hell Correspondence may vary.  By the time the Shibata family enters the story to fight against Ai\u2019s activities, we\u2019ve already seen that a contract with Ai can be used to punish a murderer, save one\u2019s life, and potentially also serve malicious purposes such as taking out one\u2019s rivals.  We\u2019ve also seen it established the kind of people who can and can\u2019t access her services, as a shrewd businesswoman with no real desire for revenge finds herself blocked from using it for financial gain.  The Hell Correspondence site, Ai Enma herself, and the show\u2019s truest theme, the true cost of vengeance, have all been firmly established by the time the plot gets off it\u2019s feet around episode 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot culminates in a multi-episode climax that starts off with a certified gut-punch of an episode where the Shibatas are investigating the case against a pretty young nurse, and the results of their investigation shake any faith that young Tsugumi may have had about a black and white justice system where bad people deserve to die, as well as calling into question her...  And any viewer\u2019s...  Belief that Hell girl is a benevolent force that exists to help people and to do the right thing.  Things spiral out of control from there, with Ai fighting against her curse and two very tragic backstories being revealed as the three main characters are challenged with their own pasts as well as each others\u2019, but more importantly, it doesn\u2019t answer any of the questions it raises about the nature of revenge and forgiveness.  It explores the theme from so many angles that you can\u2019t simply boil it down to either one being morally superior to the other, and that\u2019s the sign of good thematic writing.  I hate preachy shows that offer messages with definite answers, because life isn\u2019t made of definite answers...  It\u2019s made of nuance, of shades of grey, and of different perspectives offering complexity into every single choice a person can make.\\n\\n\r\nIs it okay to punish somebody if they\u2019ve wronged you, or should you accept the fact that the damage has been done and move on?  What if you know they\u2019re going to wrong you again, and you have the chance to prevent it at they\u2019re expense?  What if you refuse to do so, giving them the benefit of the doubt, but they still hurt you again?  Is it okay to get revenge on them then, even thought once again, the damage has been done?  What if a person hurts you in a way that has serious implications on your future?  What if you have to sacrifice a part of yourself to get back at someone, but it\u2019s a part of yourself you can never get back?  Isn\u2019t it possible that someone else might come along and do something worse, but you\u2019ve already cashed in your only chance to sell your soul for revenge, either literally or metaphorically?  Could you kill someone to save yourself?  To save others?  These are the questions Hell Girl asks, and while the characters facing them may find their answers, it\u2019s never made clear whether or not they\u2019re making the right choices and taking the proper actions.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, moral relativism isn\u2019t the only thing this show has going for it.  It\u2019s still entertaining, which may be the most important aspect of all.  The stories follow a repetitive formula, but it\u2019s never the same story twice, and it\u2019s really easy to get wrapped up in them.  They\u2019re all unique, a lot of them can leave you feeling emotional, and yet they\u2019re all important, offering a development to the plot or a new perspective on the theme of vengeance.  The only real exception I can think of is episode 10, Friends, which doesn\u2019t really offer anything and ends in what I have to admit is pretty stupid fashion.  Aside from that, there\u2019s no filler, and barely any fanservice.  In addition to offering a tour of the different Japanese communities and landscapes, it can also teach you a surprising amount about Japan\u2019s various social issues, from obscure topics like collective responsibility and mob mentality to more well known phenomena such as Idol worship, the shunning of outsiders to the psychology behind hikkikkomori culture.  Japan is a strange place, where being in the wrong place at the wrong time can have devastating effects on the lives and careers of not only you, but your family and friends as well, and Hell Girl offers an accessible window into how these social systems work.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I probably shouldn\u2019t go any further without mentioning the obvious downside of having an anime be about vengeance...  If there was ever an anime that deserved to have a bunch of trigger warnings attached to it, it would be this one.  Hell Girl features a wide and mercilessly thorough spectrum of terrible things that people can do to each other, and never shies away from any of it.  Throughout this 26 episode series, you\u2019ll bare witness to acts of sabotage, stalking, attempted murder, actual murder, neglect, child abuse, rape, false accusations, dehumanization, fratricide, infanticide, and no less than two mutually exclusive instances of animal cruelty.  This series is not for the faint of heart, and could easily reopen old wounds in the wrong viewer.  Another obvious issue would be the pile of inconsistencies surrounding how the Hell Correspondence works...  Sometimes people are offered a chance at salvation, sometimes they\u2019re not.  sometimes Ai approaches her client immediately, sometimes she has to investigate the circumstances first.  She almost always waits to suit up until the string\u2019s been pulled, but there are instances where she does so just to meet the client.  After a while, it starts to feel arbitrary, which is kind of a huge misstep, but it\u2019s still one hell of a show.\\n\\n\r\nHell girl is available from Funimation.  You can find the individual DVDs pretty cheap on amazon, but full collections, including the thick series box collection and even the thin SAVE pack, are out of print and can easily run over a hundred dollars online.  Two follow-up seasons, Two Mirrors and Three Vessels, are available from Sentai Filmworks, although the switch in companies led to them being released undubbed, and they\u2019re not exactly cheap either, although Two Mirrors collection 1 can be found for mere pennies.  A manga adaptation by Miyuki Eto is available stateside from Del Rey, and can be found online for relatively cheap, although it\u2019s been over five years since I read the first copy, so I can\u2019t speak as to the quality.  A short-lived live action series ran for 12 episodes starting in 2006, and three further manga adaptations have not been released stateside, nor has the handheld video game.\\n\\n\r\nI first saw Hell Girl when the first two episodes aired in Gaiaonline.com\u2019s long forgotten theater feature in 2007.  Funimation was airing a few shows there, but Hell girl was the one I became immediately addicted to.  I went out and bought the first DVD, and before long, I wound up watching it on it\u2019s own several times through.  It quickly became one of my favorite shows as I gathered up each individual disk upon release, before eventually trading it all in for the thinpack to save room on my shelf.  I can easily see someone getting frustrated with the formulaic nature of the series, but for me, it just kept getting better and better.  Of course, even through my furious rewatchings of the first DVD, even I was able to recognize the pacing issues each episode had, as they could either flesh out the client, the tormentor, or the situation, but there was never enough time for all three...  And yet, somehow, my biggest regret about this series is that with so many interesting characters, we never get to check back on any of them.  Just one episode set in hell would be enough, really.  In any case, if you\u2019re looking for a spooky anime to watch this October, this anthology of antipathetic animosity easily gets one of my first recommendations.  I give Hell girl an 8/10.",

I warn you once you start this anime it is impossible to stop. This is truly deserving of the word masterpeice. The artwork is fantastic and the voice actors have done a phenomenal job portraying a host of characters you can't help but fall in love with. This anime is a bit lengthier than most but honestly you are left feeling a bit cheated because you'll want more. The only unsatisfying thing about this anime is the ending(which isok because there are two more seasons). All the mini stories will captivate you pulling you further and further into Ai Enma's world. You'll be sure to pick a favorite substory and a favorite villain; there are PLENTY to choose from. (mine is in the second episode). Plot twist after plot twist, page turn after page turn Hell Girl will have you going up to the end. Thank goodness there are two more seasons! A must see for any anime lover or even anyone who slightly enjoys it. Please PLEASE watch this.It does NOT disappoint.",

            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo. My god, where do I begin? This anime is a phenomenal psychological anime where almost everything, at the very least in my book, is spot-on.\r\nI guess I'll start with it's choice of sound. The music never ceases to amaze me. It's so moving and filled with emotion, put into the best possible places in the anime. The music itself almost brings me to tears, I shit you not. That's how amazing it is.\r\nThe art style could be looked down at, but it's perfect for this anime. The huge, staring eyes peer directly into your soul, as if Ai is staring through your verybeing, like she does with the characters. That's amazing that the concept could fit in so well with her character.\\n\r\nThe story, for the most part, has a format. It follows the damned souls of modern-day Japan that, eventually decide to contact Ai to receive help in sending someone to Hell. But I'll be damned if that means that we don't get to know the characters. While the format is repeating, what else would you expect? That's life. It's repetitive. And that feeling you get when you've seen all these terrible people and sympathetic victims? That's what Ai sees all the time. She's seen this cycle again and again. The format adds to the characters and the overlying plot, not diminishes it. I NEVER got tired of seeing these traumatized people.\\n\r\nWhen enjoying the anime, it depends on what kind of feeling you like the anime to give you. Do you want a feel-good anime? If so, then this isn't really the anime you should be watching. This anime puts down humanity by looking into the darkest of people and other's willingness to give up themselves in order to punish someone else. And that leaves such a bittersweet taste in your mouth and yanks at your heart strings so hard that you start to hate humanity, too.\\n\r\nIf that isn't a 10/10 anime, I don't know what is.",

            "content": "This review will be about all 3 of the Hell Girl series, since despite a few small differences (for example a notable graphics improvement over time) all 3 series are pretty much similar. And by similar I mean DEPRESSING AS F\u00a3$K. The protagonists do change as well, but you could say that the protagonists actually play the sub-plot part whereas the random people appearing for one episode play the main part.\r\nThe anime's theme is about a site, which you can only access if you feel deep hatred inside your heart... In other words everyone can easily access this, and it even becomes a telephone app.(no, really, it does). This was never explained but it is assumed that each person can only use this site once. If you write the name of a person you hate on that site, you receive a Hell Doll. If you pull a string from the doll, the person whose name you wrote immediatly goes to a hell trial (supposedly you can avoid going to hell if you succeed in those trials. Throughout the series noone ever did.) which is pretty much the \"ironic punishment\" section before literally going to hell. After that, the site's user gets a tattoo, meaning he/she (usually a she) will also go to hell when they die (without their soul having a chance to go to heaven etc etc), though \"when\" they die isn't affected.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode usually stands on its own, with the main protagonist of each series working and scooping around on the background, but otherwise remaining a minor character. The real protagonist is usually the site's user of each episode. We see him getting tortured by his harsh reality (oh and I DO mean harsh), how usually it's a specific person's fault (bullying, buckets of it) and how the protagonist decides that his/her soul is not worth it if his/her life is that miserable.\\n\\n\r\nWhile in the first few episodes the anime does fool us that if your name is written on that site you're one sick psycho, as the episodes go on it starts becoming MUUUUUCH more complicated than that. People make mistakes, sometimes the people who they send to hell even protected them from worse things to come, sometimes it was just misunderstandings, sometimes it is the evil psychos who use the site and innocent people go to hell for no apparent reason. What you start believing is a mechanism for justice soon becomes muuuuch more complex and questionable. In addition the outcome isn't always what each episode's protagonist thought it would be.\\n\\n\r\nAs the series go on, you don't get used to it, it actually becomes worse. The Hell Girl herself (basicly hell's employee for commiting the \"murders\" and collecting the souls) has a phenomenally depressing backstory. Her helpers also share gruesome tails. And lastly the main protagonists... For the first season it's pretty sad. For the second season's protagonist story it is pretty darn depressing. For the third season it is \"well here is the rope, you know what to do\".  Since (when I was 13-14) I made the mistake of watching all three series in a row, I actually went through depression for 1-2 months.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, what I really liked about Hell Girl is that it actually promotes the value of human life, and therefore shows how big a dillema it is to actually kill somebody. Even better there is no fear of getting caught since the protagonists of each episode never have to actually interract with said \"to-be-missing\" person, so it's just a matter of conflicting ethics and emotions most of the time, as well as comparing the happiness your own soul MIGHT achieve one day compared to how miserable your current life is. If you want a good way to get depressed or some read food-for-thought, there you have it!",

It tries to show you haw can desperate people behave and how much do they want revenge.\r\nMain character is Enma Ai, Jigoku Shoujo. Bu she is not participating in story, other characters too (in majority of episodes). Ai has some lines which she always say and in the most of ceses, nothing more. Altought she's still very interesting charcter.\r\nIf you don't like anime where in every episode is another story, and till half of season nothing is connecting - it's not for you. But still, even with this sitiation short stories from episodes are really interesting,well thought and you can watch them with pleasure. You can also understand some characters (people) who you will see later.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDesign is nice, at least in my opinion. Enma Ai looks mysteriously and with other things they did good work too. Not masterpice, but very nice.\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly tell that it's really good anime and watching it is not wasting of time (if you survive first seven or eight episodes - real plot starts after them).",

Don't stop watching because of that though, as it picks up a gain and again.\r\nAs stated, it an excellent anime at first. The style, the sound and the plot. After a while though it doesn't evolve and quickly becomes stagnant, I almost gave up... but because of playing Diablo 3 and it being dubbed I listened.\r\nIt become an play ofhuman hatred and love, vengeance and forgiveness.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most of those can be played off as, \"who's silly enough, or petty enough to do this?\", you leave your self open to the episodes of love and regret which strike a cord.\\n\\n\r\nTo me this only happened when the true story began, which is about the the newspaper person. (I also have to admit I egged on to find out about the Hell Girl more than the other characters).\\n\\n\r\nIt all blends well together, and don't give up just because it's time consuming... if you don't normally watch dubbed, you should do this time.

Hell Girl features little to none of that. Just the occasionally skulls and blood splatters is all. \r\nSecondly, I loved this anime so much. Its interesting and keeps your brain going. There's always a twist no one expected right around the corner. I have re-watched it about 4 times. Once I even watched it in reverse order....(don't ask....) \r\nIn the first 12 episodes or so nothing is really given except that Hell Link is a website of whichanyone can access at midnight to enter in the name of their abuser for Ai Enma (Hell Girl) to come in contact with the person and propose a contract. But undoubtedly, each episode which contains a new persons story is always entertaining and interesting. After you get past those beginning episodes, new characters appear that add on to the story that is figuring out who this \"Hell Girl\" really is. You then begin to learn the story of Ai and the others of whom help her with the Hell Link. \\n\\n\r\nALL IN ALL~\\n\\n\r\nFUNimation did an excellent dubbing of it.\\n\r\nThe Animation and art is beautiful. \\n\r\nThe story line isn't plain or meaningless. \\n\r\nI recommend this to anyone who loves surprises and twists in an anime. \\n\r\nIt is also for the more paranormal kind of people. \\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this to anyone who is okay with an anime not being happy go lucky moe kawaii desu ne.",

Will they pull the red thread?\r\nIf you are expecting to know immediately why Enma Ai is Jigoku Shoujo then this anime takes patience. In the middle of the season, there will be recurring characters or second protagonists, that's when things will start getting interesting. So I suggest that you watch maybe one or twoepisodes per day until the end because Enma Ai's backstory is really worth watching for. It will all fit together like puzzle pieces.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the series, many of the people being sent to hell are terrible people who cause torture and suffering to others so it can be formulaic. There are even petty/trivial reasons and could probably be resolved if they had not been so blinded by their hatred and thirst for vengeance. \\n\\n\r\nBut as the series progresses, it gets seemingly almost impossible to escape such a situation that their only exit is to pull the thread.. then later, it shows how grievance is subjective and there are misunderstood situations like good people who don't deserve to be sent to hell and they get sent anyway because the person who pulled it was willing to sell their soul for it. It now makes you see how it can be such a hard job for Enma Ai and how the system can be unjust. \\n\\n\r\nThis series really makes you see the philosophy behind vengeance too.. like how it can be futile and not everything is black and white. The karmic fate of humanity. \\n\\n\r\nOutstanding animation, great characters, and it's overall a very good anime. \\n\\n",

These people are twisted, conniving, sick and downright evil so no wonder the Hell Girl is popular. Oh and the men have got nothing on the women when it comes to evil, I mean damn!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, art and sound are winners here, but unfortunately it falls short because of its predictable format and lack of 'flow'. \\n\\n\r\nI will still watch the 2nd and 3rd series, because I'm hoping that all of the mundane stuff should now be out of the way, so bring on the good stuff!

Anyway while this is going on a \"reporter\" seeks to stop it. In all the story is very unique and very tragic. Depending which episode  almost anyone can relate. my one problem which was only small, was that some small things like someones dog dying and a girl sending a soul to hell for it, along with her own soul. Imean I love the story but it is nonsense no one in their right mind would do this. I did like the fact they used real like examples of people out for vengeance.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI loved the art! it could be creepy, sad, and happy all at once. It stood out a lout and it was just plain out amazing. I do however wonder why the decided to draw a school girl dress on Ai through out every episode. She didn't really go to a school. It is just small, but overall the art was amazing. Some things I wished had more variety than drawing the same thing over and over, however like I said it was still a great style of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNow just the same as the Art, but I find the music fit perfect in every episode. I loved the music when a creepy, happy, sad, or just every scene when it played. It stood out to me a lot. I especially loved the i intro and ending. So that was a big plus. I can't say much for sound or art but I said what I think so it is good enough.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nEvery character that continued to show during the series had some kind of character development. I do think that the development could have been better for some. the build up was wasted at the end I find. I may be saying this because certain characters don't continue on to season 2, but I really thought that the ending would have more impact considering all the build up. I still liked all characters though. All the supporting characters too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWell what can I say? I found almost everything perfect. I realize my score is a little rough but I have my reasons. I still really enjoyed watching, I can still remember watching the first episode and feeling so exited to have found such a wonderful anime. This will always be one of my favorites and so will the next couple of seasons too I hope.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nWell, why are you still reading this? Get on to the anime! This anime was nearly PERFECT. I believe everyone should give Jigoku Shoujo a try.",

The story mainly, a website where you type in the person you want to send to hell however you must make a contract with Jigoku Shoujo for when you die, your soul will be sent to hell. And to access this site, you need to be serious about exacting your revenge. It starts off with serious problems then into small ones. Like during the visit to the hospital and the nurse being killed for no reason. It shows that you just need hatred for that person and Jigoku Shoujo will grant your wish if you want it notmatter if it's just pointless. Then a journalist tracks her down along with his daughter whose connected to her which you find out why at the end. The daughter seems to believe Jigoku Shoujo is righteous and soon learns that is not the case. That even the most kindest and innocent person will die by Jigoku Shoujo if someone wanted that said person dead. The anime overall was great and worth watching. I don't recommend watching it all in one day for it does get repetitive so take a 10 minute break from episode to episode at least.",

Each episode is shown why  Ai got summoned by that certain person, some of the stories are really tragic and heartbreaking, it can make you cry.

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE*\r\nThis is a spoiler free review of Jigoku Shoujo, Hell Girl. Having watched this series, I've decided to review it. It's my first review and it's purely my personal opinion, so please forgive me if there's anything you don't like.\r\n-Premise- 10/10\r\nThe general concept of Hell Girl is that there's a communication medium known as Hell Link, and one can use it to avenge against a person you have a grudge on. I find this concept unique and to my knowledge no other anime series has it. This is a perfect setting a horror anime and is just what makes Hell Girl...well Hell Girl.\r\n-Story- 8/10\r\nAtypical episode: a person has a grudge, and then uses Hell Link, then Hell Girl comes into action...you get the idea. It sounds repetitive on paper, considering you have the same framework/skeleton backbone for 26 episodes. However, each episode feels fresh as there is a new character and storyline involved. But there just might be some backstories that will unfold overtime and twists...I won't go into there. Overall, I enjoyed the stories.\\n\\n\r\n-Art- 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is decent, considering this is a relatively old anime. It doesn't stand out much though and it isn't always that colorful. I do particularly like Hell Girl's Kimono's colors and floral design though XD\\n\\n\r\n-Soundtrack- 7/10\\n\r\nMusic and sound are not too bad: the background music fits in well with the atmosphere, especially the one playing when Hell Girl ferries someone to hell. I just don't find the opening and ending themes fitting for a HORROR anime...they sound too happy.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters- 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is amazing in this series: I can feel their mental struggles, despair, hopelessness...only to resort to using Hell Link. The recurring cast each have unique personalities that all go very well together. For instance, Hell Girl has no emotion whatsoever but once you watch the series you will understand what made her that way.\\n\\n\r\n-Overall- 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Hell Girl and wholeheartedly recommend it to any horror anime fans. It is just so satisfying seeing people being banished to hell when they deserve it. \\n\\n\r\nHope you've found this review helpful, or I won't be afraid to use Hell Link...",

            "content": "Do you hate someone to the point that you would like to literally send them to Hell - even at the cost of your own soul?\r\nStory: 6\r\nEach episode centers on one person's suffering and its relation with its tormentor; from there it falls into a modular routine: they contact Hell Girl, she gives them a straw doll with a red string, and warn them that if they pull the string, when they die they'll go to hell too...\r\nWhile the diverse contracts are episodic in nature and have mostly (but not always) predictable outcomes, many of them are connected by a freelancer reporter's quest to findout more about, and foil, Hell Girl's activities - and if it weren't for him and his psychic daughter, the show would grow old after just a few episodes. Still, it's only in the latter half of the series that this arch begins to gain momentum and importance.\\n\r\nWhile mostly predictable, this doesn't mean every episode will end the same way: sometimes there is a plot twist or a change of heart, or even some ironical poetic justice to throw the viewer off-balance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nIts crisp art, vibrant colors, detailed settings and amazing character design make for some brilliant artwork, but the slow paced animation and excessive repeated use of the Hell Girl-related scenes detract the art score from the full 10 I would give otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nEven if the ambiance sounds and voice acting are all first rate and the ED is a beautifully mellow ballad, the OP is somewhat standard, if catchy. The Western/Japanese background orchestrations are very ambientic, and are used repeatedly throughout the series as plot point and character Leitmotifs to great effect.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nWhile Ai Enma, her helpers and the grandma are present in every episode, very little about them is explored until the latter half of the series; this is also true of the reporter Hajime Shibata and his daughter Tsurugi.\\n\r\nThis is because they aren't the the main focus until later; the show's real stars are the clients and their disaffects, and most of each episode is dedicated to knowing them, their relation and their grievances.\\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the clients are teenagers or even younger, and their grievances are too often caused by not knowing how to handle the situations; this leads to both victim and tormentor idiotically going to hell for what a maturer person could easily solve simply by telling the other to f**k off, or calling the police. While this could be a point against the series, in my opinion it makes perfect sense: after all, it is not rare that teenagers end up killing themselves precisely out of such immaturity-driven angst; they'd make precisely the main target for the \"service\" provided by Hell Girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/9\\n\r\nAs stated above, The series' early episodes are slow paced, modular and mostly predictable; however, it improves tremendously once the Shibatas start gaining importance and the plot unfolds.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7",

            "content": "Lets begin with saying that I really like this anime. Although it\u2019s an old one (it could be started in 2005 and ended in 2006, but it could also have been from 2006 to 2007. The web is not clear on that) it still holds up today. \r\nThe story is about Enma Ai, but she is better known as Jigoku Shoujo, which means girl from hell. But saying that the story is about her, is not true. Every episode focuses on other characters. These people have been wronged in life, and seek revenge \r\nTo get their revenge, they go to a site (that weirdly enoughhas the same name as the nickname of the protagonist) while its 0:00 hour, to request the death of the one that wronged them, and for them to be dragged to hell by Enma. \\n\\n\r\nBut there is a steep price for wanting the revenge. When the person who asked for the murder dies, he/she will not go to heaven when they die, but will also end up in hell\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of this anime is the struggle the characters go trough. You see that the characters have trouble deciding if they actually want these people murdered (they souls will also go to hell, after all) I had moments that I had tears in my eyes while watching those people get wronged. And I had moments of pure joy when the people who wronged them got carried to hell.\\n\\n\r\nThe building up to the moment when someone decides if they really want revenge is also done beautifully. You get why they want revenge, you feel happy for them that they get that said revenge, and at the same time you feel sorry, knowing that they will also end up in hell\\n\\n\r\nThere are however also some things that aren\u2019t that good with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nLets begin with the reason that I decided to watch this anime. I wanted a good horror anime, and I expected to have a lot of horror, and some action here and there. This is not what you get from the show. Don\u2019t let the premise of people being dragged to hell fool you that this is an anime with lots of horror. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying that the lack of horror is a bad thing. I mean, I just said that I think that this is an great anime that knows how to hit your emotions. Its just something totally different than true horror anime. It has scary moments, yes, but not enough and not as scary enough to be called an horror anime\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that isn\u2019t that good about the anime, is sometimes the moments on when the show tries to make you feel something. What I mean with this, is that sometimes its to obvious that you should feel sorry or that you should cry, while these moments aren\u2019t that moving. This, however, rarely happens, and isn\u2019t that big of an issue\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to note: if you want funny shows, then don\u2019t watch this. If you want a lot of action, don\u2019t watch this. If you want horror, don\u2019t watch this. What I\u2019m trying to say is that this show is definitely not for everybody. This is a \u2018\u2019feel\u2019\u2019 show, and if you don\u2019t like crying or sudden shift of moods, then don\u2019t watch this anime\\n\\n\r\nFor the people who like \u2018\u2019feel\u2019\u2019 shows, like to cry to movies, can appreciate good characters and story, and doesn\u2019t mind the lack of action/horror or funny moments, watch this anime. Its for you\\n",

And the main characters niche is... wait for it... to go against the modus operandi of the show (and I mean it almost literally). \r\n   Each story lasts exactly one episode, with the main character's overreaching plot throughout.\r\n   Warning: this series is sufficiently dark, tragic, and depressing, ifthat's not your cup of tea, then I recommend not watching it.

            "content": "\"Before you embark on a journey of revenge prepare two graves first\" - Confucius\r\nMeaning you will suffer just as much as the person you are taking revenge on. This is the premise of the anime and the contract you take out with Hell Girl before she exacts your revenge.\r\nHell Girl is Enma Ai, girl who lives in a twilight world leaving only when called upon to exact someone's revenge. She is not evil and she does not judge the reasons for revenge, she just provides a service.\r\nThe first half of the series follows the same formula before introducing Hijame and his daughter Tsugumi. Hijame isa journalist who blackmails celebrities and the word's worst father, so much so that his daughter doesn't call him Dad. Tsugumi has a connection with Hell Girl after a chance meeting.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series follows Hijame in trying to stop Hell Girl by using Tsugumi's visions to obsessionly find who called Hell Girl and try and persuade them not to take out revenge leading to a dramatic finale with Enma Ai where we find out her story.\\n\\n\r\nThe main criticism Hell Girl gets is that it is repetitive. I think this is unfair as it is a bit like saying CSI is repetitive as it solves murders using science every time. I would say the series is a little long. Maybe 20 episodes would have been better. To get the most out of watching Hell Girl you really need to take each episode as a different story and not expect a story to develop through the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe each story of revenge is well thought out where none of the characters are 2 dimensional even though most of them appear in only one episode. The main characters are well developed and it is interesting watching Tsugumi learn about revenge and its morality.\\n\\n\r\nThe art work is excellent although I wouldn't say original.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening song by SnOW is excellent and the end song is haunting allowing you reflect on what you have just seen and whether the person sent to hell deserved it (not always).\\n\\n\r\nIn short I really liked Hell Girl and is one of the best anime I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't know who Confucius is I would find out more on the internet.",

            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo was one of the very first episodic series I\u2019ve ever seen and it was the first time that I realized how magnificent episodic series are. For the first time, I realized that not having a concrete main plot is not bad at all. Instead, it is a lot more exciting and anticipating. \r\nThere\u2019s a very long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nAlmost all types of genres are present. Horror, mystery, supernatural, drama, psychological and there\u2019s even a little bit of romance and comedy in some of chapters. This is the ultimate revenge based-type of story I\u2019ve ever seen. It is just so frustrating and verymuch irritating when we see this different type of bad people. So it is also just so sweet and exciting that we get to see them being punish in such ways. Plus, it is episodic, so we get to see many different exciting stories. And because of that, every new story comes with so much excitement and anticipation. I just love how different stories are expressed. Every each of them starts from detailing why the characters have grudges and how they are push to the limit and ended up relying to Jigoku Shoujo. It is quite amazing how modern the supernatural things nowadays. Be it by phone, videos, and internet; they are gradually entering the world of gadgets and modernization. Setting aside the extremely exciting revenge of the different characters, I strongly believe that more than the sweet revenge, it also tackles the consequences that come with such actions. At the end of the day, just like there are consequences in doing good things to others, there are also consequences in doing harmful things to others regardless whether the reason are right or wrong. Like they said, everything that we do in our lives always comes with consequences. I think that\u2019s why Enma Ai would let the ones requesting know the price that comes in making the contract. To be honest, it sucks a little bit. You get so irritated by those types of characters but at the end the ones requesting it also have to pay the price. I don\u2019t think that the series is about whether Jigoku Shoujo\u2019s actions are right or wrong. I strongly believe that the series whole point is WHY people are push to the limit and force to rely with Jigoku Shoujo. In a way, no matter how you justify it or be against on it, for them she is definitely helping them. And like what Enma Ai would always say that it is for them to decide whether to pull the string or not. And more importantly, it is also about forgiveness which is one of the hardest things for human beings to do. Lastly, regardless of all the hypocrisy and righteousness, it still definitely feels great when we see them get punish which I think one of the strongest edge of this series from others.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nBecause it is episodic, there are very few recurring characters. In fact, literally the main characters are the only ones who are always shown. If there is recurring characters aside from the main leads, I guess there are two or three who plays very important roles in the story. Most characters that are the focus of the revenge are no doubt made extremely irritating which make it more exciting that they get to be punished. But that\u2019s not the case all the time. It is not always about the bad guys getting punished and happy ending for the good guys who asked for the revenge. Actually, there are some twist to it which makes the series a lot more exciting and interesting. There are even instances that it is the other way around which I think why Jigoku Shoujo\u2019s actions are question if it\u2019s really right or wrong. The main characters are just a bundle of too much mysteriousness. Because there is no specific plot, we really can\u2019t figure out who they are. I admire Hajime\u2019s determination to stop people from pulling the string and with all his self-righteousness. Though, I pity him because he would always fail. Unfortunately, life is not as simple as what is right or wrong. It\u2019s a lot complicated than that most especially when the human emotions are the ones involve. It\u2019s not as black and white as a lot of people would consider it. There\u2019s always gray matter for all things in life.\\n\\n\r\nAbout JIGOKU SHOUJO (ENMA AI)\\n\r\nAnd the most enigmatic of all is of course, the protagonist with the titular alias as the hell girl (jigoku shoujo). It is no doubt that she has this very mysterious aura that really makes her scary but for some reasons she\u2019s not creepy at all. It\u2019s like she\u2019s in between being scary and being charming at the same time. Plus, she\u2019s very gorgeous as well. Her very calm gestures and poker face expressions makes her even more beautiful. In fact, she\u2019s one of the top 5 best characters in my list of best female characters. Her very enigmatic character makes her even more likeable. Among the very few anti-heroine characters out there, my number one favorite is Enma Ai. She\u2019s even in my top 10 out of 50 in my best characters.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUNDS\\n\r\nI like how their version of hell is illustrated; it\u2019s quite different from your typical representation of hell. For something as an image of hell, it is very beautiful. There are even flowers, streams, trees, and even mountains. Though, I am not sure if it is hell or purgatory or just the dimension where Enma Ai and her companions reside. But for a place which is no doubt not a paradise or the opposite of paradise, it is still very beautiful. I think the sounds are very appropriate with the theme of the series. It gives a whole package to the greatness of the series most especially Enma Ai\u2019s character song.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve never seen a series which literally packages most of my favorite genres. And every elements of it are made so magnificently that the result is one brilliant series. This is one of the very few series that you would want to continue even after realizing that it is already the last episode. \\n",

            "content": "Few, I'm finally done with the series! What I'm about to write will be a bit spoilerish so be wary.\r\nAs you know, the main story is about a girl who takes bad guys to hell after they were cursed by the victim. \r\nThe main idea is fighting the morals: is it right to curse/kill bad people or no? Almost like Death Note.\r\nThe problem is that series don't really explore it that well since every episode things end up the same way. The bad guy never admits the fault what is a bit refreshing though I really believe that there should be some exceptions.\r\nVictims are readyto send people to Hell almost for everything and without even trying to do anything themselves about it! A lot of cases could be avoided if the victims actually tried something! There was one exception where the girl seemed to change her mind though when she saw a computer, the old idea of vengeance instantly came back. Every single person had pulled the string, is humanity really that dumb and ready to suffer for eternity just to make up for one bad moment?\\n\\n\r\nThis whole set up was cool for the first like 8 episode but then it just got too repetitive.\\n\r\nAngel Beats suffered because of lack of the episodes while Jigoku Shoujo suffers because of having too many of them. The whole series could easily fit into 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing started to change somewhere in the middle when journalist got involved. But even after that the interest got lost fast because despite his involvement thing still stayed the same. If anything, he actually was an eye sore in most cases. The moment he pissed me the most was in the episode with that inheritance obsessed woman who killed everyone in her way.\\n\\n\r\nHe didn't help at all, if anything he caused more problems. How do you expect to stop someone from cursing when you do nothing to help and just watch from the distance and sneak around the house which is very suspicious? What kind of idiot tries to stop someone when they already have their hands on a string? Why not talk and try to actually help sooner than that?! And by help I mean to actually help instead of saying \"It is bad, don't do it\". You are not helping one bit!\\n\\n\r\nThe real fun only began at around episode 22 when we finally saw a different side to Enma and found out just who exactly is she.\\n\\n\r\nThis show really suffered from the pacing and because of that I can only give it 7 because I really was getting bored in the middle.\\n\\n\r\nIf the show was around 13 episodes, it would get a straight 9 from me because I was that excited when I began to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nWell I heard that season 2 is better so I will definitively check it out and hopefully I'll be able to give it 9 this time :)\\n",

            "content": "This anime discovers on people's lives. I actually loved how they tackled on the moral of being hurt and bullied by other people. Enma Ai is a very mysterious girl with a tragic past. I won't go into detail with that.\r\nI also love how this anime tackles on people's tolerance to other people's bad attitudes. It is very hard to be understanding, loving and forgiving to others because nowadays people use violence to threaten others to obey their will. What people should learn is that we make mistakes and we learn from them. It really hurts a lot to make a person suffer. The animealso tells about how rotten society could be in this world. \\n\\n\r\nWhen people couldn't control their anger towards someone who offended them, they will released their anger by screaming or making that person suffer or even call Ai to send them to hell.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, Enma Ai can be very scary and stoic at the same time. I like some stoic characters like Homura (Madoka Magica), Wilhelmina (Shakugan no Shana), Setsuna (Shattered Angels) including the one I mentioned. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was all right nothing spectacular. The art and animation was well done. They show nice boat scene where Ai sends the person to hell but the entrance door resembles like the Japan Wall. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime also says that anger really couldn't be controlled easily. This is also a good lesson to learn that we must learn how to control out anger and forgive people otherwise anger will really control us and destroy our lives. People may sometimes change for the better, we wouldn't know. So I give it a 8/10 because this anime is a great learning experience on anger management.",

            "content": "I've decided to write this review because, after reading the opinions of other people, here and in other websites, I've found that a lot of people seem to either be under a few misconceptions about this series, or simply have been looking at it at the wrong angle. What I will say here is meant to be about this season specifically, and it's in no way a representation of the whole work.\r\n So, to start from the beginning, what is the misconception that people seem to fall for when watching this show? Well, it's a kind of hard one to explain. Mainly, they seemto take this story as an story and not a thesis. \\n\r\n Most people would call it episodic, but, even though the term technically applies here, this series isn't meant to be episodic, it's simply a result of it's nature.  And what is this nature? A series of situation-examples to test out a theory, a thesis, on morality. \\n\r\n When someone creates an idea on morality, one of the ways to test it is by challenging that idea through various situations and see their logical outcome. The more you agree with the end result, the more sound your idea is, and the less you do, the chance of it being simply wrong increases.\\n\r\n Jigoku Shoujo presents us with a set up: A person can take revenge and kill other for any perceived, on the victims perspective, damaged the other might have caused. To facilitate things, we can simply ignore laws and physical limitations by making this process supernatural, and thus focus only on it's moral aspects. And, before can test it out, we must address a logical result of it: the inevitable impact on the victim's life. You see, killing someone creates quite the burden in your life, and that burden is represented as the promise of spending eternity in hell. Secondly, another thing must be clarified: we aren't dealing with self defense. All acts thought here must be done as revenge, as answer to an aggression carried out and finished. Thus, for the victim to kill their wrongdoer, there is a three-step system: have the grievance, contact Jigoku Shoujo, and then untie the thread. In short, this isn't a gun you're firing on spot, this is a planned out act.\\n\r\n With this set up, the show starts a series of episodes to test it out in various scenarios. However, the show doesn't give you any answers, that much is up to you and you alone. And here is why most people miss the point of the show. They're expecting an ordinary story, that will answer them, that will shift and head somewhere, but this isn't no ordinary story, it's a thesis about revenge, and you just got invited to watch the testing.\\n\r\n It's only after several episodes that two other characters come and show us two other theories on the same subject, creating a ideological battle among the main cast. And, to differ even more from your common storytelling, the show doesn't give you a conclusion on this battle. The characters, of course, receive their endings and reach their own conclusions, but these are only satisfactory to their own personal point of views. You, as a third party, is left hanging. And that is part of the brilliance of the show, because the author never wanted to give a definitive answer on this matter. They left it up to you. You should draw your own conclusions. After all, if at the very end, the author was to step in and give their own personal views, the whole point of the series would vanish.\\n\\n\r\n Now, of course, there is a story being followed here. An ordinary one. However, this plays as a secondary arc to the show. The story itself is simply a progression to justify what is going on, while making you care about the characters and plot, and not sleep through it all. But, judging the show based on this story is, at least, wrong. \\n\r\n Given it's a 2005 show, the animation has aged quite a lot, but the shot composition and directing are still on spot. The pacing of the show is good for what it wants to achieve, giving you enough time to chew on the information you're given and letting enough room for you to think and rethink your opinions as you watch it.\\n\r\n In the end, Jigoku Shoujo is one of a kind. Definitely not a watch for everyone, but surely interesting, engaging and thought provoking to those who can enjoy such a show.",

            "content": "I will tell you what I think after watching the three seasons of this anime, after 26 ep each. That's a lot? Probably so. Is it worth the time? I think it's worth it. What? Without enthusiasm? No, I will not say to you: \"Wow, what a mega was cut into the cosmos! Die if you did not see! Yolo! MMA! USA!...\" No. Was well. Moments even very well. But it was not outstanding. Why? I will try to summarize ... Generally all three seasons were presented according to a certain pattern. I'm already translating. First: As anyone mentioned here, each episode contains some indispensableelements that repeat almost like a mantra. Presentation of the situation. Use the services of our young antagonist and her team. Sending to hell in the accompaniment of the same mantra spoken by our (anti) heroine (some viewers get bored). Second: The story. In addition to the epic plot (the story begins and ends in the same episode and not everyone is behind it), we have in every episode at the beginning and at the end a gentle pull of the main plot of the season, always associated with Enma Ai itself and Hellfire Correspondence (theme from Dr House). Third: The first 19 episodes of each season are episodic with a gentle push of the main storyline. WHERE Episode 20 from 26 is a masterpiece driving into the chair. Because we get a sense of the condensed dose of a solid, action-packed, heavy storyline with a mix of extreme emotions whose culmination we find at the climax of the 26th episode of each season. In the first season it will be a motive for a journalist exploring the mysterious disappearances of the city's inhabitants. In the second, the motive of the detective attempting to do the same as mentioned above. And in the third season, we get the story of a heroine with a very unusual destiny (which is without spoilers ^^). All this consists of one coherent picture of the fate of a city rolled over many years by hatred and revenge in the hearts of every citizen. Somewhere along the way, we will also learn about the arch-sad story of Ai and each of her companions. Overall, the anime is really good. Impeccable animation, very atmospheric (dark) music, very interesting and engaging story of side characters, neatly combining previous stories with current events (events of the season will be reflected even after many years in season 3), the story of the main characters that fall into memory and They give the audience a whole range of emotions (which I expected from the series). Not extending: Anime definitely worth recommending and sacrificing for it these 29 hours (total). I especially recommend for fans some darker climates who find pleasure in the plot full of unreason, speculation, mysticism and very sad history of people from different time periods. My rating is 8.5 / 10 (second season is much weaker than others). Regards.\\n\r\nPS.: I apologize in advance for my english.",

            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo is one of those animes that you really have to be mature enough to appreciate fully. I watched it when I was younger and enjoyed it but having watched again years later I appreciate it even more for how it analyzes very dark topics, most notably the idea of revenge and the price one pays for it. Is Jigoku Shoujo a great anime? No but it most certainly is a very good one that is head and shoulders above anime that may be more popular.\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe good news about most of theseries is that its episodic so you can watch most episodes out of order and not miss much. The bad news about this series is that its episodic so if you grew up hating \"monster of the week\" series then you might not enjoy Jigoku Shoujo for its stories. That being said even if you don't like the episodic format I highly recommend you watch the show in small doses at least because a number of the stories in this season are very clever and leave you with some troubling thoughts. Although for most of the stories there are fairly obvious villains tormenting poor little girls (yes most of the time it is little girls) there are also a number of episodes where the villain isnt that clear or there is no villain or where in the end the victim gets punished by the villain. In fact some of the best episodes in this season feature last second twists that make you question how worth it vengeance can be sometimes (the answer is very much worth it in some cases). Season 1 also subtly builds up to a confrontation between Ai and Hajime, one a vengeful spirit, and the other a man seeking to convince people that what Ai is doing is just wrong. The fact that we get to see Ai's origin story unfold in the last 3 episodes of the season are also very rewarding.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nWhile the art and animation in Jigoku Shoujo is completely fine it probably wont win any awards for artistic design. There are a few nice shots of beautiful scenery and the artists deserve credit for coming up with pretty unique looking new character designs for each episode, the art of this series is good but not great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nWhile the voice acting in this series is generally very good (impressive given the need for different voice actors each week for the non-leading roles), the soundtrack is hit or miss in season 1 (if memory serves they did a better job with the sound in later seasons). First of all the opening and closing songs really do not fit in with the tone of the series (yeah how often does that happen in anime *sarcasm*). At the same time though the soundtrack picks up during certain parts of each episode...especially the music that plays when Ai is summoned following a string being pulled off a doll and the music that plays right as Ai is about to condemn someone to hell. There are unfortunately a few parts where a musical cue or change in the soundtrack could have made a shocking moment even more impactful but these opportunities are occasionally missed...not often but often enough for me to notice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nThe writers deserve a lot of credit for coming up with both interesting lead characters and mostly interesting weekly episodic characters. Enma Ai herself is deeply complex. She is a vengeful spirit forced to ferry people to hell based on the desire for vengeance held by other people but at the same time she herself is forbidden for acting on her own desires for vengeance and she must take people to hell regardless of if they deserve it or not. One particularly tear jerking scene near the end of the season has Ai taking a clearly good and innocent young woman to hell as she pleads for Ai to stop. We get to see just how complex Ai is at the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSadly Ai's assistants are not that complex in season 1 but this is rectified in season 2 so it doesn't hurt the series too much. Also interesting are Hajime and Tsugumi. Though individually the two sometimes get in the way of the weekly drama (sometimes on purpose) together they have a very thought provoking debate about what Ai is doing and whether vengeance can sometimes be justified or not. Also Tsugumi is sometimes quite adorable in how she acts despite being a little girl.\\n\\n\r\nFinally lets not forget the episodic characters. In Season 1 most characters outside the main cast never show up for more than one episode. This means that every week the writers have to come up with new and interesting characters (including villains) for a new and interesting story. For the most part they succeed in this. While a few episodic characters are basically stereotypes (see bratty schoolgirl bully in episode 1) most of them are quite interesting and some of them are actually amazing (if you like dogs there are one or two episodes where you yourself might feel actual feelings of hatred towards an anime villain). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nMaybe I am a bit messed up for saying this but overall I enjoyed Jigoku Shoujo even more than other anime including some that are objectively better than it. The episodic nature means you can come back and watch just your favorite stories if you want without missing much in the way of an overarching story (there is one but it doesn't really reveal itself in full until the last 3 episodes). If you like watching character's struggle with difficult questions then you should enjoy this series. If you are looking for something lighthearted or action packed this is not the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nWhile Jigoku Shoujo certainly has its faults, they are but cracks in a remarkably engaging and thought provoking facade. As a series I am happy to see it get so much attention in terms of 4 seasons and an honest to God live action adaptation. Jigoku Shoujo is one of those shows that proves anime isn't just for kids and you can also make mature anime without resorting to language, super violence, or sexual content...so won't you try dying this once?\\n\\n",

That pipsqueak acts so pretentiously as if she's absolute right to do anything to anyone as she pleases and to judge or set moral standards. She's blatantly domineering, and sadistic.

At midnight just look go online and look for the hell correspondence and enter the name of the person you hate most. Then hell correspondence will immediately come and sweep them off to hell...there is a price of course. You will be entitled to live out the rest of you mortal life...though when your time comes you too must join us here in the fiery underworld!\r\nSounds like an interesting story doesn't it? Something a bit new, a bit different, a bit edgy? Well it is!The first time, the second time...maybe even the third time. Though the fourth time? Fifth time? Sixth time? Yes I'm sure you can pick up what the problem with this anime is...it's repetitive!\\n\\n\r\nHere we have a gem of an anime! And I really mean that! It's something new, has an interesting story, a character we want to learn more about, and even more characters come along and move the plot along. There are episodes that also add more depth to the whole situation. Why Ai is forced to ferry people to hell. How people had access to hell correspondence before the time of the internet. How Ai is forced to ferry people to hell weather they are good or bad. You don't have to be evil for Ai to drag you off to hell, once your name is entered that's it! There is also a man, who's daughter has some kind of connection to Ai, so he begins to investigate the hell correspondence while he and his daughter's lives are taken over by the whole thing.   \\n\\n\r\nThat right there is an amazing series! That right there is a 12 episode anime that is strong from beginning to end! And keeps you invested the whole way through! ....but...that's not the anime we have....no we have a 26 episode anime....filled with repetition.\\n\\n\r\nFirst we see Ai dragging people of too hell, but after episode 3 we keep seeing it over and over again! Then we see the man investigating Ai, and here I was getting excited! \"Okay\" I would say to myself \"Here must be where the action starts!\" well again it is interesting to see the man investigate what Ai is doing, but it gets a bit old after seeing him do the same thing for ten episodes. And here we do see the kind person who gets dragged to hell. He also comes across an artist who is obsessed with Ai. Though again these good episodes become few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nThen we come to the end, the part that just about kills me. The back story for Ai, and no I won't spoil anything don't worry! But here we have this character we have been building up for a good 20+ episodes! A mysterious character who drags people to hell, against both hers and the other's wills. So what is the best way to handle this person's back story?....why cram it into the last three or four episodes and hastily run through it of course! O and do a complete personality flip on her as well too! ...um hello? \\n\\n\r\nOh and Ai's helpers? who were they? who knows? Why were they there? Why are they helping Ai drag people to hell as well?....well why should we care? The creators sure as hell didn't!\\n\\n\r\nHell Girl is just one of those animes that frustrates me! Like Sacred Blacksmith or Kashi Mashi, here you have so much to do an interesting story! Here even more so then the other two because you have something totally new and engaging! And so much that just adds layers of complexity to this story! And this really wouldn't of taken much to make this one of those stand out anime classics like Death Note! Keep the interesting episodes, make it a 12 episode series, and add a bit more depth to the characters, rather then just having them take up space, and there you go! An anime worth anyone's time!\\n\\n\r\nWell I have not seen season 2 or 3 just yet, so maybe they are a bit of an improvement, though given the circumstances here I'm tending to doubt it. Don't even waste your time on the manga! As for this, if you seem interested then I recommend this to those who can sit through the repetitive bore just for the tiny glimmers that shine through. Though it might not hurt just to give this one a pass.\\n\\n",

What draws people to the story is about a cute emo little girl who does crazy sh** in the most dramatic kind of way possible. Normally we would think, \"Wow, who could imagine things like that?!\". But then again, to answer that question, each one of us. We have someone we hate and want them dead right? This anime shows the true essence of human hatred (for normal people) and as we try toconnect with the story itself. Truly, an anime worth watching for us to understand that not everything is free.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\\n\r\nMeh, I give it that because the story is a bit *ahem* repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nStandard animation like any other 26 episode anime.

Maybe when you get to the point of focusing on the story you kinda forget about minor things like the pebble draw over there or the sound of raindrops. I only like her saying \"Ippen, shinde miru?\" kinda cute, but it's also for you to find out. :P\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nI give the main lead a 10 the rest around 7-6. Meh, the author gave to much personality to the cute emo girl that the rest just looks like straw dolls! *Rage* Seriously, that's what they get for trying to do single-minded one shots.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nIt was good but sad to say I can rate it as a generic type of anime because of too much repetition that it saps the excitement away and geez (predictable), trying to make up at the end by adding *beep beep beep*. You'll know what I mean after finishing the season and the next etc.\\n\\n\r\n7.5 = 8\\n\r\nOverall, what I can say is if you part of the anime community this anime is a definite material on your watch log. Not because it's that damn good but because you'll be left out if people talk to you about it and you just like \"What the hell you talking about man?!\" Haha. Well, that sums it up, but please do enjoy the anime and it's rich mix of cutness and sense of dark aura.",

            "content": "Well, to summarize many of the other reviews, strictly as an anime, Jigoku Shoujo is pretty good. It's true that the art and sound are both are actually exceptional. Even the characters that are introduced are more often than not interesting. But the big problem with Jigoku Shoujo is one that is most often cited... and it's a BIG problem... there is absolutely no progression or variety in the story.\r\nSo, let's take a break here and I'll admit something: I haven't gotten through more than half a dozen episodes. I just... I just couldn't! Life was wasting while I sat through 20-something minutes of theexact same thing over and over (and over and over) again. To be fair, though, I will finish it and update this review if somehow it changes (which it seems does happen right at the very end).\\n\\n\r\nThe truth of the problem with Jigoku Shoujo is that the repetition is outright lazy. I'm all for episodic shows, and I typically find them to have a greater rewatch value than ones with continuing story lines. But the reason for that is that with each episode you get a new story altogether, and in many of the episodes you get more insight to the common character(s). That's not the case with Jigoku Shoujo. With this show, the only difference is in the exposition. After that, it's the same plot progression, the same execution and, as pointed out before, even identical mechanics in the banishing part. For me, that made each episode worth about 5 minutes of new material. Personally, I don't think 20-something minutes of viewing time is worth 5 minutes of a new story. Perhaps the most irksome, though, is that the writers probably could have taken enough liberty with the story to actually give the views something, ANYTHING new after the victim and wrongdoer have been introduced.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what's the point of repeating what's been said in other reviews? It's to stress just how defining the repetitive nature is of Jigoku Shoujo. Apparently some people don't have a problem with it as they are able to focus solely on the victim/wrongdoer combo for 20-something minutes. If you're the type who doesn't mind watching reruns over and over (and over and over) again, then none of this is likely to bother you. In that case, you'll probably really like this! However, if you're not sure, just be careful; maybe give it 3 episodes to decide if you can handle the repetition but, until further notice, I wouldn't put yourself through the torture if you're at the WTF?! stage by then. Also, I suspect Jigoku Shoujo may be easier to handle if the episodes are spaced apart. When I tried this show, I was doing 1-2 per day, which obviously was too much! However, I think that if I did 1 episode per week (which is how I'll retry it), it might be a lot easier to handle. And, if you're not sure about this show when you go into it... good luck!",

During each story or ep (since each ep deals with a complete story), the protagonist dramas are explained, showing us how did it all started to where when the Jigoku Shoujo is contacted, Enma Ai will then appear and hand black straw doll with a red string tied to its neck, she then says \u201cif u really wish to take revenge, take the red string, if you remove that string you shall enter officially in a contract with me, the one u seek revenge upon will be carried to hell immediately. However if I deliver your revenge, I must have you make restitution to me.\\n\r\nWhen one person is cursed, to graves are dug, when you die your soul shall fall to the pits of hell. Your spirit shall wander forever in pain and suffering, never having known paradise.\u201d (Translation is different for each fansub group, but the meaning is the same).\\n\r\nWhen someone\u2019s cursed, a mark appears in the chest, remembering this person of his/her sin, reminding them that after their lives come to end, they must give compensation by having their own soul carried to Hell.\\n\r\nThis is only in the first episodes, starting from ep 8, 2 new important characters are introduced: A journalist named Hajime Shibata who is investigating the stories involving the Jigoku Shoujo, and his daughter Tsugumi. After an encounter with Enma Ai, Tsugumi starts to have visions of her and thus the duo becomes more and more involved in her matters. Tsugumi is somehow related to Ai, this is something that won\u2019t be reveled up to ep 23, but will be dealed from ep 13up.\\n\r\nBecause of this connection, Tsugumi always knows who is the next client or victim, and Hajime will try to stop the revenge.\\n\r\nThe introduction of the 2 characters is important to the story, since they will always be present, trying to uncover the Jigoko Shoujo secret\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Enma Ai, she is a beautiful young red eyed girl with Dark Hair, usually wearing traditional sailor school uniform.\\n\r\nHer Mission is to carry others revenge to hell\u2026\\n\r\nShe is quite a mature character, and as to be tough in order to carry the mission.\\n\r\nWe can see that she is not a bad person, even thought she may look terrifying sometimes, it seams she feels something for the ones she carries to hell, has an example in ep 21, she seemed she really enjoyed to take the guy to hell, I could be seen on her face and in he voice. Other example was ep 23, a pure, honest and innocent girl loved by all was sent to hell, it was easy to tell she was not happy, she showed a really sad face and expressed a sad voice.\\n\r\nShe lives in a house in an unknown world that is in eternal sunset with her grandmother who orders her around and whose face never appears only her voice and shadow.\\n\r\nIt seams she doesn\u2019t lead a happy life, and there seams to be something bothering her, like if she is being forced to do that work\u2026\\n\r\nEnma Ai doesn't work alone. Ai, Ichimoku Ren, Wanyuudo, and Hone Onna are the only are her assistants\u2026\\n\\n\r\nWanyuud ou, he is an old man wearing a hat and a red scarf that becomes the same black doll delivered to each one of their \"clients\"\\n\\n\r\nIchimoku Ren, is a handsome young man in casual clothes. He has the power to look beyond walls with a mysterious big eye.\\n\\n\r\nHone Onna (Bone Woman), a beautiful woman wearing a kimono, she usually helps seducing mans and helps out with the investigation and torture\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThey help Ai during the event when their victims are confronted with their own sins, prior to the moment when she (dressed in traditional kimono with floral patterns) ferries them to hell. Also, the trio helps her investigate the true nature of their cases every time they content something suspicious.\\n\r\nThey usually do most of the work; Enma Ai only gives the final blow and rides the boat to Hell.\\n\\n\r\nTsugumi \u2013 This small girl as met the Jigoku Shoujo, they seam to have some sort of relation as Tsugumi is able to incarnate her for a few seconds giving her a sight of what she sees, and sometimes what she speaks. As it seams Ai is doing it intentionally, but why is yet to be explained.\\n\\n\r\nHajime Shibata \u2013 He is Tsugumis father, he works as an investigator, he is trying to uncover and stop the Jigoku Shoujo, he is wise man that can easily deceive most of peoples to try and get information about the surroundings of each case, he follows Tsugumi\u2019s leads to every case and is seen as an annoyance for the trio helping Ai, but it seams she does not wish them any harm, maybe wanting to be followed by them\u2026\\n\\n\r\nTsugumi and her father are descendents of Shintaro, the one and only one Ai friend, then one who protected her and in the end the one o utterly killed her, here may lye the reason why the Jigoko Shoujo is interested in them\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThese are the only characters that really care trough the series\u2026\\n\r\nThere is so much I could tell about the characters and their relationships, but it would make a big review even bigger, and add so much more spoilers to a review full of spoilers\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - The animation in Jigoko Shoujo is very good, the art in this anime has a dark tendency, as it\u2019s supposed to be am horror anime, the background art is also detailed an quite pleasing some times, like in her house, the beautiful nature that surrounds it, makes it look like paradise, and in contrast, the hell scenes, even thought they are reused to some extent, are really good, and look really dark, sometimes we see spirit hand trying to catch the one being ferried, also usually the chase/murder scenes are really good with great special effects that can be disturbing sometimes.\\n\r\nThe character design usually is also really good, with nice colors, and good proportion, the big round eyes look good on the characters, specially the red ones in Enma Ai, together with the long dark hair, she looks like a beautiful doll u would like to have, also the flower kimono she wears is special, if u watch the anime u will notice the flowers moving trough the kimono, giving it a mysterious look\u2026\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Op, the op music is not bad, it\u2019s a regular pop song, sung by Snow (sont have any information on her, as ANN doesn\u2019t have any for me), I don\u2019t have the lyrics so I cant say much about the letter but I think it suits the op art.\\n\r\nThe music in Jigoku shoujo is nice, I\u2019m currently listening to the soundtrack, while doing this part; the music contains some soft and gentle melodies using flute, cord instruments and piano, along with some traditional instruments, this music is suited for the light scenes in the story; since this is an horror anime, its supposed to have dark music, this music, is more the electronic type and more heavy, using electronic instruments together with some guitar and drums, which helps to set the dark mood throughout the series.\\n\r\nThe Ed song is more soft, Karinui sung by Noto Mamiko (Enma Ai seyuu), I think it\u2019s better than the op. I don\u2019t currently have the dvd with me so I cant do much more for the music, but as soon as I get it ill try to update a little\u2026\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: When I got the first ep I did know nothing about Elfen lied, and once I started watching it, I was surprised with the great op, I thought it was really a beautiful op with a great music, but after the op those next 7m really caught me on surprise, looking all that gore, fanservise and deaths made me think, what where those guys thinking, everyone will be caught by the beginning of the show, and that\u2019s when people will think if they should stop there or if they want to see what\u2019s going to happen next.\\n\r\nDuring the show u will end up liking the character, and enjoy each situation not getting bothered with the violence. The interest factor is always high throughout the anime, and the fights are always short yet unpredictable. You never know when Lucy might just rip a person\u2019s head off.\\n\\n\r\nOther aspects of the anime: The Buddhist statue that appears at several points in the series, with what looks like a club/sword and a golden pomegranate in her hands (especially in ep 13) is Benzaiten (\u5f01\u624d\u5929), originally the Hindu Goddess Sarasvati. She is one of the \u201cSeven Lucky Gods,\u201d and the patron of music, dance and general good fortune \u2013all in all, a very bright deity overseeing this very dark story. She\u2019s usually represented carrying a biwa (lute) and a jewel in her hands. Benzaiten is enshrined at Enoshima, the island in Kanagawa prefecture where the events of the series take place. She is also associated with the story of the White Snake \u2013the archetypical East Asian story of falling in love with a woman who is not quite what she seems.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Elfen Lied happened in the City of Kamakura (\u938c\u5009\u5e02) of Kanagawa Prefecture (\u795e\u5948\u5ddd\u770c).",

            "content": "Jigoku Shoujo (or Hell Girl) is a unique anime in various ways. Jigoku Shoujo tells the story of various individuals who really want someone in this world gone. Each episode is about how a person faces tragedy, treachery and prejudice in this cold society. These people will end up using..... the Jigoku Tsushin, the only way to contact the Hell Girl Enma Ai and send a nemesis to hell. The contract with Hell Girl has a catch: you will go to hell too after you die. Of course, most people considers for a while, but they will end up releasing the red string.\r\nThis anime seriesis .... very.... dark. Each episode will show you true tragedy and remorse. Words cannot describe just how angry or sad each story is. What I can say is: watch the first three episodes and it will shock you.\\n\\n\r\nWARNING! BITS OF SPOILER! (Not too much...)\\n\\n\r\nOf course this alone is boring overall, which is why the Shibatas come in. Hajime Shibata, a freelance journalist, and his young daughter Tsugumi learns that the rumor of Hell Girl is true after witnessing a person disappearing (which happens during the process of Hell sending). From then starts the struggle of these two to stop Hell Girl.\\n\\n\r\nEnma Ai is a cold and mindless individual residing in the Sunset World. She has three followers: Hone Onna, Ichimoku Ren and Wanyudo. These followers transform into a straw puppet with a red string when a request is made. When the requester pulls the red string, the person who he/she wrote on the Jigoku Tsushin website will be sent to hell immediately. However the person won't go to hell just like that. He/She will suffer before in either a scary way or a (to us) comical way.\\n\\n\r\nSpoiler Ends\\n\\n\r\nI started this series out of curiousity, but ended up watching until season 3. I believe most will once you start.",

Before the last episodes, I always wonder who is Ai and why is she doing that. Then after knowing what happened to her, I understood everything. I felt sorry for her. I think they should've also let us know Ai's subordinates' past. Also, who is grandmother? I enjoyed the series. I reccommend it.",

I love Enma Ai and her crew.They set the mood for this anime, and i just love this.\r\n   The art was AMAZING , but sometimes it had some,not a lot, but some. I love how the creator captured the mood ofthe characters being sent to Hell , just amazing~\\n\r\n     The sound, it was amazing. I loved Enma Ai's voice on how the voice actress made her voice sound ghostly , that just made me LOVE it.\\n\r\n    Sometimes, I would have to say I didn't understand some episodes , they just didn't appeal to me, but the rest is AMAZING.",

But that just made it all that more amazing. It will pull feelings out of you so easily. Mostly episode-by-episode sort of thing. Each episode focusing on a new character who's plagued by someone who is causing them pain and basically ruining their life. Main character calls on Hell Girl to send them to hell. As boring as it may SOUND to watch the same sort of thing over and over again, it never ceased to keep me interested due tothe difference in the reason for every character to call on Hell Girl.\\n\\n\r\nThen it gets into Hell Girl's past. And starts half focusing on the original stuff of a new character being plagued, ect and half focusing on Hell Girl herself. I loved this. I loved seeing more of Ai Enma in a different light.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Oh wow. This art is so... almost classic? No I can't seem to find a good word for it. But to this day, having watched the anime originally about a year or two ago, I love seeing the art and it always puts me in the mood to watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDialogue:\\n\r\nWonderful, wonderful dialogue. Sub and Dub. Amazing voice actors for both too!\\n\\n\r\nThis is a staple in my anime collection and I will never ever sell it. It's a wonderful anime that makes me feel so much for the characters. I've never seen another anime pull me so much into the story that I'm crying and screaming at the television.",

            "content": "Quick Summary: Hell Girl is about a girl that takes people's requests to banish other souls to hell. Of course there is a price to sending your tormentors to hell.\r\nStory (6): To be completely honest the anime is the same thing over and over again, it lacks a plot change until around the 18th episode in. But if you do stay for the first 18 episodes you'll mostly likely enjoy the rest because you start to learn more about Hell Girl herself. Some of the episodes shined more than others but all in all they were decent.\r\nArt (9): It was really nice art nice andsharp the character designs were all different you didn't really see anyone that looked like the same person in the last episode. And everyone looks beautiful, even the old people look good. And Hell Girl looks like the most beautiful thing in the world I always looked forward to her appearance in the episode. To me her eyes are just hypnotic.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8): I borrowed the DVD of Hell Girl because my friend absolutely loves the series and owns the complete box set and on the title menu before you hit play the music is just epic and addicting, my friend and I would just leave it playing. But the OP and ED fit the series well and they sound good together just slow somber songs that shows the somber feel of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6): The characters are very basic when you look at the person you can tell what character they are going to be. You can always tell who is going to be who in every anime you watch but in Hell Girl you can really tell who is who, the way the character looks you can basically judge their character.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7): When I first started watching it I liked it a lot, I liked hearing about peoples problems and why they wanted revenge. But then the stories slowly got slower and slower. To me it went from these juicy episodes (1-10) to like \"We ran out of ideas and tried our best.\" episodes (11-18). But all in all it was decent for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7): I'm only giving it a 7 because my friend made it sound like the greatest thing since sliced bread and over the years I've heard nothing but good talk about Hell Girl. But to me it reminds me of the quote \"All that glitters is not gold,\" That's how I felt. I mean towards the end it did get better but too be honest I'm only going to start season 2 and 3 for my friend. If it were up to me I'd probably have stopped watching it a long time ago. But all in all if you're truly into this kind of thing it's the show for you.",
