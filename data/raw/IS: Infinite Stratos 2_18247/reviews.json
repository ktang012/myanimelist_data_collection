            "content": "Infinite Stratos 2 is the anime equivalent of a lobotomy. An anime so insipid, so devoid of intelligent thought that a trip to the garbage can would likely yield something more interesting. Maybe you'll feel dirty afterwards, but hey, at least you won't receive brain damage for it. \r\nI struggle to think of a single good thing to say when describing Infinite Stratos 2. Even the absolute worst of the medium (from the infamous Mars of Destruction to the nonsensical Cipher) can at least be laughed at in their awfulness. Not Infinite Stratos. It is everything wrong with the harem genre and the anime industryas a whole, assembled into one cretinous pile of filth. You would need standards so low that they pass the Earth's core and leave the other side of the planet in order to appreciate this trash. Nothing went right. Everything went wrong. Hell, this is awful even by the first season's standards.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to describe one of Infinite Stratos' most asinine scenes. In the sixth episode, Charlotte finds herself in a situation where her panties have magically disappeared. Rather than simply tell Ichika the situation like any sensible person would, she convinces herself that lifting her skirt and directly showing him is the only way to get her point across. Ichika does as she asks and looks. Her response? \"Pervert!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnother scene involves Ichika being forced to take body measurements of all the girls in the school (which every single one of them is happy about for some incomprehensible reason). He closes his eyes, so embarrassed by female cleavage, thinking to himself that a measuring tape does not require eyes to see. His complete lack of understanding about human anatomy results in him fondling the girl. Every single member of his harem then appears out of thin-air and catches him in the act, screaming and assaulting him as the camera pans away. \\n\\n\r\nEven from the very first episode, we know that a trainwreck awaits. The antagonist walks down a dark corridor and meets five soldiers armed with assault rifles. They open fire... and all the bullets somehow manage to land in front of her feet or behind her. She jumps into the air, pulls out two pistols and shoots them all with perfect accuracy. Yep. Even the most brainless of Hollywood blockbusters aim for better than this, but I suppose Infinite Stratos never cared for quality in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode is the most brain-damaging of all. The antagonist's sidekick willingly reveals to one of the girls the location of a hidden bomb, and the main antagonist then unleashes a laser attack on thirty or forty armed mech soldiers, annihilating them all instantly. Of course Ichika (the most worthless soldier in the entire school) and the members of his harem can take her on in a one-on-one fight, however. As the final insult to the audience's intelligence, a deus ex machina unfolds, placed in direct sight of the enemy at the most convenient time possible. They then escape, and the story ends with a random onsen scene wherein Ichika passes out in the girl's bath. OK.\\n\\n\r\nI do not know how a show so stupid could have ever been produced. Even putting aside the abysmal writing, the harem aspect (the anime's sole appeal) fares no better. The two new additions to his harem (Tatenashi and Kanzashi) suddenly fall in love with Ichika for no bloody reason at all. In the case of Kanzashi, all Ichika ever had to do was smile a lot and play the white knight role once for her to be head over heels for him. There are so many damn members to his harem that you may as well just throw in the entire school at this point. What do they even see in Ichika, anyway? He is one of the most insipid protagonists ever created, absent of any personality. The animators should have just drawn a rock instead - at least that way there would be one less thing to infuriate the audience. \\n\\n\r\nAside from having the intellect of a toddler, Ichika has the maturity of one, too. He is so adverse to any female contact (even visibly cringing in one scene where a girl's breasts rub against his arm) that you would ordinarily assume he is a homosexual. The fact that he has seven girls blatantly chasing after him and does not recognise it is a testament to how dreadful his characterisation is. A decent harem series would have the protagonist aware long before this point, if not already actively pursuing one of the girls. Future harem anime should take notes from Sora no Otoshimono and HenNeko, and treat Infinite Stratos like the plague that it is. \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the female characters are just as bad. Even the two with a brain (Houki and Charlotte) inevitably fall victim to the show's abysmal writing. The most obnoxious is by far Cecilia, her voice so excruciating that it would be more appropriate in the 9 Circles of Hell. Lin on the other hand has about as much presence as a shadow while Kanzashi lacks any sort of personality or defining feature except \"has glasses\". \\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 is terrible even from a technical perspective. All of the action scenes are rendered in low-budget CG and many times the characters' faces will look as if they were drawn by a 10-year-old with a cheap \"How to Draw Manga\" textbook. The soundtrack is also rubbish and comprises mainly of elevator music and a tuba endlessly making the same two-three notes. During the action scenes, the music is so turgid and over-dramatic that it almost becomes hilarious when combined with the infantile dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nIt is rare to find an anime as bad as Infinite Stratos. It is the exact kind of tripe that gives anime such a bad image in mainstream society. Regardless of whether you enjoy the harem genre or despise it, absolutely nothing of value will be found here. Even as mindless entertainment it fails miserably. Avoid it like the plague, or better yet, convince yourself that it doesn't even exist. You will save yourself some sanity that way. \\n\\n\r\nIf this is the future of the anime industry, then god help us.",

            "content": "There was once a time in the early years of the 2000s where Harem shows were one of the more popular genres of anime even in a few parts of the western world with titles such as Tenchi Muyo and Love Hina. Though the former wasn\u2019t loved because of this specific trope, the latter show had indeed put the genre more focus on the anime community at large with its quirky cast of characters. Nowadays the harem genre isn\u2019t as it once was, not really in terms of merit but in popularity so to speak. Once in a while, we get one that does tryto put different ideas on how to view the genre in terms of parody, comedy, and character development. But there are some that don\u2019t try to do anything unique to it as a whole and most likely felt like could\u2019ve been a lost harem idea back in say, 2002 at most.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos. The continuation of a series that the majority of people, even fans of Harem, show no restraint in voicing their hatred of it. Somehow, it has gone to sell like hotcakes despite its lack of authenticity of being anything more than drab and generic. Now, even with all of this in mind, the one question that pops into my head is: Why is this show getting all of the attention from people buying up all the OVAs and BDs when there are better harem shows out there and are even continuing to this day?\\n\\n\r\nSome that come to mind are Hentai Ouji, Sora no Otoshimono, To Love Ru Darkness, Kore wa Zombie, and Haganai. All of which have an infinite amount of personality and creativity to their comedic writing and overall creative charisma that the series could ever have in its little world. But, of course, I\u2019d have to explain why I think of Infinite Stratos this way, but the only reason I bring this whole comparison thing up is just that\u2026there isn\u2019t that much to say about this next installment in the franchise, other than the fact that it pales in comparison to shows like it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are indeed some awful characteristics to be made public about the 2nd season. It\u2019s quite apparent to see how badly written the story is for something like Infinite Stratos, but what makes it even more perplexing is just how there\u2019s so little plot, to begin with. What little serious drama that is present comes across as muddled and overly not well-paced at all. All it is is just the characters going through separate kinds of problems that typically might involve Ichika to help them that eventually leads to him in a suggestive situation involving him getting kicked or beaten to a bloody pulp for accidentally peaking on them changing or saying something that made them blush. From what you could get out of from this description I made, you might think of it as a good thing that they\u2019re sacrificing plot to put more emphasis on comedy that can succeed. Unfortunately, this sacrifice only provided a lukewarm reception in all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe way to describe the comedy in Infinite Stratos in one word is \u201chaphazard.\u201d There\u2019s hardly any clever gags to most of the jokes to the point where it\u2019s almost as if the writers copy-and-pasted the jokes on the scene in question and prayed that the audience would get a laugh from it. A few do garner a little chuckle here and there, but the vast majority don\u2019t even deserve a snicker in the slightest. We\u2019ve all seen the typical Onsen and the accidental peeking scene in every harem show in existence, so why keep milking it to the people who are already tired of it? I\u2019m sure there are many people who don\u2019t mind that kind of humor but there comes a time when they need to at least inject new life into these kinds of jokes. If not, it\u2019s going to be the equivalent of getting your face getting passively slapped multiple times by the people who come up with this day after day.\\n\\n\r\nNot only do the writers not put in any new effort into the jokes themselves, but even the ones that they wrote are so muddled and confused on its reason for existing in the first place. One prime example is when Charlotte forgot to wear her panties and she\u2019s too embarrassed to tell it to Ichika, for some reason that is never explained. When she finds out later that they are back on, after being noted by Laura, she pulls up her skirt and tells Ichika to look at them even though he didn\u2019t want to. Despite this, she still feels embarrassed and calls him a pervert, despite the fact she had no problem to tell him to look. It\u2019s almost as if the writers forgot what the punchline was supposed to be and, what I assume in a desperate attempt at trying to be smart, just with the generic route of letting Charlotte call him a pervert for no reason. Good job on that one guys.\\n\\n\r\nWith the writing automatically becoming a one trick pony, the overall character castdoesn\u2019tt provide better reception but there are a few that do get some laughs. The new character Sarashiki is quite humorous in her attempts on being sneaky and conniving in messing with Ichika and his romances, even with her muddled reasoning for liking Ichika in the first place. But the charms pretty much stops there in the 2nd half when her appearances are only brief and we have to sit through her sister who just doesn\u2019t have anything going for her other than that she\u2019s there to fill out the 2nd to the last arc that hardly amounts to anything other than her being Ichika\u2019s next girl in his harem. As for the rest, they don\u2019t really improve on from the 1st season nor do they really decline in quality either since they weren\u2019t even that strong to being with other than being cute girls. Strangely enough, Lingyin hardly makes an impression in this season, which might indicate that she might have been the least popular of the girls, even though personally Cecilla would\u2019ve been the more reasonable choice.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Ichika, the main protagonist, who is just about the by-the-book harem protagonist that you could ever find out of the entire catalog of dense male protagonists. It\u2019s safe to say that Ichika represents what most otaku love to see, a poor guy that acts so brainless to his own male hormones that he can\u2019t even muster up the courage to express his true emotions so that they can feel better about themselves. Here\u2019s a pretty unique idea: How about a strong male protagonist who actually acts like how an actual male at his age would do at that typical scenario? Now I\u2019m not saying that being a total pervert openly is a good thing nor does this indicate that we need more protagonist to think of females as nothing but sex objects. But when you\u2019re like me and you constantly see someone like Ichika that does the same shtick where he always acts like he doesn\u2019t have any interest in any of the girls yet somehow later on does and he can\u2019t find the courage to admit it openly, you\u2019d think that we would be tired of this kind of thing around 2005, but nope.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical prowess of the show aren\u2019t of any special value because of the generic designs of the mechs, the really average attempts on CG, and the average character designs; though admittedly the girl designs are definitely colorful and nice to look at. Not to mention the opening and ending animation is almost like they recycled some of the animation that we saw in the previous ones in the first season. Then we have the ensemble cast, to which I must ask how in the name of all that is good and decent did these talented seiyuus signed up again for this? I mean granted Kana Hanazawa is in every show that comes out these days, but actresses like Yoko Hikasa, Chiwa Saito, and Inoue Marina really deserved better to be in something else than this. They do their best attempts at trying to be charming as usual, but even with those in mind, it doesn\u2019t really dull out the pain of going through mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nThis could\u2019ve been an attempt at trying to pull out a full-blown rant into tearing this show apart like some of my colleagues are willing to do but in all honesty, as far as harems go, you could sit through way worse. You could probably dig deeper into the lost collection of thrown out harem shows that have even been dumped by the studios themselves in the past and see how so much worse they can be. However, since Infinite Stratos is headed by a well-known studio as of now, it can definitely be seen as a high-profile failure in trying to reboot the series for a second season that was in dire straits of regaining some merit, if there was ever one to be found to begin with. Not something that I would ever in my life ever watch fully again, maybe only a few amusing clips of it, but as I said before, I\u2019ve seen way worse.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: D+\\n",

            "content": "Chances are that if you are plan on watching Infinite Stratos 2, you probably want to see how the story goes on between Ichika and the friends he has made at IS Academy in this brand new adventure. After all, season 1 didn\u2019t end with an exactly a high note with its indecisive conclusion. Yes, I\u2019m talking about Ichika and his dense mind along with the irrational decisions he makes. The story itself only had some moments that shined while others fell under the typical harem tropes with little development. Unfortunately, Infinite Stratos 2 doesn\u2019t get any better. In fact, it went backwards and becameeven worse. It\u2019s a continuation of a story that set itself on a time bomb ticking away at its destruction. \\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 is the sequel of the first season based off of the light novel in the same name written by Izuru Yumizuru. The series continues directly from season 1 with a young man named Orimura Ichika. To refresh some memory, Ichika is the first male pilot of the exoskeleton mech known as the IS (Infinite Stratos). Because the system was designed for female pilots, Ichika becomes the first user of the technology.  The government obviously has plans for him and sent him directly to the world famous IS Academy. That means it\u2019s a paradise for him because he is set to an academy where everywhere around him is: girls.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned previously, this series begins exactly where the first season left off. Ichika is still the talk of the academy because of his status and kindness. It\u2019s no surprise that girls are interested in him in some way because most if not all of them came from a girls-only school previously. Among these girls include the return of the five female protagonists known as Houki, Cecilia, Ling, Charlotte, and Laura. Although most of them had some spotlights in season 1, this sequel puts them to shame. Their development is in ashes because the a big chunk of the series concentrates on some nonsense where everyone tries to get Ichika\u2019s attention. Unfortunately, Ichika is dense as ever and hardly understands any of the girls\u2019 attempts. In fact, he seems them a sign of gratitude while all the while being ignorant of its intentions. This comes early in the series in many shapes and sizes. These include the typical pool episode, absurd cosplays, surprise party extravaganza with absurd gags, and even an entire episode dedicated to a pair of panties plying around the lost & found game. While all this seems to fun at first, it quickly grows old because of the lack of depth in its fun.The comedy is also killed thanks to Ichika\u2019s dense personality.\\n\\n\r\nOn more a directional side, the series does contain a story that expands further somewhat. Even in harem series like this, there is a story because the concept is serious with the IS being part of the system. In this sequel, the story introduces two new characters - one of them with an authoritative control, skill of a pilot, and ability to flirt with Ichika like no tomorrow. There\u2019s some problems wrong with her character though. For one thing, she seems almost too perfect. Furthermore, Ichika is confused throughout the series as to her true intentions. Her smile often seems to be a like a mask that hides her purpose as a facade. But behind that smile also lies a girl whose skills is unrivaled in IS combat. To make matter worse for the girls though, she seems to be also possesses the skill to tame all of Ichika\u2019s harem. Initially, she stands out as the boss of the series, like a game that the girls must overcome.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also another character that represents the opposite of her. It\u2019s quite odd seeing Ichika interact with her as someone that hardly gives him any attention. In many ways, she represents the opposite of the typical girls in this harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Infinite Stratos 2 completely sicks under the ocean with no chance of salvage is also an exaggeration though. Despite the lack of development or engaging storyline, the sequel does expand on a more darker side as the characters learns the existence of an organization. Their purpose stands for what terrorism is and their actions speaks louder than words. In fact, this organization declares war against IS Academy along with Ichika and his friends. There is also some mystery related to one particular member of this organization whom bares a strikingly similar appearance to another character from the series. Calling herself by a name that shocks Ichika, she becomes a pivotal antagonist that brings out the dark side of IS.\\n\\n\r\nAction wise, Infinite Stratos surprisingly has some decent movements with its mechanics. The system itself is designed to fight efficiently in almost any circumstances. Also depending on the skill of the user, each IS has its own specialization or customized weapon that can inflict additional damage. In this sequel, new models are introduced with even more devastating abilities. The new models also gives them an impressive look from its exterior with its threatening design. Even with the harem tropes all over the place, the IS does stand in as a prominent factor as each time they are shown on screen, the camera angles focus exclusively on them with a more detailed look.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not where the only place where the camera points to...\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice is all over the place in this sequel. It shouldn\u2019t surprise viewers considering the way season one was handled. However, the show goes on with even from the beginning such as Laura crawling into Ichika\u2019s bed or the swimsuits coming off just because. Cosplay also seems to make its way into this sequel because the show wants to try out some new ideas to cover all the field of a harem anime. This includes the form of odd animal outfits with skin bearing. There\u2019s a hidden reason behind this but is definitely one that Ichika is not pleased with. Even when he doesn\u2019t try it, Ichika is the center of attention just because of who he is. There\u2019s almost no credibility in any of the characters\u2019 attachment to Ichika in this sequel either thanks to a lack of exploration in their past/histories with Ichika. The characterization is shallow and doesn\u2019t get anywhere. Even when there\u2019s some hope, there are those moment killers (thanks to our new characters) that ruins the fun for Ichika; if he even depicts as fun in the first place. It\u2019s absurd, idiotic, and a disgrace to the main story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, the series maintain the same style as the original. What that means is the characters all retain their generic designs. Most of them retain the way they still look while new characters make their way with their flashy introductions. The new threat that is presented in this sequel does bring out a dangerous outlook but also confusion as one of the characters has a familiar outlook. Unfortunately, her character is never really explained at all so you\u2019ll be guessing who she is towards the end. Our main male protagonist Ichika doesn\u2019t even change an inch in either his outer or inner appearance. There\u2019s little to in depth with any of the designs besides the Infinite Stratos models. Luckily, the backgrounds of the series is rich enough to give the feeling of a high level technology environment. The way both the inner and outer exterior of Infinite Stratos Academy is designed stays true to its terms by standards of high level technology. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t really mean much with its generic traits that is thrown almost everywhere artistically.\\n\\n\r\nThe standards of its soundtrack has a so-so presentation judging by the OST. Most of the action scenes contains an explosive tone thanks to its intensity. Like mentioned before, the primary concept of IS means serious business so the series portrays it seriously with its standards. The OP song True Blue Traveler foreshadows some ideas of what to expect from season 2 while at the same time throws generic concepts all over the place. Kouki Uchiyama also returns as the voice actor of Ichika whom surprisingly has a decent acting ability that portrays the typical harem lead well. New characters voiced by Chiwa Sato and Suzuko Mimori also represents their characters well despite their opposite personalities. To say the least, the soundtrack department isn\u2019t half bad but honestly, that isn\u2019t saying much.\\n\\n\r\nFinishing this series should only be a priority if you want to see how the franchise concludes rather than expecting greatness from it. There\u2019s nothing really great about this sequel considering its lack of characterization, poorly constructed plot clustered with fan service , generic subplots, and weak progression. This adaptation also omits some parts from the light novel that could have enhanced the comedic side of the sequel. Unfortunately, it backfires in the end. There\u2019s no doubt some fans will be disappointed at how this show turned out to be. Infinite Stratos 2 is a perfect example of an adaptation gone wrong with no redemption. There might not of been infinite possibilities to expand this continuation. However, the excuse of its story is beyond miserable. So if you plan to watch this series, I\u2019d recommend you to hit the fast forward to save some time. Time for you isn\u2019t infinite after all\u2026\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes at night when I'm having trouble sleeping, I find myself wondering; if you could shove in as many dere heroines as possible (with individual fanservice, of course) into an anime, what would it look like? My highly philosophical questions of utter importance have been answered: IS 2. In a way, I'm genuinely impressed. How did they think of this? Or rather, how did they not think of anything else than stereotypical characters falling in love with the main character which, coincidentally, has the stereotypical brain that consists of concrete. Is he supposed to be portrayed as stupid? If so, apologize to the stupid people,as they (the whole population of idiots) have been portrayed faultly.\\n\\n\r\nI had somewhat high hopes for the first season of IS, since it sounded cool for a 16-year-old me, and they even managed to get me to watch through it without smashing my head into a wall. Impressive. Now, with a critical eye to it as well, I'm disappointed in the 16-year-old me. This entire series has been nothing but a disgrace. The first season of IS did indeed try to progress, albeit slowly, but there was without a doubt some progress. The second season just seems like the producers gave up and threw girls at the fans. Yay, sex and stuff. Although I'm used to fanservice taking place more and more in anime (which, by the way, is not a good thing), IS 2 is on a whole new level. As I said, it feels like they simply threw the storyboard away and let everything happen as it happened. Like they didn't give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything good (or rather, something to not really complain about) in IS 2, it ought to be the animation. It would literally be better if the whole series were the fighting scenes combined into one long (not really) fight. But noooooooo, the producers chose to draw figure-8's and got a brilliant idea.\\n\\n\r\nI give IS2 the final rating suicidal tendencies out of 10.\\n",

            "content": "You know, for quite sometime now, I forgot about this anime...since there is nothing memorable about garbage. This sequel to IS has the same amount of bullshit as Old McDonald's farm. Once you're on the tip of your chair or what ever you're sitting on, it pushes you back down making you say \"Really...you're really going to do that\". Of course this isn't the first time it did this *cough* season one *cough* but this time I was really,really, really let down.\r\nThe story from season one.... really didn't move. Even though the series did have some highlights like mecha fights, getting chased...by girls, misunderstandings...., andhow Cecilia can't cook to save her life. All those high...lights... But don't worry guys and girls! We have two new characters!\\n\\n\r\nLike most sequels to any animes, Infinite Stratos also gives us new characters, two new characters. You guessed it! A student council president and her sister! The Sarashiki sisters (Tatenashi and Kanzashi) both have blue hair and are totally \"totes\" for Ichika...you know like how the rest of the school is....The other characters, that play as the villain,Madoka Orimura, who obviously is not Chifuyu and Ichika sister, does not get much screening time. And once she does, she is there to just make shit happen. Leaving out explanations, and leaving the viewers with sooooo much questions just to be turned down with ass and tit shots. (Did I mention that Ichika forgets his own birthday. Seriously, who does that?)\\n\\n\r\nYou know the art was the only thing this anime could have kept going on. The art was pretty much on par as any 8-Bit producers want it to be. Seeing how this anime is one who like to show off cleavage, I could pretty much tell that they were going to emphasize on the \"jiggles\" and they did deliver on the \"jiggles\".\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine. Nothing special, it's pretty much the same as season one but it seems like there was not enough \"umph\" into it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nI like harems. I like ecchi. \"If\" (huge if) they are done right. Examples are Zero No Tsukaima, Sekirei...Hell, I could even say Highschool of the Dead had more plot than this pathetic excuse for a harem. Honestly, my thoughts haven't changed since season one nor has my enjoyment. I have read a few pages of the light novels and they are pretty much the same. Really disappointing but really I wasn't hoping much, just a little. And that little hope got tossed out to the nearest four way intersection, right in the middle of street. The reason why I was hoping just a little change, was because of some other series with the same genres and elements, changed during the second season. Examples are Boku wa Tomodachi, Sekirei, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend IS: Infinte Stratos. Yes, only if you like to lose more brain cells.",

            "content": "With an ending as open as Infinite Stratos's was, there was a lot to expect when the sequel was announced a little over a year later. As with most sequels, people come to expect that with the introductions and character building out of the way, a fresh start can open new possibilities for the title to showcase with more air time. Unfortunately, there are titles that take advantage of this gargantuan amount of free space and use it to try and attract a larger audience through obscene amounts of fan service and the unnecessary plot devices that arise out of it. While these types ofsequels are fine and dandy toward those who expect nothing of the series, Infinite Stratos 2 tries to do the unthinkable: combine illogically contrived fan service with a full-fledged plot focus.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 starts off where the debut season ended; with Ichika Orimura and his band of merry miracles flying through their schoolwork as if it didn't mean a thing, and to all fairness, it probably doesn't. What this anime likes to portray, especially in this current season, is the mirage of a typical harem/slice of life series with some added robotic plot devices for good measure. However, later on, it tries to force itself into a plotline involving an unknown team of evil-doers that really have no purpose in the series except for driving Ichika, the bland, uninspiring main male character, to show off his use in times of dire need; in typical shounen fashion. When a large amount of time spent on a series is contributed to fan service and moments of unrivaled bliss, it's hard to incorporate a necessary dose of serious scenarios to it. With Infinite Stratos 2, it's the equivalent of driving a monster truck into a library; it's loud, obnoxious, and ultimately as far a match as anyone could imagine.\\n\\n\r\nTo spice up more of the fun that is Infinite Stratos, the series takes it upon itself to introduce two new characters: Tatenashi and Kanzashi Sarashiki. Conveniently enough, these two characters are sisters, which only provides an excuse to give some characterization to the younger of the two, Kanzashi. Somewhat of an instigator of the fan service that arises, Tatenashi is the self-proclaimed student body president of the school that all of the original characters attend. With that symbol of invincibility, Tatenashi places Ichika into inconvenient situations that most other males of his age group would probably trade for anything. As Tatenashi causes trouble for our hero, Kanzashi is the complete opposite, as most series like to portray this template for sisters. Kanzashi is timid, vulnerable, an introvert, and a whiz with computers. She gets the most amount of character development than any other character in the series, but only for a limited time, as is typical of harems. While Kanzashi's entire arc feels natural and fresh, Tatenashi seems to pop up out of nowhere whenever both trouble and an instance for fan service comes to fruition. Overall, they're mostly remembered for their blue hair.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of the fan service can't be compared to the original source of the madness. Cecilia, Laura, Charlotte, Houki, and Lingyin are as presentable as ever whenever meaningless plot shows its ugly face. Throughout this season, however, each of these character don't get an equal amount of screen time. During the first season, Ichika's childhood friend, Houki, was focused on as the prime suitor for Ichika's affection, and it seemed as though she had a good shot at him as a romantic interest. Unfortunately for those who cared, Houki is barely even shown outside of scenes where Ichika is placed in a precariously obscene situation. Lingyin is also noticeably missing from most of the series as well, with her being the least shown original character out of all of them. Cecilia, Charlotte, and Laura all get their own individual arcs of varying lengths and substance. All of them are forgettable to a point and laughably silly. It seems that Infinite Stratos 2 wanted to put more emphasis on the original characters' assets and Tatenashi moving the chaos along than trying to develop these characters into more than simply plastic.\\n\\n\r\nWith this series being notorious for fan service, it's safe to say that the art suits the desires of those who view it. With two years difference, Infinite Stratos 2's artwork is noticeably more full of shine than its predecessor. The character designs remain the same, as though the series wanted to remain nostalgic, with the student uniforms and shaky CGI looking as though they were cut straight from the first season. What was noticeable to a point, however, was the CGI itself. What's different about the CGI within the second season is that the quality isn't different whatsoever. During minimal movements, the machines are still shaky and lazily bulky. The animation comes to shine when the action comes into view. Although, with the amount of time spent on the characters' assets, those watching could forget that the IS machines even exist. For those who are expecting any action from this series could look forward to the ending sequences of this anime. Whether or not the ending disappoints you, at least it will look presentable.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not try and make it better? While fan service and an overexaggerated amount of female body parts isn't enough to completely disregard an anime's effort, it's hard not to cringe when an anime tries too hard to be something it isn't. Infinite Stratos 2 wants to be something fantastic, something so fantastic that it can combine fan service and dramatic, life-threatening predicaments into a giant heap of animated excellence. The harder it tries, the easier it is to expose its flaws, and it certainly has them; lots of them. Perhaps if this series tried to be one or the other, maybe it wouldn't seem so forced. Instead, it's everything in one and it couldn't feel any more like wasted potential.",

            "content": "I've read a couple of reviews bashing IS2 quite heavily now and whilst I feel that many of their points are justified and I agree with most of them... I can't help but feel the need to throw this series a life-line. For a summary skip to 'enjoyment' section.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThe only word I can think of to describe the story in IS2 in a nut-shell would have to be 'filler'. \r\nThe story is effectively non-existent consisting mostly of the girls (Ichika's harem - which he remains completely oblivious to as is now a custom with harems echii or not as it would seem) throwing theirboobs and panties thrown in every possible direction with the occasional fight here and there... (here it comes) ... HOWEVER...  whilst this season is effectively fan-service there is a small plot running throughout that left me wondering 'how long until #### goes down' with a sense of excitement.\\n\r\nIn addition a number of the antics that were thrown into the mix left me laughing or giggling at the very least and I liked the art quite a lot too.\\n\\n\r\nI think the issue people have here is that things don't 'go down' until the end where things finally begin to heat up, but even then there isn't a conclusive end to the arc... This leaves me with the feeling that the producers are planning to develop it in a third season (or at-least I hope - I'm not sure how closely it follows the manga either). I know its hopeful but it really could pull the series back into perspective story wise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNice art work which felt fluent and well drawn throughout the series with some nice detail on the IS's (which are used more than you might think they would after reading comments about the story). The characters looked fairly good including in any echii scenes for those who are interested.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nSound was average in all honesty with ok intro and outro music. Although some credit has to be given to the voice actors who did a decent job (I'd be shocked if they didn't considering some of the talent there).\\n\\n\r\ncharacter: 5\\n\r\nAll of the characters remain the same throughout this season as you (probably and if you haven't then go look at the first series) saw at the end of the first without any character development what so ever; even the 'near-ish romantic' bit is completely forgotten about for all those hopefuls.\\n\r\nThe only glint of development from season 1's characters arises from Ichika's big sis which is towards the end if at-all. \\n\r\nThe saving grace (if it can be called that) is the introduction of two new characters of which one shows some development over a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall despite a stagnant story, very little character development and feeling slightly let-down from season 1 as a result... I somehow really enjoyed this series to put it bluntly. I loved some of the scenario's however cliche some of them may be simply because of how they were executed. I liked the well-drawn art style and loved the battles that were included in it (though I wish the battles were focused on a little more and I've seen more 'epic battles' in other anime). I can't quite explain it... All I can say is that despite its criticisms IS2 is still worth a watch & that I'm still left wanting a season 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna start off by saying I've always hated Infinite Stratos. I was unfortunate to be invited in by the concept alone, expecting some good science-fiction action. I was very upset only to find it to be a very poorly written and generic harem with few redeeming qualities. However, I looked forward to the second season with almost no expectations, only to find that it had slaughtered said redeeming qualities from the first season.\r\nIn case you didn't know what Infinite Stratos is all about, let me remind you: It's set in the near future where the eponymous weaponized armors are the norm in military warfare.The only drawback is that only females can pilot them, and so the Infinite Stratos Academy was founded for the sole purpose of training future pilots. However, the main protagonist, Ichika Orimura, is the only male who can pilot an IS. Throw him inside an all-girls school and harem antics ensue. Dumb, cliche harem antics.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. The first season never goes on with that premise because apparently harem is more important. Most harem anime tend to be rather flimsy when it comes to story and plot development, but in Infinite Stratos 2, \"story\" does not even exist. There's a group of terrorists known as Phantom Task who want to kill Ichika and his older sister, Chifuyu, for unexplained reasons. There's a certain plot point with a member of Phantom Task named Madoka, who is revealed to be Chifuyu's evil twin sister and has a vendetta against her for unexplained reason. That's right, \"unexplained reasons\" is pretty much how this entire season runs on. Any plot threads concerning this are left completely unfinished. Wouldn't it be a good idea to actually elaborate on who these guys are and why they're doing bad stuff? According to the writing staff, apparently not. They only take action for about less than two and a half episodes total. All other episodes is basically \"How much can we pander to the viewers' cocks until their nutbladder explodes? I mean, nobody will care about the lack of character and plot when we can give something for our viewers to fap to every week.\" A whole season of filler had better writing than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters: First, you got Ichika himself who is just your standard harem protagonist whose about as dense as a brick. Then you got his harem; all but only one or two are nothing but generic cookie cutter stereotypes who has about as much personality as a piece of cardboard. But wait, there's more: They're unique from other harem girls in that they're a multinational harem! So you got the Japanese childhood friend/abusive tsundere, the German girl who hides weapons in her locker, the Chinese tsundere, the English chick, and the French reverse trap. All of them have nothing special about them and they only want Ichika because he's the only male in school. You might as well throw the entire student body at his bones, while you're at it.\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are decent for the most part. The music is forgettable, much like the first season. One thing I actually did like about this was the IS designs and the battle scenes. Even if the harem part was badly written, the fight scenes kept me entertained, even if it isn't the major focus as I hoped it would. Unfortunately, harem comes above all else in Infinite Stratos, so the military warfare part is left high and dry.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos in general is not a good anime, let alone a good harem show. This mistake known as the second season turns it into an unsalvagable, burning wreck. There have been very few good harem anime in this day and age, but this is just another one tossed under the \"pathetic\" pile. And the second season shoved it into the \"worst ever\" pile. If 8-bit were smart, they should save themselves even more embarrassment and don't even bother with greenlighting a third season because it won't fix anything. Instead, just do the right thing and leave Infinite Stratos to die in its own filth.",

            "content": "Wow. It's hard to decide where to begin. I suppose I should mention in advance that the first season of IS was one of the first anime I had ever watched, and I was naive enough to think, \"This is pretty good!\" I assumed the dialogue and plot were supposed to be cheesy and nonsensical. I laughed at what a silly guy that Ichika was! And so, after rewatching this franchise, I wish to apologize to every person that viewed my list in the last year and saw an 8 or 9. Undoubtedly, you shook your head in shame and wept at my foolishness, withgood reason.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't misunderstand me, I'm not completely disregarding this series. I can understand the viewpoints of both those for and against this show. It's likeable, but please, don't make it out be all that great. It is not the \"bee's knees\", because even people of the 20's wowed by early Mickey Mouse cartoons would probably not be in love with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI'll lay out the few good points first. The animation is good. When I say this, I'm mainly referring to the mecha fight scenes. This has always been the best part of IS, and it continued into the sequel. It's a harem, through and through. So if you're really into that genre, you'll get plenty of haremness to fill your harem quota. Plenty of women fall for the main guy. In fact, aside from his sister and the girl who invented the robot suits, there is not a single female in this show that does not show some romantic interest in our hero. Lastly, IS 2 creates some depth and plot in the new season! Hooray!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in order to discuss the bad stuff, I have to rip apart most of the preceding paragraph. Because IS 2 is bad. It is worse than the original. Yes, IS 1 had its flaws: a moron for a main man, lack of depth or character development, and on and on. So while IS 2 did some things slightly better, the flaws were kept and got worse.\\n\\n\r\nWhat little character depth and romantic progress from the prequel almost completely disappeared. Laura, for example, had some backstory and development. She was originally confident and somewhat headstrong and forward, despite the little attention the show gave her. IS 2 degraded her character, and gave me the impression that she was simply socially naive and blunt. Nothing new is revealed about the other girls either, nor do they do anything but drop semi-subtle romantic hints and act as comedy/fanservice tools. Speaking of which, both comedy and fanservice are reused from the first show, maybe even dumbed down a bit. If you liked the humor in IS 1, rejoice. You're getting the same thing this season.\\n\\n\r\n(One running gag is Ichika getting attacked by his harem. In the first ever episode of IS, they mention regulations and when they're allowed to use their suits, because they make such a big deal about how dangerous Infinite Stratos is. Naturally, this goes out the window for the sake of comedy, and in 24 episodes, the protagonist is ALMOST MURDERED 14 TIMES BY HORMONAL, LOVESICK TEENAGE GIRLS WALKING AROUND WITH THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED WEAPON ON THEIR ARM.)\\n\\n\r\nThere is kind of a plot, I'll give you that. But it fails. It is more present in the show than the 2-episode plot of IS 1, and yet it goes nowhere. You learn someone's name, and her relationship to another character, then nothing else. The bad guys attack throughout the show, but absolutely NOTHING else is revealed. The last two episodes feel incredibly rushed, except nothing really ends and you're left pondering the point of it all.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'm going to torch Ichika, the protagonist. Without a doubt, the lamest and worst protagonist of any I've seen in the almost 20 years I've been alive. Yes, he is dumb and oblivious. He is constantly suprised, embarrassed, or confused. Apparently, his hearing should be checked because he can't hear the comments his harem makes in front of him to each other with clear romantic implications. Often times he plays them off or just doesn't react to any 'subtle' advances, because god forbid the story advance. IS 2 also makes Ichika afraid of women and female contact at times, because his character has to stay fresh, of course. He also cannot win a fight whatsoever. He's pathetic. He's constantly being saved.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, rant over. Basically, there's a reason IS 2 can't even average a 7 out of 10. It's watchable, and it can be enjoyed, but it definitely helps if you are:\\n\r\n-into watching terrible tv/movies\\n\r\n-slightly masochistic\\n\r\n-blind\\n\r\n-deaf",

Aside from the fact that there is a bare minimum of what a \"plot\" there is, the MAIN flaw would have to be how there is this \"alternation\" between plot and no plot every alternate episode.For example, one whole episode would be spent showing how the girls chase Ichika around, and at the last few minutes RIGHT before the credits when Ichika is alone, he gets ambushed by the enemy. And of course, the next whole episode after that is spent resolving the issue. This definitely wasn't the case in the first season, where there was somewhat a blend between the two in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (8/10): Not much to point out here. Since the first season I was always a fan of how the characters were drawn and how they looked. For the soundtrack I prefer the opening and ending song of the first season as compared to this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10): Pretty much no character development at all. Ichika is still dense as hell, like all main characters in all harem type shows. The original 5 girls from the first season are even more clingy to him this time, but with the addition of 2 more girls into the harem and slight personality changes in a few of them as the episodes progress. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): Even though this anime is FILLED with flaws, I still enjoyed certain parts of it, laughing at how absurd some of the scenes are (those which are certainly not possible/probrable in real life). One thing is for sure though, the ending was a letdown since it wasn't a good one anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10): Giving it a 7/10 is really kind of stretching it, when compared to the many other masterpieces out there. Would I recommend this to the people who finished the first season? Not really. It isn't much of a sequel anyways.",

            "content": "Bueno, as the info states this season 2 was compose of chapters from 5 to 8 of the manga and quite frankly the way studio 8-bit executed it was not very impressive compare to season 1, now, it's difficult to say as to whats going on in the mind of this anime's director, Yasuhito Kikuchi and writer, Fukihiko Shimo that they've decide to come out with a season 2 where a clique harem was more profound than the action. Also, the introduction of Tatenashi didn't do much, for I hated her more than the antagonists called \"Phantom task,\" which brings us next subject as towho really is Modoka Orimura? Where, there isn't much info about her, except that she's Ichika's twin sister, such info actually conflicts the notion that it is only Chifuyu and Ichika were the only siblings, all in all this anime has left us with a lot of loose ends where one thing conflicts another. Going back to the harem part, ok, I'm really disappointing that the Ichika X Houki arc becomes more choice than before, in fact it wasn't just Houki, rather it also involves other member of the guy's harem where a newbie Kanzashi joins in. Ichika, for some reason become more like your typical stupid harem guy who allows two new competition to his already complicated romantic situation which proves to be quite annoying for me. So here are my ratings for this pathetic anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, studio 8-Bit just recycled the usual harem thing from season 1, and even with the addition of \"Phantom task,\" and the Sarashiki  sisters didn't help at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt's only the fanservice that interest me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBoth op and ed also interests  me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nIchika- usual harem guy who has gone from dumb to dumber with his harem members and not much improvement with his combat skills.\\n\\n\r\nHouki, Cecilia, Char, Huang and Laura...still hoping to be Ichika's girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sarashiki sisters- with the exception of Kanzashi, Tatenashi was pretty much the girl I hate.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom task- if studio 8-Bit would have given them such air time in a way that they really did a lot of bad ass thing and unable to succeed, then this season 2 would have been more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nModoka- they should have added some info as how she came to be.\\n\\n\r\nChifuyu and Maya- nothing from the ordinary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: same as above.\\n\\n\r\nBoring, so why did I kept watching it up to the end....well, I was hoping for some action where there will be an epic battle between Phantom Task and Ichika with his harem, too bad it ended in a cliffhanger where it's added OVA is yet to be shown next year 2014.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: same\\n\\n\r\nStudio 8-Bit should never had made a season 2 this boring and just leave as a manga. Like I've said season 1 was better than season 2.",

            "content": "I'm going to go ahead and say it. Watching Infinite Stratos 2 is awful. It's an ordeal that no human being should ever have to go through, yet do so anyway because they might have enjoyed the first season, as I did. While it had its flaws, the first season managed to captivate me with its typical harem antics and intriguing premise that, on the surface, seems like it could do really well in today's market. Needless to say, I was excited for the second season. Alas, what we got instead made me feel the need to jump off of the roof of my house.\r\nStory:1\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Infinite Stratos, in my opinion, did a very good job of balancing the amount of plot and pandering that was present in each episode, providing me with an experience that I quite enjoyed. Infinite Stratos 2, on the other hand, takes everything the first season had, and throws it out the window like garbage. To give you an example, the very first episode of season two had about five minutes worth of plot, followed by another twenty minutes of pure, unadulterated yuri pandering  with the two most popular girls, Charlotte and Laura. At first, I was dumbfounded, skeptical even of what I was looking at, and dismissed it, assuming that it would get better. Little did I know that this formula of roughly five minutes of plot to twenty minutes of pointless filler was the entire, fucking season. In all honesty, you can't even enjoy the little plot being presented because of all the bull shit overflowing from the cracks in this terrible excuse of a narrative. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the shows more redeeming qualities, though it still had many problems. Character designs have been changed from the first season, and re-drawn to appear slightly sharper than the previous ones. To be honest, I didn't really have a problem with it, and I actually thought it looked okay, though I still prefer the first season's designs a bit more. What drags the art down, though, is the animation. By God, the animation in this show is so unbelievably bad, it's not even funny. Going back to the first episode, within the first two minutes, I watched Ichika float up from lying on his back to standing up right. That's right, float. Normally, when a person gets up off the ground, they have to get on their knees in order to push themselves into the air. But not Ichika, he just kinda floats from one position to the next. In a similar fashion to the story, I sadly realized that poor animation jobs such as the one present in the first episode was to be expected in the episodes to come, and made the decent looking characters seem like strange aliens in a world that I personally think looked rather nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI don't have a whole lot to say about the music, other than it was pretty good. One of the things that stood out to me during the first season was the surprisingly good soundtrack that really set the mood for many of the scenes in each episode. Season two brings back that same feeling, and I was happy with the outcome, especially considering it is the show's only real highlight. Character voices are also very good, with all the previous cast reprising their roles for each of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Enjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nI decided to lump the character and enjoyment section together considering the two are very closely connected when it comes to Infinite Stratos 2. While I haven't exactly discussed characters much previously, I feel the need to express my opinion on them now. Every character in season two is a honest to God idiot, through and through. Ichika, being at the front of the pack, is about as intelligent as a wooden board, though he really isn't any better than the other characters in the show. However, while every character is essentially the embodiment of idiocy, the thing that pisses me off the most, more so than the story and shitty animation, is the actual changes to character personalities. My favorite girl was Charlotte, and for good reason. In season one, she was introduced as being one of the few truly sane people present, choosing to be rather intelligent that fucking stupid like everyone else. Then season two comes along, and thinks that to make Charlotte more popular than she already is, they need to turn her into a mindless dumb shit as well to make her fit in with the already mentally unstable cast. This is clearly evident in the episode where Charlotte magically has her panties disappear off her body, and decides that the best course of action is to act like nothing's wrong and try to hide it from the rest of the cast rather than consult them for help in fixing her problem. Of course, they all probably wouldn't understand her anyway considering they can't properly process events unfolding before them and jump to conclusions faster than a cheetah runs after its prey. This, in all honesty, is the number one thing that makes this show so unbearable to watch. I could probably live with the awful story and episode pacing. I could deal with the piss poor animation. But to go in and change the actual characters themselves is a crime that I cannot, and will not, stand. If you enjoyed any of the characters in the first season, please, for the love of all that is good in this world, do not watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10\\n",

            "content": "If this is what the anime industry honestly has in store for us, I might as well go live under a rock from now on.\r\nSequels, in all honesty, should build on their predecessor and deliver a new splash of flavor to the series - whether it be a more invigorating plot, new/interesting characters, or a more in-depth back story that does not fail to amaze.\r\nIS: 2 fails to do any of this - it, in fact, is the epitome of everything that can go wrong. \r\nEnter Ichika Oriumra, the same male lead from the first season of IS. You would imagine by this point thathe would undergo some kind of character development - but, in reality, he is as dense as he was in season 1. His dense nature is probably why this anime was just so unbearable - everything about him was very predictable. Someone making a move on him, for example? You can pretty much guess how he would respond.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters do not change much either. They behave and act with all of their weird little strange idiosyncrasies - which is obviously fine up to a point. Their idiosyncrasies are a way for viewers to differentiate between the female leads; I guess you can call them personality \"quirks\", if you will. But where IS 2 goes wrong is that these same \"quirks\" are used over and over, up to the point where it becomes predictable and bland.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also new characters, obviously, but their introductions into the series are incredibly forced. Orimura continues to build his harem, new villains are introduced... you know, the same old cliches and what not. Again, new characters are fine, but what is not fine is their entrance into the series. Each new character appeared in the series just for the heck of it - they were not well-integrated to the surrounding plot (if you could even call it a plot).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is awfully forced too. The plot is too focused too much on the fanservice/harem aspect, and thus, most of the time, it doesn't even seem like there is a plot most of the time. When there is an attempt to make a plot, it flowed extremely poorly - an utter and complete mess.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot execution is flawed too. Here's one example (trying very hard not to spoil anything!): IS 2 attempts to incorporate a number of cut scenes but a lot of the times it is difficult to interpret their true purpose or whether they are even necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe only plus to IS 2 is the art and sound, and even then, there's nothing exceptional there. Which just tells you how bad this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime should be a sin. I try not to give any 1's to any anime series, but IS 2 was just too unbearable for me. If I were you, I would avoid this anime at all cost. I'm not even sure why I decided to suffer through all 12 episodes...\\n\\n\r\nChecklist\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n- The only pro I can think of is the art and sound.\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Poor character development\\n\r\n- Poor incorporation of characters\\n\r\n- Poor execution of plot\\n\r\n- Unrelatable characters\\n\\n\r\n*Sorry that I'm pretty vague about this, I'm trying my hardest not to spoil anything.*",

            "content": "I initially didn't plan on writing a review, but I wanted to more or less try to tell about how... Mixed the feelings when watching this show are.\r\nFirst, it was heavily criticized by the viewers it seems, and like them I totally agree with the negative point. This show was awful in its structure and totally clich\u00e9 with fanservice all the way. No originality.\r\nThere was a plot. We pretty much forgot about it until a few reminders sometimes, the pace is horrible. To make things worse, they rushed it totally at the end of the show, with nothing answered at all even though something wasstarting to get interesting(I liked the little development at the end of episode 10, that was a pure detail but the character was one I liked and it was interesting to see more of what she can do).\\n\r\nAnd there's a awful lot of useless episodes, the main one, totally ridicule, being the one with Charlotte and her disappeared panties, which I didn't enjoy at all... There are a lot of cheesy situations too, while I don't mind, sometimes it's a bit too much (still Charlotte's episode, or the measurements scene, as said by other reviewers. Hell, good thing the action was off-screen because I don't even know HOW he can lack anatomy knowledge to the point of mistaking it this much and how he ends up doing what he does). \\n\r\nHonestly , a few less of those nonsense and a bit more development on the plot or better introduced gags would be welcome. At least, I hope they'll make a season 3 because else that would just be truly a pure shitty show judging from how it ends with questions. TO me, it's bad, but there's worse, and I hope they'll make better in S3. I think this season would have gained some benefits from getting 24 episodes instead of 12 (well, 24 is a bit much, more like 20. Ep 13-15 being plot related to develop a bit of what was going on at the end of 12, 16-17 being a bit more comedy-centered, and back to the plot on 18 to 20 to reveal the intentions, motivations, and some final fights)\\n\\n\\n\r\nYet, I liked it. Well, not as much as I liked others harem shows, but well... aside from the few useless episodes, I liked the clich\u00e9 setting. Yeah, sure, no originality, but why always seeking pure originality? It's also rather enjoyable sometimes to see good ol' scenes in other shows, when you enjoy the genre.\\n\r\nLike, I dunno, Death note. Death Note was a nice thrilling story and I liked it. Then Lost Brain was published with a similar plot (student with great intellect fooling the police with great \"tactics\" and all), and everyone was like \"this is just a death note copy with hypnosis instead of killing books\". Heck, I liked it because it was similar to Death Note! The \"it's not original so I don't like it and don't want to see it\" mentality is comprehensible, but then I think it's a bit of a waste as you can never be allowed to get into the same ambiance than the first you ever read in that style. \\n\r\nSo yeah, I enjoy seeing the harem clich\u00e9, that's rather funny seeing them back. Although I have to say a lot of the gags were bad-written, some were quite enjoyable anyway, as some relaxing show.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand the lassitude of always seeing the same things, and if you're watching a lot of harem oriented shows recently, I suggest you don't watch IS. Not now. What I usually do is getting into periods of anime style: watching a few shows of serious, good plot without much of a comedy (duno, for example, Psycho Pass, Kara no Kyoukai, Shingeki no Kyojin), and then switch the change to mood and not being too overwhelmed by the heaviness, dark ambiance of those animes, by watching a few lighter things, like harem, simple romantic comedy, stories with a plot but still having somewhat of a plot or pure WTF colorful shows (dunno, for example, watching To love, Dog Days, and D frag).\\n\\n\r\nSo indeed the harem cliche was strong, but I did enjoy quite a lot IS and IS2, because that has been a while since I've watched a good old harem show with colorful characters like this. The last light animes that I saw were a bit less clich\u00e9, but not as lively in consequence as there's not a whole bunch of girls trying to get your attention, more like a few scenes here and there without much boldness coming from them.  So it was kinda refreshing seeing a show like IS. Back to IS2, I was grateful for the new characters, Tatenashi being someone that lacked in the harem, the almighty always-plotting-troublemaker who only gets things worse, and is the boldest of all (even if her timing isn't all that great), and yet is strong enough to be able to keep doing this without fear.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the voicecast is good. I was pretty happy to hear Kana Hanazawa, Marina Inoue, Yukari Tamura, Megumi Toyoguchi and Yukana(the last one being awfully rare in the shows I usually watch, yet I really like her. Still, I think Yukana was playing a bit too high-pitched in this). Sure, the show isn't great, but it's rather enjoyable to hear those voices when you like them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to conclude, IS is  a mere continuation of the first season, with an interesting background not exploited at all and it just feels like an horribly long intro plus a few OVA-type episodes mixed in the middle, but while it's not a good show, it's not the worst of what we can see either. It's abit frustrating sometimes, true, but well, just watch it when your brain is off. Seeing IS after a while of not watching typical harem anime can be nice, if you want one without much of a thinking, just for relaxing after a long day.\\n\r\nLet's hope a season 3 will be coming to finally develop that poor plot who was totally neglected during this season.",

            "content": "Ohhhhhhh, Infinite Stratos! How I loladkv----loveevasfdsa-love-hate this! Okay, I'm just kidding I don't actually hate this show, but I am joking when I say I love it. \r\nSeason 1 of this show, was well pretty good. (I'm hesitant on actually writing a review on that season) Not good enough to make me go, \"OH MY GOOOOOOODNESSS!!!\" But more to the point of, hmm, okay let's just watch season 2 of this show, for poops and gigs. \r\nBefore I continue on, if you want someone more experienced, and someone more in depth on this series, go right ahead and skip this read. I do also expectyou to have SOME background knowledge so that I can actually, \"spoil\" some of the more obvious stuff. For those of you who actually read this, thank you. \\n\r\nI have watched 12/12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nStory 3/10 (Let's dive right into it~)\\n\r\nThe story was \"decent\" not a bad plot, it was sort of \"meh.\" The plot itself doesn't really seem to be going anywhere, for the plot is not really a plot. What I mean by this is, sure the main characters have special missions, there's a group of villains, and yeah they fight and square off with each other to see who is the best, it's just that fan service got in the way. In my honest opinion, everything in this season, felt like it was being brought up too late... Timing is key for a good story. Like the villains being introduced at a good time, but not really doing anything a certain episode/s. And before I go on about the fan service, I just wanted to say that the story takes place right after the events of season 1.\\n\r\nThe story and plot got to heavy reliant on the fan service. Now what I really hate about this is that the story was going to be actually pretty good, if you didn't have all this other nonsense going on at the same time. If the creators put in more time and work on the actual story, and got things rolling, instead of making a FULL episode (spoiler, they make an entire episode dumb!), a \"Fanserviceode\" then things might have been different. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nI'm not usually picky when it comes to animation, but like many anime, Infinite stratos just isn't as good as other anime in it's time. The animation is pretty standard, nothing I haven't seen before. Also with the fight scenes I would have wanted more strategic  battles, with cool attacks. Rather than the \"BOOM-KA-PAW-WHAM\" type of explosion animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nWith sound, I'm not that picky either. What I look for in sound, is good opening/s and closing/s. If the show doesn't have these I don't mind, but just make sure to have enough music to not make every scene sound the same. (Which IS did fairly well at.) The music wasn't \"amaze-ballzzz\" but it was probably the best thing about this anime. They didn't really change some of the osts from the first season, which bothered me, because some of them were bad and made the scene a bit awkward. But at the same time some of the music just fits the show to well, for it not to be in there. The voice actors did a nice job also, no complaints on this end. Although, sometimes I just cringe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nWhen I watch anime, I look at the characters and say, \"is that someone I can sort of relate to, or even just hang around with?\" Because for me anime is an escape from my daily life. So when Infinite Stratos made these characters, I got pretty mad, and then just straight up bored. These characters are ALL so one-sided and predictable, AND cliche. You have the dumb MC, and his harem, not much more to say here...\\n\r\nLike I've stated before this show became HIGHLY dependent on the fan service aspect, so when that happened, the characters all went to poo. There was almost no character development at all for the old season 1 characters, and for the new main season 2 characters, the character development was more like 30% development and 70% fan service. Overall, for the character part of the anime, I got bored, I stopped paying attention when the dumb fan service parts happened, and well I even wanted to skip a certain episode... \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nOkay from what I've been stating, this anime looks grim, hella grim. Don't get me wrong, it is hella bad, but that doesn't really mean I didn't enjoy this anime. Actually this anime got a couple laughs from me, in some scenes I actually smiled and hoped for something good to happen. (KEK)   It's just that story/plot and character is all I truly enjoy, sure when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, I love the art and the sound too. But when you strip the 2 main aspects away from me, I feel like this isn't good anymore, it's just there. Sure I enjoyed it, but to a very, very, very limited extent. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 3/10\\n\r\nIn all honesty I was actually pretty hyped up for this season, seemingly only to be disappointed. When you ask me or someone asks me, \"eyyyy, you know any good anime with lots of fan service??\" I'll simply just reply with, \"Watch IS.\" Because that's all Infinite Stratos is, fan service. I'm disappointed because the first season, wasn't this terrible, it was actually quite OK. I simply just hate anime that lose face, and do not use any of its potential and waste it.\\n\r\nI strongly do not recommend this, there are plenty of others that can fill this ones place. But I guess if you are into harems with dumb MC's then this is for you. If you like cat fights with kawaii faces, then this is for you,",

            "content": "\"He's been closing and opening his left hand for a while. When that habit shows up, he usually makes simple mistakes.\"\r\nAnd that mistake my friends, was the second season if IS: Infinite Stratos.\r\nTo start off, let me just say I was a fan of the first season. I understood where everyone was coming from when they were talking about the cliche harem aspects of the anime, as well as the completely dense protagonist, but I enjoyed it anyways! Why? It had good visuals, some of the characters were awesome (IE Charlotte and Laura), and the action scenes? Beautiful. I was looking forward to a season2, hoping for it to be as awesome as the first season, and maybe even find out if Ichika will ever be even the slightest less dense...\\n\\n\r\nBut sadly, my dreams were shattered...\\n\\n\r\nI think the worst thing about this season was the storyline. That's the thing though, there was no storyline. There was the idea of one, but it was never carried out. Instead, what we got were a bunch of filler episodes, with a few action scenes here and there. The fillers ranged from a slutty costume contest, a reenactment of some crazy fairy tale, and trying to get a shy girl who dreams of her prince charming to become friends with an idiot who doesn't realize he has 6 other girls hanging off of him like bananas on a tree. What I was hoping to see was the idea I was previously talking about turn this ruined season into a story that might just save it. Sadly though...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things they did right were the animation and the sound. The animation was beautiful, but the only thing preventing me from giving said animation a 10/10 was the fact that they barely ever put it to good use with action scenes. Instead, they decided that it would be fun to see how graphic they can make a slutty costume competition without getting the video flagged on YouTube. And then there's the sound. I enjoyed most of the actors and actresses' roles, but the thing is, I watched the first season dubbed, mainly because I liked the cast, so it was difficult to get used to the subbed as I watched each episode the day it came out. But in the end I found the subbed version entertaining and well done.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we get down to one of the biggest problems with this season... THE CHARACTERS. The thing is, I still like Charlotte and Laura, but the problem is that they are completely different from the first season... like most of the other girls as well... it seemed like the only thing I was hearing them talk about was how much they loved Ichika, and what they would do to be with him and stuff like that. There were no interesting \"Oh hey, I just learned something new about them\" moments or backstories, just a bunch of girls drooling over the most dense person on the planet. Luckily, there were 2 new characters we got to know... well, at least one of them were okay in my opinion. One of them turned out to be exactly the same as the rest of the girls, but at least the other one had some skepticism about it. But overall, very disappointing to see Charlotte in a sexy dog outfit... wait... I guess it wasn't THAT disappointing... but still...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, IS: Infinite Stratos II was somewhat of a trainwreck... it had it's pros, although there were very few of them, but it had so many cons I really wish I could unwatch season 2 and wait until they release an actual, well done, great story, backstory included season 2. Sadly though, that won't be happening... at least not for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5",

            "content": "Compared to the first season of IS: Infinite Stratos, the second season feels very similar. Just like the first season, the mecha theme is brought back, along with the harem, the ecchiness, the gag. In simpler words, it doesn't feel like anything has changed. \r\nLike other harem animes, IS: Infinite Stratos 2 brings a cast of girls chasing one guy, but the difference is that the setting is in a girls-only school with the protagonist, Ichika, the sole male in the school. Judging it as a harem anime, sure, this is a pretty smart idea. However, since both the characters and the story are ridiculouslyweak, the anime as a whole simply cannot be taken seriously, similar to many other harem animes. We have the prototypical protagonist boy whose strong male presence (considering he is the only male in the school) attracts a whole lot of girls, but he is oblivious towards their feelings. We have two types of girls in the school: the first type is the type that falls in love with him for no reason at all, and the second type is the type that falls in love with him because he promised to protect them. Basically, the characters are very one-dimensional, sounds very similar to the first season, right? Charlotte is the only girl who has an enjoyable and understandable character, which is why she is also the best character across both seasons. The story is a minor improvement from the first season, since at least a few episodes have antagonists in them (the Phantom Task), but it is still very poor, as the story is full of holes and a very important antagonist gets introduced out of nowhere, which leaves me wondering many many times, \"Who the **** is that? Why the **** is she not introduced in the first season? What the **** is wrong with this storyline???\"\\n\\n\r\nOther minor aspects are just OK. Art is what you would typically expect in a mecha anime. The ISs look pretty good, characters are like any other anime characters, animations are average, nothing to \"Wow\" about. Sound is also average, but it does its job to fit in with the anime. You're not going to hear any sound that's going to make you cry or fire you up. \\n\\n\r\nAmong all these negative aspects of this anime, the one shining star is: it draws cheap laughs out of you. This anime isn't going to leave a lasting impression like Steins;Gate does or Gintama does, this anime isn't going to give you an anime hero that you will think about for the next week like Death Note does or One Piece does. The most you should expect is laughing at silly, ecchi scenes with tsundere girls. Bored? Want a break from your routine? Want to laugh at stupid things and drool over breasts? This is it, this anime is for you.",

Somehow, that last season was enough to warrant a sequel despite its awfulness.\r\nThe good thing is, it builds itself on top of its predecessor. The bad thing is, it builds itself on top of its predecessor.\r\nI'm gonna review this based on the assumption that you people who're reading this have seen the first season. If you live through that, than you just might live through this.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nWith the same setting as the previous season, the story didn't reallychange much.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around, they tried to incorporate more Action. They even have an evil group now! But alas, it was all for naught. Because the evil group didn't really do other things aside from being, well, evil.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all that happened really. Bad guys does bad things, then was stopped by the students with personal IS.\\n\\n\r\nBut the amount of action is still overshadowed by the FANSERVICE!!!\\n\r\nReally, every episode is some kind of Boob Showroom. It's really annoying\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSame thing with the previous season too. The new ISes' designs are rather awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSame ol', same ol'\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1/10\\n\\n\r\nCan I rant here a little? Really? Okay here goes...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so goddamn boring!\\n\\n\r\nEspecially Ichika! I know that guy is supposed to be clueless. But the level of his cluelessness this season is so annoying it almost killed me!\\n\\n\r\nI never knew i can get irritated by a character that much...\\n\\n\r\n(Rant over)\\n\\n\r\nThe girls didn't really change much. \\n\r\nAlthough there are two new members to the harem.\\n\\n\r\nThey're sisters, Tatenashi and Kanzashi.\\n\\n\r\nTatenashi, the older one, is the Student Council President and acts like a bigger sister. A perverted one at that. And even though there's literally no reason for her to fall in love with Ichika, she fell for it anyway\\n\\n\r\nKanzashi, the younger one, hates Ichika at first due to some things. But since he's so nice, she fell for him too. \\n\\n\r\nBecause a guy who can accidentaly grab boobs every episode is a nice guy everyone loves.\\n\\n\r\nThe enemy characters are mostly boring, except for one, whose name i'm not gonna say. But even then, she didn't even get deve... screw development! They didn't even EXPLAIN, why she's like that. Even by the end of the season, we know nothing about this girl!\\n\\n\r\nSo Character-wise, IS2 was a flop\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis thing must be crazy popular in Japan, because aside from... well... i can't really think of any good things to set aside.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this thing is worth to watch, if you like School Life Mecha that much, you can always watch Valvrave.\\n\\n\r\n*shudder*... Valvrave... *shudder*",

The first season wasn't the greatest thing ever animated but how far are you willing to fall before you fall into the abyss known as IS2? Read on please!\r\nSTORY: 1\r\nOne could argue there is no story! Only emptiness. There is a story however and it sucks. If they had no specific storyline and instead centered on tournaments fighting for Ichika's happy sacks until they graduated, I would be totally unopposed to it and it would've garnered it a 7 or 8. Unfortunatelyit follows the light novels, and the light novel does something extremely groundbreaking: It puts in an evil organization. Never mind how original the name \"Phantom Task\" is. (Say it out loud! it sends shivers down your spine!). No anime or manga has ever DARED  put in an evil organization into their storyline. EARTH SHATTERING! The planet is desperately trying to glue itself back together! Help! I'm entering space!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5\\n\\n\r\nIS2 gets half a full score only for it's character design. The girls are quite preetee!! I want to hold hands with Charlotte Dunois, pet Laura Bodewig's head, spy on Cecelia Alcott while she makes toilet, wipe my nuts all over Huang Lingyin's sleeping face, and ambush Houki Shinonono with my golden shower as she washes up after kendo practice. IS2 does not fail with the pretty ladeez!\\n\\n\r\nThey introduce two new chracters: Tatenashi the student council president (because that's required in every high school harem) and her ugly sister who would look fine without glasses but sadly only exists to serve those with a fetish for NURDZ!\\n\\n\r\nIchika Orimura.. Has changed.. During the first season he had this expression on his face that made him seem like a 5 year old in a older teen's body - In other words he looked like an idiot. Now Ichika is a cool calm Harley driving thug who takes nothing from no one and takes everything from everyone. He looks that way at least.\\n\\n\r\nHowever one character really pissed me off. Tabane Shinonono the genius rabbit chimp hybrid. I enjoyed her in the first season, she was quite adorable and moe. However, her scene in the final episode was the most cringe inducing thing I've ever seen. It was bad enough they introduced a cliche \"secret organization\" into the mix but now they try to make the cute random critter-like Tabane all BA and overpowered in a scene that may have got some of you excited, but made me slap my hand right through my head. It's stuck in there and I can not see!!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED for the first season were great. The OP for the second season on the other hand SUCKED! The ED was aight doe'.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack production team really messed up picking this anime to create music for. They did wonderfully but there talents could have gone to a show that deserved it much more.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints. The art and character design are great. As usual the mecha battles are excellently rendered although the \"technology\" (such as the mechs user interface) designs are very questionable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYABILITY: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show makes me want to barf into my lap just so I can see the barf and barf again to ease the nausea from watching this piece of shit. This is possibly the wor- wait what?? an 8?? N*GGA IS U HIGH?\\n\\n\r\nYea that's right! This show is very enjoyable! Yeaaa I said it! Overall this definitely deserves a 4, possibly less but the enjoyablity deserves an 8! ECHHI IS EPIC! EIE..IO! AND ON HIS FARM HE HAD A TSUNDERE! EIEIO! WITH A ITS NOT LIKE I WANTED TO HERE AND A ITS NOT LIKE A WANTED TO THERE! While the \"main plot\" is cringe worthy and should be blocked out of your mind sit back relax with a six pack and enjoy the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is highly recommended! FOR ANTS!!",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos 2 is the anime equivalent of a lobotomy. An anime so insipid, so devoid of intelligent thought that a trip to the garbage can would likely yield something more interesting. Maybe you'll feel dirty afterwards, but hey, at least you won't receive brain damage for it. \r\nI struggle to think of a single good thing to say when describing Infinite Stratos 2. Even the absolute worst of the medium (from the infamous Mars of Destruction to the nonsensical Cipher) can at least be laughed at in their awfulness. Not Infinite Stratos. It is everything wrong with the harem genre and the anime industryas a whole, assembled into one cretinous pile of filth. You would need standards so low that they pass the Earth's core and leave the other side of the planet in order to appreciate this trash. Nothing went right. Everything went wrong. Hell, this is awful even by the first season's standards.\\n\\n\r\nAllow me to describe one of Infinite Stratos' most asinine scenes. In the sixth episode, Charlotte finds herself in a situation where her panties have magically disappeared. Rather than simply tell Ichika the situation like any sensible person would, she convinces herself that lifting her skirt and directly showing him is the only way to get her point across. Ichika does as she asks and looks. Her response? \"Pervert!\"\\n\\n\r\nAnother scene involves Ichika being forced to take body measurements of all the girls in the school (which every single one of them is happy about for some incomprehensible reason). He closes his eyes, so embarrassed by female cleavage, thinking to himself that a measuring tape does not require eyes to see. His complete lack of understanding about human anatomy results in him fondling the girl. Every single member of his harem then appears out of thin-air and catches him in the act, screaming and assaulting him as the camera pans away. \\n\\n\r\nEven from the very first episode, we know that a trainwreck awaits. The antagonist walks down a dark corridor and meets five soldiers armed with assault rifles. They open fire... and all the bullets somehow manage to land in front of her feet or behind her. She jumps into the air, pulls out two pistols and shoots them all with perfect accuracy. Yep. Even the most brainless of Hollywood blockbusters aim for better than this, but I suppose Infinite Stratos never cared for quality in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe final episode is the most brain-damaging of all. The antagonist's sidekick willingly reveals to one of the girls the location of a hidden bomb, and the main antagonist then unleashes a laser attack on thirty or forty armed mech soldiers, annihilating them all instantly. Of course Ichika (the most worthless soldier in the entire school) and the members of his harem can take her on in a one-on-one fight, however. As the final insult to the audience's intelligence, a deus ex machina unfolds, placed in direct sight of the enemy at the most convenient time possible. They then escape, and the story ends with a random onsen scene wherein Ichika passes out in the girl's bath. OK.\\n\\n\r\nI do not know how a show so stupid could have ever been produced. Even putting aside the abysmal writing, the harem aspect (the anime's sole appeal) fares no better. The two new additions to his harem (Tatenashi and Kanzashi) suddenly fall in love with Ichika for no bloody reason at all. In the case of Kanzashi, all Ichika ever had to do was smile a lot and play the white knight role once for her to be head over heels for him. There are so many damn members to his harem that you may as well just throw in the entire school at this point. What do they even see in Ichika, anyway? He is one of the most insipid protagonists ever created, absent of any personality. The animators should have just drawn a rock instead - at least that way there would be one less thing to infuriate the audience. \\n\\n\r\nAside from having the intellect of a toddler, Ichika has the maturity of one, too. He is so adverse to any female contact (even visibly cringing in one scene where a girl's breasts rub against his arm) that you would ordinarily assume he is a homosexual. The fact that he has seven girls blatantly chasing after him and does not recognise it is a testament to how dreadful his characterisation is. A decent harem series would have the protagonist aware long before this point, if not already actively pursuing one of the girls. Future harem anime should take notes from Sora no Otoshimono and HenNeko, and treat Infinite Stratos like the plague that it is. \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the female characters are just as bad. Even the two with a brain (Houki and Charlotte) inevitably fall victim to the show's abysmal writing. The most obnoxious is by far Cecilia, her voice so excruciating that it would be more appropriate in the 9 Circles of Hell. Lin on the other hand has about as much presence as a shadow while Kanzashi lacks any sort of personality or defining feature except \"has glasses\". \\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 is terrible even from a technical perspective. All of the action scenes are rendered in low-budget CG and many times the characters' faces will look as if they were drawn by a 10-year-old with a cheap \"How to Draw Manga\" textbook. The soundtrack is also rubbish and comprises mainly of elevator music and a tuba endlessly making the same two-three notes. During the action scenes, the music is so turgid and over-dramatic that it almost becomes hilarious when combined with the infantile dialogue. \\n\\n\r\nIt is rare to find an anime as bad as Infinite Stratos. It is the exact kind of tripe that gives anime such a bad image in mainstream society. Regardless of whether you enjoy the harem genre or despise it, absolutely nothing of value will be found here. Even as mindless entertainment it fails miserably. Avoid it like the plague, or better yet, convince yourself that it doesn't even exist. You will save yourself some sanity that way. \\n\\n\r\nIf this is the future of the anime industry, then god help us.",

            "content": "There was once a time in the early years of the 2000s where Harem shows were one of the more popular genres of anime even in a few parts of the western world with titles such as Tenchi Muyo and Love Hina. Though the former wasn\u2019t loved because of this specific trope, the latter show had indeed put the genre more focus on the anime community at large with its quirky cast of characters. Nowadays the harem genre isn\u2019t as it once was, not really in terms of merit but in popularity so to speak. Once in a while, we get one that does tryto put different ideas on how to view the genre in terms of parody, comedy, and character development. But there are some that don\u2019t try to do anything unique to it as a whole and most likely felt like could\u2019ve been a lost harem idea back in say, 2002 at most.\\n\\n\r\nNow we have the 2nd season of Infinite Stratos. The continuation of a series that the majority of people, even fans of Harem, show no restraint in voicing their hatred of it. Somehow, it has gone to sell like hotcakes despite its lack of authenticity of being anything more than drab and generic. Now, even with all of this in mind, the one question that pops into my head is: Why is this show getting all of the attention from people buying up all the OVAs and BDs when there are better harem shows out there and are even continuing to this day?\\n\\n\r\nSome that come to mind are Hentai Ouji, Sora no Otoshimono, To Love Ru Darkness, Kore wa Zombie, and Haganai. All of which have an infinite amount of personality and creativity to their comedic writing and overall creative charisma that the series could ever have in its little world. But, of course, I\u2019d have to explain why I think of Infinite Stratos this way, but the only reason I bring this whole comparison thing up is just that\u2026there isn\u2019t that much to say about this next installment in the franchise, other than the fact that it pales in comparison to shows like it.\\n\\n\r\nThere are indeed some awful characteristics to be made public about the 2nd season. It\u2019s quite apparent to see how badly written the story is for something like Infinite Stratos, but what makes it even more perplexing is just how there\u2019s so little plot, to begin with. What little serious drama that is present comes across as muddled and overly not well-paced at all. All it is is just the characters going through separate kinds of problems that typically might involve Ichika to help them that eventually leads to him in a suggestive situation involving him getting kicked or beaten to a bloody pulp for accidentally peaking on them changing or saying something that made them blush. From what you could get out of from this description I made, you might think of it as a good thing that they\u2019re sacrificing plot to put more emphasis on comedy that can succeed. Unfortunately, this sacrifice only provided a lukewarm reception in all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe way to describe the comedy in Infinite Stratos in one word is \u201chaphazard.\u201d There\u2019s hardly any clever gags to most of the jokes to the point where it\u2019s almost as if the writers copy-and-pasted the jokes on the scene in question and prayed that the audience would get a laugh from it. A few do garner a little chuckle here and there, but the vast majority don\u2019t even deserve a snicker in the slightest. We\u2019ve all seen the typical Onsen and the accidental peeking scene in every harem show in existence, so why keep milking it to the people who are already tired of it? I\u2019m sure there are many people who don\u2019t mind that kind of humor but there comes a time when they need to at least inject new life into these kinds of jokes. If not, it\u2019s going to be the equivalent of getting your face getting passively slapped multiple times by the people who come up with this day after day.\\n\\n\r\nNot only do the writers not put in any new effort into the jokes themselves, but even the ones that they wrote are so muddled and confused on its reason for existing in the first place. One prime example is when Charlotte forgot to wear her panties and she\u2019s too embarrassed to tell it to Ichika, for some reason that is never explained. When she finds out later that they are back on, after being noted by Laura, she pulls up her skirt and tells Ichika to look at them even though he didn\u2019t want to. Despite this, she still feels embarrassed and calls him a pervert, despite the fact she had no problem to tell him to look. It\u2019s almost as if the writers forgot what the punchline was supposed to be and, what I assume in a desperate attempt at trying to be smart, just with the generic route of letting Charlotte call him a pervert for no reason. Good job on that one guys.\\n\\n\r\nWith the writing automatically becoming a one trick pony, the overall character castdoesn\u2019tt provide better reception but there are a few that do get some laughs. The new character Sarashiki is quite humorous in her attempts on being sneaky and conniving in messing with Ichika and his romances, even with her muddled reasoning for liking Ichika in the first place. But the charms pretty much stops there in the 2nd half when her appearances are only brief and we have to sit through her sister who just doesn\u2019t have anything going for her other than that she\u2019s there to fill out the 2nd to the last arc that hardly amounts to anything other than her being Ichika\u2019s next girl in his harem. As for the rest, they don\u2019t really improve on from the 1st season nor do they really decline in quality either since they weren\u2019t even that strong to being with other than being cute girls. Strangely enough, Lingyin hardly makes an impression in this season, which might indicate that she might have been the least popular of the girls, even though personally Cecilla would\u2019ve been the more reasonable choice.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Ichika, the main protagonist, who is just about the by-the-book harem protagonist that you could ever find out of the entire catalog of dense male protagonists. It\u2019s safe to say that Ichika represents what most otaku love to see, a poor guy that acts so brainless to his own male hormones that he can\u2019t even muster up the courage to express his true emotions so that they can feel better about themselves. Here\u2019s a pretty unique idea: How about a strong male protagonist who actually acts like how an actual male at his age would do at that typical scenario? Now I\u2019m not saying that being a total pervert openly is a good thing nor does this indicate that we need more protagonist to think of females as nothing but sex objects. But when you\u2019re like me and you constantly see someone like Ichika that does the same shtick where he always acts like he doesn\u2019t have any interest in any of the girls yet somehow later on does and he can\u2019t find the courage to admit it openly, you\u2019d think that we would be tired of this kind of thing around 2005, but nope.\\n\\n\r\nThe technical prowess of the show aren\u2019t of any special value because of the generic designs of the mechs, the really average attempts on CG, and the average character designs; though admittedly the girl designs are definitely colorful and nice to look at. Not to mention the opening and ending animation is almost like they recycled some of the animation that we saw in the previous ones in the first season. Then we have the ensemble cast, to which I must ask how in the name of all that is good and decent did these talented seiyuus signed up again for this? I mean granted Kana Hanazawa is in every show that comes out these days, but actresses like Yoko Hikasa, Chiwa Saito, and Inoue Marina really deserved better to be in something else than this. They do their best attempts at trying to be charming as usual, but even with those in mind, it doesn\u2019t really dull out the pain of going through mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nThis could\u2019ve been an attempt at trying to pull out a full-blown rant into tearing this show apart like some of my colleagues are willing to do but in all honesty, as far as harems go, you could sit through way worse. You could probably dig deeper into the lost collection of thrown out harem shows that have even been dumped by the studios themselves in the past and see how so much worse they can be. However, since Infinite Stratos is headed by a well-known studio as of now, it can definitely be seen as a high-profile failure in trying to reboot the series for a second season that was in dire straits of regaining some merit, if there was ever one to be found to begin with. Not something that I would ever in my life ever watch fully again, maybe only a few amusing clips of it, but as I said before, I\u2019ve seen way worse.\\n\\n\r\nGrade: D+\\n",

            "content": "Chances are that if you are plan on watching Infinite Stratos 2, you probably want to see how the story goes on between Ichika and the friends he has made at IS Academy in this brand new adventure. After all, season 1 didn\u2019t end with an exactly a high note with its indecisive conclusion. Yes, I\u2019m talking about Ichika and his dense mind along with the irrational decisions he makes. The story itself only had some moments that shined while others fell under the typical harem tropes with little development. Unfortunately, Infinite Stratos 2 doesn\u2019t get any better. In fact, it went backwards and becameeven worse. It\u2019s a continuation of a story that set itself on a time bomb ticking away at its destruction. \\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 is the sequel of the first season based off of the light novel in the same name written by Izuru Yumizuru. The series continues directly from season 1 with a young man named Orimura Ichika. To refresh some memory, Ichika is the first male pilot of the exoskeleton mech known as the IS (Infinite Stratos). Because the system was designed for female pilots, Ichika becomes the first user of the technology.  The government obviously has plans for him and sent him directly to the world famous IS Academy. That means it\u2019s a paradise for him because he is set to an academy where everywhere around him is: girls.\\n\\n\r\nLike I mentioned previously, this series begins exactly where the first season left off. Ichika is still the talk of the academy because of his status and kindness. It\u2019s no surprise that girls are interested in him in some way because most if not all of them came from a girls-only school previously. Among these girls include the return of the five female protagonists known as Houki, Cecilia, Ling, Charlotte, and Laura. Although most of them had some spotlights in season 1, this sequel puts them to shame. Their development is in ashes because the a big chunk of the series concentrates on some nonsense where everyone tries to get Ichika\u2019s attention. Unfortunately, Ichika is dense as ever and hardly understands any of the girls\u2019 attempts. In fact, he seems them a sign of gratitude while all the while being ignorant of its intentions. This comes early in the series in many shapes and sizes. These include the typical pool episode, absurd cosplays, surprise party extravaganza with absurd gags, and even an entire episode dedicated to a pair of panties plying around the lost & found game. While all this seems to fun at first, it quickly grows old because of the lack of depth in its fun.The comedy is also killed thanks to Ichika\u2019s dense personality.\\n\\n\r\nOn more a directional side, the series does contain a story that expands further somewhat. Even in harem series like this, there is a story because the concept is serious with the IS being part of the system. In this sequel, the story introduces two new characters - one of them with an authoritative control, skill of a pilot, and ability to flirt with Ichika like no tomorrow. There\u2019s some problems wrong with her character though. For one thing, she seems almost too perfect. Furthermore, Ichika is confused throughout the series as to her true intentions. Her smile often seems to be a like a mask that hides her purpose as a facade. But behind that smile also lies a girl whose skills is unrivaled in IS combat. To make matter worse for the girls though, she seems to be also possesses the skill to tame all of Ichika\u2019s harem. Initially, she stands out as the boss of the series, like a game that the girls must overcome.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is also another character that represents the opposite of her. It\u2019s quite odd seeing Ichika interact with her as someone that hardly gives him any attention. In many ways, she represents the opposite of the typical girls in this harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nTo say that Infinite Stratos 2 completely sicks under the ocean with no chance of salvage is also an exaggeration though. Despite the lack of development or engaging storyline, the sequel does expand on a more darker side as the characters learns the existence of an organization. Their purpose stands for what terrorism is and their actions speaks louder than words. In fact, this organization declares war against IS Academy along with Ichika and his friends. There is also some mystery related to one particular member of this organization whom bares a strikingly similar appearance to another character from the series. Calling herself by a name that shocks Ichika, she becomes a pivotal antagonist that brings out the dark side of IS.\\n\\n\r\nAction wise, Infinite Stratos surprisingly has some decent movements with its mechanics. The system itself is designed to fight efficiently in almost any circumstances. Also depending on the skill of the user, each IS has its own specialization or customized weapon that can inflict additional damage. In this sequel, new models are introduced with even more devastating abilities. The new models also gives them an impressive look from its exterior with its threatening design. Even with the harem tropes all over the place, the IS does stand in as a prominent factor as each time they are shown on screen, the camera angles focus exclusively on them with a more detailed look.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, that\u2019s not where the only place where the camera points to...\\n\\n\r\nThe fanservice is all over the place in this sequel. It shouldn\u2019t surprise viewers considering the way season one was handled. However, the show goes on with even from the beginning such as Laura crawling into Ichika\u2019s bed or the swimsuits coming off just because. Cosplay also seems to make its way into this sequel because the show wants to try out some new ideas to cover all the field of a harem anime. This includes the form of odd animal outfits with skin bearing. There\u2019s a hidden reason behind this but is definitely one that Ichika is not pleased with. Even when he doesn\u2019t try it, Ichika is the center of attention just because of who he is. There\u2019s almost no credibility in any of the characters\u2019 attachment to Ichika in this sequel either thanks to a lack of exploration in their past/histories with Ichika. The characterization is shallow and doesn\u2019t get anywhere. Even when there\u2019s some hope, there are those moment killers (thanks to our new characters) that ruins the fun for Ichika; if he even depicts as fun in the first place. It\u2019s absurd, idiotic, and a disgrace to the main story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork wise, the series maintain the same style as the original. What that means is the characters all retain their generic designs. Most of them retain the way they still look while new characters make their way with their flashy introductions. The new threat that is presented in this sequel does bring out a dangerous outlook but also confusion as one of the characters has a familiar outlook. Unfortunately, her character is never really explained at all so you\u2019ll be guessing who she is towards the end. Our main male protagonist Ichika doesn\u2019t even change an inch in either his outer or inner appearance. There\u2019s little to in depth with any of the designs besides the Infinite Stratos models. Luckily, the backgrounds of the series is rich enough to give the feeling of a high level technology environment. The way both the inner and outer exterior of Infinite Stratos Academy is designed stays true to its terms by standards of high level technology. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t really mean much with its generic traits that is thrown almost everywhere artistically.\\n\\n\r\nThe standards of its soundtrack has a so-so presentation judging by the OST. Most of the action scenes contains an explosive tone thanks to its intensity. Like mentioned before, the primary concept of IS means serious business so the series portrays it seriously with its standards. The OP song True Blue Traveler foreshadows some ideas of what to expect from season 2 while at the same time throws generic concepts all over the place. Kouki Uchiyama also returns as the voice actor of Ichika whom surprisingly has a decent acting ability that portrays the typical harem lead well. New characters voiced by Chiwa Sato and Suzuko Mimori also represents their characters well despite their opposite personalities. To say the least, the soundtrack department isn\u2019t half bad but honestly, that isn\u2019t saying much.\\n\\n\r\nFinishing this series should only be a priority if you want to see how the franchise concludes rather than expecting greatness from it. There\u2019s nothing really great about this sequel considering its lack of characterization, poorly constructed plot clustered with fan service , generic subplots, and weak progression. This adaptation also omits some parts from the light novel that could have enhanced the comedic side of the sequel. Unfortunately, it backfires in the end. There\u2019s no doubt some fans will be disappointed at how this show turned out to be. Infinite Stratos 2 is a perfect example of an adaptation gone wrong with no redemption. There might not of been infinite possibilities to expand this continuation. However, the excuse of its story is beyond miserable. So if you plan to watch this series, I\u2019d recommend you to hit the fast forward to save some time. Time for you isn\u2019t infinite after all\u2026\\n",

            "content": "Sometimes at night when I'm having trouble sleeping, I find myself wondering; if you could shove in as many dere heroines as possible (with individual fanservice, of course) into an anime, what would it look like? My highly philosophical questions of utter importance have been answered: IS 2. In a way, I'm genuinely impressed. How did they think of this? Or rather, how did they not think of anything else than stereotypical characters falling in love with the main character which, coincidentally, has the stereotypical brain that consists of concrete. Is he supposed to be portrayed as stupid? If so, apologize to the stupid people,as they (the whole population of idiots) have been portrayed faultly.\\n\\n\r\nI had somewhat high hopes for the first season of IS, since it sounded cool for a 16-year-old me, and they even managed to get me to watch through it without smashing my head into a wall. Impressive. Now, with a critical eye to it as well, I'm disappointed in the 16-year-old me. This entire series has been nothing but a disgrace. The first season of IS did indeed try to progress, albeit slowly, but there was without a doubt some progress. The second season just seems like the producers gave up and threw girls at the fans. Yay, sex and stuff. Although I'm used to fanservice taking place more and more in anime (which, by the way, is not a good thing), IS 2 is on a whole new level. As I said, it feels like they simply threw the storyboard away and let everything happen as it happened. Like they didn't give a shit.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything good (or rather, something to not really complain about) in IS 2, it ought to be the animation. It would literally be better if the whole series were the fighting scenes combined into one long (not really) fight. But noooooooo, the producers chose to draw figure-8's and got a brilliant idea.\\n\\n\r\nI give IS2 the final rating suicidal tendencies out of 10.\\n",

Of course this isn't the first time it did this *cough* season one *cough* but this time I was really,really, really let down.\r\nThe story from season one.... really didn't move. Even though the series did have some highlights like mecha fights, getting chased...by girls, misunderstandings...., andhow Cecilia can't cook to save her life. All those high...lights... But don't worry guys and girls! We have two new characters!\\n\\n\r\nLike most sequels to any animes, Infinite Stratos also gives us new characters, two new characters. You guessed it! A student council president and her sister! The Sarashiki sisters (Tatenashi and Kanzashi) both have blue hair and are totally \"totes\" for Ichika...you know like how the rest of the school is....The other characters, that play as the villain,Madoka Orimura, who obviously is not Chifuyu and Ichika sister, does not get much screening time. And once she does, she is there to just make shit happen. Leaving out explanations, and leaving the viewers with sooooo much questions just to be turned down with ass and tit shots. (Did I mention that Ichika forgets his own birthday. Seriously, who does that?)\\n\\n\r\nYou know the art was the only thing this anime could have kept going on. The art was pretty much on par as any 8-Bit producers want it to be. Seeing how this anime is one who like to show off cleavage, I could pretty much tell that they were going to emphasize on the \"jiggles\" and they did deliver on the \"jiggles\".\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was fine. Nothing special, it's pretty much the same as season one but it seems like there was not enough \"umph\" into it anymore.\\n\\n\r\nI like harems. I like ecchi. \"If\" (huge if) they are done right. Examples are Zero No Tsukaima, Sekirei...Hell, I could even say Highschool of the Dead had more plot than this pathetic excuse for a harem. Honestly, my thoughts haven't changed since season one nor has my enjoyment. I have read a few pages of the light novels and they are pretty much the same. Really disappointing but really I wasn't hoping much, just a little. And that little hope got tossed out to the nearest four way intersection, right in the middle of street. The reason why I was hoping just a little change, was because of some other series with the same genres and elements, changed during the second season. Examples are Boku wa Tomodachi, Sekirei, Kore wa Zombie Desu ka?.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend IS: Infinte Stratos. Yes, only if you like to lose more brain cells.",

            "content": "With an ending as open as Infinite Stratos's was, there was a lot to expect when the sequel was announced a little over a year later. As with most sequels, people come to expect that with the introductions and character building out of the way, a fresh start can open new possibilities for the title to showcase with more air time. Unfortunately, there are titles that take advantage of this gargantuan amount of free space and use it to try and attract a larger audience through obscene amounts of fan service and the unnecessary plot devices that arise out of it. While these types ofsequels are fine and dandy toward those who expect nothing of the series, Infinite Stratos 2 tries to do the unthinkable: combine illogically contrived fan service with a full-fledged plot focus.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 starts off where the debut season ended; with Ichika Orimura and his band of merry miracles flying through their schoolwork as if it didn't mean a thing, and to all fairness, it probably doesn't. What this anime likes to portray, especially in this current season, is the mirage of a typical harem/slice of life series with some added robotic plot devices for good measure. However, later on, it tries to force itself into a plotline involving an unknown team of evil-doers that really have no purpose in the series except for driving Ichika, the bland, uninspiring main male character, to show off his use in times of dire need; in typical shounen fashion. When a large amount of time spent on a series is contributed to fan service and moments of unrivaled bliss, it's hard to incorporate a necessary dose of serious scenarios to it. With Infinite Stratos 2, it's the equivalent of driving a monster truck into a library; it's loud, obnoxious, and ultimately as far a match as anyone could imagine.\\n\\n\r\nTo spice up more of the fun that is Infinite Stratos, the series takes it upon itself to introduce two new characters: Tatenashi and Kanzashi Sarashiki. Conveniently enough, these two characters are sisters, which only provides an excuse to give some characterization to the younger of the two, Kanzashi. Somewhat of an instigator of the fan service that arises, Tatenashi is the self-proclaimed student body president of the school that all of the original characters attend. With that symbol of invincibility, Tatenashi places Ichika into inconvenient situations that most other males of his age group would probably trade for anything. As Tatenashi causes trouble for our hero, Kanzashi is the complete opposite, as most series like to portray this template for sisters. Kanzashi is timid, vulnerable, an introvert, and a whiz with computers. She gets the most amount of character development than any other character in the series, but only for a limited time, as is typical of harems. While Kanzashi's entire arc feels natural and fresh, Tatenashi seems to pop up out of nowhere whenever both trouble and an instance for fan service comes to fruition. Overall, they're mostly remembered for their blue hair.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of the fan service can't be compared to the original source of the madness. Cecilia, Laura, Charlotte, Houki, and Lingyin are as presentable as ever whenever meaningless plot shows its ugly face. Throughout this season, however, each of these character don't get an equal amount of screen time. During the first season, Ichika's childhood friend, Houki, was focused on as the prime suitor for Ichika's affection, and it seemed as though she had a good shot at him as a romantic interest. Unfortunately for those who cared, Houki is barely even shown outside of scenes where Ichika is placed in a precariously obscene situation. Lingyin is also noticeably missing from most of the series as well, with her being the least shown original character out of all of them. Cecilia, Charlotte, and Laura all get their own individual arcs of varying lengths and substance. All of them are forgettable to a point and laughably silly. It seems that Infinite Stratos 2 wanted to put more emphasis on the original characters' assets and Tatenashi moving the chaos along than trying to develop these characters into more than simply plastic.\\n\\n\r\nWith this series being notorious for fan service, it's safe to say that the art suits the desires of those who view it. With two years difference, Infinite Stratos 2's artwork is noticeably more full of shine than its predecessor. The character designs remain the same, as though the series wanted to remain nostalgic, with the student uniforms and shaky CGI looking as though they were cut straight from the first season. What was noticeable to a point, however, was the CGI itself. What's different about the CGI within the second season is that the quality isn't different whatsoever. During minimal movements, the machines are still shaky and lazily bulky. The animation comes to shine when the action comes into view. Although, with the amount of time spent on the characters' assets, those watching could forget that the IS machines even exist. For those who are expecting any action from this series could look forward to the ending sequences of this anime. Whether or not the ending disappoints you, at least it will look presentable.\\n\\n\r\nWhy not try and make it better? While fan service and an overexaggerated amount of female body parts isn't enough to completely disregard an anime's effort, it's hard not to cringe when an anime tries too hard to be something it isn't. Infinite Stratos 2 wants to be something fantastic, something so fantastic that it can combine fan service and dramatic, life-threatening predicaments into a giant heap of animated excellence. The harder it tries, the easier it is to expose its flaws, and it certainly has them; lots of them. Perhaps if this series tried to be one or the other, maybe it wouldn't seem so forced. Instead, it's everything in one and it couldn't feel any more like wasted potential.",

            "content": "I've read a couple of reviews bashing IS2 quite heavily now and whilst I feel that many of their points are justified and I agree with most of them... I can't help but feel the need to throw this series a life-line. For a summary skip to 'enjoyment' section.\r\nStory: 5\r\nThe only word I can think of to describe the story in IS2 in a nut-shell would have to be 'filler'. \r\nThe story is effectively non-existent consisting mostly of the girls (Ichika's harem - which he remains completely oblivious to as is now a custom with harems echii or not as it would seem) throwing theirboobs and panties thrown in every possible direction with the occasional fight here and there... (here it comes) ... HOWEVER...  whilst this season is effectively fan-service there is a small plot running throughout that left me wondering 'how long until #### goes down' with a sense of excitement.\\n\r\nIn addition a number of the antics that were thrown into the mix left me laughing or giggling at the very least and I liked the art quite a lot too.\\n\\n\r\nI think the issue people have here is that things don't 'go down' until the end where things finally begin to heat up, but even then there isn't a conclusive end to the arc... This leaves me with the feeling that the producers are planning to develop it in a third season (or at-least I hope - I'm not sure how closely it follows the manga either). I know its hopeful but it really could pull the series back into perspective story wise.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nNice art work which felt fluent and well drawn throughout the series with some nice detail on the IS's (which are used more than you might think they would after reading comments about the story). The characters looked fairly good including in any echii scenes for those who are interested.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nSound was average in all honesty with ok intro and outro music. Although some credit has to be given to the voice actors who did a decent job (I'd be shocked if they didn't considering some of the talent there).\\n\\n\r\ncharacter: 5\\n\r\nAll of the characters remain the same throughout this season as you (probably and if you haven't then go look at the first series) saw at the end of the first without any character development what so ever; even the 'near-ish romantic' bit is completely forgotten about for all those hopefuls.\\n\r\nThe only glint of development from season 1's characters arises from Ichika's big sis which is towards the end if at-all. \\n\r\nThe saving grace (if it can be called that) is the introduction of two new characters of which one shows some development over a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall despite a stagnant story, very little character development and feeling slightly let-down from season 1 as a result... I somehow really enjoyed this series to put it bluntly. I loved some of the scenario's however cliche some of them may be simply because of how they were executed. I liked the well-drawn art style and loved the battles that were included in it (though I wish the battles were focused on a little more and I've seen more 'epic battles' in other anime). I can't quite explain it... All I can say is that despite its criticisms IS2 is still worth a watch & that I'm still left wanting a season 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I'm gonna start off by saying I've always hated Infinite Stratos. I was unfortunate to be invited in by the concept alone, expecting some good science-fiction action. I was very upset only to find it to be a very poorly written and generic harem with few redeeming qualities. However, I looked forward to the second season with almost no expectations, only to find that it had slaughtered said redeeming qualities from the first season.\r\nIn case you didn't know what Infinite Stratos is all about, let me remind you: It's set in the near future where the eponymous weaponized armors are the norm in military warfare.The only drawback is that only females can pilot them, and so the Infinite Stratos Academy was founded for the sole purpose of training future pilots. However, the main protagonist, Ichika Orimura, is the only male who can pilot an IS. Throw him inside an all-girls school and harem antics ensue. Dumb, cliche harem antics.\\n\\n\r\nThat's it. The first season never goes on with that premise because apparently harem is more important. Most harem anime tend to be rather flimsy when it comes to story and plot development, but in Infinite Stratos 2, \"story\" does not even exist. There's a group of terrorists known as Phantom Task who want to kill Ichika and his older sister, Chifuyu, for unexplained reasons. There's a certain plot point with a member of Phantom Task named Madoka, who is revealed to be Chifuyu's evil twin sister and has a vendetta against her for unexplained reason. That's right, \"unexplained reasons\" is pretty much how this entire season runs on. Any plot threads concerning this are left completely unfinished. Wouldn't it be a good idea to actually elaborate on who these guys are and why they're doing bad stuff? According to the writing staff, apparently not. They only take action for about less than two and a half episodes total. All other episodes is basically \"How much can we pander to the viewers' cocks until their nutbladder explodes? I mean, nobody will care about the lack of character and plot when we can give something for our viewers to fap to every week.\" A whole season of filler had better writing than this.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters: First, you got Ichika himself who is just your standard harem protagonist whose about as dense as a brick. Then you got his harem; all but only one or two are nothing but generic cookie cutter stereotypes who has about as much personality as a piece of cardboard. But wait, there's more: They're unique from other harem girls in that they're a multinational harem! So you got the Japanese childhood friend/abusive tsundere, the German girl who hides weapons in her locker, the Chinese tsundere, the English chick, and the French reverse trap. All of them have nothing special about them and they only want Ichika because he's the only male in school. You might as well throw the entire student body at his bones, while you're at it.\\n\\n\r\nProduction values are decent for the most part. The music is forgettable, much like the first season. One thing I actually did like about this was the IS designs and the battle scenes. Even if the harem part was badly written, the fight scenes kept me entertained, even if it isn't the major focus as I hoped it would. Unfortunately, harem comes above all else in Infinite Stratos, so the military warfare part is left high and dry.\\n\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos in general is not a good anime, let alone a good harem show. This mistake known as the second season turns it into an unsalvagable, burning wreck. There have been very few good harem anime in this day and age, but this is just another one tossed under the \"pathetic\" pile. And the second season shoved it into the \"worst ever\" pile. If 8-bit were smart, they should save themselves even more embarrassment and don't even bother with greenlighting a third season because it won't fix anything. Instead, just do the right thing and leave Infinite Stratos to die in its own filth.",

            "content": "Wow. It's hard to decide where to begin. I suppose I should mention in advance that the first season of IS was one of the first anime I had ever watched, and I was naive enough to think, \"This is pretty good!\" I assumed the dialogue and plot were supposed to be cheesy and nonsensical. I laughed at what a silly guy that Ichika was! And so, after rewatching this franchise, I wish to apologize to every person that viewed my list in the last year and saw an 8 or 9. Undoubtedly, you shook your head in shame and wept at my foolishness, withgood reason.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, don't misunderstand me, I'm not completely disregarding this series. I can understand the viewpoints of both those for and against this show. It's likeable, but please, don't make it out be all that great. It is not the \"bee's knees\", because even people of the 20's wowed by early Mickey Mouse cartoons would probably not be in love with this show.\\n\\n\r\nI'll lay out the few good points first. The animation is good. When I say this, I'm mainly referring to the mecha fight scenes. This has always been the best part of IS, and it continued into the sequel. It's a harem, through and through. So if you're really into that genre, you'll get plenty of haremness to fill your harem quota. Plenty of women fall for the main guy. In fact, aside from his sister and the girl who invented the robot suits, there is not a single female in this show that does not show some romantic interest in our hero. Lastly, IS 2 creates some depth and plot in the new season! Hooray!\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, in order to discuss the bad stuff, I have to rip apart most of the preceding paragraph. Because IS 2 is bad. It is worse than the original. Yes, IS 1 had its flaws: a moron for a main man, lack of depth or character development, and on and on. So while IS 2 did some things slightly better, the flaws were kept and got worse.\\n\\n\r\nWhat little character depth and romantic progress from the prequel almost completely disappeared. Laura, for example, had some backstory and development. She was originally confident and somewhat headstrong and forward, despite the little attention the show gave her. IS 2 degraded her character, and gave me the impression that she was simply socially naive and blunt. Nothing new is revealed about the other girls either, nor do they do anything but drop semi-subtle romantic hints and act as comedy/fanservice tools. Speaking of which, both comedy and fanservice are reused from the first show, maybe even dumbed down a bit. If you liked the humor in IS 1, rejoice. You're getting the same thing this season.\\n\\n\r\n(One running gag is Ichika getting attacked by his harem. In the first ever episode of IS, they mention regulations and when they're allowed to use their suits, because they make such a big deal about how dangerous Infinite Stratos is. Naturally, this goes out the window for the sake of comedy, and in 24 episodes, the protagonist is ALMOST MURDERED 14 TIMES BY HORMONAL, LOVESICK TEENAGE GIRLS WALKING AROUND WITH THE WORLD'S MOST ADVANCED WEAPON ON THEIR ARM.)\\n\\n\r\nThere is kind of a plot, I'll give you that. But it fails. It is more present in the show than the 2-episode plot of IS 1, and yet it goes nowhere. You learn someone's name, and her relationship to another character, then nothing else. The bad guys attack throughout the show, but absolutely NOTHING else is revealed. The last two episodes feel incredibly rushed, except nothing really ends and you're left pondering the point of it all.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'm going to torch Ichika, the protagonist. Without a doubt, the lamest and worst protagonist of any I've seen in the almost 20 years I've been alive. Yes, he is dumb and oblivious. He is constantly suprised, embarrassed, or confused. Apparently, his hearing should be checked because he can't hear the comments his harem makes in front of him to each other with clear romantic implications. Often times he plays them off or just doesn't react to any 'subtle' advances, because god forbid the story advance. IS 2 also makes Ichika afraid of women and female contact at times, because his character has to stay fresh, of course. He also cannot win a fight whatsoever. He's pathetic. He's constantly being saved.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, rant over. Basically, there's a reason IS 2 can't even average a 7 out of 10. It's watchable, and it can be enjoyed, but it definitely helps if you are:\\n\r\n-into watching terrible tv/movies\\n\r\n-slightly masochistic\\n\r\n-blind\\n\r\n-deaf",

            "content": "When the second season of Infinite Stratos was first announced, I couldn't wait for it to come out. The first two episodes were fine, but from there on it just went downhill. \r\nStory (5/10): The first season of Infinite Stratos helps to put in place most of the characters seen in Season 2. At least back then, there was something to be achieved, unlike this continuation of a series. Aside from the fact that there is a bare minimum of what a \"plot\" there is, the MAIN flaw would have to be how there is this \"alternation\" between plot and no plot every alternate episode.For example, one whole episode would be spent showing how the girls chase Ichika around, and at the last few minutes RIGHT before the credits when Ichika is alone, he gets ambushed by the enemy. And of course, the next whole episode after that is spent resolving the issue. This definitely wasn't the case in the first season, where there was somewhat a blend between the two in each episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound (8/10): Not much to point out here. Since the first season I was always a fan of how the characters were drawn and how they looked. For the soundtrack I prefer the opening and ending song of the first season as compared to this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (5/10): Pretty much no character development at all. Ichika is still dense as hell, like all main characters in all harem type shows. The original 5 girls from the first season are even more clingy to him this time, but with the addition of 2 more girls into the harem and slight personality changes in a few of them as the episodes progress. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10): Even though this anime is FILLED with flaws, I still enjoyed certain parts of it, laughing at how absurd some of the scenes are (those which are certainly not possible/probrable in real life). One thing is for sure though, the ending was a letdown since it wasn't a good one anyway.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10): Giving it a 7/10 is really kind of stretching it, when compared to the many other masterpieces out there. Would I recommend this to the people who finished the first season? Not really. It isn't much of a sequel anyways.",

            "content": "Bueno, as the info states this season 2 was compose of chapters from 5 to 8 of the manga and quite frankly the way studio 8-bit executed it was not very impressive compare to season 1, now, it's difficult to say as to whats going on in the mind of this anime's director, Yasuhito Kikuchi and writer, Fukihiko Shimo that they've decide to come out with a season 2 where a clique harem was more profound than the action. Also, the introduction of Tatenashi didn't do much, for I hated her more than the antagonists called \"Phantom task,\" which brings us next subject as towho really is Modoka Orimura? Where, there isn't much info about her, except that she's Ichika's twin sister, such info actually conflicts the notion that it is only Chifuyu and Ichika were the only siblings, all in all this anime has left us with a lot of loose ends where one thing conflicts another. Going back to the harem part, ok, I'm really disappointing that the Ichika X Houki arc becomes more choice than before, in fact it wasn't just Houki, rather it also involves other member of the guy's harem where a newbie Kanzashi joins in. Ichika, for some reason become more like your typical stupid harem guy who allows two new competition to his already complicated romantic situation which proves to be quite annoying for me. So here are my ratings for this pathetic anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, studio 8-Bit just recycled the usual harem thing from season 1, and even with the addition of \"Phantom task,\" and the Sarashiki  sisters didn't help at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt's only the fanservice that interest me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nBoth op and ed also interests  me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Pathetic 1.\\n\\n\r\nIchika- usual harem guy who has gone from dumb to dumber with his harem members and not much improvement with his combat skills.\\n\\n\r\nHouki, Cecilia, Char, Huang and Laura...still hoping to be Ichika's girl.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Sarashiki sisters- with the exception of Kanzashi, Tatenashi was pretty much the girl I hate.\\n\\n\r\nPhantom task- if studio 8-Bit would have given them such air time in a way that they really did a lot of bad ass thing and unable to succeed, then this season 2 would have been more enjoyable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nModoka- they should have added some info as how she came to be.\\n\\n\r\nChifuyu and Maya- nothing from the ordinary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: same as above.\\n\\n\r\nBoring, so why did I kept watching it up to the end....well, I was hoping for some action where there will be an epic battle between Phantom Task and Ichika with his harem, too bad it ended in a cliffhanger where it's added OVA is yet to be shown next year 2014.   \\n\\n\r\nOverall: same\\n\\n\r\nStudio 8-Bit should never had made a season 2 this boring and just leave as a manga. Like I've said season 1 was better than season 2.",

            "content": "I'm going to go ahead and say it. Watching Infinite Stratos 2 is awful. It's an ordeal that no human being should ever have to go through, yet do so anyway because they might have enjoyed the first season, as I did. While it had its flaws, the first season managed to captivate me with its typical harem antics and intriguing premise that, on the surface, seems like it could do really well in today's market. Needless to say, I was excited for the second season. Alas, what we got instead made me feel the need to jump off of the roof of my house.\r\nStory:1\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Infinite Stratos, in my opinion, did a very good job of balancing the amount of plot and pandering that was present in each episode, providing me with an experience that I quite enjoyed. Infinite Stratos 2, on the other hand, takes everything the first season had, and throws it out the window like garbage. To give you an example, the very first episode of season two had about five minutes worth of plot, followed by another twenty minutes of pure, unadulterated yuri pandering  with the two most popular girls, Charlotte and Laura. At first, I was dumbfounded, skeptical even of what I was looking at, and dismissed it, assuming that it would get better. Little did I know that this formula of roughly five minutes of plot to twenty minutes of pointless filler was the entire, fucking season. In all honesty, you can't even enjoy the little plot being presented because of all the bull shit overflowing from the cracks in this terrible excuse of a narrative. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the shows more redeeming qualities, though it still had many problems. Character designs have been changed from the first season, and re-drawn to appear slightly sharper than the previous ones. To be honest, I didn't really have a problem with it, and I actually thought it looked okay, though I still prefer the first season's designs a bit more. What drags the art down, though, is the animation. By God, the animation in this show is so unbelievably bad, it's not even funny. Going back to the first episode, within the first two minutes, I watched Ichika float up from lying on his back to standing up right. That's right, float. Normally, when a person gets up off the ground, they have to get on their knees in order to push themselves into the air. But not Ichika, he just kinda floats from one position to the next. In a similar fashion to the story, I sadly realized that poor animation jobs such as the one present in the first episode was to be expected in the episodes to come, and made the decent looking characters seem like strange aliens in a world that I personally think looked rather nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nI don't have a whole lot to say about the music, other than it was pretty good. One of the things that stood out to me during the first season was the surprisingly good soundtrack that really set the mood for many of the scenes in each episode. Season two brings back that same feeling, and I was happy with the outcome, especially considering it is the show's only real highlight. Character voices are also very good, with all the previous cast reprising their roles for each of the characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters and Enjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nI decided to lump the character and enjoyment section together considering the two are very closely connected when it comes to Infinite Stratos 2. While I haven't exactly discussed characters much previously, I feel the need to express my opinion on them now. Every character in season two is a honest to God idiot, through and through. Ichika, being at the front of the pack, is about as intelligent as a wooden board, though he really isn't any better than the other characters in the show. However, while every character is essentially the embodiment of idiocy, the thing that pisses me off the most, more so than the story and shitty animation, is the actual changes to character personalities. My favorite girl was Charlotte, and for good reason. In season one, she was introduced as being one of the few truly sane people present, choosing to be rather intelligent that fucking stupid like everyone else. Then season two comes along, and thinks that to make Charlotte more popular than she already is, they need to turn her into a mindless dumb shit as well to make her fit in with the already mentally unstable cast. This is clearly evident in the episode where Charlotte magically has her panties disappear off her body, and decides that the best course of action is to act like nothing's wrong and try to hide it from the rest of the cast rather than consult them for help in fixing her problem. Of course, they all probably wouldn't understand her anyway considering they can't properly process events unfolding before them and jump to conclusions faster than a cheetah runs after its prey. This, in all honesty, is the number one thing that makes this show so unbearable to watch. I could probably live with the awful story and episode pacing. I could deal with the piss poor animation. But to go in and change the actual characters themselves is a crime that I cannot, and will not, stand. If you enjoyed any of the characters in the first season, please, for the love of all that is good in this world, do not watch this show. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 2/10\\n",

            "content": "If this is what the anime industry honestly has in store for us, I might as well go live under a rock from now on.\r\nSequels, in all honesty, should build on their predecessor and deliver a new splash of flavor to the series - whether it be a more invigorating plot, new/interesting characters, or a more in-depth back story that does not fail to amaze.\r\nIS: 2 fails to do any of this - it, in fact, is the epitome of everything that can go wrong. \r\nEnter Ichika Oriumra, the same male lead from the first season of IS. You would imagine by this point thathe would undergo some kind of character development - but, in reality, he is as dense as he was in season 1. His dense nature is probably why this anime was just so unbearable - everything about him was very predictable. Someone making a move on him, for example? You can pretty much guess how he would respond.\\n\\n\r\nThe other main characters do not change much either. They behave and act with all of their weird little strange idiosyncrasies - which is obviously fine up to a point. Their idiosyncrasies are a way for viewers to differentiate between the female leads; I guess you can call them personality \"quirks\", if you will. But where IS 2 goes wrong is that these same \"quirks\" are used over and over, up to the point where it becomes predictable and bland.\\n\\n\r\nThere are also new characters, obviously, but their introductions into the series are incredibly forced. Orimura continues to build his harem, new villains are introduced... you know, the same old cliches and what not. Again, new characters are fine, but what is not fine is their entrance into the series. Each new character appeared in the series just for the heck of it - they were not well-integrated to the surrounding plot (if you could even call it a plot).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is awfully forced too. The plot is too focused too much on the fanservice/harem aspect, and thus, most of the time, it doesn't even seem like there is a plot most of the time. When there is an attempt to make a plot, it flowed extremely poorly - an utter and complete mess.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot execution is flawed too. Here's one example (trying very hard not to spoil anything!): IS 2 attempts to incorporate a number of cut scenes but a lot of the times it is difficult to interpret their true purpose or whether they are even necessary.\\n\\n\r\nThe only plus to IS 2 is the art and sound, and even then, there's nothing exceptional there. Which just tells you how bad this anime is.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime should be a sin. I try not to give any 1's to any anime series, but IS 2 was just too unbearable for me. If I were you, I would avoid this anime at all cost. I'm not even sure why I decided to suffer through all 12 episodes...\\n\\n\r\nChecklist\\n\r\nStory: 2\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\r\nOverall: 1\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr\\n\r\nPros\\n\r\n- The only pro I can think of is the art and sound.\\n\r\nCons\\n\r\n- Poor character development\\n\r\n- Poor incorporation of characters\\n\r\n- Poor execution of plot\\n\r\n- Unrelatable characters\\n\\n\r\n*Sorry that I'm pretty vague about this, I'm trying my hardest not to spoil anything.*",

            "content": "I initially didn't plan on writing a review, but I wanted to more or less try to tell about how... Mixed the feelings when watching this show are.\r\nFirst, it was heavily criticized by the viewers it seems, and like them I totally agree with the negative point. This show was awful in its structure and totally clich\u00e9 with fanservice all the way. No originality.\r\nThere was a plot. We pretty much forgot about it until a few reminders sometimes, the pace is horrible. To make things worse, they rushed it totally at the end of the show, with nothing answered at all even though something wasstarting to get interesting(I liked the little development at the end of episode 10, that was a pure detail but the character was one I liked and it was interesting to see more of what she can do).\\n\r\nAnd there's a awful lot of useless episodes, the main one, totally ridicule, being the one with Charlotte and her disappeared panties, which I didn't enjoy at all... There are a lot of cheesy situations too, while I don't mind, sometimes it's a bit too much (still Charlotte's episode, or the measurements scene, as said by other reviewers. Hell, good thing the action was off-screen because I don't even know HOW he can lack anatomy knowledge to the point of mistaking it this much and how he ends up doing what he does). \\n\r\nHonestly , a few less of those nonsense and a bit more development on the plot or better introduced gags would be welcome. At least, I hope they'll make a season 3 because else that would just be truly a pure shitty show judging from how it ends with questions. TO me, it's bad, but there's worse, and I hope they'll make better in S3. I think this season would have gained some benefits from getting 24 episodes instead of 12 (well, 24 is a bit much, more like 20. Ep 13-15 being plot related to develop a bit of what was going on at the end of 12, 16-17 being a bit more comedy-centered, and back to the plot on 18 to 20 to reveal the intentions, motivations, and some final fights)\\n\\n\\n\r\nYet, I liked it. Well, not as much as I liked others harem shows, but well... aside from the few useless episodes, I liked the clich\u00e9 setting. Yeah, sure, no originality, but why always seeking pure originality? It's also rather enjoyable sometimes to see good ol' scenes in other shows, when you enjoy the genre.\\n\r\nLike, I dunno, Death note. Death Note was a nice thrilling story and I liked it. Then Lost Brain was published with a similar plot (student with great intellect fooling the police with great \"tactics\" and all), and everyone was like \"this is just a death note copy with hypnosis instead of killing books\". Heck, I liked it because it was similar to Death Note! The \"it's not original so I don't like it and don't want to see it\" mentality is comprehensible, but then I think it's a bit of a waste as you can never be allowed to get into the same ambiance than the first you ever read in that style. \\n\r\nSo yeah, I enjoy seeing the harem clich\u00e9, that's rather funny seeing them back. Although I have to say a lot of the gags were bad-written, some were quite enjoyable anyway, as some relaxing show.\\n\\n\r\nI can understand the lassitude of always seeing the same things, and if you're watching a lot of harem oriented shows recently, I suggest you don't watch IS. Not now. What I usually do is getting into periods of anime style: watching a few shows of serious, good plot without much of a comedy (duno, for example, Psycho Pass, Kara no Kyoukai, Shingeki no Kyojin), and then switch the change to mood and not being too overwhelmed by the heaviness, dark ambiance of those animes, by watching a few lighter things, like harem, simple romantic comedy, stories with a plot but still having somewhat of a plot or pure WTF colorful shows (dunno, for example, watching To love, Dog Days, and D frag).\\n\\n\r\nSo indeed the harem cliche was strong, but I did enjoy quite a lot IS and IS2, because that has been a while since I've watched a good old harem show with colorful characters like this. The last light animes that I saw were a bit less clich\u00e9, but not as lively in consequence as there's not a whole bunch of girls trying to get your attention, more like a few scenes here and there without much boldness coming from them.  So it was kinda refreshing seeing a show like IS. Back to IS2, I was grateful for the new characters, Tatenashi being someone that lacked in the harem, the almighty always-plotting-troublemaker who only gets things worse, and is the boldest of all (even if her timing isn't all that great), and yet is strong enough to be able to keep doing this without fear.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the voicecast is good. I was pretty happy to hear Kana Hanazawa, Marina Inoue, Yukari Tamura, Megumi Toyoguchi and Yukana(the last one being awfully rare in the shows I usually watch, yet I really like her. Still, I think Yukana was playing a bit too high-pitched in this). Sure, the show isn't great, but it's rather enjoyable to hear those voices when you like them.\\n\\n\r\nSo, to conclude, IS is  a mere continuation of the first season, with an interesting background not exploited at all and it just feels like an horribly long intro plus a few OVA-type episodes mixed in the middle, but while it's not a good show, it's not the worst of what we can see either. It's abit frustrating sometimes, true, but well, just watch it when your brain is off. Seeing IS after a while of not watching typical harem anime can be nice, if you want one without much of a thinking, just for relaxing after a long day.\\n\r\nLet's hope a season 3 will be coming to finally develop that poor plot who was totally neglected during this season.",

In my honest opinion, everything in this season, felt like it was being brought up too late... Timing is key for a good story. Like the villains being introduced at a good time, but not really doing anything a certain episode/s. And before I go on about the fan service, I just wanted to say that the story takes place right after the events of season 1.\\n\r\nThe story and plot got to heavy reliant on the fan service. Now what I really hate about this is that the story was going to be actually pretty good, if you didn't have all this other nonsense going on at the same time. If the creators put in more time and work on the actual story, and got things rolling, instead of making a FULL episode (spoiler, they make an entire episode dumb!), a \"Fanserviceode\" then things might have been different. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nI'm not usually picky when it comes to animation, but like many anime, Infinite stratos just isn't as good as other anime in it's time. The animation is pretty standard, nothing I haven't seen before. Also with the fight scenes I would have wanted more strategic  battles, with cool attacks. Rather than the \"BOOM-KA-PAW-WHAM\" type of explosion animation. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nWith sound, I'm not that picky either. What I look for in sound, is good opening/s and closing/s. If the show doesn't have these I don't mind, but just make sure to have enough music to not make every scene sound the same. (Which IS did fairly well at.) The music wasn't \"amaze-ballzzz\" but it was probably the best thing about this anime. They didn't really change some of the osts from the first season, which bothered me, because some of them were bad and made the scene a bit awkward. But at the same time some of the music just fits the show to well, for it not to be in there. The voice actors did a nice job also, no complaints on this end. Although, sometimes I just cringe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 2/10\\n\r\nWhen I watch anime, I look at the characters and say, \"is that someone I can sort of relate to, or even just hang around with?\" Because for me anime is an escape from my daily life. So when Infinite Stratos made these characters, I got pretty mad, and then just straight up bored. These characters are ALL so one-sided and predictable, AND cliche. You have the dumb MC, and his harem, not much more to say here...\\n\r\nLike I've stated before this show became HIGHLY dependent on the fan service aspect, so when that happened, the characters all went to poo. There was almost no character development at all for the old season 1 characters, and for the new main season 2 characters, the character development was more like 30% development and 70% fan service. Overall, for the character part of the anime, I got bored, I stopped paying attention when the dumb fan service parts happened, and well I even wanted to skip a certain episode... \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 4/10\\n\r\nOkay from what I've been stating, this anime looks grim, hella grim. Don't get me wrong, it is hella bad, but that doesn't really mean I didn't enjoy this anime. Actually this anime got a couple laughs from me, in some scenes I actually smiled and hoped for something good to happen. (KEK)   It's just that story/plot and character is all I truly enjoy, sure when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, I love the art and the sound too. But when you strip the 2 main aspects away from me, I feel like this isn't good anymore, it's just there. Sure I enjoyed it, but to a very, very, very limited extent. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict 3/10\\n\r\nIn all honesty I was actually pretty hyped up for this season, seemingly only to be disappointed. When you ask me or someone asks me, \"eyyyy, you know any good anime with lots of fan service??\" I'll simply just reply with, \"Watch IS.\" Because that's all Infinite Stratos is, fan service. I'm disappointed because the first season, wasn't this terrible, it was actually quite OK. I simply just hate anime that lose face, and do not use any of its potential and waste it.\\n\r\nI strongly do not recommend this, there are plenty of others that can fill this ones place. But I guess if you are into harems with dumb MC's then this is for you. If you like cat fights with kawaii faces, then this is for you,",

            "content": "\"He's been closing and opening his left hand for a while. When that habit shows up, he usually makes simple mistakes.\"\r\nAnd that mistake my friends, was the second season if IS: Infinite Stratos.\r\nTo start off, let me just say I was a fan of the first season. I understood where everyone was coming from when they were talking about the cliche harem aspects of the anime, as well as the completely dense protagonist, but I enjoyed it anyways! Why? It had good visuals, some of the characters were awesome (IE Charlotte and Laura), and the action scenes? Beautiful. I was looking forward to a season2, hoping for it to be as awesome as the first season, and maybe even find out if Ichika will ever be even the slightest less dense...\\n\\n\r\nBut sadly, my dreams were shattered...\\n\\n\r\nI think the worst thing about this season was the storyline. That's the thing though, there was no storyline. There was the idea of one, but it was never carried out. Instead, what we got were a bunch of filler episodes, with a few action scenes here and there. The fillers ranged from a slutty costume contest, a reenactment of some crazy fairy tale, and trying to get a shy girl who dreams of her prince charming to become friends with an idiot who doesn't realize he has 6 other girls hanging off of him like bananas on a tree. What I was hoping to see was the idea I was previously talking about turn this ruined season into a story that might just save it. Sadly though...\\n\\n\r\nOne of the few things they did right were the animation and the sound. The animation was beautiful, but the only thing preventing me from giving said animation a 10/10 was the fact that they barely ever put it to good use with action scenes. Instead, they decided that it would be fun to see how graphic they can make a slutty costume competition without getting the video flagged on YouTube. And then there's the sound. I enjoyed most of the actors and actresses' roles, but the thing is, I watched the first season dubbed, mainly because I liked the cast, so it was difficult to get used to the subbed as I watched each episode the day it came out. But in the end I found the subbed version entertaining and well done.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we get down to one of the biggest problems with this season... THE CHARACTERS. The thing is, I still like Charlotte and Laura, but the problem is that they are completely different from the first season... like most of the other girls as well... it seemed like the only thing I was hearing them talk about was how much they loved Ichika, and what they would do to be with him and stuff like that. There were no interesting \"Oh hey, I just learned something new about them\" moments or backstories, just a bunch of girls drooling over the most dense person on the planet. Luckily, there were 2 new characters we got to know... well, at least one of them were okay in my opinion. One of them turned out to be exactly the same as the rest of the girls, but at least the other one had some skepticism about it. But overall, very disappointing to see Charlotte in a sexy dog outfit... wait... I guess it wasn't THAT disappointing... but still...\\n\\n\r\nOverall, IS: Infinite Stratos II was somewhat of a trainwreck... it had it's pros, although there were very few of them, but it had so many cons I really wish I could unwatch season 2 and wait until they release an actual, well done, great story, backstory included season 2. Sadly though, that won't be happening... at least not for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5",

            "content": "Compared to the first season of IS: Infinite Stratos, the second season feels very similar. Just like the first season, the mecha theme is brought back, along with the harem, the ecchiness, the gag. In simpler words, it doesn't feel like anything has changed. \r\nLike other harem animes, IS: Infinite Stratos 2 brings a cast of girls chasing one guy, but the difference is that the setting is in a girls-only school with the protagonist, Ichika, the sole male in the school. Judging it as a harem anime, sure, this is a pretty smart idea. However, since both the characters and the story are ridiculouslyweak, the anime as a whole simply cannot be taken seriously, similar to many other harem animes. We have the prototypical protagonist boy whose strong male presence (considering he is the only male in the school) attracts a whole lot of girls, but he is oblivious towards their feelings. We have two types of girls in the school: the first type is the type that falls in love with him for no reason at all, and the second type is the type that falls in love with him because he promised to protect them. Basically, the characters are very one-dimensional, sounds very similar to the first season, right? Charlotte is the only girl who has an enjoyable and understandable character, which is why she is also the best character across both seasons. The story is a minor improvement from the first season, since at least a few episodes have antagonists in them (the Phantom Task), but it is still very poor, as the story is full of holes and a very important antagonist gets introduced out of nowhere, which leaves me wondering many many times, \"Who the **** is that? Why the **** is she not introduced in the first season? What the **** is wrong with this storyline???\"\\n\\n\r\nOther minor aspects are just OK. Art is what you would typically expect in a mecha anime. The ISs look pretty good, characters are like any other anime characters, animations are average, nothing to \"Wow\" about. Sound is also average, but it does its job to fit in with the anime. You're not going to hear any sound that's going to make you cry or fire you up. \\n\\n\r\nAmong all these negative aspects of this anime, the one shining star is: it draws cheap laughs out of you. This anime isn't going to leave a lasting impression like Steins;Gate does or Gintama does, this anime isn't going to give you an anime hero that you will think about for the next week like Death Note does or One Piece does. The most you should expect is laughing at silly, ecchi scenes with tsundere girls. Bored? Want a break from your routine? Want to laugh at stupid things and drool over breasts? This is it, this anime is for you.",

Somehow, that last season was enough to warrant a sequel despite its awfulness.\r\nThe good thing is, it builds itself on top of its predecessor. The bad thing is, it builds itself on top of its predecessor.\r\nI'm gonna review this based on the assumption that you people who're reading this have seen the first season. If you live through that, than you just might live through this.\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nWith the same setting as the previous season, the story didn't reallychange much.\\n\\n\r\nThis time around, they tried to incorporate more Action. They even have an evil group now! But alas, it was all for naught. Because the evil group didn't really do other things aside from being, well, evil.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all that happened really. Bad guys does bad things, then was stopped by the students with personal IS.\\n\\n\r\nBut the amount of action is still overshadowed by the FANSERVICE!!!\\n\r\nReally, every episode is some kind of Boob Showroom. It's really annoying\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSame thing with the previous season too. The new ISes' designs are rather awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nSame ol', same ol'\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 1/10\\n\\n\r\nCan I rant here a little? Really? Okay here goes...\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are so goddamn boring!\\n\\n\r\nEspecially Ichika! I know that guy is supposed to be clueless. But the level of his cluelessness this season is so annoying it almost killed me!\\n\\n\r\nI never knew i can get irritated by a character that much...\\n\\n\r\n(Rant over)\\n\\n\r\nThe girls didn't really change much. \\n\r\nAlthough there are two new members to the harem.\\n\\n\r\nThey're sisters, Tatenashi and Kanzashi.\\n\\n\r\nTatenashi, the older one, is the Student Council President and acts like a bigger sister. A perverted one at that. And even though there's literally no reason for her to fall in love with Ichika, she fell for it anyway\\n\\n\r\nKanzashi, the younger one, hates Ichika at first due to some things. But since he's so nice, she fell for him too. \\n\\n\r\nBecause a guy who can accidentaly grab boobs every episode is a nice guy everyone loves.\\n\\n\r\nThe enemy characters are mostly boring, except for one, whose name i'm not gonna say. But even then, she didn't even get deve... screw development! They didn't even EXPLAIN, why she's like that. Even by the end of the season, we know nothing about this girl!\\n\\n\r\nSo Character-wise, IS2 was a flop\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis thing must be crazy popular in Japan, because aside from... well... i can't really think of any good things to set aside.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think this thing is worth to watch, if you like School Life Mecha that much, you can always watch Valvrave.\\n\\n\r\n*shudder*... Valvrave... *shudder*",

The first season wasn't the greatest thing ever animated but how far are you willing to fall before you fall into the abyss known as IS2? Read on please!\r\nSTORY: 1\r\nOne could argue there is no story! Only emptiness. There is a story however and it sucks. If they had no specific storyline and instead centered on tournaments fighting for Ichika's happy sacks until they graduated, I would be totally unopposed to it and it would've garnered it a 7 or 8. Unfortunatelyit follows the light novels, and the light novel does something extremely groundbreaking: It puts in an evil organization. Never mind how original the name \"Phantom Task\" is. (Say it out loud! it sends shivers down your spine!). No anime or manga has ever DARED  put in an evil organization into their storyline. EARTH SHATTERING! The planet is desperately trying to glue itself back together! Help! I'm entering space!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 5\\n\\n\r\nIS2 gets half a full score only for it's character design. The girls are quite preetee!! I want to hold hands with Charlotte Dunois, pet Laura Bodewig's head, spy on Cecelia Alcott while she makes toilet, wipe my nuts all over Huang Lingyin's sleeping face, and ambush Houki Shinonono with my golden shower as she washes up after kendo practice. IS2 does not fail with the pretty ladeez!\\n\\n\r\nThey introduce two new chracters: Tatenashi the student council president (because that's required in every high school harem) and her ugly sister who would look fine without glasses but sadly only exists to serve those with a fetish for NURDZ!\\n\\n\r\nIchika Orimura.. Has changed.. During the first season he had this expression on his face that made him seem like a 5 year old in a older teen's body - In other words he looked like an idiot. Now Ichika is a cool calm Harley driving thug who takes nothing from no one and takes everything from everyone. He looks that way at least.\\n\\n\r\nHowever one character really pissed me off. Tabane Shinonono the genius rabbit chimp hybrid. I enjoyed her in the first season, she was quite adorable and moe. However, her scene in the final episode was the most cringe inducing thing I've ever seen. It was bad enough they introduced a cliche \"secret organization\" into the mix but now they try to make the cute random critter-like Tabane all BA and overpowered in a scene that may have got some of you excited, but made me slap my hand right through my head. It's stuck in there and I can not see!!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED for the first season were great. The OP for the second season on the other hand SUCKED! The ED was aight doe'.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack production team really messed up picking this anime to create music for. They did wonderfully but there talents could have gone to a show that deserved it much more.\\n\\n\r\nART: 8\\n\\n\r\nNo complaints. The art and character design are great. As usual the mecha battles are excellently rendered although the \"technology\" (such as the mechs user interface) designs are very questionable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYABILITY: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show makes me want to barf into my lap just so I can see the barf and barf again to ease the nausea from watching this piece of shit. This is possibly the wor- wait what?? an 8?? N*GGA IS U HIGH?\\n\\n\r\nYea that's right! This show is very enjoyable! Yeaaa I said it! Overall this definitely deserves a 4, possibly less but the enjoyablity deserves an 8! ECHHI IS EPIC! EIE..IO! AND ON HIS FARM HE HAD A TSUNDERE! EIEIO! WITH A ITS NOT LIKE I WANTED TO HERE AND A ITS NOT LIKE A WANTED TO THERE! While the \"main plot\" is cringe worthy and should be blocked out of your mind sit back relax with a six pack and enjoy the fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is highly recommended! FOR ANTS!!",

            "content": "10 notes that I wrote after the first episode of the show. \r\n1. Besides this piece of writing, there would not be any further comments on IS. I might rant on Facebook, but I would probably not to do so. \r\n2. The reason that I would not write anything for IS is that it does not need any review. Simply put, nobody would care if IS had got any actual plot or not. The first episode already proved my point by having the French and The German (that\u2019s my acronym for the characters inside this show.) eating Crapes, The Male (yes, there is only onemale) and The Chinese, The French and the British outdoor, or The Japanese\u2019s door being knocked while she was having a shower. Anyone counting this as serious drama should have their brain checked, and yet many watched joyfully every week. \\n\\n\r\nWhat? Oh you mean Phantom Task? Someone stealing an IS from the school? Who cares? At least not the script writer. \\n\\n\r\n3. Main plot of IS: a bunch of girls and a boy having operations. \\n\\n\r\nPlease feel free to interpret and imagine what kind of operations was being referred to. \\n\\n\r\n4. Another clue showing that there would not be any serious bits inside the show: by comparing the ED of the first season and the second season, they just look the same aren\u2019t they? It could be summarized as a bunch of girls running around and more girls running around on the 2nd version. \\n\\n\r\n5. the Correct way of reviewing this show should not be in ordinary points. It should be count as \u201cX out of the 10 Moe\u201d. For episode 1, I originally give 7 Moe, since my favorite character didn\u2019t showed up. There are also some new settings that probably they won\u2019t even used again so that\u2019s another 2 moes. \\n\\n\r\n6. This Show lacks any actual drama. The one thing that it doesn\u2019t lack of is the original script writer Yumizuru Izuru\\n\\n\r\n7. The most interesting factor of IS isn\u2019t about the characters. IS is a good indication of How light novel publishers trying the best to hang on to popular writers. Even thought his new novel \u201cAfterschool Battlefield\u201d received loads of bad reviews and he was being kicked out of his old publishing company, his still got another publishing deal. It reflects the competitiveness of the light novel industries nowadays. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the reason that IS is able to sell well is not because it is a well written novel, nor because that Yumizuru is a good writer or a nice person (in fact, he is an ass). It is all because that IS had a good illustrator. Since everyone are buying light novels without any chance to read the content (At least, this is true for Hong Kong and Taiwan), the illustrations, cover pages and popularity of the series are often the key component for consumers to decide whether they would like to purchase or not.\\n\\n\r\n8. Rather than reading the novel or watching the show, the true battlefield Is in Comiket and Doujin. Have I not told you that C85 already started? BTW I like Chika Arimura. \\n\\n\r\n9. Since I was in college studying English and we do have an unbalance portion of boys and girls, I can surely tell that Harem is all just a dream. \\n\\n\r\n10. if Ichika dies, I will give this show a 10. Oh never mind, it will never be that way.",

            "content": "An interesting sequel to the original infinite stratos anime it becomes a fairly mediocre but enjoyable series. \r\nTo get the main thing out of the way first this season of Infinite Stratos is a harem, echhi, comedy with SOME story in it. NOT an aspiring story with some harem, ecchi, and comedy in it (yes there's a difference).\r\nThe anime follows Ichika with all the main characters from the first series placed into this one. A lot of it becomes the awkward harem ecchi that is to be expected from Infinite Stratos with little deviation from the original seasons. The  character development wasn't too badconsidering most of it was done in the first season although it feels like the ecchi and harem parts have been taken up a few notches. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem comes into play mostly as they hint of an arc or story that rarely comes to light in each episode. In the end if your hoping to watch an enthralling story the anime will quickly feel like 10 episodes of fillers and 2 episodes of story. \\n\\n\r\nOverall its fairly hard to critique the second season as it doesn't do too much from the first. They both had fairly average story, the art is similar along with the sound and the characters are the the same as well with few editions. With the haphazard use of the story it becomes difficult to review an anime that doesn't add too much to the series. A few things are found out particularly about the antagonists and how they relate to Ichika but it doesn't seem to delve much deeper then that. The last episode is where the story really comes into play and sort of wraps up, but it feels quite obvious that this seasons was made to push the story along a bit and set up for another sequel.\\n\\n\r\nStill though taking the anime like it is, its one of my favorites. The females flock to Ichika as expected in a harem. There is ecchi scenes and times when they are being really cute or really strong. Ichika is still as weak as ever but its good to see him fighting for his friends and I particularly enjoyed the strength that Charlotte and Laura bring into play.\\n\\n\r\nIn closing (or TLDRthrough its an interesting anime, in which I feel if you enjoyed the first series you may likely enjoy this one. Although don't expect too much from the story as a lot of it will feel like a group of people doing random stuff for a while until the last episode.",

            "content": "First season was much more enjoyable.\r\nDirector thought it would be a better idea to rush through the source material so Kanzashi could be introduced halfway through the series and be useless instead of waiting until Episode 9 which when Vol 7 should have been adapted. Instead we got a ending that was a lot like the ending to S1 (everyone against OP IS and jobs it save Ichika and Houki), but managed to be so much stupider just from the last minute and a half as a BUY THE BDs measure.\r\nHaving read the LNs, Vol 5-7 would have been fairly entertaining to see adapted becauseYumizuru bothered to offer some action in a harem series, along with actually character development for Cecilia instead of Charlotte and Houki getting jammed down our throats like S1. To a certain extent, some scenes had to be omitted because of choices made from S1, such as taking Natasha Fairs out of Silver Gospel, so that couldn't be helped.\\n\\n\r\nBut so much stuff was skipped/omitted it's not even funny:\\n\r\n>Gotanda siblings\\n\r\n>Student council\\n\r\n>Cannonball Fast Race\\n\r\n>Ichika's core actually being extracted from Byakushiki during that part of the Cinderella Ball\\n\r\n>Cecilia training her bits to bend beams like Madoka did\\n\r\n>Cecilia and Madoka rematch where Cecilia's hard work and guts paid off though it's a Pyrrhic victory \\n\\n\r\nInstead we had about 70% of the content from those volumes skipped for an episode about Char's hammerspace panties. Not saying all of that was skipped so Char could run around with no panties for an episode, but the episode itself offered absolutely nothing otherwise in terms of plot or even fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even after that, they bothered to fuck around with the viewer more by offering slideshows over actual animation as a ploy to get viewers to buy the BDs. Granted, as a Cecilia fan, I did like her section of the birthday celebration as well as her episode because she didn't try to kill Ichika during those times (not saying she didn't try like during Cinderella ball, but Yumizuru's sense of slapstick violent humor has never been IS's strong point).\\n\\n\r\nI can understand that some of the QUALITY issues from IS artwise were because of the fact that 8bit was also working on Tokyo Ravens and Walkure Romanze at the same time, but I didn't like feeling gyped to buy the BDs. IS S1 was this studio's project they had the most control over and was rather enjoyable: you'd think they would have put a little more thought into handling their flagship series and not run it at the same time as two other shows.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I still like the novels, so if we get a S3, I suppose I'll give it the three episode rule, but I gave S2 9 episodes too many in the long run.",

            "content": "I imagine there are two core audiences who would be attracted to a show like Infinite Stratos: There are those who enjoy the Mech genre, and thought it carried a somewhat interesting premise, despite the underlying signs that it could go in a number of questionable directions. Then there are those who enjoy carefree slice of life stories that have love triangles, harems, and plenty of awkward situations. Before I dive into what I think about this anime, not just within the confines of the second season, but as a whole, I'd like to preface that I had no idea what this show was aboutbefore I randomly started watching it. I can safely say that regardless if you are Mech junkie, or a harem lover, this show will ultimately waste your time. I will not be including any major spoilers in this short review. \\n\\n\r\nLet me first begin by explaining my grades. I don't really have a good eye for art, unless it is absolutely fantastic, and the same goes for the sound. It isn't annoying or peculiar in any way, and unless you are very selective or attuned to sound and art, you shouldn't notice it. The story has elements and pieces of intrigue or interest, but they never amount to anything and ultimately will betray your expectations in frustrating ways. The cause for such mediocrity in story stems from the fact that many of the characters are annoying and are truly victims of ridiculous plot lines that can't even be considered as 'story'. Even the most casual viewers can find something more entertaining to spend their down time watching than Infinite Stratos, whether it is the first season or the second. Allow me to venture further. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise of the story is quite simple. Orimura Ichika is the only man in the world who can use an IS, and so that in of itself makes it perfectly okay for him to attend an all-girls school where he is to learn how to master and utilize a powerful military grade machine that is apparently is used for sport. This plot invites a multitude of misunderstandings between Ichika and every single female student he encounters, which definitely increases in number from season to season. Although this academy he attends is focused on training IS units, it also functions as a military base of operations, using emotionally charged high school students  as soldiers who are sent into battle to confront threats that even the armies of the world can't handle. Season two throws in an evil organization that has a terrible habit of appearing every other episode, no doubt to make room for overly cliche fan-service sequences, that will ultimately have no closure whatsoever. Although there are some specks of greatness reflected throughout the duration of Infinite Stratos, it is hardly worth the time or effort to suffer through. One moment Ichika's life will be threatened by an intriguing assassin, and the very next day he'll be on some play date with one girl or another, unknowingly angering the others, as if his life was never in danger. Most viewers will question whether or not the show has a serious case of short term memory loss, as it continually picks up and drops the plot several times throughout the season. \\n\\n\r\nThe battles and fight sequences have their moments as well, until the animation zooms out, leaving two colored balls streaking across the sky and ignoring the finer details of mech on mech combat. I won't deny that some of the designs are pretty darn cool, but it doesn't matter because most of the fights are short lived, and ultimately lead up to more slice of life moments that are jam packed with awkward moments that become so redundant, it becomes near unbearable. The second season ends with even more questions than answers, and if a third season ever emerges, it seems quite unlikely that anything will get resolved from it without a change of director or author. For anyone who finished season one thinking that the variety of unanswered questions would get elaborated on in season two will be sorrily disappointed. In fact, the entire premise of the plot is only vaguely hinted at, and never truly expanded upon at all. \\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the characters who are apart of this jumbled mess of plot and harem pointlessness, there are some stars among the mix, though ultimately they will frustrate you with their cliche behavior or pointless interjections into the story. The main character, Ichika, is a fairly basic male protagonist, who wants to protect his comrades and is overall a very nice person. There is no doubt that he is purposefully designed to be incredibly oblivious, and while that may invite some hilarity at first, it becomes very stale, and very quickly. Naturally, surrounding him are a cast of female characters, the most important being his childhood friend, Houki, who clearly has a stronger bond with him than the other girls. Houki may be my personal favorite among the bunch, but like everything in this show, her character and morals are often broken for the purpose of setting up a pointless interlude in the plot for fan service. The Houki of season one, was a respectable and hardworking girl who actually carries genuine feelings for Ichika, which are more than likely mutual. The Houki of season two periodically falls to Cecilia and Lin's level of attention grabbing nonsense. While Lin is also Ichika's childhood friend, she and Cecelia are nothing but obnoxious intrusions who serve little to no purpose to anything relevant within the story. Their personalities are bland and predictable, and you can pretty much expect what they are going to do. In fact, Cecelia's only redeeming quality is her inability to cook remotely edible food, which provides a single episode of laughs, but is still irrelevant. Much like Houki, Charlotte is another character who has many respectable qualities, but ends up drowning them in the obvious pursuit to be the one chosen by Ichika. It is unfortunate because Charlotte is an intelligent and well-meaning person who probably could serve as a good source of information for Ichika in terms of how the other girls think of him. Surprisingly, the only character I don't have a problem with in terms of the fan service and the cliche harem tactics is Laura. Perhaps it is the fact that I gave up on expecting a serious female student to appear and stay for long, and Laura benefits from being somewhat clueless about society, and doesn't overplay the \"blushing girl who wants to go on a date no matter what the cost is\" stereotype the others do. Of course, season two had to add on a few other characters to the list, including the student council president, and her kid sister, who ultimately take up a few episodes of drama that don't really have much to do with anything. \\n\\n\r\nThe best characters of the show are those who aren't involved with the harem whatsoever. This includes Ichika's older sister, Chifuyu, who just happens to be a teacher at the academy. She is a serious, no-nonsense, military-minded instructor who once was one of the greatest IS pilots the world has ever known. It is unfortunate that her much needed presence is put to waste by locking her up in a control booth giving orders. The times I smiled the most while watching this anime was when Chifuyu would call out the ridiculousness of the other girls, and ultimately deny them their right to be Ichika's girlfriend. While I feel that Houki is a good and decent person who has been victimized by the show's designs, her sister is undoubtedly one of favorites of the viewers. Tabane is a super genius who originally created the IS, and is pretty much an unstoppable god who plays tricks on the other characters just for fun. While she is a vital piece of the story's plot, her appearances are so rare, it hardly amounts to anything until its too late. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I would advise not to venture into this anime, even if you found the first season somewhat intriguing. I would say that Infinite Stratos 2 is best enjoyed by those who don't mind a redundancy when it comes to typical cheap anime romantic troupes such as: feeding a girl her lunch and saying \"aah\", accidentally seeing a girl's panties, accidentally pissing off the other girls repeatedly by showing accidental favoritism towards one over the others, going on pseudo dates, blushing excessively and playing coy, and most of all, hitting the male protagonist many times for being accidentally stupid. If in the hands of a suburb writer or producer, I believe Infinite Stratos could've been a very successful anime. One thing that makes it so difficult to watch is that there are moments when it truly feels awesome, only to knock you down with overused heroics. The peak of this show occurred near the end of season one, and as hard as season two tried, it never came close.",

            "content": "Hello! I'm only writing a review for this season, as I found the first season a lot more enjoyable than the second one. Therefore, I just want to get straight to the point with my review and why I rated the anime as I did and how enjoyable it was for me. (This is my first review by the way.)\r\nStory\r\n----------------\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 did not have a good story in my opinion. There was little to no story development, only a small preview of what's going to happen in the beginning of the anime, then it suddenly jumps into the end. That preview almost seems likeit was rushed into the end and placed uncomfortably. Most of the episodes in the beginning were as you so call 'fillers', as they had nothing to do with the main storyline at all. (I never expected there to be fillers in a 12 episode anime...) Of course, it's only a 12 episode anime, so I didn't expect the storyline to go too far, but they could've progessed it little by little instead of just introducing more characters and watching them hang out with the main character. I think that the writers did not do a good job of focusing on the story, but more of comedy with a little bit of ecchi. \\n\r\nI give this show a story rating of: 1/10\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nAs someone who does art and wants to become an animator, I see the art as amazing. The IS mecha was so cool to me. (Besides the main character's, His suit looked mediocre compared to the other IS suits. -_-;;) There were nice and unique effects to each IS suit and weapons. The art made the fighting look super intense and really cool. Also, for an ecchi show, it was nice to know that the girls didn't have a 4 cm waist and DDs. I've seen shows such as Highschool of the Dead, Kampfer, and all the girl's bodies seemed the same with different faces. I do believe the Art was a good aspect of this anime.\\n\r\nI give this show an art rating of: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nThe sound was also a very good aspect of the anime. Just like the art, the sound of the weapons clashing together and the missiles shooting away made the anime much more enjoying to me because of the intensity it gave. The voice actors (seiyuu as I should say because I didn't watch the dubbed version.) were good at showing emotions whether it be shy, angry, or proud. I would also like to point out that not every girl's voice was a squeaky 4 year old's voice. The cute characters had a cute voice while the more mature characters had a mature voice. The sound fit in with the character and the sound fit in with the situation. The soundtrack was the best part. It captured each moment well. It gave intensity when it needed to and gave comedy when it needed to. The opening and ending songs were great. I loved them every time I went to a new episode. \\n\r\nI give this show a sound rating of: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\n----------------\\n\r\nThis is where the downfall of the anime begins. The main character is so dense when it comes to girls that it makes me want to punch my computer screen, go into the anime world, and rip his eyes out. I understand that this is a harem anime and that his character shouldn't really go into ONE of the girls, but he could've at least progressed with them. Also, it felt like he couldn't really improve his skills with maneuvering his IS. However, not ONLY was the main character really stupid/frustrating, the character development was a big thumbs down. There was little to no character development AT ALL. (Mostly because most of the episode were 'fillers') I felt like the characters stayed the same since the first season ending and that there was no change at all. It felt like they introduced each character's problem in the first season, and completely forgot about it and made them into robots. I did not like the character set in this anime WHATSOEVER besides the comedical aspect of each of them.\\n\r\nI give this  show a character rating of: 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nAs horrible as the storyline and characters development was, I still did find this anime to be mediocre. Why? Because even though the main character was dense, it was still really funny. I kept watching this anime mainly because of the comedy. It gave me a good laugh every episode and didn't fail to make me quit watching. I'm not too into ecchi, but I don't mind it at all as well. Sometimes, when they incorporated ecchi into an episode, I thought, \"How in the world can this happen.\" Its like you try to open a door and it turns on the light instead, you know? But they rescued those areas with a comedical turn and the anime DID have its cute and  shounen like (?) moments.\\n\r\nI give this show an enjoyment rating of: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nI didn't like the story or the character, but it wasn't an anime that I would cross out of my list. It still is enjoyable to watch. It isn't too plot heavy, (And I actually mean the PLOT. Not boobs plot.)  I guess but more enjoyable. It's more of an anime to watch when you just wanna watch a short anime that had a simple storyline (Although it didn't do well with the storyline xD) and comedical features. Why do I put comedy, comedical and enjoyable so much in this review? Because IT REALLY IS VERY FUNNY. Its nice to watch when you're having a bad day and really want a good laugh. \\n\r\nTherfore, I overall give this show an OKAY rating of...\\n\r\n....4/10!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review, I hope it had shown you what experience I had when watching this anime and what kind of experience you'd GET from this anime. :)\\n\r\nGoodbye!",

My rating of the story is a 3/10\r\nArt: I say lantis did a pretty good job with the art but messed up on the3D they tried to add in the second season when i looked closely you could barley tell who it is but when up close they decided to switch from 3D back over to 2D but that did not really bother me,The Art made even me to try and master this art style so if you love to draw try this style once. rating 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now here is where it counts the feeling that your in the battle or you can tell that ichika felt that beat down great sounding not like when some anime use to blocks of wood and slam them together no, it sounds like skin getting hit by a huge mecha arm still ichika you need to read the mood. rating 9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I say i loved all the females following ichika one they just bring the mood to the scene like how laura comes in a serious say \"Your my wife\" and all that but as we all know she has a soft side that she barley shows to anyone and when \\n\\n\r\n[spoiler] with the cake bunny scene lol made my day[/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nnow the rest of the girls give the same feeling just in there own way like Houki and her Tsundere act and her helpless act she makes you feel like i would not want to mess with her.now this is how i feel about all the females in the series you will understand when you watch you will laugh tons.10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Enjoyment was a good amount because of the comedic affect but the fighting i could not take seriously\\n\\n\r\n[spoiler] only the part with the sisters i say that is a family right there[/spoiler]\\n\\n\r\nthere were like half the episode while other mechas make it 3 or the whole series about fights with mecha no this anime just adds two fights and ichika always being useless,but i say if this anime would have used the mecha battles to be a sport then the anime would have made sense to make the battles,well still in the end its the comedy and the spoiler in the first episode with a scene of the last episode keeps this anime alive Lantis you have found a way to trick our minds. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I will say it again still a pretty good anime to waste time on but raging at the same this my OVERALL Rating is 8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is a review for both 1st and 2nd season. They are basically the same anime with different names. \r\nFirst off all, Infinite Stratos is NOT A ROMANCE anime. It is not even trying to be one. It doesn't involve anything I would call romantic. It is an exaggerated example of harem genre. Yes there are also anime with both romance and harem in it, however IS:Infinite Stratos is NOT one of them. This is pure harem. So if you keep that in mind and set your expectations that way, it is actually pretty enjoyable and I will tell you why.\r\n1- Story\r\nThere is no plotthat is worth mentioning in this anime and I couldn't care less about it. The very first scene of the anime already shows that. A guy in an all-girls school. WTF are you expecting??? There is this guy and the girls around him and they are doing standard harem things. Time to time everyone in the school also joins them. That's all. Also he has a sister who was a legendary IS pilot and now a teacher. Bonus: There is no incest and siblings relationship with each other is, altho a little bit overshadowed by standard harem things, still gives a little warmness to the show. Heck, it is the only thing that is a bit realistic and warm here. \\n\r\nSome might enjoy the action scenes but I certainly did not since I don't really like those nonsense characters are spouting rather than actually fighting.(I am looking at you Bleach). Now put mecha here and I am done.\\n\r\nOverall it is average harem with lots of fan service and time-to-time fun. Nothing serious happens and even if it does  I didn't and you shouldn't care.\\n\\n\r\n2- Characters\\n\r\nGirls are cute and they differ from each other. We have the standard set:\\n\r\n-tsundere childhood friend\\n\r\n-loli tsundere childhood friend with twintails YAY!\\n\r\n-foreigner noble overly self-conscious blonde\\n\r\n-clueless to love, villain to yandere girl\\n\r\n-a girl with a little bit of logic and looks more reliable than the others yet still acts foolish with the flow sometimes\\n\r\nThese two will be added in 2nd season:\\n\r\n-A shy and hard-working glasses girl overshadowed by her big sister\\n\r\n-Perfect senpai with a daring personality and easy-going attitude, always teases the guy and claims to be a big sister etc.\\n\\n\r\nFinally MC:\\n\r\nThink about a general unrealistic harem MC and increase denseness to the max. I have watched lots of anime like that however this guy was something else. It is so ridiculous that the show itself intentionally highlights his impossible denseness. I gotta say tho, he is not that unlikable due to his genuine over the the top denseness. So dense that it has adverse effect on  the viewer.\\n\r\nJust from these explanations, everyone with enough harem experience can now guess most of the story given the context.\\n\\n\r\nTechnical aspect:\\n\r\nNothing out of ordinary. Fitting voice acting, poor soundtracks. Animation is nothing amazing but doesn't suck either, easily watchable. Characters look cute and likeable too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall;\\n\r\nthis anime is a generic harem for easy watching. Don't even try if you are tiny bit serious. Also much better and realistic than School Days imo.",

            "content": "As when you watch any anime you have to be open to the genre with this being a harem you should expect most of the over used things in this genre.\r\nPlot:  With Infinite Stratos you will find yourself in the future where mankind is at a age where mechs are created and used but there is a twist they can only be used by the female gender. This is the main idea of the story but there is one other thing the is a boy named Ichika who can use the mechs as well. This boy is forced into the I.S academy where heis surrounded by women.\\n\\n\r\nNext we have the story which is about Ichika and his harem life while haveing to deal with problems with the school and training. After the first couple of episode a the action begins and Ichika is left to fight with his personal I.S and those of his other female class mates.\\n\\n\r\nWith the characters you have the main male Ichika and his other lovers. This includes the 5 from the first season and 2 new. First is the Student President Tatenashi Sarashiki who is also the strongest in the school which is why she has the title of President. Next is her sister Kanzashi Sarashiki who is not as strong and has always been not at the same level as her sister.\\n\\n\r\nAfter this is the sound which is ok in my eyes but with me i dont pay to much attention to it other then the Opening and Closeing. The opening was cheerful and average not very memorable. The Closeing was better. It kept the cheerful feel and found its way to something i listen to often.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation on the other hand is different when i say that i mean it was done by someone else. It was similar but if you compared them side by side you would see the differences other than that is was nice art work but not interesting or amazeing.\\n\\n\r\nThis leaves me with my final verdict giving it a 7 out of 10. Also saying if you like the harem, sci-fi, romance genres to watch it",

Art remains pretty good good and sound is likewise. As for character develop on the other hand, forget about it. I mean they did try something but even then it only serves to make you realise how weak the main protag is. By far the most frustrating thing about season 2 is the wasted potential.With the new characters introduced and the events that were set in motion, i personally thought at the start of the season that we were in for something great, after episode after episode after episode of disappointment however i'm beginning to wish i had watched something different. IMO if you don't watch it, you're not missing much, if you do still watch it, don't expect much out of it",

            "content": "Hi everyone! I recently chanced upon the reviews on the final episode of Infinite Stratos and to my utmost astonishment, the vast majority of posts were absolutely negative and offered blatantly scathing replies regarding the termination of another season of Infinite Stratos. As an avid supporter of anime and artists of all genres, such comments regarding the twelve hard-won episodes stirred something within me and hence I took to crafting this review which I believe is an accurate reflection of what I believe in as a positive supporter and compassionate patron of the anime and manga arts.\r\nAs an anime, Infinite Stratos Season 2 is doubtlesslynot without its faults (like all of its other counterparts, predecessors, and works to come) however it is also not without merits; the spirit and zeal that went into producing this particular season and the combined efforts of the artist, production personnel, and most importantly the fans who never gave up on this project that almost never happened epitomize what anime is all about and gave this work a place in my heart. Instead of offering a bleak and bludgeoning critique on this work, I believe that an anime (just like everything in life cannot be objectively judged) and remains ostensibly a unique opinion that can only be determined by the viewer which also restricts its validity to encompass only the latter. If there is to be an objective interjection, I welcome and beckon all to view, experience, and come to a unique conclusion on what Infinite Stratos means. Perhaps it may be a bad experience, perhaps a good one (like mine was) or even an ambivalent one; however  I sincerely hope that all may embrace it for what it is. \\n\r\nThe plot was great (albeit involving a vast amount of fanservice just like last season which is not surprising for a harem anime) if one cares to keep track of it and involved a great deal of cliffhangers which should not be an issue for inquisitive audiences now that all twelve episodes are finally out. Despite the fanservice, the plot is still existent and contributes greatly to the suspense and cathartic poignancy of the work. The addition of new and entertaining characters like Kanzashi and Tatenashi keeps individuals on the balls of their feet and the fun never subsides. With fantastic and dramatic fighting scenes IS 2 features a vast array of designs and action that will not disappoint either returning viewers or new viewers who want a part of the action. The artwork (especially the stunning details in mech designs, equipment, and characters) was phenomenally rendered and the girls just keep getting cuter with innovations in technology. Despite having a new artist and animation company producing the work, the characters resemble their counterparts in season one so there are no discrepancies regarding appearance. Needless to say, the characters were likable and overall the anime was thoroughly enjoyable. While Infinite Stratos 2 is not the best anime that I have watched it has certainly been an exceedingly pleasurable and great experience. \\n\r\nAfter all the hate and highly negative views on this anime, I sincerely hope that I have helped in some way and contributed my positive opinions on IS 2. Thank you for your time and best wishes! Take care and happy watching!",

            "content": "To start off with this review of \"infinite stratos 2\" I just want to say from my opinion that this second season really disappointed me a lot and I made up a \"don't pull a infinite stratos\" which this all relates to the main protagonist in this story who is ichika oremura who is by far the worst protagonist of a romance and action anime. now lets get into the scores shall we. \r\n THE STORY: the story of the season 2 of infinite stratos of course picked up from where we left off carrying everything from scares and worries from season1 all theover to season 2 which was a good thing to start off with which got me all excited. but as I progressed in watching season 2 I got very bored in watching the same girls still chasing after 1 guy who Is all STILL chasing after one guy, who doesn't seem to notice any of their feelings yet unlike in one of the episodes where he was carrying one of the girls and her face was next to him and she whispers \"I love you ichika.\" and he acts like any clich\u00e9 protagonist would and responds to that with \"what?\" and brushes it off which made this anime a horrible anime for the harem and romance parts because of how stupid and weak the main protagonist is but ill save that for the characters. so everyone in the story hears about an organization who is trying to capture the main protagonists mecha armor or whatever to use to create an even bigger and powerful weapon stronger than anyones power which is kind of a clich\u00e9 way to go for the villan part and yup it ends in a part which brings up a lot of questions and no they aren't done with the story yet so there is or will be a season 3.\\n\\n\r\n ART: the art still remains the same which is also a popular and very modern in todays animation which is of course what we all like but what good is art when it dosent have an interesting story right?\\n\\n\r\n CHARACTERS: \\n\r\nICHIKA- the worst guy you can ever have in a romance or harem story BECAUSE he may consider all the girls around him but he dosent seem to have STILL a clue that any of them even love him even though they bombard him with all these clues and some even straight up confessed and he just brushes it off with saying \"what?! what do you mean?!\" im very angry with this man. -_- I think school days does better.\\n\\n\r\nthe rest of the characters haven't developed at all from season one they all are still the same amount of jealousy and love and skills just a continue from season ones plot. \\n\\n\r\noverall enjoyment: I GOT BORED!  \\n\\n\r\nscore: 6",

            "content": "Well after watching the whole anime and reading all the books that have been translated so far,(bracing for all the hate) I would say it's a good anime for anyone that just wants something light and nothing too serious. Like a goofy romance harem.\r\nStory: 5\r\nI will agree when people say the story sucks. There's not much to this anime other than Ichika being really dense and all the girls magically falling in love with him. I have seen better, but I also have seen worse (The ending to Akane-iro ni Somaru Saka. Infuriating beyond words. But then again, that is only my opinion).\r\nArt: 9\r\nI personallyfind the art style of this anime to be visually well done. Once again this is only my personal opinion. Some people might find the art style to be bad, not fluid enough, etc. I will say that some parts are kinda boring art-wise but overall I would say its not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nSome of the sound effects might be a little cheesy(?)(don't quite know the word for it). But voice acting-wise it was decent. Not the best but not the worst. I can say that I absolutely hate Ceclia's voice (but that's just my opinion of course. Some people might like her.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nMinus the EXTREME density of Ichika and the annoyingness of Cecilia, I personally liked most of the characters. Houki is very much the stereotypical tsundere childhood friend. Lingyin might be a little over the top sometimes and possibly a bit annoying. Laura is probably my second favorite but can still be a little weird as well. But by far my favorite character is Charlotte. I just like her character type: very nice to people, and not super high-pitched squeaky/ annoying sounding and also the least abnormal of the bunch. It doesn't help that Ichika is probably one of the most useless male MCs out there. In both season 1 and 2 he never beats anyone (without the help of others) and always gets his ass kicked. So I would rate everyone (except for Cecilia and Ichika) at least a 7 or 8\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nI (I'm going to be flamed so much for this but) personally found it quite enjoyable. Reason: It's a very happy, lighthearted anime. Not serious but also not Gintama goofy. As much as I love drama and action, sometimes I just want to watch something light. Of course if you absolutely can't stand practically useless MCs and the annoying ojou-sama personality, then this might not be for you. It all just depends on what type of genre of characters and anime you enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5\\n\r\nI loved the books (and that's probably why I'm a little biased on my review) and I like the anime. The anime follows the books pretty closely and I think they did a decent job on the anime. Both book and anime are very similar but of course they might leave out a few things (like the water park episode is only supposed to be Charlotte and Laura because Charlotte won a prize but instead Ichika invites everyone. There is a few more but I can't remember off the top of my head.) I was a little concerned when they made the water park episode part of the anime because, from the books, it's just a side story. But overall I would give it an 8 or 9.",

            "content": "With the first season in the chain ending as \"fair\" at best, the second season of Infinite Stratos is barely mediocre (and that's being generous). Consisting mostly of bottle episodes wherein the characters spend enormous periods of time at the academy doing uninspired and rather uninteresting activities, the second season doesn't even pick up the fecal-stained ball dropped at the end of season one. \r\nWhile character development in season one was weak, it's nonexistent in s2. The characters literally don't change.  So with no character progression and no story progression, what do we have? Mostly just a series of *unexpected* (sarcasm) bouts with amysterious cult that presumably hate's Ichiga's harem enough to try and kill him every 2-3 episodes. It's truly mind boggling how the show might have improved dramatically if they'd succeeded!  But I digress, after a series of predictable and cliche engagements they only managed to \"gain sufficient data\". Which I don't entirely understand because *SPOILER ALERT* they defeat Ichiga and the ladies. So if their main priority was to kill Ichiga and his sister, why not just do it? Oh, because it makes more sense to defeat him in battle so you can gain valuable intelligence on... how to beat him in battle. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I'd say this anime is best viewed while you're doing something more important. Perhaps you could leave it playing while you clean, cook, study, feed your cat, or whatever it is you do. The main point being that it's not really worthy of your full attention, but it's not so terrible that it can't be used in the place of the windows bubbles screensaver.",

            "content": "[Rant]\r\nA while back I remember watching Infinite Stratos for the first time. The harem and comedy elements of it were good and although I'm not really a fan of mecha I could stomach it and thought it was a good anime altogether and rated it pretty high. When I found out a 2nd season was coming out I was excited, like I bet all IS fans were, but sadly the 2nd season was a huge let-down.\r\n[Plot: 4/10]\r\nNo plot what-so-ever. It was episodic and pretty much random throughout the whole series. The whole basis of the anime was only only visited in like 2 or 3episodes and then the rest of the anime was followed but \"The Daily Lives Of Ichika And His Harem\" .The fight scenes were lazy, the storyboard was lazy and altogether IS 2 was horrible. The only good thing about IS I can think of is the comedy which entertained me for most of the anime but then the same gags kept getting repeated over and over again and after awhile you just get tired of it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2/10\\n\r\nS.H.A.L.L.O.W\\n\r\nIn the first season of IS, the characters were just being introduced so Ichika's Harem had a lot of character development and we went through their back stories. Each character had episodes dedicated to them and we got to know them better. Since IS 2 continues were IS 1 left off, all we get is Ichika's mindless harem who are blindly in love with him for god knows what reason. Ichika is the most stupidest protagonist I have ever seen. There's a limit to how ignorant you can be. The girls are freaking throwing themselves at you and nothing comes to mind. If i had a penny for every time Ichika said something stupid or corny to one of the girls I'd be a billionaire. So the fans don't find this too weird they even added 2 more girls to his harem. The first ones personality was ok but her sister was as generic as can be and it was a pain to hear her say anything.\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 6/10]\\n\r\nThe art was actually really good. Its nice to look at and was a redeeming factor of the anime.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 8/10]\\n\r\nI actually liked the OP and ED. They had somewhat good replay value but are easily forgetable.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall 4/10]\\n\r\nInfinite Stratos 2 was trash and the worst anime of the season. I normally don't say this but after watching all 12 episodes I regret every second of this and think it would of been better if IS 2 was never made. If your an IS fan go ahead and watch this because it brings back all your favorite people from the first season but be prepared to be disappointed severely. Also to top everything off the ending was horrible too. It started off average but then turned into a snow ball going down a mountain and kept on getting worse and worse until your hit with the impact from the giant snowball crying for help but no one can hear your calls.",

I mean I don't know about others but i would not be able to keep my virginity if i had 2 female room mates and a girl sneaking into my room every night to sleep naked with me every day but hey that is just me and he is  still very funny with they way he backs away from the advances of the others but other that the good comedic writing although over played in most anime now days  the characters themselves are very bland and generic dere type characters that have absolutely no development throughout the series cecilea is the generic ojou sama rin and hoki are basically the same tusndere person except rin is a  loli and laura the closesd to a kuudere and last but not least we have cahrlete aka best girl but even still they are still good example of said generic dere types however the art style for the mechas themselves are different than most others but  i should love to be the meeting table with the creator when he came up with them so we have these how girl pilot mech but to keep it sexy we will leave their head exposed as well as their chest and crotch only there arms and legs need protecting but with that said they look good i personally found some design element of the mechs similer to gundam 00 like lauras shoulder cannon was similer to the throne gundam and charlotes was similer to harute gundam and the sound pretty good as well but then again on the same hand it is a little hard to mess that up   however no one cares about that kind of stuff when it comes down to it its all about enjoyment and that is where the show shines as it was  and fun to watch however the story in season one is pretty much non existent there is hints  at a larger picture just teasing you like the guy that makes samiwtches at subway.....yeah now the honey mustard hmmm smear it.. anyway season two is much much better as it has some plot to go along with charlottes god danm perfect everything sos would i recommend this anime yeah yeah i would watch a episode and see if u like it.",

            "content": "Truly it is unfortunate when an anime is just bad. Infinite Stratos 2 is one of the worst anime I have ever had the displeasure to watch. The story continues from where it left off in season one (kinda?) and it seems alright up to episode 3. After episode 3 is where season 2 spirals down into a void so deep that no amount of drugs will get you high enough to get you out of there.\r\nStory (4) - As I said before the show was alright up until episode 3. By the end of episode 3 there is a new character who appears andproceeds to give the show an actual plot that could have turned the show into a more serious and interesting; however, it was all scratched and instead the only story there is to be told is Ichika\u2019s growing harem that will most likely never end. Some of the events in this show are just utterly ridiculous. A perfect example of this is episode 6, in which Charlotte\u2019s panties disappear for reasons not properly explained at the beginning of the episode. At the end, the problem is solved (how?) and Charlotte proceeds to call Ichika a pervert when she tries to show him what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5) - While I do enjoy the majority of opening and ending themes, I found the opening and ending of this show were mediocre at best. There isn\u2019t much to say about the soundtrack either as every track was entirely forgettable in my opinion, but everyone has their own taste in music, so my own opinion shouldn\u2019t stop you from liking this soundtrack. The voice acting is, for the most part, good; however, I find Cecelia\u2019s voice incredibly irritating.\\n\\n\r\nArt (5) - The animation is rather average and fight scenes are mostly CG. Even then there are very few fight scenes worth mention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (1) - I find that I dislike just about every character in this anime, especially the females (oh wait, that\u2019s 99.9% of the cast\u2026). Ichika has to be one of the worst protagonists I\u2019ve ever seen in an anime, specifically his denser-than-dense part of his character (oh wait, that\u2019s almost all of his character interaction\u2026). His IS piloting skills range from average to just plain bad, as he is never able to take care of himself in battle for very long without help. The main girls aren\u2019t any better. Here is a list of the main girls and their personality:\\n\\n\r\n\u2022\tHouki - Japanese childhood friend, easily jealous of other girls being with Ichika.\\n\r\n\u2022\tRin - same as Houki, but is Chinese.\\n\r\n\u2022\tCharlotte - French girl, appears cute, calls Ichika a pervert when she herself causes the perversion in the first place.\\n\r\n\u2022\tLaura - German girl, doesn\u2019t know culture if it hit her in the face (in her defense, she was very strictly raised as a solder). She calls Ichika her wife (no excuses on this one\u2026) even though they aren\u2019t even together.\\n\r\n\u2022\tCecelia - British girl, everything about her is annoying, likes Ichika for one reason: he has \u201cstrong and idealistic eyes\u201d (what does that even mean?)\\n\r\n\u2022\tTatenashi - An absurdly powerful student council president, tries to seduce Ichika, make Ichika do impractical things like take the girls\u2019 measurements (apparently the teachers allowed it... so did the students...), and likes him for reasons unknown.\\n\r\n\u2022\tKanzashi - Tatenashi\u2019s little sister and Japan\u2019s IS representative, jealous of her older sister\u2019s talent (which makes one wonder why Kanzashi is the representative\u2026) and, because of that envy, insists on building her IS herself without anyone\u2019s help. Luckily, Ichika saves the day by helping her and gains yet another girl in the harem.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainments (2) - There are much better harem anime out there such as Clannad, The World God Only Knows, and Heaven's Lost Property. The only \"entertainment\" that this show provides is within those ephemeral fight scenes; everything else not pertaining to the plot is simply blatant fanservice. I had hoped that, like most second seasons, this season would have actually picked up in terms of plot. The ending of episode 3 really made me look forward to episode 4. Unfortunately, the plot was tossed aside for a whole bunch of needless \"comedy\" and fanservice. Due to this terrible season, I have absolutely no hope for the upcoming \u201cWorld Purge\u201d arc due to the synopsis of it. I believe it's safe for me to say that I will never touch this show again...unless it\u2019s for a drinking game, in which case I will be too drunk to care.\\n",

            "content": "So let's get this out of the way early: this is not what one would consider a \"good\" anime, even by the standards set by the first season. It's not even a good ecchi. This is the second season of a harem ecchi that toned down just about everything from the fanservice to character development. Actually, it's one of the rare anime that would have really been helped by adding more (or any) tits - as the whole show is based on a ridiculous harem-ecchi premise that fails to deliver. Going for pure fanservice ridiculousness I get, hell I even support it, but this lackseven that. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, it's entertaining if you go into it with the right mindset. Nothing here is going to make you think, or make you feel, or tickle your nether regions, but it's an amusing kind of bad at least. I'll try to avoid spoilers, but honestly nothing is surprising enough that could be spoiled.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Underdeveloped at best. There is no resolution, and the entire \"real\" plot revolves around a team-rocketesque secret group known as Phantom Task that randomly show up in what should be very rare personal IS machines, mess up some scenery, then retreat. Stuff just kinda happens.\\n\\n\r\n3/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: For the most part this is the highlight. Not much different than the first season, the characters are designed well and uniquely enough, though admittedly not in a groundbreaking kind of way. The girls are cute and varied, and even most of the extras are well designed from an artistic standpoint. The mechs are well designed, however in combat and motion they range from very fluid to clunky-as-hell like the CGI was never completely finished. \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing of note here really. Not bad, not good, completely average anime soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Lets take a moment to talk about the main character, Orimura Ichika. To say this guy is dumb would be a compliment. He's so amazingly oblivious all the time it's amazing he isn't constantly wetting himself. Not only is he dumb, he is awkward and about as sexual as a can of beans. God forbid he take a girl's measurements with his eyes open - the only thing he has going for him is he is the only outie in a sea of innies, and he's really good and bashing his head into things until they break. 95% of what this guy does is suck and lose, his entire purpose is to throw himself in front of whatever high powered beam weapon is being shot at a cute female companion. This is the guy that is the linchpin of the whole story. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of them, there's only one real stint of character development in the whole season and it boils down to a shy girl falling in love with a moron, the same moron who is already being half-seduced by that girl's sister. Every other character was deemed developed enough in the first season I suppose, so they all go on the back burner until it's time to randomly beat some Ichika ass for accidentally seeing side-boob while adrift in a sea of women. \\n\\n\r\n4/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: All that being said, I did enjoy it for what it was. You definitely have to turn your brain off to get any enjoyment out of this show, but hey - it's flashy at times and almost ecchi. As I said before, everything was dialed back and it exists in this strange in-between gray area for an anime. There are some suggestive poses, but a severe lack of fanservice and tits to be anywhere near a good ecchi. It would have done itself a big favor to just embrace its ecchi soul and go with it, but it didn't. At the same time, it's not anywhere near developed enough or even tell a coherent story enough to be the anime it wants to be. However, it's amusing and the art is pretty, so that's something.\\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Add it all together, and you get something exceptionally average. No risks were taken, and no meaningful story was told. Then again, it's not like I'm lamenting the time I spent watching it, so that's something. It is at least worth looking at for a palate cleanser.\\n\\n\r\n5/10",

            "content": "\"Second season of Infinite Stratos.\"\r\n           - Synopsis as of February 17, 2016\r\nThis season is so bad that even the synopsis struggles to come up with anything to say about this garbage. So allow me (and all of the other negative reviews) to give it a helping hand.\r\nInfinite Stratos 2: Electric Boogaloo is a perfect example of not only how not to write a sequel, but also how not to create an anime with any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  \r\nI'll be honest with you. I actually... kinda enjoyed the first season, if only just for Charlotte.Besides that, it was typical harem formula, ie. not much actual story.\\n\\n\r\nThis sequel follows suite with the harem formula as well, having little to no plot.\\n\\n\r\nSo, why do I let the first season slide away with a 6 while this gets the only 1 rating I've ever given to a show as of the time I wrote this?\\n\\n\r\nBECAUSE IT DIDN'T TRY TO FUCKING LIE TO US.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, what the second season did was introduce a fairly interesting plot point in order to add some needed depth to the series, and if the writers continued with this idea, the show could've had some kind of legs to stand on.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, the writers decided not to expand on this fairly neat idea, and instead chose to try to expand our pants instead, with an endless stream of T&A (and not even GOOD T&A!).\\n\\n\r\nAnd when the writers actually CHOSE to think even a little bit about creating something of quality with that idea, what did they give us?\\n\\n\r\n2 minute cliffhangers every so often that barely progressed the story.\\n\\n\r\nAre you fucking kidding me?\\n\\n\r\nFor the writers to lie to viewers like this is completely underhanded and totally insulting; I don't even know what else to say to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nEven when factoring out the blatant lies, the show is still utter shit on its own.\\n\\n\r\nAs previously stated, it's nothing more than bad T&A, but what's even worse than that is that apparently the writers weren't done demonstrating their incompetence, so they decided to flanderize pretty much every character in show.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls (even Charlotte!) are noticeably more bitchy, pretty much rendering some of them almost unlikable. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as for Ichika?\\n\\n\r\nH O L Y S H I T.\\n\\n\r\nHe went from being dense yet at least still showed signs of competence in other areas, to being nothing more than an insufferable, idiotic, pushover of a \"man\".\\n\\n\r\nSo basically a self insert for the writers.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the Sarashiki's are nothing more than an addition to Bitchka's harem. Seriously, take them out and the show wouldn't be much different. Or good.\\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\\n\r\nIf it wasn't obvious enough, Infinite Stratos 2 is little more than an insulting cesspool of bad fanservice, horrible characters, shit writing, and LIES.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Its just an typical harem anime with \r\nan oblivious male protagonist \r\nArt\r\n - The art of infinite stratos is average nothing to say about it other than a normal 2013 animation\r\nSound\r\n - TheOP and ED i give them 7/10 since i enjoyed it other than that the background music is standard fair\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\n - You have your clueless protagonist Ichika even though he can fight i can't stand his stupidity over love even if the 7 heroines obviously show's their affection to him\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n - i did not enjoyed infinite stratos to the fullest because of its story i could say it was 99% harem and ecchi and 1% action if your the type of guy who like harem ecchi romance then you MIGHT enjoy this show but if your looking for the action then you should not even bother watching this anime",

            "content": "Hmmm, I have no idea what the reason is for others disliking the series, but its not ALL that bad. I enjoyed it as much as any other harem lover would, but the thing that really hit me is this. Us Infinite Stratos fans waited for a sequel, and they give us a sequel. They give a totally incomplete series and although good for the most part, it was totally ruined by the ending. I honestly like this one, because unlike newer harem animes, they are more concerned on the trope of the harem genre, Infinite Stratos 2, like the first season, gave a blendof both harem and its action. Its a good combination for those harem lovers who seek a new blend, unlike the usual school life RomCom. However, despite all these, why do I give it only a 6 and not a good rating of 8 like its previous season? ITS ENDING THAT'S WHAT\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the previous season, the ending actually gave way to a sequel, but it was good enough even without it. The second season gave an ending that was simply saying \"I STILL HAVE MORE PLOT TO SHOW AND MORE QUESTIONS TO ANSWER, BUT I WON'T SHOW YOU ANYMORE\". The season as a whole was good and enjoyable but the ending simply drove it all off away, I really feel it could have been much much more had it been at least 2-3 more episodes long. They gave the climax of the story and the main battle in less than an episode, if they had not compacted that into a single episode, It would have been much better. Also, had they given a little bit more, and not cutting us off right at the middle of the action, but not only did they cut off the action right at the middle, they only gave a 3-5 minute cool-down from all the action. You raised the tension and you expect to lose that tension from 3-5 minutes of cooling down? To add it all up, not only did the anime not answer the questions it even first presented, after the ending of the 12th episode, it even gave twice the amount of questions, unlike the 1st season that didn't give so many questions after the ending that would bother the audience even after the show, OH NO, this season gave us a complete set of questions that they didn't bother answering and cutting us off like that, it FELT LIKE A VERY ST*PID ending, but beyond that, it was enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nStory (6/10) - The story is as typical as any other harem genres, but with a mix in of good action. It'd get an 8/10 or a 9/10 for me had they given more plot than harem. I was fine with all of the harem moments, but the climax was half done and it was barely an ending, more of a \"calm before a storm\" type of feel, so it leaves even more questions.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10) - gotta admit, the art is enjoyable. Although a few problems here and there, but not enough for one to notice unless you watch it multiple times. The 3D elements make it seem very action packed, though transition from 3D to 2D is a bit annoying at times but no worries, the 3D elements are only a few selected battle scenes. The OP and ED gave it even more spice since every episode features the girls running(along with Ichika) in different outfits based on the episode's setting\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - How can you NOT like the sound? the OP was great (the ending didn't beat SUPER STREAM of the first season in my opinion, but it was enjoyable), and the voice actors did a very good job. As usual, the 5 girls' voice actresses did a wonderful job in portraying their character, and the BGM is very catchy and is most of the time spot on with the episode's situation\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10) - I'd give it a 4/10 supposedly since none of the girls ever even made any progress, and all of them are usually together when there are harem moments. The only reason I gave it a 7/10 is because of Tatenashi, and Kanzashi. In contrast to the previous season, where I'd given a 8/10 score because all girls were given their own chance to develop their characters and even show different sides of themselves, in this season they all had their moments, but they barely showed any character development or anything new from twhat the previous season had already shown. Most of the characters were very predictable and never really went out of their character tropes or pretty much anything that the 1st season ever showed. This is not the case with Kanzashi and Tatenashi, as they were properly given development, and they gave out more mystery to their true character than what they already show. Ichika and Chifuyu also shined here, since we find out more on Ichika and Chifuyu, more of what they feel and more of their character, unlike the previous season that simply showed Ichika getting kicked in the as* by other girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6/10) - Yeah, I'd give it an 9/10 if not for the ending. Although most of the characters' development were slow and relied on harem moments to even get screen time, other characters still showed fair developments on their own, and they were very enjoyable. The story was very enjoyable up to the episode before the last. I really think it would have been better had they allotted at least a 24 episode season than a 12 episode, because there was simply too much plot to cover. Even if it wasn't a 24 episode season, at least 1-2 more episodes, one to cool down the tension form the previous fighting and another to answer all the questions, or at least give hints on them, not leave them on our face at point blank.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) - well, what can I say? it was good, but it could've been better. So many unanswered questions, and it'll only leave me wanting to know more, but knowing this anime, I'd only get it way after I'd already lost interest in wanting to know more. My advice to the people who are diligently watching the series and is still a big fan of the series is to read the light novel, since it explains all the questions that this season 2 never bothered to answer. Beyond the ending, it was a very enjoyable show",

            "content": "\"What are they so mad about?\" is what should be the slogan of this show should be.\r\nStory: 6. If your reading this then you have either watched the first season and enjoyed it even a bit, then have already watched the second and wanted to see what I think or honestly are contemplating watching the show, and need a reason to say \"sure, why not?\" I enjoyed the first season and was wishing for the same enjoyment I got from the first that I sadly did not completely get it, but it does not mean you wont enjoy it. The story has all the action,semi-fan service, and harem you need to make a fun show, which it was don't get me wrong, but the story doesn't bring anything new to the table in means of tougher battles or plot elements that supplement this mediocre story they set out to make money off of. I'm not saying the plots bad, but it pails in comparison to the first season, in all honesty.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5. IS: Infinite Stratos 2 is a continuation of the first season, and that entails exactly as it says it is. All the girls from the first season still love Ichika, god knows why, but its still the same, and Ichika is still dense enough to not notice any of the lovely ladies affection for him.  He always goes back to the namesake phrase, that I put at the top of the review, with a red slap mark basically pasted on his blank staring face. I think they should have changed the dialogue so he wouldn't say that line more times in a few episodes than he has complimented the girls for the entire series. Even though I disliked this part of the show I still did love the cast of characters, flawed as they appear to be. I sometimes wondered if it was because he's the only boy in school or because who he is that makes the ladies so excited, but hey simple questions. It sadly even seemed like all the love interests of Ichika were pushed back a bit except for some particular episodes, Ill call them filler episodes that were meant for nothing except possibly growth?, I couldn't tell, to focus on the plot which was kinda saddening. Its just that barely no character development or teasing that something might happen in between one girl and the main character that makes me herald this aspect a 5.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8. The art and animation is colorful, very beautiful to look at, and makes you want to keep your eyes on the screen for the whole episode, as long as the aforementioned doesn't stop you.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7. The sound in this show is actually quite enjoyable from the opening song to the ending song, to the voice acting that I thought was really well done, cough Kana Hanazawa cough, and even the laser and rocket sounds. Some of the sounds of the battles are the same as most other mech anime but I do understand they're metal and metal obviously hitting metal will sound the same no matter how it goes, so yeah.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7. From the music, to the characters, to the plot, I still enjoyed every minute of this show, it definitely has a certain pull to it. The characters are all fun from the childhood friends to the shy girls, they are all colorful, not completely new but funny in their own ways. The music for this show I think most will enjoy because it is upbeat and makes you ready for whatever is coming next be it random tripping into breasts, or mech fights. I felt that if the plot was lifted a bit in the beginning and middle episodes with more be it comedy or a battle and the main character chose someone or even noticed them as women, it could have fared better in my eyes and maybe many others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6. I've explained most of my reasoning up above, but I will say my last comments and if you have made it this far, I thank you. I normally give a show I sat through and enjoyed watching a little better fare but my forehead turned read from how many time I face palmed myself over Ichika reacting as if he was afraid of women, he might as well be, or his moral system is on overload. There is a line in between showing attention to the women that adore you and wanting to jump off a cliff when any woman holds your arm. This show was a great example of a mech show done in a fun and light hearted matter but still had a bunch of parts where you go, \"come on man, do something, please\" without actually caring what Ichika does because hes respectable yet predictable in his actions. I have chosen a 6/10 for this show, and I hope you read my future reviews.",

            "content": "Infinite Stratos 2 is an anime that you can't watch if you have a criteria on your hands, Is one of those animes that have their charm but you gotta clear your mind. This second season was a lot more fan service and more romantic approaches from the heroines to the main character, This season was purposed to that angle and the uncovering of \"Phantom Task\", The explanation on why was \"Ichika Oremura\" was kidnapped on his early youth and why Ms.Oremura had to step in when she was at a tournament at the time. Many reviewers don't understand the directors point of view orwhy did the writer did what he did to make this season. This a fanservice + base of what will happen on Infinite Stratos 3rd season, Since \"Phantom Task\" will take a heavy lead on the upcoming anime and A background of Dr.Tabane will be revealed and show her real intentions. IS 2 is a great anime, You can't expect this to be a very compact anime or to get straight to the point, If it did it would be a mainstream wouldn't it.\\n\\n\r\nIS2 Shows the hidden personality the heroines share and differ. New characters are added plus 2 new heroines that are added to his \"Harem\".\\n\\n\r\n If you're that kind of person that has a criteria already set, Please give up on anime and do something else with your time, Like i said before not all animes can be graded because non-mainstream animes such as this one are the type that you enjoy with a clear head, You must accept what you watch not question it, Otherwise you'll never understand the point of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you're like me a person who appreciates anime and actually is able to absorb multiple points of view and understand concepts, You'll love this anime is great. It just has an unfinished taste to it, Because like i said it's a background anime with some action but serves as base to avoid certain explaining on the next seasons and at the same time raise questions.\\n\\n\r\nA word of advice to ya all would be, Develop what i call an Spherical Understanding, You don't get it? Well how many sides does a sphere have? I guess that was hint enough. Don't approach an anime from just 1 angle if you do you're no different than a BLIND MAN trying to judge an animes graphics.",

            "content": "Ok, before anyone reads this review I just want to say this:\r\nI don't think any better of this show than anyone else who wrote a review about this anime, but I simply have a different way of rating it. The existence of the show and the things being shown actually being comprehensible make it worth a rating of 5, together with the fact that I don't really feel sorry for watching this.\r\nOn to the real review. If you enjoy criticizing people, or anime, or both (like I do), I highly recommend this anime to you. Thinking of everything the protagonists could have done in aless stupid way may actually make you feel better about yourself. Because they suck. For example, what do you do when a group of mad girls finds you while you're talking to another girl? Of course, you pick her up and run! While looking the wrong way of course, so you can bump into yet another girl.\\n\\n\r\nIS2 consists of 2 repetitive scenes, the ecchi scenes (AKA Ichika seems brainless scenes) and the battle scenes (AKA Ichika seems brainless scenes). In the first mentioned, Ichika is talking to a girl who ends up blushing, and he either says something stupid, or the other girls show up. The result: They're mad, he doesn't understand, not even if their reason is legit. I do think the characters have their defining features, but when they need to decide on something it's shown that the not-fighting scenes are nothing but a vessel for the fan service. There always is some dumb mistake/decision from one of the parties, which always results in some embarrassment, escaping, which leads to more of the same. Typical fan-service only scenarios.\\n\\n\r\nFor the fighting scenes, I'll explain some basic rules of the series which will probably make my point clear. They fly around. They scream. It usually ends with Ichika pushing the enemy with the flat side of his sword, to... push them. I guess he doesn't know swords work better when swinging them. Not introduced fighters are weaker than anybody else. Ichika is shown to be very weak in training, but everyone depends on him. And by the way, if all girls need to be together around Ichika, they can teleport. Or something like that. I don't know.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the story: It does exist. There is a storyline, and one of the baddies has some vague motive for being angry. The problem is, everything is too far-fetched. When you want to kill someone, you don't shoot them once and believe they are dead. If you find out there's a bomb on a train, a timer doesn't pop up automatically at exactly 30 minutes, which is the exact remaining time until detonation. When you die, you don't dream about being strangled by your sister. Anime doesn't have to be possible, but this was too much. Too bad these are exactly the things IS2 tries to link their story together.\\n\\n\r\nSo, my conclusion. The series do have some fun theories in them, and sometimes you might find something to laugh about. You do need to be able to find entertainment in tiny details, in comparing stupid people to yourself, or in watching things even you could do better. If you can't do these things, stay away from this show.",

What I have to say is a little different though. Some anime series are to provoke though, some are here for multitudes of other reasons. This season of Infinite Stratos DID lack in plot development, BUT it did what it was supposed to do. It was very entertaining. This is one of those anime series that is here for the soul purpose to entertain you and I'd say it did a good job at itspurpose. It lacked in story development, the art was really good though. The soundtrack was not extensive, but what it did have sounded really really good. The character development could have been done better, but I grew attached to the characters quite easily. This series was enjoyable to me. Over all...Im going to give this a 7/10.",

But if you're watching this at 2 in the morning, expect laughs, because the only thing you'll understand is how deliciously stupid this anime is. But I digress, let me explain.\r\nI usually don't hate on the ecchi anime, because they usually serve their purpose, but when they go ahead as to destroy the little plot they can serve, it becomes bad.Really bad.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 1/10\\n\r\nComing from the light novel, this arc should have brought resolution to the story. Instead, what the anime does is leave it half done, in such a way that they're hinting at a S3 that will never happen. The execution was so bad, it seemed like it was pushed off to the side, and they instead focused on ecchi and the repetitiveness of the competitiveness of the harem. This action, comedy, mecha, sci-fi anime turned into a slice of life sci-fi with a bit of mecha in it. I've never seen such a thing happen. Disgusting. This is honestly a new low; the execution/plot ratio is so low, it's lower than Guilty Crown.\\n\\n\r\nCG: Good. Not the best; not the worst. Pretty cool mecha designs; action scenes not bad. That's about it. 3/5\\n\\n\r\nSound: Nothing too special. Only noticeable was the redone main theme from S1. 1/2\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: No Development; new characters only brought plot, so they could have something to work with. As a plot device, not bad. 1/2\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I watched this at midnight till 2 ish. I found this hilarious, just because of how stupid some scenes were. If I were you, watch this when you're tired. You'll get 10 times the enjoyment you usually would. 9/10 for me, realistically, I have no idea why I watched this, so 1/5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Please focus on the plot instead of Plot. Using Plot as a plot device does not work. 5/10.",

            "content": "Okay this is coming from someone who enjoyed season one very much and I have to say that this is quite a disappointment for me. Like, I feel I needed a logic handbook of Infinite Stratos because obviously our common sense in earth doesn't apply in this and it's a whole new universe. \r\nIf you want to enjoy this anime, you need to remove high expectations of good writing. I'm not sure anymore. When did I have such high standards? \r\nThe art's pretty good and that's the best aspect of the series. I also thought the IS battle scenes were pretty cool, sometimes awesome. Butthat's it, to me, that's where the anime didn't much fail from.\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, most of main characters get wind up into really serious battles that are like maybe military-level? But those kids are 15 or 16? Where are their parents? I mean, how about after a battle, and they're exhausted and stuff, shouldn't the school contact their parents? Sure, maybe they don't want them to worry but you know, just in case?\\n\\n\r\nI adored the characters very much from the first season as I found out about their stories, most notably Charlotte, she was cool and sweet. I feel bad that these characters were being muddled because they deserve better. How about, one of them sees that Ichika will never change his oblivious because he is so stupid, and they would be like, \" I'm better off without him.\" \\n\\n\r\nOh, and that's one of the problems, Infinite Stratos treats fresh ideas in the anime as quick-rotting matter. You know, like the harem. The glasses sister, you know her, you can see she feels incredibly inferior to her sister, there was some potential for Infinite Stratos to redeem itself but NO! No no no no. It's like the people who made this thought that the fact that they're trying to flesh out the character is not gonna be good and they're going to ruin it. And what do they do? They make that character fall in love with Ichika. Were the things he did seriously enough to make her attached? \\n\\n\r\nYou can't really distinguish much of the harem since in this season they're all goggle-eyed at Ichika and you don't know them anymore. Like Ichika unknowingly brainwashed them. Yikes!\\n\\n\r\nPlease, no third season or a follow-up OVA series. There's so many freaking plot holes nooooooo....",
