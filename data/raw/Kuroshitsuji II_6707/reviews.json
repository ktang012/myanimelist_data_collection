            "content": "Sequels can be a dangerous territory to tread on. Especially ones for shows that already do not follow the manga but instead, creates its own story. On one hand it has the job of following and wrapping up the previous season\u2019s (to an extent, \u201coriginal\u201d) storyline and on the other hand, pleasing the fans. To many, Black Butler II has done neither and to others it has done more than that: in other words, there is a clear division between fans. \r\nLet\u2019s get the technicalities out of the way. The art and animation is as beautiful and Victorian-Gothic as the first season, though the animationdid slip at times. New pieces of music by Taku Iwasaki (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater) are introduced along with new characters, thus being their character theme songs. And he sure does not disappoint. Again, in keeping with the theme of high class Victorian England classical music (or pieces that are inspired by those roots) are used, violin being the most distinct sound out of the instruments. Animation for the OP is taken up a notch and again we have two sets of animation for the OP song \u201cSHIVER\u201d; both of which were fitting to the song and showed two different styles of art; the first animation being the more unique and visually stimulating one. \\n\\n\r\nNow that sound and art is covered, time to sink our teeth into the real meat of it. \\n\\n\r\nSo how does one solve the problem of concluding the story from season one, especially with the amount of mess it had been put into? Why, just create a couple of new characters, slap \u2018em in and you can create all sorts of plot lines and justifications. \\n\\n\r\nEnter (or rather waltzes and tap dances in) our scapegoats; Alois Trancy, a bipolar; sadistic; misogynistic and rather scantily clad fourteen year old boy and his poker-faced butler, Claude Faustus. Along with the beautiful dark skinned maid, Hannah Annafellows and the silent triplet servants you have yourself the Trancy Household. \\n\\n\r\nAlready the anime is set up for a Trancy VS Phantomhive storyline, and it indeed takes that turn, for the better part of the show anyway. Simultaneously it tells us of the involvement of the new master and butler to Ciel\u2019s own past. Easy isn\u2019t it, to just make up characters for the convenience of the story? True, it isn\u2019t the most respectable way to go about wrapping up a storyline but A-1 Pictures does it in a way that doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious convenient plot device but actually attempts to build a relationship between the new characters and the viewers, which I can\u2019t really say the same thing about the first set of master and butler. \\n\\n\r\nFirst things first: No, this season does include ANY material from the manga in any shape or form, but considering how much the first season had flown off on a tangent it does not really matter, as if content from the manga (such as the anticipated circus arc) were to be included it would just be filler and would not relate to the happenings of the season. This does not mean that this season is \u2018pure filler\u2019 though as some fans have stated; instead it can be seen as an \u2018alternative storyline\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is not the best, but neither is it the worst they could have done. The introduction to the new characters was a decent move A-1 Pictures made, even though \u2013 as I said before \u2013 it was not an entirely respectable twist. Because of the short season (only 12 episodes long) there were fewer opportunities for plot holes, and the frequency ratio of random twists had depleted considerably compared to the first season. Some fans argue that there were more inconsistencies and plot holes than the first season, but quite frankly, I have to disagree. This season is as, or a lot less plot hole filled than the first season. It required people to work things out and guess. Nevertheless, there were some semi-serious plot issues but I appreciated how the story was a lot more consistent and actually seemed planned out. \\n\\n\r\nThe brilliance of this short season has to derive from the nature of the show however. There\u2019s a reason why the rating has been raised since the previous season from a PG-13 to an R 17. It\u2019s vulgar. Quite disturbing. And very crude. One of the many things I disliked about the first season of Kuroshitsuji was how there would be an awkward transition from serious business to idiotic comic relief, which would just kill the dark atmosphere of the show that was built up. Heavy topics such as prostituting and abuse are brought in, and the entire series was kept mostly enigmatic and dark. \\n\\n\r\nBut to be honest, the story wasn\u2019t what really shone during the course of the show. It was the characters. Not just the new cast, but also the old familiar faces. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first time, Sebastian the \u201cperfect\u201d being has met his match, an equal: Claude Faustus. Claude contrasts greatly with Sebastian. Rather than being mischievous and teasing he is straight-faced and serious and very, very undeservingly hated \u2013 and mostly for being true to the nature of a demon: sly, cunning and untrustworthy. Demons aren\u2019t known for being the most docile of all mythical creatures, and this is prominent in Kuroshitsuji II. The new butler drove the plot of the season, and I have to commend A-1 Pictures/Square Enix for not merely pampering the fans with what most would have had anticipated: a Claude arse-whooping by Sebastian. Sebastian is repeatedly put in a befuddled state, which did not just add that much more realism to him, but also made the viewers connect with the character a bit. \\n\\n\r\nAlois is definitely one interesting kid across any anime. From being happy-go-lucky, to a practicing sadist and cross-dressing (Can anyone say Maria Holic?) Alois displays an array of characteristics which combined, would indicate to your classic psychopath. And as with almost all mentally unstable characters, he did not have the most pleasurable childhood in the world. Thankfully, there was no sob story as there was a disgusting and disturbing past. Truth be told, I found Alois\u2019 nature and antics to be quite entertaining, refreshing and again, a big contrast to Ciel\u2019s personality. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, his character had been marred by the suggestive clothing he dons. You can\u2019t take a psycho 100% seriously if he is wearing hot-pants and leather high heel boots, which sadly is the case with Alois Trancy. I wish I could say that the fan service was just limited to this, but it isn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nFan service is blown WAY out of proportion. Every episode is gorging with it. Think of the first season. Now times the fanservice in that by 10 and you have a rough idea of what Kuroshitsuji II is like. Depending on the viewer, this can either be a plus or a minus. And weirdly enough, although there is triple the gay in this season, there is also fanservice aimed at men. \\n\\n\r\nRe-introducing the maid of the Trancy Household; Hannah Annafellows, the object creating fanservice for the guys. Victim to Alois\u2019 fits of abuse and her clothes ripping as easy as tissue (and always in the area where her cleavage is...I still wonder how her back doesn\u2019t snap holding up a rack that huge), Hannah is, for the first time in the entire Kuroshitsuji franchise, a female character who is a PART of the show; though this does not seem apparent at first. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem this show has (which, ironically, is the exact opposite of the first season\u2019s problem) is the length of the show \u2013 it was too short. Too short to make it as grand an ending it could have been. Kuroshitsuji II had the potential to be great, but then ended up anti-climatic, which was a shame really considering how great the first two-thirds of the anime had been. I just wish Alois could have been expanded on, as such a interesting and unique character as him is ever so rare. Even so, this season presented thrill, suspense and comedy that wasn\u2019t as strong or well carried through in the prequel.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd what a great comedy it is at times. Not the obvious and staged comedy the show usually (awkwardly) presents with its idiotic antics or side characters (the Phantomhive servants) but with its UNINTENTIONAL comedy. Some of the fanservice, or scenes were just plain ridiculous; you\u2019d double over from laughing at it.  \\n\\n\r\nSequels are dangerous, but nowhere near as dangerous as a demon lusting for your soul. Kuroshitsuji II should be taken with a grain of salt \u2013 it most definitely isn\u2019t the best it could have been, but honestly, it could have been a lot worse. If not for the open ended conclusion, which is most likely to lead onto a third season to milk the proverbial \u201ccash cow\u201d I would have rated this higher, but as it stands, it is decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nBut you can never please all the fans, and this has never been truer when it came to Kuroshitsuji II. \\n",

            "content": "Here we have Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler), season 2.  What is it, and what is it not?  (Please, loyal fans, be kind to me, for voicing my opinion.)  And please, all you Black Butler fans under age 18, ask your parents before watching this series.  I'll say up front that the content is at an overtly ADULT-ONLY level.\r\nMoving on....\r\nWhat this series is not: It's not at all related to the manga.  It's a continuation from the end of season 1, which had begun to diverge from the manga around halfway through.  Even though the first season apparently painted itself intoa corner, we continue on from that ending.  (And eventually get some questions answered regarding that.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I hope this isn't a spoiler, but Ciel's back.  And so is everyone's favorite butler, Sebastian.\\n\\n\r\nSo what IS this series?  It's fanfiction.  Pure and simple.  By fans, for fans.  And that means heavy doses of fanservice.  You can imagine that its creators took everything they had fantasized about in regards to the first series, and decided, \"Let's put it into an anime!\"  And this fanservice isn't for youngsters.  Funimation was right about choosing to rate the series MA (equivalent to an \"R\" rating).  The opening scene is a mere sampling.  It shows a naked young boy crawling out of a bed from next to a naked older man.  \\n\\n\r\nFanservice is pervasive, with hints of shotacon, and enough boyxboy and butlerxbutler to make yaoi fangirls melt into squeals.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis:\\n\r\n**********\\n\r\nThe first episode introduces a new young master, Alois Trancy (a blonde boy of Ciel's age), and his butler, Claude.  The next three episodes are similar to the original series: Ciel goes about with Sebastian, running errands for the queen.  We reunite with a lot of beloved characters from the first season (the Phantomhive servants, Elizabeth, Prince Soma, Lau, Grell).  \\n\\n\r\nBut then Alois and Ciel cross paths.  And that's when things start getting sticky.  Secret arrangements between butlers.  Soul transfers.  New contracts.  A new rule was added to the Black Butler world when the creators came up with the idea of keeping souls in rings.  All these ideas and more are pushed to the max, to practically the very final moments of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, Alois and Claude are after Ciel and Sebastian.  It's not until halfway through the series that we find out what for.  We also discover why Ciel is still around, despite how the first series ended.  Sebastian also has his own personal bone to pick with Claude. Get ready for a butler showdown....\\n\\n\r\nAfter we get to the middle of the series, we encounter an incredible number of new twists and turns, making things muddier and muddier.  They can come off as brilliant plot twists, or tiresome complications, depending on how you liked the series up to that point.  Personally, I didn't have a very good opinion of the series by the 5th or 6th episode, so as each of the final episodes unfolded, I kept asking myself, \"Can things get more screwed up than they already are?\"  And yes, they do.  \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the ending is not ambiguous like the first series' was.  Although things are still unclear until the final 60 seconds or so.  I'm not sure that they could make more series based on an ending like that (or that I would want to see them!).  But it's pretty satisfying, and in keeping with the spirit of both series.  You do wonder how it's possible within the Black Butler world, since it's sprung on us quite suddenly, and we've not seen anything like it before.  Still, it's nice and gothic, and a little creepy; makes you feel good, while giving you a bit of a chill.\\n\r\n***********\\n\\n\r\nI had always thought of Ciel as being a tad cruel, and rough on his servants.  But now he seems a veritable angel compared to Alois. Alois dregs the depths of cruelty, sadism, cunning, and is an utter brat.  And creepy.  \"Ciel,\" he says, \"I want to become One with you.\"  Yep, that's one messed-up kid.  Later, we see some of Alois' backstory, and some tragic and difficult things that happened to him.  But it still doesn't excuse (or, I think, fully explain) his cruelty and borderline insanity.  Fans of creepy characters might like him.  But he's rather pathetic.  I only felt a twinge of pity when I found out what it was he really wanted from Claude.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also one busty maid who's always being required to strip or wear revealing clothing; or sometimes she even rips off her own clothes.  If this were a shounen anime, it would be almost ecchi.  There's also a character who acts as a sheathe for a demon sword, and gets the sword pulled out of their body in a rather grotesque fashion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 retains the lovely animation and sense of style from the first one.  And hot butlers.  And, as a bonus, an ending that doesn't leave you hanging like before.  However, if you want an intelligent, well-crafted story along the lines of the manga, or even the first season, it's really not here.  It's a fanfiction series that tries to see how messy you can make the world of soul/demon contracts.   Sure, you need to know the world of season 1 in order to watch this.  But its purpose is no more than to be a pleaser for mature fans and yaoi addicts.  \\n\\n\r\nThus, my comparatively low rating.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II (Black Butler II) is not a true sequel to the original, or at least I refuse to hail it as such, but it is still an interesting addition to the series and appears to experiment with several archetypes, something I as a writer and literature major can appreciate.\r\nI've heard it called an abortion, a sort of a tragic death to the tragic series about death and mortality, and taken in the aspect of a literal sequel - a direct followup to the Black Butler that received high acclaim - this would indeed be the case. However, what Black Butler II does is notpoor storytelling in any sense, as far as I can tell (at least until the last few minutes of the final episode, but we'll get to that) - it is simply such a strong deviation from the anime offered by the original that many I've encountered have trouble accepting its premise. Both offer an interesting, Faustian take on the story of the classical romance, (where the bond between demon and contracted is not platonic, but romantic) but Black Butler II greatly underplays the elements that made Black Butler what it was. \\n\\n\r\nThis series introduces Alois Trancy and the butler Claude Faustus, along with several other characters who seem to mirror Ciel Phantomhive, Sebastian Michaelis, and the cast who tends to the former's mansion. While Ciel is outwardly dark but ultimately benevolent, Alois is (in several cases) outwardly benevolent but ultimately sadistic. The image we get from the beginning of the anime is one where Ciel and Alois are polar opposites, with Alois playing the Moriarty to Ciel's Holmes, but that dichotomy is played with in such a way that I would have to consider it unique or innovative at least. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Butler II has several faults. For one, it does not serve as a tangible vehicle for an intuitive storyline, but uses its allotted run time to dabble in the deconstruction of dichotomies and social mores (at times not as subtly as it should). The relationship between butler and master is questioned, as naturally so is the relationship between demon and contracted. Fictional conceptions of \"the villain,\" who serves as opposite and parallel to the central protagonist, are also challenged. I can't get into how without spoiling the ride for you, but if you take a step back, it's definitely there. How it goes about this \"deconstruction\" is questionable.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, it's almost not Black Butler anymore. Sebastian is presented on a level plane thanks to Claude Faustus and the presence of several other \"demonic\" characters, meaning he doesn't allow the series to shine quite as much. I've heard it said that Black Butler IS Sebastian Michaelis, and people who agree with that notion are likely to face disappointment at the sight of this new, humbled Sebastian.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, it's much darker with much less comedy than the original. We see less of the servants, of Elizabeth, and of the main cast, who have been relegated further into the background. At its core, it's simply not the same anime anymore.\\n\\n\r\nI liked it. I liked that I was able to see where it played with the romance genre and with fiction in general. Ultimately though, its willingness to experiment and dabble in concepts does not save its occasional poor delivery or the eerie ending which doesn't fit with the buildup of the series. The conclusion is quite a deus ex machina, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I will say is that Black Butler didn't need a sequel. If ever it did need one, Black Butler II is certainly not its rightful successor.",

            "content": "Being an avid fan of Kuroshitsuji, and seeing the entire first season, OVA as well as being an avid manga fan, I must say that I'm disappointed in this series for several reasons. This is merely an opinion, but I found myself hating the storyline behind season 2 entirely.\r\nBelow are the good, bad and ugly of this series:\r\nThe good\r\nThe series has amazing artowrk and beautiful sound.The animation was crisp and clear and the music was amazing, especially with songs coming from Yuya Matsushima and Nightmare.\r\nThe bad, and the ugly.\r\nAs several reviewers stated before, it does not follow the manga, but I don't consider that badbecause a lot of anime follow this trend.  The storyline had actually stopped following the original manga plot during the Drocell arc in season one.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this series started off with a filler episode as the second episode.  That is a big no-no for any anime.  You start off the series by building up the plot, not doing a filler episode that, regardless of whether you watched it or not would still understand the story.\\n\\n\r\nOut of character moments.  There are several large out of character moments and things that were brought up and dropped.  In one of the episodes, Viscount Druitt (who has a medical degree and offered to sell off the protagonist, Ciel Phantomhive in pieces on a black market auction) fainted at the sight of blood.  It was rather vague on if he was extremely happy in seeing it, since he had sadistic reactions to the previous battle, or if it was because he was woozy but I found it very out of character.  There are several other moments in Ciel, Sebastian and a few other characters that I found out of character.\\n\\n\r\nUnexplained changes to characters.  Several relationships and things about the characters were not explained or elaborated on, which made a very obscure plot and caused general confusion among fans who had been following the series faithfully.\\n\\n\r\nFan service.  To be honest, in my opinion, and don't kill me on this, but this series was written like bad fanfiction and left many answered questions.  There was also a huge amount of fanservice and hardly any of it was presented in a way that I thought was well thought out or tasteful in the slightest.  The setting and time period for this show went from elegant to trashy and it caused the series to lose it's appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also too many of what I call 'scenes of convenience'. Several characters had the opportunity to be interesting and have a good amount of spotlight but were disposed of in poorly executed ways. Viscount fainting was a poor excuse to get rid of his character during an important scene where he could have taken active role in the plot. He was actually promised a very good storyline with watching over Alois but it was disregarded shortly after wards, which was a let down to me, as a personal fan of the characters.  Also, as good as the first episode was, shoving Ciel and Sebastian in it all too quickly, as if the say 'Look! They're still in this season!' Because the writers were afraid of fans not being interested was a poor decision in execution as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had overall poor execution and a lot of things were unexplained or left off.  The episodes got more and more ridiculous after a moment in time and I couldn't find myself watching it after a while.  It became a chore and not an enjoyment.  As a Kuroshitsuji fan, I'm sorely disappointed in this season. As an anime fan whose critiqued anime for 4 years, this is the worst I've seen in a long time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing but a case of bad fanfiction turned into an animated series.  I expected a lot more from Kuroshitsuji.  It only got worse as the series ended. If they make a season 3, I might not even give it the time of day.  There are better anime out there, I implore anyone who reads this to stick to season one, or they might end up just getting angry.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time in England there was a fair Queen who ruled the land; only the queen was not fair at all, in fact she had died and the country itself was hiding it. But from what or whom?\r\nThe story continues with a new contract formed between a young boy of fourteen: Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus who carries a similar presence as well as punch line \"I want to greedily devour you to the end, my master\" as Sebastian and through a small critique made by Sebastian in the first episode it seems that Claude tries to follow in Sebastian's foot steps butnot quite One hell of a butler; just yet...\\n\\n\r\nAlois and Claude compliment each other well as Alois is very needy at times and clings to Claude then goes through ridiculous turns of moods which Claude just seems to ignore. (I think Sebastian would not have the patience for this child.) Alois who is also referred to as \"the spider\" (As this is the form in which Claude introduced himself to Alois) is a marvelously radiant child with a charming smile and captivating energy... sometimes. The truth is the kid is like Mr. Jeckle and Hyde. He goes from smiling cheerfully to scornfully screaming or punishing a servant for no rhyme or reason and further more he seems to enjoy this type of behavior wildly. The young boy has basically gone mad. Where as Ciel was \"evil\" because he wanted revenge for the wrongs done to him; before that he was pure. He was stable, had good relationships in his life. He lost everything before he stunk from the mud of the gutter. But Alois was born from gutter mud so to speak. It's all he ever knew. His evilness is much more frightening. But this I'm sure is precisely why the \"Queen\" uses him. He's an interesting character who I thought I'd hate but he'll be fun to through into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nSo with the queen's new spider doing her dirty work then what of her loyal dog? Well SPOILER: he comes back. In the first episode Sebastian feigns the guise of a traveler and enters the Trancy mansion to retrieve Ciels ring. Why it's in the Trancy mansion, I don't know. Why he needs it revive Ciel? Who knows?\\n\\n\r\nI didn't suspect a character like Alois could actually carry this series as the lead. He's too unbalanced and immature to carry out a vendetta successfully no matter who they made as his side kick. At first I didn't like the idea of Ciel coming back either after he was so obviously dead. But I assume this new character Alois and Claude will be fighting against Ciel at some point? It implies by the third episode that Claude is the protagonist causing the fires \"a man with yellow eyes\".The series has barely started and there are still so many interesting possibilities. What did he come back as? In the first episode it says that Ciel's debt is now paid. How so? Why doesn't he remember the Queen was killed or that Madame Red died? Why are his memories altered, I'm sure it's Sebastian's doing. I can't say yet but with the enjoyably written new characters to add to this twisted soul sucking thriller I certainly am looking forward to enjoying what I'm sure will be an amazing Kuroshitsugi 2. At least here's hoping.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II embarks with the debut of Alois Trancy, the sadistic, erratic, and creepy-as-hell lord of the Trancy estate. Alois\u2019 backstory is disturbing, though in an incredibly enjoyable way. His character is endearing; a classic anime psycho that you can\u2019t help but be immediately drawn to. His character design is one of the best I\u2019ve seen in a while. He was such a complex character that had so much development potential. He really could have held the series up on his own. \r\nUntil he dissipates into a sniveling excuse of a train wreck along with the rest of the cast. Let\u2019s hope all those fanficsyou read late at night conditioned you to characters acting OOC. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to all the warnings I was given before viewing Kuroshitsuji II, I began with high hopes. It\u2019s Kuroshitsuji, after all. How can it fail? Surely Alois Trancy\u2019s creepy-as-hell demeanor would get the ball rolling. His juxtaposition to his stoic demon butler, Claude, was promising. But despite all the possibilities Kuroshitsuji II could have embellished upon, it fell flat. The character relationships so intrinsically built up in the first season came crashing way, way, down. It seemed as if Sebastian and Ciel were tossed into the plot just to please the fangirls. Character development for the debuting servants of the Trancy household is stagnant to nonexistent. The season begins with shameless fillers\u2014starting in the second episode, no less\u2014and later thrusts itself into a plot woven flimsier than one of Claude\u2019s spider webs. The romantic 1800s London time-setting of the first season seems to disappear from plot significance. Like the rest of the season, you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anymore.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the plot weaves into a labyrinth game show you could\u2019ve sworn you were watching Kuroshitsuji and not the Kids\u2019 WB.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the amnesia ass-pull.\\n\\n\r\nBut don\u2019t let me senselessly bash. The art is still great, but not as flawless as the first season\u2019s. Both versions of the OP, set to the song \u201cSHIVER\u201d, were stunning, with dazzling animation. (Especially Alois\u2019 version\u2014oh my god, can you say impressive?) Needless to say, Kuroshitsuji has THE best anime OST I\u2019ve ever come across. Alois Trancy's theme, \"The Slightly Chipped Full Moon\", is as beautifully disturbing as he is. But don\u2019t expect to hear the flawless soundtrack of the first season all throughout this sequel. You\u2019ll have to make due with cartoon sound effects tossed behind every \u201ccomedic\u201d fast-dash movement.\\n\\n\r\nComedic. Right.\\n\\n\r\nHahaha. Aha.\\n\\n\r\nSuccessful comedy in this season is rare, but its rarities are frequently supplied by Viscount Druitt. His idealistic ravings are hilarious, albeit ill-timed considering they most often arose during what could\u2019ve been considered a more serious fight scene in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship that Ciel and Sebastian built up season one came tumbling down faster than my expectations for this sequel. (On another note, Daisuke Ono\u2019s voice is like God whispering sweet nothings into your ear. Have you heard Sebastian\u2019s character song, \u201cAru Shitsuji no Nichijou\u201d? Woah baby. On second, thought, go hear Ronald Knox's character songs. And the entire Kuroshitsuji OST.) \\n\\n\r\nHinted shotacon is evident, but nothing you can\u2019t endure. Characters you thought were gone are back, characters you thought would show up are nowhere in sight, and the characters present\u2014namely Sebastian, Ciel, Alois, and Claude\u2014surprisingly leave the show unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you thought Lady Elizabeth couldn\u2019t get any more annoying, think again.\\n\\n\r\nI know that it\u2019s biased to compare a second season solely to its former, but the only reason I managed to stick it out until the end was\u2026well, it\u2019s Kuroshitsuji for God\u2019s sake. Especially considering that this season didn\u2019t follow the conclusive events of the first season\u2019s at all. It really felt as if this season was expecting to generate success solely by the loyal fanbase built up from the first. I\u2019m a major fan of the first season, but my loyalty can only take me so far. I really didn\u2019t know it was possible to slaughter a series like this. I really didn\u2019t. Creating a sequel is always a risky process. This risk should\u2019ve been left alone. The season quickly became tedious to watch. Season 1 also had a brilliant ending. This season\u2019s ending left a lot less room for interpretation, but it really doesn\u2019t matter how tight an ending is if it stinks. The characters provided this season with so much potential, but just couldn't hold up. But that being said, Alois Trancy is enchanting, and Ronald Knox (though his screen-time is pathetically minuscule) is an epic cutie pie.\\n\\n\r\nI never thought I\u2019d be giving anything of Kuroshitsuji a 5. But a 5 is really all this second season deserves.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kuroshitsuji II managed to take everything the first season stood for and drive it into the pits of hell. But don\u2019t worry, at least Sebastian will be waiting. Along with the season\u2019s production staff.\\n\\n\r\nBurn, baby. Burn.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II, a new butler and a new master. It is completely original and does not follow the manga. Kuroshitsuji II was born as fanservice and it died as fanservice too. But you know what? A-1 is pro enough to make this fanserivce work with the plot. I call it!! *drum roll* Logical fanservice!! :P\r\nOk so I'm not talking about boobs and panty fanservice. There's plenty of boobs I assure you but I'm talking about a different kind of fanservice. Notice how Ciel and Seb are in the character section now? They're in there for a reason. So think about it, Seb and Ciel +fanserive equals what? And you probably got it so I'm not gonna say :D\\n\\n\r\nThis season has been dubbed as Toboso-san's personal doujinshi just so you know.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so, the story was weird for me. It was dark and everything but it just didn't have that original touch to it, like it was obvious Toboso-san didn't make it. The plot was infuriating if you ask me. It was like a roller coaster I was kinda regretting to ride. Later in the season, maybe because of my biased thinking, the story was just annoying. The comic relief was in the wrong places, everyone's ooc, it was just wrong and I didn't like it. \\n\\n\r\nBut thinking of it from an unbiased point of view, it was pretty smart. The plot was clever and contains a whole lot of symbolism. It's crack, I have to say but it's crack that just made it into an anime. It was a cool crack and even though watching it annoyed, I'm still glad I 'went on the roller coaster'. \\n\\n\r\nArt was beautiful. God I love it!! However, it was lacking. I don't know if the budget was running low or something but some of the faces were really blank, quite literally too. Okay, so they didn't have fully blank faces but it was really under detailed and honestly, I think they could've done better. The art is clean, beautiful, good use of colours, just lacking detail.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the sound. I love the OP and ED and the little movie that went along with it. They were so beautiful. Kalafina comes back as well with their beautiful voices to give us a really beautiful song. Even Seb's actor for the musical sings the first ED. It's really meaningful once you watch the whole season. It was like a light bulb that went off in my head. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu is just wonderful!! Ono Daisuke does a wonderful and so does Maaya Sakamoto!! Sakurai and Mizuki-san do wonderful jobs as well!! I love their voices. I jsut find it kinda funny how Ciel and Alois are voiced by girls LOL But it's cool :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is the main section of Kuro II. It's pretty much what drives the story. I love the cast. All of them, even if they are characters you can't help to hate. It's one of them love to hate characters. You get them in this season. But it makes it oh so interesting!! It's because of everyone's weird personalities that Kuro II is just that much better. However, characters -obviously- give out huge spoilers so I cannot continue with this section anymore :( And I love talking about characters the best!! Just some advice, don't judge a book by its cover, ok?\\n\\n\r\nI loved the season, even though there were parts when I felt bored or incredibly angry but it's good. The fanservice kinda makes up for it. It's definitely something for fangirls/boys but if you're a serious follower of Kuroshitsuji, then you might not like this season at all. It's sorta a love or hate thing. However, A-1 still gets points for mixing the plot with fanservice!! I pretty much worship them now :P But yeah, if you're serious, this might not be your thing. If you're part of the fandom, you'd probably enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch it, then try to watch it with an open mind, or if you want to go on that roller coaster, you can always watch it biased :P Either way's good. Btw, watching this season will make you love the manga more, whether you love it or hate it, you're gonna wanna go back to the proper thing. Sometimes you really do have to be careful with what you wish for.",

And I loved it!\r\nYes, I love season 2 and dislike season 1. Firstly I never found Ciel/Sebastian to be interesting. Sebastian is way too perfect that I don't even care about him.\r\nBut here comes season 2 where we are introduced to several new characters. Alois is very mean and had some pathefic moments but over all I would better watchhim and his active live instead of Ciel who mostly drinks tea, walks around, gets kidnaped and orders Sebastian around. However, in this season Ciel happened to be more ative and became more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian had finally faced some seriouse trouble and is not a Marry Sue anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most importatly, characters who seemed to be useless forthe most part, happned to have a big suprise for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one of those series where good guys actually lose at some point. I don't want to spoil too much but ending was perfect for me. It was unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only people who will be dissapointed are crazy yaoi fangirls, that is if you don't try to look deeper into it. Becaue I think that you also should be happy about the ending.\\n\r\nAnd of course if you are manga obessed, then you also won't like it.",

            "content": "Story::\r\nKuroshitsuji II starts off where season one left off.....sort of. The series begins with a a new butler/child combo, Alois and Claude. From the summery of the series, one would assume that this isn't so much a second season as it is a successor. However, we quickly learn that the story begins to jump around from the first episode as this pair is introduced alongside the more familiar Ciel and Sebastian.  Not much can be said beyond this point to avoid spoilers, but the basic premise of Kuroshitsuji II revolves around the developed rivalry between Alois and Ciel, as well as the rivalry betweenSebastien and Claude. The story develops at a fantastic pace and mostly avoids the silly fillers and unless episodes that slowed season 1 down so much. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, fan service is back with full force. The obvious tension between..oh..every male in the show is amplified ten fold. I would go so far as to say that Kutoshitsuji II almost treads into slight shounen ai territory. Alois and Claude are especially guilty of perpetuating this. \\n\\n\r\nAs great as the story is (and it is very, very good) a major problem I had with it was that it is sometimes a bit unbelievable. The motivations of the characters sometimes seems slightly unrealistic and forced. I found myself questioning these sometimes over dramatic and silly motives, but ultimately no caring because I was enjoying the show so much. \\n\\n\r\nArt::\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the art in Kuroshitsuji II is top notch and beautiful in every way. \\n\\n\r\nSound::\\n\\n\r\nVery catchy opening and ending themes, though what really pleases me about Kuroshitsuji's sound is the background score. It remains elegant and classical; with some jazz and opera numbers thrown in occasionally. At times, it can be over the top, but the flashy and in your face opera tracks really do add quite a bit to the mood of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like this series does a good job making highly emotional music that compliments the scenes very well and helps you connect better to them. It was one of the rare OSTs that I hunted for right away on the internet after hearing it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter::\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that things really get shaken up in this season. Ciel and Sebastian as a team have developed quite a bit from last season, adding a strong emotional flair that may have been lacking before. I much preferred their dynamic in this season, as it seems like they legitimately care for each other beyond using each other for revenge/a meal. Of course, both of them still retain their cynical and sinister natures as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Alois and Claude..they are intense. Alois is by far the shows most emotional character, however borderline he may be. Watching him in action brings chills down my spine. He has some of the most raw and pure emotion I'v seen in any anime character to date.\\n\\n\r\nHis butler is just the opposite. Claude is a cold, calculative scheme, but that in itself makes him interesting on screen. Both are immensely terrifying, and their interactions between Ciel and Sebastian will have you at the edge of your seat.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:: \\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji II starts off with a bang, gets weak for a few episodes, and then just straight shoots into a wild ride. \\n\\n\r\nOverall::\\n\\n\r\nThis show is very worth watching assuming you have seen the first season. Once you start, you won't be able to take your eyes away from the screen until the very end. The very few flaws it has are completely forgivable and overshadowed by it's amazing characters and rich plot. Fans of Kuroshitsuji won't at all be disappointed by the second season, and many may very well find themselves enjoying it more than the first.",

            "content": "To those lucky people out there who come across this review without watching Kuroshitsuji I: \r\nBefore you watch the first season, I strongly, STRONGLY recommend you watch the second season first, and then follow up with the first one and look at them as two different little stories, rather than being continuous. Look at them as two possible endings which might've occurred and you will have a choice of choosing the ending which best suits you and by doing so you won't have a chance of being disappointed and no ending is then \"forced\" upon you.\r\n(I will not compare it to the manga and howthe anime should have been adapted)\\n\\n\r\nSequels and second, third seasons are very dangerous; they can make a mess of things, good and bad. They can satisfy your wish when you don't want the anime to end, to go that extra episode or two because it can, they can clear the mistakes of the season I, they can be fun and ok to watch, they can be great and just the perfect thing to end the whole deal, they can even improve the first season!\\n\\n\r\nHowever...\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji II isn't one of those sequels. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season, as far as I am concerned had a superb ending, but seeing the first episode of season II which confused me, few episodes later, they explain perfectly as to why the anime continues and that satisfied me, because to some level they had a point and well, I too wanted to go on for a little while. But the sequel was unnecessary.\\n\r\nNow, shall we begin?\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound (10 - perfect)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is as good as season I, the same perfect style of drawing and coloring which suits the atmosphere, plus an extra additional touch when it comes to opening and ending themes. Music, great as ever. When it comes to intermission it blends more into it; instead of suddenly playing some happy tune when the mood way on the other side, it is  continuous, the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6 - fine)\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few additional characters as to season I:\\n\\n\r\nAloys Trancy - a bipolar child who dances on the line between thriving to destruction and then towards sadness and needing love to the maximum selfish extent. A sadist, yet a sad boy, jealous and vengeful, yet misplaced, lost and scared. The exact opposite of the young Ciel Phantomhive we've accustomed to and certainly refreshing to a point. He has a past which is not that sad as it is disturbing. Really, really disturbing. You can sit back and take a break from those sad, throbbing and sobbing flashbacks and be assured there are very, very few of those.\\n\\n\r\nClaude Faustus - AloysTrancy's very own demon butler who's perfect in every way as he should be, who can go head to toe with Sebastain. His forks and knives are golden, opposite Sebastians silverware, his eyes are yellow and he wears glasses. He has a few tricks on his own, being the servant of Trancy family, whose crest holds a spider.\\n\\n\r\nHannah Annafellows is a maid at the Trancy household. Aloys takes his insecurity and sadism on her without regret. Toying with her at any given time and given chance as the anime goes on, yet she remains loyal to her master in hope he will be happy...\\n\\n\r\nTrio - three identical bulters of the Trancy residence. They too had and have a part to play, though they could have been ignored. They are there for the soul purpose of being the \"new character\", anime could have gone without them just fine.\\n\\n\r\nWith the Trio exception, characters are very well made and fairly interesting.\\n\r\nAs opposed to the Trio, Phantomhive trio isn't seen much, which means there are zero to One \"unnecessary\" episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOnward to the story.\\n\r\nI'll try my best not to give out and spoilers so I will keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nSince there is a new master and a new butler, predictably, they will clash. Sebastian has met his match, a perfect copy of himself, Claude. He basically carries the story. Being sly and cunning he makes twists and turns and thus Sebastian has to work as hard as ever to protect his young master. Sebastian finally shows some \"emotion\" if you can call it that way. His expressions do change from the well accustomed satisfied, eager and hungry to rage, rage and rage and yes, even sometimes concern.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment of this series is pretty well. It's not good, it's not bad, it's a perfect mediocrity. Exactly what you'd expect from a sequel. The story had a bellow average, predictable development, an impressive twist none the less\\n\\n\r\nHowever...\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is idiotic and disappointing. Compared to season I, which had a perfect ending, nothing else was needed, they go ahead and give the ending (thus giving the entire anime) meaninglessness and mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nI know that most of you who will finish season I will immediately go searching for season II, but I feel I have to warn you, the ending Is disappointing and you Will be disappointed. Not because it might not be to your liking, but because it butchered what the first season was all about and thus killed the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching it? Yes, ofcourse. But ONLY if one looks at it as a different story that stands by itself, instead of combining it into one anime. Looking at season I and II as two different little anime who have same characters, different stories, different endings. That way, you can choose which ending suites you best and it's not forced on you as The Last and Final Ending.\\n\\n\r\nHope it was helpful :)",

            "content": "Last week I looked at Kuroshitsuji. This week I'm looking at the sequel. What's odd about Kuroshitsuji having a sequel is that the first series is complete. It tells the story of Sebastian and Ciel beginning, middle and end. Going into this, I have no idea how they could make a sequel, unless it's some kind of spiritual successor. Well, let's take a look at the series and find out how they handle it. \r\nYou can't see it, but I'm face-palming right now. Given the quality of the first series, I gave them credit. I didn't think they would go for a true sequel, butI was wrong. This series is a direct continuation of the first. With Ciel and Sebastian both making return appearances. Why, just why? The first series may have had an ending that was obvious and kind of rushed, but it was also suitable for the series. Why would you take a series with a pretty satisfying conclusion and add to it? That's actually my biggest issue with the story in this series. It's unnecessary. You have a young man named Alois Trancy with an impossibly talented butler. One evening they're visited by a strange traveler covered in heavy clothes. The man is revealed to be Sebastian and he's brought Ciel along in a briefcase. He steals something from the mansion and makes his getaway. I'm not going to give away the reasons behind all of this, but they're kind of stupid. After that Ciel and Alois gain a lot of animosity for each other so that there can be a plot. Now, let's start with the negatives, aside from it being an unnecessary addition. The first is that the retcon is very poorly handled and the plot that's added in to explain it is weak. Then there's the ending. It's pretty terrible. The story itself is lazy. A lot of it is just devoted to the rivalry between Sebastian and Claude. The series does have some episodes devoted to Ciel, Sebastian and the rest of the characters from the first series that are entertaining. It also has some plot elements that have merit, but they aren't really handled well enough to be as interesting as they could've been. \\n\\n\r\nBut at least the characters are still good, right? Well, kind of. Sebastian and Ciel are still good characters, although not nearly to the degree that they were in the first series, probably because they retread a lot of the same ground and development that they already covered with less competent writing behind it. Ciel's staff still provides the same comic relief they did before, albeit less of it since they barely show up. On the downside, Grell reappears with the same problematic elements from the first series. Then we have the new characters. Alois, whose an obnoxious and very annoying brat with little personality aside from being a sociopath. We also have Claude whose incredibly dull. we also have Hannah, a maid in the Trancy household. When you learn what her motivations are the sheer stupidity will likely make your head hurt. We also get some triplet servants in the Trancy household. They have no personalities whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is still well done. The character designs are still good, for the most part. The backgrounds are still well done. The action sequences in this one really aren't as good. Part of that is just that they involve a lot of awkward scene transitions. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is still really good. Tamura Yukari, Hirano Aya, Sakamoto Maaya, Ono Daisuke and most of the other actors all give strong performances. Fukuyama Jun is still a weakness based solely on the fact that the character he's portraying is ridiculously exaggerated. Mizuki Nana has the same problem, although she does a little better at putting some nuance into the performance in spite of it. Sakurai Takahiro doesn't give his best performance either, largely due to his character having less emotional substance than a tapeworm. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is still a 1/10. there's no yuri here. \\n\\n\r\nYou probably deduced this already, but I didn't care for this one. It has some of the elements that made the first one great, but most of them are either weakened by idiotic contrivances and/or terrible new characters. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's a sub-par piece that doesn't stand well either on its own or as a continuation to the Kuroshitsuji. Next week, I'll look at Usagi Drop. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is next on my request queue, but I'm not going to have time to finish all of it in time. So expect that on the 29th.",

            "content": "I don't know if it's because I already poured my cereal in my bowl this morning and I didn't have any fucking milk, or if it's because this anime truley sucked. What I do know is this anime pissed me off. It introduces a set of new characters, Alios and Clyde, these two domininating the second season.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story was mediocre at best. It honestly wasn't in the least bit interesting, and was a waste of time to even watch. The storyline of the first one was great, amazing I'm fact. But this one was appealing, and made me think they should've ended it withwhat they had. Alios and Clyde weren't any significance, and seemed like a knock-off of Ciel and Sebestaion. It was long and drawn out, no character whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThe art was nice, nothing special and kept the Victorian era true to its name. Alios, Clyde, Ciel, and Sebeastian were all drawn nicely, and we're very original. The scenery in the background was nice, overall it was a solid 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was magnificent , and the voices fit the personalities of characters they represented. The opening and closing weren't very memorable, but the pictures were nice, while the second season lacked in story, the sound made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThe characters pissed me off. Not because they were annoying *cough Alios cough*, But because how two dementional they are. I hate when animators try and use flashbacks as a way to do character development. Some cases it works, others it miserably fails. This of course is the latter. They also love to try to have a depressing past to make us have sympathy for them, using this as an excuse for said character to be a complete asshole to everyone. Alios was an annoying brat, and quite frankly I'm glad what the animators decided to cut his part. Cylde was just overall creepy and delusional, obsessing over Ciel for some odd reason. They are just cookie cutter characters, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 \\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime at all. I loved seeing Ciel and Sebeastian again, but this anime was a train wreck. Alios ruined it for me, and I finished it, hoping that it will have a great ending, but it was a disappointment. I recommend that you watch it for the shits and giggles, but don't expect it to be the best thing since toast was invented. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5\\n\r\nThis anime averaged to about a 4.9, after adding each number I gave it then dividing it by the four categories, giving it a almost solid 5. It looks like shit compared to the first Black Butler, but after having an amazing first season, my expectations weren't set to high. I recommend to watch, but don't make my mistake of thinking it will be good, then being disappointed in the end. If you enjoyed my review, feel free to check out my others! Enjoy!",

            "content": "You know, people said the second season would suck. The only thing I ever knew about the second season(this was back when I was still watching season one) was the infamous \"tongue boy.\" Alois, I thought, would be a little like the Ikuto(Shugo Chara sexy kitty boy) figure. But it turned out that he was a very...Interesting person. Disturbed in terms of society's \"moral correctness,\" Alois made for the perfect character to use as support for Kuroshitsuji's finale. \r\nI'm not one to like it when an anime series alters it's plot just so they can end it ahead of time, but this was a reallywell done plot ending. Although there were a lot of new characters, Alois, in particular, was my big surprise. Because I'm sure anything anyone hears is just about his \"booty-licious shorts.\"  For those of you who are turned off by that factor(I wasn't but..You know, if you are) there's more to him than you'd imagine. \\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away any details, he's one of those characters that, if you're an open mind to different takes on justice, you can really come to love in the short amount of time that he was a lead in this series. Though it was definite that he supported Ciel, he also added a new twisted flair to Kuroshitsuji that I really liked. It was really because of him that Kuroshitsuji had as good an ending to the anime. (After all, by his wishes, did everything that happened come to be reality.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other new characters such as Hana and Claude are both support for Alois. Because of Alois's \"Needy behavior,\" it was very skillful to add such high contrast characters beside him that help support such a boy(otherwise he probably would have fallen apart.) Hana is a passive maid who lets Alois treat her as a rag doll, while Claude is a sort of absent character who is very hard to please. As Alois's butler, he says things with empty meaning and often, Alois goes searching for actual emotion in Claude. Though Alois and Claude, as a duo, where never as effective as the Ciel-Sebastian duo, they were still a very successful contrasting pairing(not in the romantic way.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins in a rather rocky start as a lot of information is dumped on you. As the story starts when a big time lapse has occurred between the end of season one and the current events, it takes some time to piece together everything that happened, but the fact that the plot still functions, without the viewers having full knowledge of the previous essential points, is proof enough that the ending to this series was really a piece of work that was woven together beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people will debate about the yaoi or non-yaoi-ness of season one. But those who cater toward such style of affection will be slightly pleased to know of a fact that they will learn upon the first few episodes of the series; Alois Trancy is an aristocratic boy with a demon butler(like Ciel). But--rather than being an exact copy of the Earl of Phatomhive--he has differences in his past that led him to his current position and the location of his contract seal is different from Ciel's.\\n\\n\r\nWith a detailed past quite similar in cruelty and suffering to Ciel's, Alois's hardships toughened him into a callus soul that masked his wounds with twisted smiles. In some ways, he ended up less \"complete in mind\" than Ciel in the fact that his consciousness is not completely at peace with itself. By his sporadic behavior, ranging on the bipolar side, we can tell that he is very deeply damaged as a result of his ordeals. And his savior, Claude, is always the person he looks toward for recognition. One can hardly blame such a soul as Alois, though. He clung to what brought him out of the darkness; it could only be cruel to condemn him for not noticing the foolishness in asking for love from a Demon.\\n\\n\r\nIf we return to the very sensitive topic for this anime: Yaoi(which makes or breaks some people's experience with such a series), we will notice the location of Alois's demon contract: his tongue. Popularly, he is seen licking people with his tongue, or rather, a single entity. A certain boy for whom also has a demon butler... Ironically, however, Alois does not favor Ciel or seek any romantic relations with him(as I first assumed by all the comments I got on Alois's character), he actually wishes torturel Ciel. This becomes evident in the first episode(so don't think I spoiled anything for you). And the way for which his past, his demon contract, Ciel, and Sebastian weave together to create the finale to Kuroshitsuji make this a MUST WATCH for any fan of Kuroshitsuji, be it the anime or manga.",

            "content": "(This review is subjected to have one or two spoilers for the first ep)\r\nSo, I didn't finish watching the first season of Kuroshitsuji, because I didn't want to see the ending, when I know that it was so different from the manga (Yes, I read the manga) but I have to say, giving Kuroshitsuji season ll a shot wasn't a bad idea. As of now, there are only three episodes out and the suspense and the want for answers are already building. \r\nSTORY:\r\nThe anime starts out with a new butler and a new master. The starting of the anime wasn't bad, actually it was quiteinteresting, I thought that it wouldn't be so bad to watch this anime without the formal characetrs, Sebastian and Ciel, whom everyone deemed gone because of the last ep in season one. But Kuroshitsuji isn't something to be looked upon lightly, because our favorite characters were brought back as the actual main characters for Kuroshitsuji. This land mine was quite a surpise and excitement for me, but with the return of them brought up a very important question. Why has Ciel forgotten the near past events? The death of his aunt, the shinigami Grell, the queen... Why has Ciel forgotten? The answer might be clear to many of us, Sebastian is the puppeteer behind this whole charade. But why, why is this demon still holding on to his 'pure' master? And then the last question is, what does Alois want with Ciel? And the fact that the 2cnd episode doesn't bring back the Trancy household makes you want more information on them. So for now, I give the story a big TEN. Three episodes in and the suspense, the mystery, and the questions are building. But if you don't like a dark mystery revolving around a young boy and sinister characters that bind themselves to demons to get their very wish fufilled, then this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNow as a full on fan of Kuroshitsuji I do indeed read the manga and nothing can compare to Yana Toboso's art skill. She's a great artist, so it's obvious that I will be basing my critique off of her art. The scenery compares well with the artistic talent of Yana-san and feels very much of the victorian age. Though, for a dark plotted anime not everything has a dark feel to it and that gives the anime light. There isn't much of that in the manga but for a change it is good. The objects, houses, carriages, are all well accounted for when it comes to detail. It's a very beautifully animated anime. The characters I must say are also well animated, but it's hard to ignore the fact that the details just seem a bit off. I compare the screencaps to the manga pages and just think, the characters are so much better drawn in the manga. Had I just watched the anime though and cared less for manga, this would have gotten a ten, but yet, it has to suffice with just a nine.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (I re-watched the first ep for this part xD)\\n\r\nPersonally, I hate squeaky voices or overrated voice actors voicing anime characters. Bad voices can take away from a very good series. But it's hard to say that I don't like the voices in this series. I don't research on voice actors, but I have to say that the people who voice Sebastian, Ciel, and Claude are very good. They bring out the characters personalities very well. As for the sound effects, it's eh for me. I've yet to find a good anime where they don't have useless sound effects, but there not very apparant in Kuroshitsuji. As for the music? OH MY GOD. The eerieness off the opra music selected for this series if just fantastic. I don't personally like the sort of music play in Kuroshitsuji, but man, it's placed well. Not to mention the opposition of the music and the feel of the moment is perfect. So the only part bringing down the rating of this part is the sound effect of which I don't care for in any anime. So this portion gets a EIGHT.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nIf you haven't understood yet then let's repeat, this is a dark gothic manga with characters that have either rather depressing pasts, demonic personalities, or messed up lives. And the scarey fect of the matter is, some of the situations are not impossible and most definitely are quite real. Rape, human sacrifices, death, these are things aren't strangers to this series. It isn't talked about in every episode to where you are annoyed with it, but it shows in the characters personality how they were treated in the past. Such as Alois the supposed antagonist of the series and Ciel the main character whoes personalities feed off of their past. Then there's Claude and Sebastian, the butlers whos only desirer is to consume their master. With these dark characters the anime would be a lot more than just plain depressing (It can be) but then you have all your comic relief characters. So as there is lots of dark trends that will most definitely stream through this anime, don't worry, you will most definitely laugh. But keep in mind, this series revolves around the past and goals of the main characters. But I love the characters, so TEN.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI remember being completely and crazily crazy with happiness when I watched the first episode. And it's hard to say I didn't enjoy the first episode. It was great and fantastic and completely off the the edge of my seat. But then after the first episode, I asked the computer what happened? Sure, I laugh, but, episode two and three just couldn't compare to the first episode. It's not enough as of now to make me drop the series, because there are answers that I want answered, so I won't let the first few episodes stop me. So as of now, if you want to see a multitude of geners, go ahead and watch this. It can make change your sad mood to happy or your happy mood to sad, but because it's so early in the series, but the last two installments couldn't own up to the first one, this category gets a eight. There is hope yet, hopefully.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI hope I didn't mix up the anime and the manga... Which I highly doubt, since the anime is now completely different from what Yana-san has been writing, but I must say, that for so early into the anime, I am SLIGHTLY hooked. I enjoy the characters and the story. The fact that I already have questions without answers is a good thing. I'm happy that I have given this series a chance. And it's more than just a great way to pass time, so overall grade gets a NINE",

            "content": "Alright guys, I'm going to say this straight out of the box. I had my doubts, five minutes in to the first episode. I didn't think Alois was going to live up to the standards Ceil set, nor did I like Claude. He was simply too fussy. I changed my mind in the last few minutes of that same episode. Once I realized Ceil was in fact, still around, and it wasn't going to be about Alois, I was thoroughly delighted. \r\nFrom the standpoint of an animator, I have to say that the animation isn't as great as it maybe could have been, but consideringhow hard and quickly they have to work to get an episode out on time, I think they did a brilliant job.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the different entry scenes for the two different characters, both Antagonist and protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nI think you're going to come to like Alois, once you get past the fact that he's incredibly creepy at times. He's a bit co-dependent and needy, but he's also devious and clever. He knows how to get what he wants-when flirting fails him, he either acts crazy or incredibly clever. He's quick witted and VERY sharp--if a little sadistic and cruel. I respect character writing that makes me think, and Alois is definitely someone who keeps you on your toes. He's an ASTOUNDINGLY complex character, despite all surface appearances. \\n\\n\r\nHannah, despite  appearing to be incredibly submissive in the first episode, reveals a side of herself you'll find very surprising. Telling more would be spoilers though!\\n\\n\r\nClaude I didn't like, but I recognize the importance of having a character like him--His development is actually quite surprising as well.\\n\\n\r\nthe triplets seemed a little flat for me, but I think their role was just to be pretty and act creepy, points for that. There's really no back story or development behind them. I would have liked to see them explained a little more.\\n\\n\r\nOver all the series is a lot of fan service, (I assume as an apology to those who were upset by the final episode of the first season) and some trolling on the part of the maid and Alois. There are also a few Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jojo's bizarre adventures, and Eddy Izzard references(from my point of view at least) Showing that the Creator, Producers, Writers and animators all have BRILLIANT senses of humor, and good skills in subtlety. Indeed there are a few phrases in the middle of the project that you don't understand completely until the last two or three episodes, but it's well worth the wait.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion? Props for going out with a bang, keeping me on my toes and waiting, practically begging for more, and for doing a great job in a little window of time. 12 episodes isn't very much to reach the climax of this sort of thing. Kuroshitsuji II has a fantastic storyline, wonderful writing, intelligently crafted characters, for the most part. Because of all of this, I love this series as much as I loved it's predecessor, and the manga it's derived from. I'm sure you'll love it as well!\\n\\n\r\n Good watching-Nix",

            "content": "As a fan of the first season, I was looking forward to the announcement that the second season got a green lit. I disliked the idea of having a new master and butler but as the updates and airing date were moving close, I felt that the new master is indeed interesting and unique. Aside the new butler of course.\r\nThe moment I got to watch the first episode of the second season, there were mixed feelings. Confusion, amusement and unsatisfaction. The latter episodes became dull but there were certain ones that just makes me \u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll finish this. Maybe it would be more interestingon the next episode.\u201d I was damn wrong. The second season was full of faults in an overall score. The characters took a sudden landslide the moment Alois declared that he wanted Ciel, Claude lusting for Ciel\u2019s soul and Sebastian being a weak demon whenever Ciel\u2019s soul was on the table. Landslide?More of a catastrophe I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSo I\u2019ll start with the first and second most important part, characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive is a strong hearted independent noble. Why in the name of the queen of England should he let his emotions of pride and selfishness  just because there is someone working for the queen other than himself? This is clearly a point why Ciel is, most of the times, a spoiled brat, only a million fold richer. Ciel\u2019s reincarnation as a demon made the overall season\u2019s score lower than the others. He is Ciel but at the same time not. It\u2019s not confusing. Just imagine Ciel, being himself, only as a empty hollow. Do you get it now? Great. Now you\u2019ll see why Ciel isn\u2019t interesting anymore. I just don\u2019t know for those Sebastian x Ciel fans though, I\u2019ll just leave their imaginations of pedophility love.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian Michaelis is the famous talk around bishounen town. I\u2019m not a fan of his character but if I could compare his development between the two seasons, I would say that he became more of a lowly and cowardly dog than a humble butler in the present season. He is confident that his possession, Ciel\u2019s soul, wouldn\u2019t be robbed by some other demon. Which lead to a disaster which also lead to another huge failure, particularly the 12th episode. His resistance as declared in the first season was his biggest mistake if I say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nAlois Trancy(please do not remind me of his real name, I prefer this instead) is one of the freshest characters I\u2019ve seen. He is an interesting, pathetic, adorable, slutty, pitiful, devastated, attention-seeking male cinderella. But he became the dullest thing I can see in the 12th episode. He has become weak and easily-controlled soul. Leaving his murder behind, his character, wanting to be loved by Claude is just like those romantic movies I\u2019ve seen a hundred times. It\u2019s unrequited love, master and butler special edition. He became a poorly made character by the moment he said that he wanted Claude despite his failure of finishing the contract. Biggest waste. Period.\\n\\n\r\nClaude Faustus, fuck this butler very much. He is the biggest mistake. And because he is the biggest mistake he is also the culprit of the biggest downfall and biggest waste of the series. He\u2019s too honest, sneaky and is a monkey dressed in a butler suit with glasses. He\u2019s the type that if he wanted something, he would use anyone just to attain his \u2018something\u2019 and this something was none other than Ciel Phantomhive. His death was a failure too. I dislike him so much that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to accept comments about my rant about him.\\n\\n\r\nHannah Anafeloz,with no mistake, has the most development especially in the last two episodes. She has become Alois\u2019 savior and Ciel\u2019s killer. She ignited Alois\u2019 passion of becoming one with Ciel and devoured Alois\u2019 into a new contract after letting him know that she is one with his younger brother, Luca. I\u2019m surprised that she grew feelings with Luca which lead to performing a contract with him which became a bridge to be of service under the Trancy household. Oh, did I say she\u2019s a masochist? Yeah. The hell with it. She rocked the boat herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe triplets, the highlight of their existence was their failure of killing Sebastian. Other than that, they\u2019re triplets! And triplets are eyecatching. I prefer them cleaning and doing household chores instead of attacking Sebastian just to hide their idiocy and uselessness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, who would forget the Ronald Knox appearance? I didn\u2019t see that coming, I doubt that you did too.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters that were adapted to the second season has a pale presence. The parts where Sebastian was handing over a letter declaring the death date of Ciel were confusing. Their reactions weren\u2019t as lively as before.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the first season was balanced. The background and character quality was well balanced. The second season wasn\u2019t. The background quality was more of an A+ while the character quality was lower, more of a B minus. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but other than that, it was brilliant. The animation was great too especially when it comes to the fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThird, music and character voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe CV in the first season had a good score coming from most of the watchers, why wouldn\u2019t the second season have too? It\u2019s better and more fine. The music is more than passable. It\u2019s befitting. Except that in some points it sometimes overpowers the characters.\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji or in English, Black Butler, is a finely made series. The thing is, it flunked during the second season in very many points. So many that you will be able to point them out even though you haven\u2019t watched the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThird season? No thanks. But if they\u2019ve decided to push another season through, good luck with that. I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut till then.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II\r\n(two stars like this \uf0e0** means that there is a spoiler coming up, and you should skip to the next set of stars)\r\nAnd here we come to a sequel. Sequels can be a good thing, if expressed correctly and if it is relevant to the parent story, much like an OVA. And let\u2019s be honest \u2013 if a show is THAT good, and it ends in a sort of open ended way, shouldn\u2019t it just stay like that? I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure no one wants to know what happened to Azmaria at the end of Chrono Crusade. And though I used to hopefor it, I like the way the Code Geass series ended. You were left with either believing he was dead or alive in some other world. Quite honestly, I think that\u2019s the best kind of ending \u2013 one that you\u2019ll remember long after finishing the story. And this sequel is just passable. I preferred the way the first season ended, because it was just at the cataclysm that Ciel dies. Or, it was assumed so. I just don\u2019t like the way it all took off. And sadly, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re done. (I'm grading this according to the MAL number ruling - a six is fair, meaning its not great but it isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art hasn\u2019t changed much if at all from the first season. If there was a change, then it was so small I couldn\u2019t even notice it. So I\u2019ll give it the same art score I would\u2019ve given the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nNothing to say about the ending and opening soundtracks. They weren\u2019t overly enjoyable or disappointing, they were just ok. The soundtrack in the show, however, is a different story. The sound track of the second season is just as enjoyable as the soundtrack of the first. Beautiful melodies that mask sorrow or that exempt it all together \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of music you can hope to hear from this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nTo make it simply and clear: There really is no story at the beginning. The first episode brings Ciel back, and then it\u2019s just\u2026\u201cwhat?\u201d until episode 6. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you enjoy this arc, as you reminisce with old characters, but it all seems irrelevant to the story \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem. This, to me, is always what can make any viewer drop an anime. If the show flies way out with an idea or its arc is too long and irrelevant, you gotta wonder why you\u2019re still watching it. I can\u2019t tell you how many shows I was excited to watch, that I ended up dropping because the arcs got too boring and I began to question its relevance. But this is not the case, it was a little over played, yes, but it was enjoyable, and that makes up for it. In the end, the reconciliation of the characters, though late and not very deep, is strong, albeit a little more confusing than it should have been. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nCiel and Sebastian are old news. Elizabeth has very obviously taken a liking to Ciel, even more so than is noticeable in the first season. And sadly, you don\u2019t get to see much of her after the first few episodes. And then we get to Alois Trancy. A homoerotic, sadistic **(actually gay, as we see in the first scene)** freak. **People may argue that he was forced into it, but he doesn\u2019t seem at all deeply affected by it. Almost like it just doesn\u2019t bother him.**  He is utterly disgusting and despicable to say the least. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s gay, but because of the way he acts and the way he treats others.  His butler, Claude, is another freaky one. When you meet him, you sort of get the feeling he\u2019s like\u2026Sebastian from wal-mart. Like, Sebastian is a nicely polished Lamborghini or BMW, and Claude is just a cheap knock off, like a  90\u2019s era Toyota Corolla, or Dodge Grand Caravan. They just don\u2019t compare. Maybe I\u2019m being a little biased, perhaps because I already know Sebastian from the first season and have seen just how good he is at what he does. And, his humor has upped its ante from the first season \u2013 there was one specific part that I couldn\u2019t stop laughing about midway through the series that I had to watch again and again. You also start to wonder what the hell other characters are even doing in the story. And the truth is, you won\u2019t know until you get to episode 5 or whatever, when the story starts to make sense, as they\u2019re all explaining what has happened thus far. In simpler terms, your favorite characters don\u2019t exactly get enough air time this time around. I was honestly hoping for some more bonding with Lizzy. But that was shot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I still wouldn\u2019t exactly categorize this show as pure fan service or maybe even partly fan service, it does deliver a lot of what you\u2019re hoping to see. Not because its eye candy, although that is sometimes the case, but because it relates to the story, or helps set up a premise to the next or future setting. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Even though the first few episodes you\u2019re confused to no end, the last few episodes stick to the main plot and the point it is trying to get across is received clearly. Though, the ending was probably a disappointment simply because it ended, and made you think that the story could honestly have just not even started if it was going to end the way it did.  **With Sebastian being trapped into eternal loyalty.**\\n\\n\r\nFaults:\\n\\n\r\nI think the series was a great piece of work, but to be perfectly honest, it almost seems like the creators tried to make something out of nothing. I think that they wanted another season, and to make it possible, they brought Ciel back. He was dead at the end of the first season, and it should have just ended there. If the production team had wanted to do more work, they could\u2019ve just chosen to do an entirely new series. I wanted to watch this sequel because I assumed it would ONLY be based on Alois Trancy and his butler.  **Now, however, they\u2019re both dead.** And it only seems like it\u2019ll get worse, as word of a possible 3rd season is going around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis being a direct sequel, you are obligated to watch the first season in order to get this one. I honestly thought this was going to be a standalone show with just Alois, but that was wrong. Way wrong. Anywho, it was a great watch. I have personally been getting pretty bored with all the new anime coming out this season, as they are either too clich\u00e9 or they haven\u2019t finished (I had a bad experience waiting for Bakemonogatari to finish, since I started watching it a week before the last episode was supposed to come out, only to find out that the last episode was going to be coming out HALF A DAMN YEAR LATER). I\u2019ve started to watch MM! and the new To-LOVE-ru, and hope to finish them soon to write a review. \\n",

            "content": "I enjoyed Kuroshitsuji a lot and that was what got me hooked onto it to begin with. The fact that they made a second season made me leap for joy in a way but I'm utterly disappointed with what I've seen in this season. For the most part it doesn't have anything to do with the manga. The story from the beginning is really confusing and was really hard for me to understand. It was really obvious that the producers were only making a second season to please the fans. I would rather have Kuroshitsuji ending the way it did rather than have this crazyplot put together as a dire last method to make us happy. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a consistent storyline this is not the anime to watch. Some episodes I enjoyed and some I thoroughly didn't understand at all. Alois and Claude were newly made characters for this season; first off understanding the two is really confusing. Their personalities are hard to describe. One thing I noticed was that their behaviors were hard to follow but I'm not sure if this is just me or if they're just like that. I'm guessing it's both. From episode 1 to episode 12 it just makes me wonder what the hell happened. The ending was absolutely ridiculous to me but then again I'm sure this might have pleased many other fans out there. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the moment you begin to love a character you suddenly start to hate them as well towards the end. For some of the fanservice moments I laughed and enjoyed myself, but these moments didn't last too long. I'm not sure how to explain how confused I was by this season, the dialogue and events occurring didn't flow well and you don't get the answers to certain questions until you're at the end of the anime and even then it still leaves you puzzled. \\n\\n\r\nWatching the second season was still great because I got to see Ciel and Sebastian again. Kuroshitsuji fans I'm sure will watch this second season but I am honestly disappointed with the outcome of this season. The fanservice was still enjoyable though but the overall expectations I had for this season were not even close.",

            "content": "Okay I'm just gonna jump right into it:\r\nAs much as I enjoyed the first season, with its flaws and plotholes this season was confusing. There's plot elements that don't get discussed or explained until well into the season (e.g. episode 6/7) Now I haven't read the manga so all my opinions are purely based on the anime.\r\nThe setting, the art and the commitment to the victorian gothic feel are just as good as they were in season one. The atmosphere is dark and creepy and I loved it.\r\nThe new character are frankly gross, Alois Trancy is a sadistic child who gives off the impression of...wanting to be Ciel? wanting to be like Ciel? I still don't know. But he was genuinely so vulgar and overall unpleasant I was just disturbed by him.\\n\r\nThe new butler? acceptable, but he does feel like a Sebastian 2.0 in every sense of the word\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I had enjoyed about season one is that it didn't use the typical anime version of women, big breasts, tiny waist, zero personality. Season two somehow.... it almost seems like they're trying to make up for the lack of nudity from season one??? Which is something that I didn't really need. It would have stood and been just as if not more enjoyable (for me) if there wasn't.\\n\r\nAlois Trancy's maid suffers constant abuse from him and is basically just an excuse for thinly veiled extremely disturbing porn.\\n\\n\r\nin conclusion, I am so disturbed by this season and I don't even know what to think anymore. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Creators have to be extra careful when they create sequels and even series to popular movies/shows. I can name only a few sequels that have been almost or even better than the original, but this...not even close. I don't count this as a 'sequel'. \r\nPlot: \r\nWith the story, the first five episodes are clearly fillers, except maybe the first when introducing Alois. But we don't really get a proper story line until the middle of the season. It's a bit disappointing when you reach it and say, \"so what was the purpose of the last few episodes?\" clearly the writers weren't thinking when they wroteit. I do understand this strays far from the manga, but I found many scenes where it...just didn't make a whole lot of sense. Having the random episodes and humour is fun, but does it fit? Probably not. \\n\\n\r\nNow the themes of death and sacrifice were clearly there. Good. Some symbolism with the rings, marks, etc. But I found it repeated some mistakes from the first season. However, I won't hold season II responsible for a cliche plot. They did well to establish something original, creating a darker more gory atmosphere the first one didn't have much of. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that bugged me was how Sebastian felt like a supporting character in this. It was all about the new characters and less about developing the character of Sebastian and Ciel. When watching this, don't be surprised when they don't show up in the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nI have no problems with the art. The same comments apply from my review in the first season. Very clear effects. We had some rain, blood spilling out, shiny spiderwebs we all know and love, and many other things. The castles are well designed and animated, showing the dark-Gothic, 19th century theme in the show, and the characters the same. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually natural sound in this. The music fit perfectly with the selected scenes, and added the touches of the mood to the story. There are even the eeriness moans and screams from children and other things in the night. Adds to the horror genre this show wanted to come across as. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy...here we go. Let's start with Alois, shall we? \\n\\n\r\nCan someone please get this kid a psychologist? Clearly he has some major mental issues and even sexual issues. Now we do get a backstory on him, but I don't think it went far enough. We never got to see the relationship with his parents. Perhaps his birth father sexually abused him and his brother to make him the way he is. Who knows. But I have a feeling his parents or at least his father are to blame for his behaviour as the Lord and how he comes up with such vile things/ideas. He has no fear, and probably is diagnosed with PTSD or separation anxiety. I can say he is one messed up kid. \\n\\n\r\nThe good thing about him is he is not a stereotype. That is a relief right there. The writers created a very dark character though. I was shocked what I saw at the beginning. No child should ever be doing that sort or thing, which is probably one of the reasons why this show is rated R. \\n\\n\r\nOnto Claude. He is another Sebastian except a spider version of him. He doesn't really have a personality of his own. I don't have anything else to say other than that... \\n\\n\r\nHannah seems to hold a darker secret, which if you read the synopsis you'll know who she is. But she is probably the second darkest character after Alois.\\n\\n\r\nNow Ciel. I actually liked Ciel in this season. He's changed and his character has developed. He turned into a likeable character, something the first season failed to do. But Sebastian is still the same lovable, demon butler. He didn't change as much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI'll say it again, I didn't enjoy this season as much as the last. The ending was...a bit odd for my taste. Black Butler I and II is it's own series in itself. It doesn't follow the manga plot at all. And remember the cliffhanger ending in the first one? BB II doesn't show what really happens until a little while later. Go ahead and watch it to let go of your tension of wanting to find out after the last one, but don't be surprised if it's not what you expected. I was rather confused at first until I hit the fifth or sixth episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Black Butler II a C+ or a 68% on the soul scale. \\n",

            "content": "Sequels can be a dangerous territory to tread on. Especially ones for shows that already do not follow the manga but instead, creates its own story. On one hand it has the job of following and wrapping up the previous season\u2019s (to an extent, \u201coriginal\u201d) storyline and on the other hand, pleasing the fans. To many, Black Butler II has done neither and to others it has done more than that: in other words, there is a clear division between fans. \r\nLet\u2019s get the technicalities out of the way. The art and animation is as beautiful and Victorian-Gothic as the first season, though the animationdid slip at times. New pieces of music by Taku Iwasaki (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater) are introduced along with new characters, thus being their character theme songs. And he sure does not disappoint. Again, in keeping with the theme of high class Victorian England classical music (or pieces that are inspired by those roots) are used, violin being the most distinct sound out of the instruments. Animation for the OP is taken up a notch and again we have two sets of animation for the OP song \u201cSHIVER\u201d; both of which were fitting to the song and showed two different styles of art; the first animation being the more unique and visually stimulating one. \\n\\n\r\nNow that sound and art is covered, time to sink our teeth into the real meat of it. \\n\\n\r\nSo how does one solve the problem of concluding the story from season one, especially with the amount of mess it had been put into? Why, just create a couple of new characters, slap \u2018em in and you can create all sorts of plot lines and justifications. \\n\\n\r\nEnter (or rather waltzes and tap dances in) our scapegoats; Alois Trancy, a bipolar; sadistic; misogynistic and rather scantily clad fourteen year old boy and his poker-faced butler, Claude Faustus. Along with the beautiful dark skinned maid, Hannah Annafellows and the silent triplet servants you have yourself the Trancy Household. \\n\\n\r\nAlready the anime is set up for a Trancy VS Phantomhive storyline, and it indeed takes that turn, for the better part of the show anyway. Simultaneously it tells us of the involvement of the new master and butler to Ciel\u2019s own past. Easy isn\u2019t it, to just make up characters for the convenience of the story? True, it isn\u2019t the most respectable way to go about wrapping up a storyline but A-1 Pictures does it in a way that doesn\u2019t seem like an obvious convenient plot device but actually attempts to build a relationship between the new characters and the viewers, which I can\u2019t really say the same thing about the first set of master and butler. \\n\\n\r\nFirst things first: No, this season does include ANY material from the manga in any shape or form, but considering how much the first season had flown off on a tangent it does not really matter, as if content from the manga (such as the anticipated circus arc) were to be included it would just be filler and would not relate to the happenings of the season. This does not mean that this season is \u2018pure filler\u2019 though as some fans have stated; instead it can be seen as an \u2018alternative storyline\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is not the best, but neither is it the worst they could have done. The introduction to the new characters was a decent move A-1 Pictures made, even though \u2013 as I said before \u2013 it was not an entirely respectable twist. Because of the short season (only 12 episodes long) there were fewer opportunities for plot holes, and the frequency ratio of random twists had depleted considerably compared to the first season. Some fans argue that there were more inconsistencies and plot holes than the first season, but quite frankly, I have to disagree. This season is as, or a lot less plot hole filled than the first season. It required people to work things out and guess. Nevertheless, there were some semi-serious plot issues but I appreciated how the story was a lot more consistent and actually seemed planned out. \\n\\n\r\nThe brilliance of this short season has to derive from the nature of the show however. There\u2019s a reason why the rating has been raised since the previous season from a PG-13 to an R 17. It\u2019s vulgar. Quite disturbing. And very crude. One of the many things I disliked about the first season of Kuroshitsuji was how there would be an awkward transition from serious business to idiotic comic relief, which would just kill the dark atmosphere of the show that was built up. Heavy topics such as prostituting and abuse are brought in, and the entire series was kept mostly enigmatic and dark. \\n\\n\r\nBut to be honest, the story wasn\u2019t what really shone during the course of the show. It was the characters. Not just the new cast, but also the old familiar faces. \\n\\n\r\nFor the first time, Sebastian the \u201cperfect\u201d being has met his match, an equal: Claude Faustus. Claude contrasts greatly with Sebastian. Rather than being mischievous and teasing he is straight-faced and serious and very, very undeservingly hated \u2013 and mostly for being true to the nature of a demon: sly, cunning and untrustworthy. Demons aren\u2019t known for being the most docile of all mythical creatures, and this is prominent in Kuroshitsuji II. The new butler drove the plot of the season, and I have to commend A-1 Pictures/Square Enix for not merely pampering the fans with what most would have had anticipated: a Claude arse-whooping by Sebastian. Sebastian is repeatedly put in a befuddled state, which did not just add that much more realism to him, but also made the viewers connect with the character a bit. \\n\\n\r\nAlois is definitely one interesting kid across any anime. From being happy-go-lucky, to a practicing sadist and cross-dressing (Can anyone say Maria Holic?) Alois displays an array of characteristics which combined, would indicate to your classic psychopath. And as with almost all mentally unstable characters, he did not have the most pleasurable childhood in the world. Thankfully, there was no sob story as there was a disgusting and disturbing past. Truth be told, I found Alois\u2019 nature and antics to be quite entertaining, refreshing and again, a big contrast to Ciel\u2019s personality. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, his character had been marred by the suggestive clothing he dons. You can\u2019t take a psycho 100% seriously if he is wearing hot-pants and leather high heel boots, which sadly is the case with Alois Trancy. I wish I could say that the fan service was just limited to this, but it isn\u2019t. \\n\\n\r\nFan service is blown WAY out of proportion. Every episode is gorging with it. Think of the first season. Now times the fanservice in that by 10 and you have a rough idea of what Kuroshitsuji II is like. Depending on the viewer, this can either be a plus or a minus. And weirdly enough, although there is triple the gay in this season, there is also fanservice aimed at men. \\n\\n\r\nRe-introducing the maid of the Trancy Household; Hannah Annafellows, the object creating fanservice for the guys. Victim to Alois\u2019 fits of abuse and her clothes ripping as easy as tissue (and always in the area where her cleavage is...I still wonder how her back doesn\u2019t snap holding up a rack that huge), Hannah is, for the first time in the entire Kuroshitsuji franchise, a female character who is a PART of the show; though this does not seem apparent at first. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem this show has (which, ironically, is the exact opposite of the first season\u2019s problem) is the length of the show \u2013 it was too short. Too short to make it as grand an ending it could have been. Kuroshitsuji II had the potential to be great, but then ended up anti-climatic, which was a shame really considering how great the first two-thirds of the anime had been. I just wish Alois could have been expanded on, as such a interesting and unique character as him is ever so rare. Even so, this season presented thrill, suspense and comedy that wasn\u2019t as strong or well carried through in the prequel.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd what a great comedy it is at times. Not the obvious and staged comedy the show usually (awkwardly) presents with its idiotic antics or side characters (the Phantomhive servants) but with its UNINTENTIONAL comedy. Some of the fanservice, or scenes were just plain ridiculous; you\u2019d double over from laughing at it.  \\n\\n\r\nSequels are dangerous, but nowhere near as dangerous as a demon lusting for your soul. Kuroshitsuji II should be taken with a grain of salt \u2013 it most definitely isn\u2019t the best it could have been, but honestly, it could have been a lot worse. If not for the open ended conclusion, which is most likely to lead onto a third season to milk the proverbial \u201ccash cow\u201d I would have rated this higher, but as it stands, it is decent enough. \\n\\n\r\nBut you can never please all the fans, and this has never been truer when it came to Kuroshitsuji II. \\n",

            "content": "Here we have Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler), season 2.  What is it, and what is it not?  (Please, loyal fans, be kind to me, for voicing my opinion.)  And please, all you Black Butler fans under age 18, ask your parents before watching this series.  I'll say up front that the content is at an overtly ADULT-ONLY level.\r\nMoving on....\r\nWhat this series is not: It's not at all related to the manga.  It's a continuation from the end of season 1, which had begun to diverge from the manga around halfway through.  Even though the first season apparently painted itself intoa corner, we continue on from that ending.  (And eventually get some questions answered regarding that.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd I hope this isn't a spoiler, but Ciel's back.  And so is everyone's favorite butler, Sebastian.\\n\\n\r\nSo what IS this series?  It's fanfiction.  Pure and simple.  By fans, for fans.  And that means heavy doses of fanservice.  You can imagine that its creators took everything they had fantasized about in regards to the first series, and decided, \"Let's put it into an anime!\"  And this fanservice isn't for youngsters.  Funimation was right about choosing to rate the series MA (equivalent to an \"R\" rating).  The opening scene is a mere sampling.  It shows a naked young boy crawling out of a bed from next to a naked older man.  \\n\\n\r\nFanservice is pervasive, with hints of shotacon, and enough boyxboy and butlerxbutler to make yaoi fangirls melt into squeals.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis:\\n\r\n**********\\n\r\nThe first episode introduces a new young master, Alois Trancy (a blonde boy of Ciel's age), and his butler, Claude.  The next three episodes are similar to the original series: Ciel goes about with Sebastian, running errands for the queen.  We reunite with a lot of beloved characters from the first season (the Phantomhive servants, Elizabeth, Prince Soma, Lau, Grell).  \\n\\n\r\nBut then Alois and Ciel cross paths.  And that's when things start getting sticky.  Secret arrangements between butlers.  Soul transfers.  New contracts.  A new rule was added to the Black Butler world when the creators came up with the idea of keeping souls in rings.  All these ideas and more are pushed to the max, to practically the very final moments of the series.  \\n\\n\r\nFor some reason, Alois and Claude are after Ciel and Sebastian.  It's not until halfway through the series that we find out what for.  We also discover why Ciel is still around, despite how the first series ended.  Sebastian also has his own personal bone to pick with Claude. Get ready for a butler showdown....\\n\\n\r\nAfter we get to the middle of the series, we encounter an incredible number of new twists and turns, making things muddier and muddier.  They can come off as brilliant plot twists, or tiresome complications, depending on how you liked the series up to that point.  Personally, I didn't have a very good opinion of the series by the 5th or 6th episode, so as each of the final episodes unfolded, I kept asking myself, \"Can things get more screwed up than they already are?\"  And yes, they do.  \\n\\n\r\nTo its credit, the ending is not ambiguous like the first series' was.  Although things are still unclear until the final 60 seconds or so.  I'm not sure that they could make more series based on an ending like that (or that I would want to see them!).  But it's pretty satisfying, and in keeping with the spirit of both series.  You do wonder how it's possible within the Black Butler world, since it's sprung on us quite suddenly, and we've not seen anything like it before.  Still, it's nice and gothic, and a little creepy; makes you feel good, while giving you a bit of a chill.\\n\r\n***********\\n\\n\r\nI had always thought of Ciel as being a tad cruel, and rough on his servants.  But now he seems a veritable angel compared to Alois. Alois dregs the depths of cruelty, sadism, cunning, and is an utter brat.  And creepy.  \"Ciel,\" he says, \"I want to become One with you.\"  Yep, that's one messed-up kid.  Later, we see some of Alois' backstory, and some tragic and difficult things that happened to him.  But it still doesn't excuse (or, I think, fully explain) his cruelty and borderline insanity.  Fans of creepy characters might like him.  But he's rather pathetic.  I only felt a twinge of pity when I found out what it was he really wanted from Claude.\\n\\n\r\nThere's also one busty maid who's always being required to strip or wear revealing clothing; or sometimes she even rips off her own clothes.  If this were a shounen anime, it would be almost ecchi.  There's also a character who acts as a sheathe for a demon sword, and gets the sword pulled out of their body in a rather grotesque fashion.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 retains the lovely animation and sense of style from the first one.  And hot butlers.  And, as a bonus, an ending that doesn't leave you hanging like before.  However, if you want an intelligent, well-crafted story along the lines of the manga, or even the first season, it's really not here.  It's a fanfiction series that tries to see how messy you can make the world of soul/demon contracts.   Sure, you need to know the world of season 1 in order to watch this.  But its purpose is no more than to be a pleaser for mature fans and yaoi addicts.  \\n\\n\r\nThus, my comparatively low rating.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II (Black Butler II) is not a true sequel to the original, or at least I refuse to hail it as such, but it is still an interesting addition to the series and appears to experiment with several archetypes, something I as a writer and literature major can appreciate.\r\nI've heard it called an abortion, a sort of a tragic death to the tragic series about death and mortality, and taken in the aspect of a literal sequel - a direct followup to the Black Butler that received high acclaim - this would indeed be the case. However, what Black Butler II does is notpoor storytelling in any sense, as far as I can tell (at least until the last few minutes of the final episode, but we'll get to that) - it is simply such a strong deviation from the anime offered by the original that many I've encountered have trouble accepting its premise. Both offer an interesting, Faustian take on the story of the classical romance, (where the bond between demon and contracted is not platonic, but romantic) but Black Butler II greatly underplays the elements that made Black Butler what it was. \\n\\n\r\nThis series introduces Alois Trancy and the butler Claude Faustus, along with several other characters who seem to mirror Ciel Phantomhive, Sebastian Michaelis, and the cast who tends to the former's mansion. While Ciel is outwardly dark but ultimately benevolent, Alois is (in several cases) outwardly benevolent but ultimately sadistic. The image we get from the beginning of the anime is one where Ciel and Alois are polar opposites, with Alois playing the Moriarty to Ciel's Holmes, but that dichotomy is played with in such a way that I would have to consider it unique or innovative at least. \\n\\n\r\nBlack Butler II has several faults. For one, it does not serve as a tangible vehicle for an intuitive storyline, but uses its allotted run time to dabble in the deconstruction of dichotomies and social mores (at times not as subtly as it should). The relationship between butler and master is questioned, as naturally so is the relationship between demon and contracted. Fictional conceptions of \"the villain,\" who serves as opposite and parallel to the central protagonist, are also challenged. I can't get into how without spoiling the ride for you, but if you take a step back, it's definitely there. How it goes about this \"deconstruction\" is questionable.\\n\\n\r\nFor one, it's almost not Black Butler anymore. Sebastian is presented on a level plane thanks to Claude Faustus and the presence of several other \"demonic\" characters, meaning he doesn't allow the series to shine quite as much. I've heard it said that Black Butler IS Sebastian Michaelis, and people who agree with that notion are likely to face disappointment at the sight of this new, humbled Sebastian.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, it's much darker with much less comedy than the original. We see less of the servants, of Elizabeth, and of the main cast, who have been relegated further into the background. At its core, it's simply not the same anime anymore.\\n\\n\r\nI liked it. I liked that I was able to see where it played with the romance genre and with fiction in general. Ultimately though, its willingness to experiment and dabble in concepts does not save its occasional poor delivery or the eerie ending which doesn't fit with the buildup of the series. The conclusion is quite a deus ex machina, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I will say is that Black Butler didn't need a sequel. If ever it did need one, Black Butler II is certainly not its rightful successor.",

            "content": "Being an avid fan of Kuroshitsuji, and seeing the entire first season, OVA as well as being an avid manga fan, I must say that I'm disappointed in this series for several reasons. This is merely an opinion, but I found myself hating the storyline behind season 2 entirely.\r\nBelow are the good, bad and ugly of this series:\r\nThe good\r\nThe series has amazing artowrk and beautiful sound.The animation was crisp and clear and the music was amazing, especially with songs coming from Yuya Matsushima and Nightmare.\r\nThe bad, and the ugly.\r\nAs several reviewers stated before, it does not follow the manga, but I don't consider that badbecause a lot of anime follow this trend.  The storyline had actually stopped following the original manga plot during the Drocell arc in season one.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this series started off with a filler episode as the second episode.  That is a big no-no for any anime.  You start off the series by building up the plot, not doing a filler episode that, regardless of whether you watched it or not would still understand the story.\\n\\n\r\nOut of character moments.  There are several large out of character moments and things that were brought up and dropped.  In one of the episodes, Viscount Druitt (who has a medical degree and offered to sell off the protagonist, Ciel Phantomhive in pieces on a black market auction) fainted at the sight of blood.  It was rather vague on if he was extremely happy in seeing it, since he had sadistic reactions to the previous battle, or if it was because he was woozy but I found it very out of character.  There are several other moments in Ciel, Sebastian and a few other characters that I found out of character.\\n\\n\r\nUnexplained changes to characters.  Several relationships and things about the characters were not explained or elaborated on, which made a very obscure plot and caused general confusion among fans who had been following the series faithfully.\\n\\n\r\nFan service.  To be honest, in my opinion, and don't kill me on this, but this series was written like bad fanfiction and left many answered questions.  There was also a huge amount of fanservice and hardly any of it was presented in a way that I thought was well thought out or tasteful in the slightest.  The setting and time period for this show went from elegant to trashy and it caused the series to lose it's appeal.\\n\\n\r\nThere were also too many of what I call 'scenes of convenience'. Several characters had the opportunity to be interesting and have a good amount of spotlight but were disposed of in poorly executed ways. Viscount fainting was a poor excuse to get rid of his character during an important scene where he could have taken active role in the plot. He was actually promised a very good storyline with watching over Alois but it was disregarded shortly after wards, which was a let down to me, as a personal fan of the characters.  Also, as good as the first episode was, shoving Ciel and Sebastian in it all too quickly, as if the say 'Look! They're still in this season!' Because the writers were afraid of fans not being interested was a poor decision in execution as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe show had overall poor execution and a lot of things were unexplained or left off.  The episodes got more and more ridiculous after a moment in time and I couldn't find myself watching it after a while.  It became a chore and not an enjoyment.  As a Kuroshitsuji fan, I'm sorely disappointed in this season. As an anime fan whose critiqued anime for 4 years, this is the worst I've seen in a long time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's nothing but a case of bad fanfiction turned into an animated series.  I expected a lot more from Kuroshitsuji.  It only got worse as the series ended. If they make a season 3, I might not even give it the time of day.  There are better anime out there, I implore anyone who reads this to stick to season one, or they might end up just getting angry.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Once upon a time in England there was a fair Queen who ruled the land; only the queen was not fair at all, in fact she had died and the country itself was hiding it. But from what or whom?\r\nThe story continues with a new contract formed between a young boy of fourteen: Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus who carries a similar presence as well as punch line \"I want to greedily devour you to the end, my master\" as Sebastian and through a small critique made by Sebastian in the first episode it seems that Claude tries to follow in Sebastian's foot steps butnot quite One hell of a butler; just yet...\\n\\n\r\nAlois and Claude compliment each other well as Alois is very needy at times and clings to Claude then goes through ridiculous turns of moods which Claude just seems to ignore. (I think Sebastian would not have the patience for this child.) Alois who is also referred to as \"the spider\" (As this is the form in which Claude introduced himself to Alois) is a marvelously radiant child with a charming smile and captivating energy... sometimes. The truth is the kid is like Mr. Jeckle and Hyde. He goes from smiling cheerfully to scornfully screaming or punishing a servant for no rhyme or reason and further more he seems to enjoy this type of behavior wildly. The young boy has basically gone mad. Where as Ciel was \"evil\" because he wanted revenge for the wrongs done to him; before that he was pure. He was stable, had good relationships in his life. He lost everything before he stunk from the mud of the gutter. But Alois was born from gutter mud so to speak. It's all he ever knew. His evilness is much more frightening. But this I'm sure is precisely why the \"Queen\" uses him. He's an interesting character who I thought I'd hate but he'll be fun to through into the mix.\\n\\n\r\nSo with the queen's new spider doing her dirty work then what of her loyal dog? Well SPOILER: he comes back. In the first episode Sebastian feigns the guise of a traveler and enters the Trancy mansion to retrieve Ciels ring. Why it's in the Trancy mansion, I don't know. Why he needs it revive Ciel? Who knows?\\n\\n\r\nI didn't suspect a character like Alois could actually carry this series as the lead. He's too unbalanced and immature to carry out a vendetta successfully no matter who they made as his side kick. At first I didn't like the idea of Ciel coming back either after he was so obviously dead. But I assume this new character Alois and Claude will be fighting against Ciel at some point? It implies by the third episode that Claude is the protagonist causing the fires \"a man with yellow eyes\".The series has barely started and there are still so many interesting possibilities. What did he come back as? In the first episode it says that Ciel's debt is now paid. How so? Why doesn't he remember the Queen was killed or that Madame Red died? Why are his memories altered, I'm sure it's Sebastian's doing. I can't say yet but with the enjoyably written new characters to add to this twisted soul sucking thriller I certainly am looking forward to enjoying what I'm sure will be an amazing Kuroshitsugi 2. At least here's hoping.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II embarks with the debut of Alois Trancy, the sadistic, erratic, and creepy-as-hell lord of the Trancy estate. Alois\u2019 backstory is disturbing, though in an incredibly enjoyable way. His character is endearing; a classic anime psycho that you can\u2019t help but be immediately drawn to. His character design is one of the best I\u2019ve seen in a while. He was such a complex character that had so much development potential. He really could have held the series up on his own. \r\nUntil he dissipates into a sniveling excuse of a train wreck along with the rest of the cast. Let\u2019s hope all those fanficsyou read late at night conditioned you to characters acting OOC. \\n\\n\r\nContrary to all the warnings I was given before viewing Kuroshitsuji II, I began with high hopes. It\u2019s Kuroshitsuji, after all. How can it fail? Surely Alois Trancy\u2019s creepy-as-hell demeanor would get the ball rolling. His juxtaposition to his stoic demon butler, Claude, was promising. But despite all the possibilities Kuroshitsuji II could have embellished upon, it fell flat. The character relationships so intrinsically built up in the first season came crashing way, way, down. It seemed as if Sebastian and Ciel were tossed into the plot just to please the fangirls. Character development for the debuting servants of the Trancy household is stagnant to nonexistent. The season begins with shameless fillers\u2014starting in the second episode, no less\u2014and later thrusts itself into a plot woven flimsier than one of Claude\u2019s spider webs. The romantic 1800s London time-setting of the first season seems to disappear from plot significance. Like the rest of the season, you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on anymore.\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the plot weaves into a labyrinth game show you could\u2019ve sworn you were watching Kuroshitsuji and not the Kids\u2019 WB.\\n\\n\r\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the amnesia ass-pull.\\n\\n\r\nBut don\u2019t let me senselessly bash. The art is still great, but not as flawless as the first season\u2019s. Both versions of the OP, set to the song \u201cSHIVER\u201d, were stunning, with dazzling animation. (Especially Alois\u2019 version\u2014oh my god, can you say impressive?) Needless to say, Kuroshitsuji has THE best anime OST I\u2019ve ever come across. Alois Trancy's theme, \"The Slightly Chipped Full Moon\", is as beautifully disturbing as he is. But don\u2019t expect to hear the flawless soundtrack of the first season all throughout this sequel. You\u2019ll have to make due with cartoon sound effects tossed behind every \u201ccomedic\u201d fast-dash movement.\\n\\n\r\nComedic. Right.\\n\\n\r\nHahaha. Aha.\\n\\n\r\nSuccessful comedy in this season is rare, but its rarities are frequently supplied by Viscount Druitt. His idealistic ravings are hilarious, albeit ill-timed considering they most often arose during what could\u2019ve been considered a more serious fight scene in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe relationship that Ciel and Sebastian built up season one came tumbling down faster than my expectations for this sequel. (On another note, Daisuke Ono\u2019s voice is like God whispering sweet nothings into your ear. Have you heard Sebastian\u2019s character song, \u201cAru Shitsuji no Nichijou\u201d? Woah baby. On second, thought, go hear Ronald Knox's character songs. And the entire Kuroshitsuji OST.) \\n\\n\r\nHinted shotacon is evident, but nothing you can\u2019t endure. Characters you thought were gone are back, characters you thought would show up are nowhere in sight, and the characters present\u2014namely Sebastian, Ciel, Alois, and Claude\u2014surprisingly leave the show unsatisfying. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if you thought Lady Elizabeth couldn\u2019t get any more annoying, think again.\\n\\n\r\nI know that it\u2019s biased to compare a second season solely to its former, but the only reason I managed to stick it out until the end was\u2026well, it\u2019s Kuroshitsuji for God\u2019s sake. Especially considering that this season didn\u2019t follow the conclusive events of the first season\u2019s at all. It really felt as if this season was expecting to generate success solely by the loyal fanbase built up from the first. I\u2019m a major fan of the first season, but my loyalty can only take me so far. I really didn\u2019t know it was possible to slaughter a series like this. I really didn\u2019t. Creating a sequel is always a risky process. This risk should\u2019ve been left alone. The season quickly became tedious to watch. Season 1 also had a brilliant ending. This season\u2019s ending left a lot less room for interpretation, but it really doesn\u2019t matter how tight an ending is if it stinks. The characters provided this season with so much potential, but just couldn't hold up. But that being said, Alois Trancy is enchanting, and Ronald Knox (though his screen-time is pathetically minuscule) is an epic cutie pie.\\n\\n\r\nI never thought I\u2019d be giving anything of Kuroshitsuji a 5. But a 5 is really all this second season deserves.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, Kuroshitsuji II managed to take everything the first season stood for and drive it into the pits of hell. But don\u2019t worry, at least Sebastian will be waiting. Along with the season\u2019s production staff.\\n\\n\r\nBurn, baby. Burn.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II, a new butler and a new master. It is completely original and does not follow the manga. Kuroshitsuji II was born as fanservice and it died as fanservice too. But you know what? A-1 is pro enough to make this fanserivce work with the plot. I call it!! *drum roll* Logical fanservice!! :P\r\nOk so I'm not talking about boobs and panty fanservice. There's plenty of boobs I assure you but I'm talking about a different kind of fanservice. Notice how Ciel and Seb are in the character section now? They're in there for a reason. So think about it, Seb and Ciel +fanserive equals what? And you probably got it so I'm not gonna say :D\\n\\n\r\nThis season has been dubbed as Toboso-san's personal doujinshi just so you know.\\n\\n\r\nOkay so, the story was weird for me. It was dark and everything but it just didn't have that original touch to it, like it was obvious Toboso-san didn't make it. The plot was infuriating if you ask me. It was like a roller coaster I was kinda regretting to ride. Later in the season, maybe because of my biased thinking, the story was just annoying. The comic relief was in the wrong places, everyone's ooc, it was just wrong and I didn't like it. \\n\\n\r\nBut thinking of it from an unbiased point of view, it was pretty smart. The plot was clever and contains a whole lot of symbolism. It's crack, I have to say but it's crack that just made it into an anime. It was a cool crack and even though watching it annoyed, I'm still glad I 'went on the roller coaster'. \\n\\n\r\nArt was beautiful. God I love it!! However, it was lacking. I don't know if the budget was running low or something but some of the faces were really blank, quite literally too. Okay, so they didn't have fully blank faces but it was really under detailed and honestly, I think they could've done better. The art is clean, beautiful, good use of colours, just lacking detail.\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE the sound. I love the OP and ED and the little movie that went along with it. They were so beautiful. Kalafina comes back as well with their beautiful voices to give us a really beautiful song. Even Seb's actor for the musical sings the first ED. It's really meaningful once you watch the whole season. It was like a light bulb that went off in my head. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuu is just wonderful!! Ono Daisuke does a wonderful and so does Maaya Sakamoto!! Sakurai and Mizuki-san do wonderful jobs as well!! I love their voices. I jsut find it kinda funny how Ciel and Alois are voiced by girls LOL But it's cool :)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters is the main section of Kuro II. It's pretty much what drives the story. I love the cast. All of them, even if they are characters you can't help to hate. It's one of them love to hate characters. You get them in this season. But it makes it oh so interesting!! It's because of everyone's weird personalities that Kuro II is just that much better. However, characters -obviously- give out huge spoilers so I cannot continue with this section anymore :( And I love talking about characters the best!! Just some advice, don't judge a book by its cover, ok?\\n\\n\r\nI loved the season, even though there were parts when I felt bored or incredibly angry but it's good. The fanservice kinda makes up for it. It's definitely something for fangirls/boys but if you're a serious follower of Kuroshitsuji, then you might not like this season at all. It's sorta a love or hate thing. However, A-1 still gets points for mixing the plot with fanservice!! I pretty much worship them now :P But yeah, if you're serious, this might not be your thing. If you're part of the fandom, you'd probably enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're going to watch it, then try to watch it with an open mind, or if you want to go on that roller coaster, you can always watch it biased :P Either way's good. Btw, watching this season will make you love the manga more, whether you love it or hate it, you're gonna wanna go back to the proper thing. Sometimes you really do have to be careful with what you wish for.",

And I loved it!\r\nYes, I love season 2 and dislike season 1. Firstly I never found Ciel/Sebastian to be interesting. Sebastian is way too perfect that I don't even care about him.\r\nBut here comes season 2 where we are introduced to several new characters. Alois is very mean and had some pathefic moments but over all I would better watchhim and his active live instead of Ciel who mostly drinks tea, walks around, gets kidnaped and orders Sebastian around. However, in this season Ciel happened to be more ative and became more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian had finally faced some seriouse trouble and is not a Marry Sue anymore.\\n\\n\r\nAnd most importatly, characters who seemed to be useless forthe most part, happned to have a big suprise for everyone.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one of those series where good guys actually lose at some point. I don't want to spoil too much but ending was perfect for me. It was unpredictable.\\n\\n\r\nThe only people who will be dissapointed are crazy yaoi fangirls, that is if you don't try to look deeper into it. Becaue I think that you also should be happy about the ending.\\n\r\nAnd of course if you are manga obessed, then you also won't like it.",

            "content": "Story::\r\nKuroshitsuji II starts off where season one left off.....sort of. The series begins with a a new butler/child combo, Alois and Claude. From the summery of the series, one would assume that this isn't so much a second season as it is a successor. However, we quickly learn that the story begins to jump around from the first episode as this pair is introduced alongside the more familiar Ciel and Sebastian.  Not much can be said beyond this point to avoid spoilers, but the basic premise of Kuroshitsuji II revolves around the developed rivalry between Alois and Ciel, as well as the rivalry betweenSebastien and Claude. The story develops at a fantastic pace and mostly avoids the silly fillers and unless episodes that slowed season 1 down so much. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, fan service is back with full force. The obvious tension between..oh..every male in the show is amplified ten fold. I would go so far as to say that Kutoshitsuji II almost treads into slight shounen ai territory. Alois and Claude are especially guilty of perpetuating this. \\n\\n\r\nAs great as the story is (and it is very, very good) a major problem I had with it was that it is sometimes a bit unbelievable. The motivations of the characters sometimes seems slightly unrealistic and forced. I found myself questioning these sometimes over dramatic and silly motives, but ultimately no caring because I was enjoying the show so much. \\n\\n\r\nArt::\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the art in Kuroshitsuji II is top notch and beautiful in every way. \\n\\n\r\nSound::\\n\\n\r\nVery catchy opening and ending themes, though what really pleases me about Kuroshitsuji's sound is the background score. It remains elegant and classical; with some jazz and opera numbers thrown in occasionally. At times, it can be over the top, but the flashy and in your face opera tracks really do add quite a bit to the mood of the show. \\n\\n\r\nI feel like this series does a good job making highly emotional music that compliments the scenes very well and helps you connect better to them. It was one of the rare OSTs that I hunted for right away on the internet after hearing it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter::\\n\\n\r\nAll I can say is that things really get shaken up in this season. Ciel and Sebastian as a team have developed quite a bit from last season, adding a strong emotional flair that may have been lacking before. I much preferred their dynamic in this season, as it seems like they legitimately care for each other beyond using each other for revenge/a meal. Of course, both of them still retain their cynical and sinister natures as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs for Alois and Claude..they are intense. Alois is by far the shows most emotional character, however borderline he may be. Watching him in action brings chills down my spine. He has some of the most raw and pure emotion I'v seen in any anime character to date.\\n\\n\r\nHis butler is just the opposite. Claude is a cold, calculative scheme, but that in itself makes him interesting on screen. Both are immensely terrifying, and their interactions between Ciel and Sebastian will have you at the edge of your seat.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:: \\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji II starts off with a bang, gets weak for a few episodes, and then just straight shoots into a wild ride. \\n\\n\r\nOverall::\\n\\n\r\nThis show is very worth watching assuming you have seen the first season. Once you start, you won't be able to take your eyes away from the screen until the very end. The very few flaws it has are completely forgivable and overshadowed by it's amazing characters and rich plot. Fans of Kuroshitsuji won't at all be disappointed by the second season, and many may very well find themselves enjoying it more than the first.",

Look at them as two possible endings which might've occurred and you will have a choice of choosing the ending which best suits you and by doing so you won't have a chance of being disappointed and no ending is then \"forced\" upon you.\r\n(I will not compare it to the manga and howthe anime should have been adapted)\\n\\n\r\nSequels and second, third seasons are very dangerous; they can make a mess of things, good and bad. They can satisfy your wish when you don't want the anime to end, to go that extra episode or two because it can, they can clear the mistakes of the season I, they can be fun and ok to watch, they can be great and just the perfect thing to end the whole deal, they can even improve the first season!\\n\\n\r\nHowever...\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji II isn't one of those sequels. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season, as far as I am concerned had a superb ending, but seeing the first episode of season II which confused me, few episodes later, they explain perfectly as to why the anime continues and that satisfied me, because to some level they had a point and well, I too wanted to go on for a little while. But the sequel was unnecessary.\\n\r\nNow, shall we begin?\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound (10 - perfect)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is as good as season I, the same perfect style of drawing and coloring which suits the atmosphere, plus an extra additional touch when it comes to opening and ending themes. Music, great as ever. When it comes to intermission it blends more into it; instead of suddenly playing some happy tune when the mood way on the other side, it is  continuous, the way it should be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6 - fine)\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few additional characters as to season I:\\n\\n\r\nAloys Trancy - a bipolar child who dances on the line between thriving to destruction and then towards sadness and needing love to the maximum selfish extent. A sadist, yet a sad boy, jealous and vengeful, yet misplaced, lost and scared. The exact opposite of the young Ciel Phantomhive we've accustomed to and certainly refreshing to a point. He has a past which is not that sad as it is disturbing. Really, really disturbing. You can sit back and take a break from those sad, throbbing and sobbing flashbacks and be assured there are very, very few of those.\\n\\n\r\nClaude Faustus - AloysTrancy's very own demon butler who's perfect in every way as he should be, who can go head to toe with Sebastain. His forks and knives are golden, opposite Sebastians silverware, his eyes are yellow and he wears glasses. He has a few tricks on his own, being the servant of Trancy family, whose crest holds a spider.\\n\\n\r\nHannah Annafellows is a maid at the Trancy household. Aloys takes his insecurity and sadism on her without regret. Toying with her at any given time and given chance as the anime goes on, yet she remains loyal to her master in hope he will be happy...\\n\\n\r\nTrio - three identical bulters of the Trancy residence. They too had and have a part to play, though they could have been ignored. They are there for the soul purpose of being the \"new character\", anime could have gone without them just fine.\\n\\n\r\nWith the Trio exception, characters are very well made and fairly interesting.\\n\r\nAs opposed to the Trio, Phantomhive trio isn't seen much, which means there are zero to One \"unnecessary\" episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOnward to the story.\\n\r\nI'll try my best not to give out and spoilers so I will keep it short.\\n\\n\r\nSince there is a new master and a new butler, predictably, they will clash. Sebastian has met his match, a perfect copy of himself, Claude. He basically carries the story. Being sly and cunning he makes twists and turns and thus Sebastian has to work as hard as ever to protect his young master. Sebastian finally shows some \"emotion\" if you can call it that way. His expressions do change from the well accustomed satisfied, eager and hungry to rage, rage and rage and yes, even sometimes concern.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment of this series is pretty well. It's not good, it's not bad, it's a perfect mediocrity. Exactly what you'd expect from a sequel. The story had a bellow average, predictable development, an impressive twist none the less\\n\\n\r\nHowever...\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is idiotic and disappointing. Compared to season I, which had a perfect ending, nothing else was needed, they go ahead and give the ending (thus giving the entire anime) meaninglessness and mediocrity.\\n\\n\r\nI know that most of you who will finish season I will immediately go searching for season II, but I feel I have to warn you, the ending Is disappointing and you Will be disappointed. Not because it might not be to your liking, but because it butchered what the first season was all about and thus killed the entire anime.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend watching it? Yes, ofcourse. But ONLY if one looks at it as a different story that stands by itself, instead of combining it into one anime. Looking at season I and II as two different little anime who have same characters, different stories, different endings. That way, you can choose which ending suites you best and it's not forced on you as The Last and Final Ending.\\n\\n\r\nHope it was helpful :)",

            "content": "Last week I looked at Kuroshitsuji. This week I'm looking at the sequel. What's odd about Kuroshitsuji having a sequel is that the first series is complete. It tells the story of Sebastian and Ciel beginning, middle and end. Going into this, I have no idea how they could make a sequel, unless it's some kind of spiritual successor. Well, let's take a look at the series and find out how they handle it. \r\nYou can't see it, but I'm face-palming right now. Given the quality of the first series, I gave them credit. I didn't think they would go for a true sequel, butI was wrong. This series is a direct continuation of the first. With Ciel and Sebastian both making return appearances. Why, just why? The first series may have had an ending that was obvious and kind of rushed, but it was also suitable for the series. Why would you take a series with a pretty satisfying conclusion and add to it? That's actually my biggest issue with the story in this series. It's unnecessary. You have a young man named Alois Trancy with an impossibly talented butler. One evening they're visited by a strange traveler covered in heavy clothes. The man is revealed to be Sebastian and he's brought Ciel along in a briefcase. He steals something from the mansion and makes his getaway. I'm not going to give away the reasons behind all of this, but they're kind of stupid. After that Ciel and Alois gain a lot of animosity for each other so that there can be a plot. Now, let's start with the negatives, aside from it being an unnecessary addition. The first is that the retcon is very poorly handled and the plot that's added in to explain it is weak. Then there's the ending. It's pretty terrible. The story itself is lazy. A lot of it is just devoted to the rivalry between Sebastian and Claude. The series does have some episodes devoted to Ciel, Sebastian and the rest of the characters from the first series that are entertaining. It also has some plot elements that have merit, but they aren't really handled well enough to be as interesting as they could've been. \\n\\n\r\nBut at least the characters are still good, right? Well, kind of. Sebastian and Ciel are still good characters, although not nearly to the degree that they were in the first series, probably because they retread a lot of the same ground and development that they already covered with less competent writing behind it. Ciel's staff still provides the same comic relief they did before, albeit less of it since they barely show up. On the downside, Grell reappears with the same problematic elements from the first series. Then we have the new characters. Alois, whose an obnoxious and very annoying brat with little personality aside from being a sociopath. We also have Claude whose incredibly dull. we also have Hannah, a maid in the Trancy household. When you learn what her motivations are the sheer stupidity will likely make your head hurt. We also get some triplet servants in the Trancy household. They have no personalities whatsoever. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is still well done. The character designs are still good, for the most part. The backgrounds are still well done. The action sequences in this one really aren't as good. Part of that is just that they involve a lot of awkward scene transitions. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is still really good. Tamura Yukari, Hirano Aya, Sakamoto Maaya, Ono Daisuke and most of the other actors all give strong performances. Fukuyama Jun is still a weakness based solely on the fact that the character he's portraying is ridiculously exaggerated. Mizuki Nana has the same problem, although she does a little better at putting some nuance into the performance in spite of it. Sakurai Takahiro doesn't give his best performance either, largely due to his character having less emotional substance than a tapeworm. \\n\\n\r\nThe yuri factor is still a 1/10. there's no yuri here. \\n\\n\r\nYou probably deduced this already, but I didn't care for this one. It has some of the elements that made the first one great, but most of them are either weakened by idiotic contrivances and/or terrible new characters. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's a sub-par piece that doesn't stand well either on its own or as a continuation to the Kuroshitsuji. Next week, I'll look at Usagi Drop. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is next on my request queue, but I'm not going to have time to finish all of it in time. So expect that on the 29th.",

            "content": "I don't know if it's because I already poured my cereal in my bowl this morning and I didn't have any fucking milk, or if it's because this anime truley sucked. What I do know is this anime pissed me off. It introduces a set of new characters, Alios and Clyde, these two domininating the second season.\r\nStory: 4\r\nThe story was mediocre at best. It honestly wasn't in the least bit interesting, and was a waste of time to even watch. The storyline of the first one was great, amazing I'm fact. But this one was appealing, and made me think they should've ended it withwhat they had. Alios and Clyde weren't any significance, and seemed like a knock-off of Ciel and Sebestaion. It was long and drawn out, no character whatsoever.\\n\\n\r\nArt : 9\\n\r\nThe art was nice, nothing special and kept the Victorian era true to its name. Alios, Clyde, Ciel, and Sebeastian were all drawn nicely, and we're very original. The scenery in the background was nice, overall it was a solid 9\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was magnificent , and the voices fit the personalities of characters they represented. The opening and closing weren't very memorable, but the pictures were nice, while the second season lacked in story, the sound made up for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nThe characters pissed me off. Not because they were annoying *cough Alios cough*, But because how two dementional they are. I hate when animators try and use flashbacks as a way to do character development. Some cases it works, others it miserably fails. This of course is the latter. They also love to try to have a depressing past to make us have sympathy for them, using this as an excuse for said character to be a complete asshole to everyone. Alios was an annoying brat, and quite frankly I'm glad what the animators decided to cut his part. Cylde was just overall creepy and delusional, obsessing over Ciel for some odd reason. They are just cookie cutter characters, nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3 \\n\r\nI did not enjoy this anime at all. I loved seeing Ciel and Sebeastian again, but this anime was a train wreck. Alios ruined it for me, and I finished it, hoping that it will have a great ending, but it was a disappointment. I recommend that you watch it for the shits and giggles, but don't expect it to be the best thing since toast was invented. \\n\\n\r\nOverall : 5\\n\r\nThis anime averaged to about a 4.9, after adding each number I gave it then dividing it by the four categories, giving it a almost solid 5. It looks like shit compared to the first Black Butler, but after having an amazing first season, my expectations weren't set to high. I recommend to watch, but don't make my mistake of thinking it will be good, then being disappointed in the end. If you enjoyed my review, feel free to check out my others! Enjoy!",

            "content": "You know, people said the second season would suck. The only thing I ever knew about the second season(this was back when I was still watching season one) was the infamous \"tongue boy.\" Alois, I thought, would be a little like the Ikuto(Shugo Chara sexy kitty boy) figure. But it turned out that he was a very...Interesting person. Disturbed in terms of society's \"moral correctness,\" Alois made for the perfect character to use as support for Kuroshitsuji's finale. \r\nI'm not one to like it when an anime series alters it's plot just so they can end it ahead of time, but this was a reallywell done plot ending. Although there were a lot of new characters, Alois, in particular, was my big surprise. Because I'm sure anything anyone hears is just about his \"booty-licious shorts.\"  For those of you who are turned off by that factor(I wasn't but..You know, if you are) there's more to him than you'd imagine. \\n\\n\r\nWithout giving away any details, he's one of those characters that, if you're an open mind to different takes on justice, you can really come to love in the short amount of time that he was a lead in this series. Though it was definite that he supported Ciel, he also added a new twisted flair to Kuroshitsuji that I really liked. It was really because of him that Kuroshitsuji had as good an ending to the anime. (After all, by his wishes, did everything that happened come to be reality.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other new characters such as Hana and Claude are both support for Alois. Because of Alois's \"Needy behavior,\" it was very skillful to add such high contrast characters beside him that help support such a boy(otherwise he probably would have fallen apart.) Hana is a passive maid who lets Alois treat her as a rag doll, while Claude is a sort of absent character who is very hard to please. As Alois's butler, he says things with empty meaning and often, Alois goes searching for actual emotion in Claude. Though Alois and Claude, as a duo, where never as effective as the Ciel-Sebastian duo, they were still a very successful contrasting pairing(not in the romantic way.)\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins in a rather rocky start as a lot of information is dumped on you. As the story starts when a big time lapse has occurred between the end of season one and the current events, it takes some time to piece together everything that happened, but the fact that the plot still functions, without the viewers having full knowledge of the previous essential points, is proof enough that the ending to this series was really a piece of work that was woven together beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nA lot of people will debate about the yaoi or non-yaoi-ness of season one. But those who cater toward such style of affection will be slightly pleased to know of a fact that they will learn upon the first few episodes of the series; Alois Trancy is an aristocratic boy with a demon butler(like Ciel). But--rather than being an exact copy of the Earl of Phatomhive--he has differences in his past that led him to his current position and the location of his contract seal is different from Ciel's.\\n\\n\r\nWith a detailed past quite similar in cruelty and suffering to Ciel's, Alois's hardships toughened him into a callus soul that masked his wounds with twisted smiles. In some ways, he ended up less \"complete in mind\" than Ciel in the fact that his consciousness is not completely at peace with itself. By his sporadic behavior, ranging on the bipolar side, we can tell that he is very deeply damaged as a result of his ordeals. And his savior, Claude, is always the person he looks toward for recognition. One can hardly blame such a soul as Alois, though. He clung to what brought him out of the darkness; it could only be cruel to condemn him for not noticing the foolishness in asking for love from a Demon.\\n\\n\r\nIf we return to the very sensitive topic for this anime: Yaoi(which makes or breaks some people's experience with such a series), we will notice the location of Alois's demon contract: his tongue. Popularly, he is seen licking people with his tongue, or rather, a single entity. A certain boy for whom also has a demon butler... Ironically, however, Alois does not favor Ciel or seek any romantic relations with him(as I first assumed by all the comments I got on Alois's character), he actually wishes torturel Ciel. This becomes evident in the first episode(so don't think I spoiled anything for you). And the way for which his past, his demon contract, Ciel, and Sebastian weave together to create the finale to Kuroshitsuji make this a MUST WATCH for any fan of Kuroshitsuji, be it the anime or manga.",

            "content": "(This review is subjected to have one or two spoilers for the first ep)\r\nSo, I didn't finish watching the first season of Kuroshitsuji, because I didn't want to see the ending, when I know that it was so different from the manga (Yes, I read the manga) but I have to say, giving Kuroshitsuji season ll a shot wasn't a bad idea. As of now, there are only three episodes out and the suspense and the want for answers are already building. \r\nSTORY:\r\nThe anime starts out with a new butler and a new master. The starting of the anime wasn't bad, actually it was quiteinteresting, I thought that it wouldn't be so bad to watch this anime without the formal characetrs, Sebastian and Ciel, whom everyone deemed gone because of the last ep in season one. But Kuroshitsuji isn't something to be looked upon lightly, because our favorite characters were brought back as the actual main characters for Kuroshitsuji. This land mine was quite a surpise and excitement for me, but with the return of them brought up a very important question. Why has Ciel forgotten the near past events? The death of his aunt, the shinigami Grell, the queen... Why has Ciel forgotten? The answer might be clear to many of us, Sebastian is the puppeteer behind this whole charade. But why, why is this demon still holding on to his 'pure' master? And then the last question is, what does Alois want with Ciel? And the fact that the 2cnd episode doesn't bring back the Trancy household makes you want more information on them. So for now, I give the story a big TEN. Three episodes in and the suspense, the mystery, and the questions are building. But if you don't like a dark mystery revolving around a young boy and sinister characters that bind themselves to demons to get their very wish fufilled, then this anime is not for you.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nNow as a full on fan of Kuroshitsuji I do indeed read the manga and nothing can compare to Yana Toboso's art skill. She's a great artist, so it's obvious that I will be basing my critique off of her art. The scenery compares well with the artistic talent of Yana-san and feels very much of the victorian age. Though, for a dark plotted anime not everything has a dark feel to it and that gives the anime light. There isn't much of that in the manga but for a change it is good. The objects, houses, carriages, are all well accounted for when it comes to detail. It's a very beautifully animated anime. The characters I must say are also well animated, but it's hard to ignore the fact that the details just seem a bit off. I compare the screencaps to the manga pages and just think, the characters are so much better drawn in the manga. Had I just watched the anime though and cared less for manga, this would have gotten a ten, but yet, it has to suffice with just a nine.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: (I re-watched the first ep for this part xD)\\n\r\nPersonally, I hate squeaky voices or overrated voice actors voicing anime characters. Bad voices can take away from a very good series. But it's hard to say that I don't like the voices in this series. I don't research on voice actors, but I have to say that the people who voice Sebastian, Ciel, and Claude are very good. They bring out the characters personalities very well. As for the sound effects, it's eh for me. I've yet to find a good anime where they don't have useless sound effects, but there not very apparant in Kuroshitsuji. As for the music? OH MY GOD. The eerieness off the opra music selected for this series if just fantastic. I don't personally like the sort of music play in Kuroshitsuji, but man, it's placed well. Not to mention the opposition of the music and the feel of the moment is perfect. So the only part bringing down the rating of this part is the sound effect of which I don't care for in any anime. So this portion gets a EIGHT.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nIf you haven't understood yet then let's repeat, this is a dark gothic manga with characters that have either rather depressing pasts, demonic personalities, or messed up lives. And the scarey fect of the matter is, some of the situations are not impossible and most definitely are quite real. Rape, human sacrifices, death, these are things aren't strangers to this series. It isn't talked about in every episode to where you are annoyed with it, but it shows in the characters personality how they were treated in the past. Such as Alois the supposed antagonist of the series and Ciel the main character whoes personalities feed off of their past. Then there's Claude and Sebastian, the butlers whos only desirer is to consume their master. With these dark characters the anime would be a lot more than just plain depressing (It can be) but then you have all your comic relief characters. So as there is lots of dark trends that will most definitely stream through this anime, don't worry, you will most definitely laugh. But keep in mind, this series revolves around the past and goals of the main characters. But I love the characters, so TEN.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nI remember being completely and crazily crazy with happiness when I watched the first episode. And it's hard to say I didn't enjoy the first episode. It was great and fantastic and completely off the the edge of my seat. But then after the first episode, I asked the computer what happened? Sure, I laugh, but, episode two and three just couldn't compare to the first episode. It's not enough as of now to make me drop the series, because there are answers that I want answered, so I won't let the first few episodes stop me. So as of now, if you want to see a multitude of geners, go ahead and watch this. It can make change your sad mood to happy or your happy mood to sad, but because it's so early in the series, but the last two installments couldn't own up to the first one, this category gets a eight. There is hope yet, hopefully.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nI hope I didn't mix up the anime and the manga... Which I highly doubt, since the anime is now completely different from what Yana-san has been writing, but I must say, that for so early into the anime, I am SLIGHTLY hooked. I enjoy the characters and the story. The fact that I already have questions without answers is a good thing. I'm happy that I have given this series a chance. And it's more than just a great way to pass time, so overall grade gets a NINE",

            "content": "Alright guys, I'm going to say this straight out of the box. I had my doubts, five minutes in to the first episode. I didn't think Alois was going to live up to the standards Ceil set, nor did I like Claude. He was simply too fussy. I changed my mind in the last few minutes of that same episode. Once I realized Ceil was in fact, still around, and it wasn't going to be about Alois, I was thoroughly delighted. \r\nFrom the standpoint of an animator, I have to say that the animation isn't as great as it maybe could have been, but consideringhow hard and quickly they have to work to get an episode out on time, I think they did a brilliant job.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the different entry scenes for the two different characters, both Antagonist and protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nI think you're going to come to like Alois, once you get past the fact that he's incredibly creepy at times. He's a bit co-dependent and needy, but he's also devious and clever. He knows how to get what he wants-when flirting fails him, he either acts crazy or incredibly clever. He's quick witted and VERY sharp--if a little sadistic and cruel. I respect character writing that makes me think, and Alois is definitely someone who keeps you on your toes. He's an ASTOUNDINGLY complex character, despite all surface appearances. \\n\\n\r\nHannah, despite  appearing to be incredibly submissive in the first episode, reveals a side of herself you'll find very surprising. Telling more would be spoilers though!\\n\\n\r\nClaude I didn't like, but I recognize the importance of having a character like him--His development is actually quite surprising as well.\\n\\n\r\nthe triplets seemed a little flat for me, but I think their role was just to be pretty and act creepy, points for that. There's really no back story or development behind them. I would have liked to see them explained a little more.\\n\\n\r\nOver all the series is a lot of fan service, (I assume as an apology to those who were upset by the final episode of the first season) and some trolling on the part of the maid and Alois. There are also a few Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jojo's bizarre adventures, and Eddy Izzard references(from my point of view at least) Showing that the Creator, Producers, Writers and animators all have BRILLIANT senses of humor, and good skills in subtlety. Indeed there are a few phrases in the middle of the project that you don't understand completely until the last two or three episodes, but it's well worth the wait.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion? Props for going out with a bang, keeping me on my toes and waiting, practically begging for more, and for doing a great job in a little window of time. 12 episodes isn't very much to reach the climax of this sort of thing. Kuroshitsuji II has a fantastic storyline, wonderful writing, intelligently crafted characters, for the most part. Because of all of this, I love this series as much as I loved it's predecessor, and the manga it's derived from. I'm sure you'll love it as well!\\n\\n\r\n Good watching-Nix",

            "content": "As a fan of the first season, I was looking forward to the announcement that the second season got a green lit. I disliked the idea of having a new master and butler but as the updates and airing date were moving close, I felt that the new master is indeed interesting and unique. Aside the new butler of course.\r\nThe moment I got to watch the first episode of the second season, there were mixed feelings. Confusion, amusement and unsatisfaction. The latter episodes became dull but there were certain ones that just makes me \u201cOkay fine, I\u2019ll finish this. Maybe it would be more interestingon the next episode.\u201d I was damn wrong. The second season was full of faults in an overall score. The characters took a sudden landslide the moment Alois declared that he wanted Ciel, Claude lusting for Ciel\u2019s soul and Sebastian being a weak demon whenever Ciel\u2019s soul was on the table. Landslide?More of a catastrophe I guess.\\n\\n\r\nSo I\u2019ll start with the first and second most important part, characters and plot.\\n\\n\r\nCiel Phantomhive is a strong hearted independent noble. Why in the name of the queen of England should he let his emotions of pride and selfishness  just because there is someone working for the queen other than himself? This is clearly a point why Ciel is, most of the times, a spoiled brat, only a million fold richer. Ciel\u2019s reincarnation as a demon made the overall season\u2019s score lower than the others. He is Ciel but at the same time not. It\u2019s not confusing. Just imagine Ciel, being himself, only as a empty hollow. Do you get it now? Great. Now you\u2019ll see why Ciel isn\u2019t interesting anymore. I just don\u2019t know for those Sebastian x Ciel fans though, I\u2019ll just leave their imaginations of pedophility love.\\n\\n\r\nSebastian Michaelis is the famous talk around bishounen town. I\u2019m not a fan of his character but if I could compare his development between the two seasons, I would say that he became more of a lowly and cowardly dog than a humble butler in the present season. He is confident that his possession, Ciel\u2019s soul, wouldn\u2019t be robbed by some other demon. Which lead to a disaster which also lead to another huge failure, particularly the 12th episode. His resistance as declared in the first season was his biggest mistake if I say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nAlois Trancy(please do not remind me of his real name, I prefer this instead) is one of the freshest characters I\u2019ve seen. He is an interesting, pathetic, adorable, slutty, pitiful, devastated, attention-seeking male cinderella. But he became the dullest thing I can see in the 12th episode. He has become weak and easily-controlled soul. Leaving his murder behind, his character, wanting to be loved by Claude is just like those romantic movies I\u2019ve seen a hundred times. It\u2019s unrequited love, master and butler special edition. He became a poorly made character by the moment he said that he wanted Claude despite his failure of finishing the contract. Biggest waste. Period.\\n\\n\r\nClaude Faustus, fuck this butler very much. He is the biggest mistake. And because he is the biggest mistake he is also the culprit of the biggest downfall and biggest waste of the series. He\u2019s too honest, sneaky and is a monkey dressed in a butler suit with glasses. He\u2019s the type that if he wanted something, he would use anyone just to attain his \u2018something\u2019 and this something was none other than Ciel Phantomhive. His death was a failure too. I dislike him so much that I wouldn\u2019t even be able to accept comments about my rant about him.\\n\\n\r\nHannah Anafeloz,with no mistake, has the most development especially in the last two episodes. She has become Alois\u2019 savior and Ciel\u2019s killer. She ignited Alois\u2019 passion of becoming one with Ciel and devoured Alois\u2019 into a new contract after letting him know that she is one with his younger brother, Luca. I\u2019m surprised that she grew feelings with Luca which lead to performing a contract with him which became a bridge to be of service under the Trancy household. Oh, did I say she\u2019s a masochist? Yeah. The hell with it. She rocked the boat herself.\\n\\n\r\nThe triplets, the highlight of their existence was their failure of killing Sebastian. Other than that, they\u2019re triplets! And triplets are eyecatching. I prefer them cleaning and doing household chores instead of attacking Sebastian just to hide their idiocy and uselessness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, who would forget the Ronald Knox appearance? I didn\u2019t see that coming, I doubt that you did too.\\n\\n\r\nThe minor characters that were adapted to the second season has a pale presence. The parts where Sebastian was handing over a letter declaring the death date of Ciel were confusing. Their reactions weren\u2019t as lively as before.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the first season was balanced. The background and character quality was well balanced. The second season wasn\u2019t. The background quality was more of an A+ while the character quality was lower, more of a B minus. Maybe it\u2019s just me, but other than that, it was brilliant. The animation was great too especially when it comes to the fighting scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThird, music and character voice.\\n\\n\r\nThe CV in the first season had a good score coming from most of the watchers, why wouldn\u2019t the second season have too? It\u2019s better and more fine. The music is more than passable. It\u2019s befitting. Except that in some points it sometimes overpowers the characters.\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji or in English, Black Butler, is a finely made series. The thing is, it flunked during the second season in very many points. So many that you will be able to point them out even though you haven\u2019t watched the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThird season? No thanks. But if they\u2019ve decided to push another season through, good luck with that. I\u2019ll keep my mouth shut till then.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II\r\n(two stars like this \uf0e0** means that there is a spoiler coming up, and you should skip to the next set of stars)\r\nAnd here we come to a sequel. Sequels can be a good thing, if expressed correctly and if it is relevant to the parent story, much like an OVA. And let\u2019s be honest \u2013 if a show is THAT good, and it ends in a sort of open ended way, shouldn\u2019t it just stay like that? I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure no one wants to know what happened to Azmaria at the end of Chrono Crusade. And though I used to hopefor it, I like the way the Code Geass series ended. You were left with either believing he was dead or alive in some other world. Quite honestly, I think that\u2019s the best kind of ending \u2013 one that you\u2019ll remember long after finishing the story. And this sequel is just passable. I preferred the way the first season ended, because it was just at the cataclysm that Ciel dies. Or, it was assumed so. I just don\u2019t like the way it all took off. And sadly, it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re done. (I'm grading this according to the MAL number ruling - a six is fair, meaning its not great but it isn't bad either.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art hasn\u2019t changed much if at all from the first season. If there was a change, then it was so small I couldn\u2019t even notice it. So I\u2019ll give it the same art score I would\u2019ve given the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nNothing to say about the ending and opening soundtracks. They weren\u2019t overly enjoyable or disappointing, they were just ok. The soundtrack in the show, however, is a different story. The sound track of the second season is just as enjoyable as the soundtrack of the first. Beautiful melodies that mask sorrow or that exempt it all together \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of music you can hope to hear from this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nTo make it simply and clear: There really is no story at the beginning. The first episode brings Ciel back, and then it\u2019s just\u2026\u201cwhat?\u201d until episode 6. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you enjoy this arc, as you reminisce with old characters, but it all seems irrelevant to the story \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem. This, to me, is always what can make any viewer drop an anime. If the show flies way out with an idea or its arc is too long and irrelevant, you gotta wonder why you\u2019re still watching it. I can\u2019t tell you how many shows I was excited to watch, that I ended up dropping because the arcs got too boring and I began to question its relevance. But this is not the case, it was a little over played, yes, but it was enjoyable, and that makes up for it. In the end, the reconciliation of the characters, though late and not very deep, is strong, albeit a little more confusing than it should have been. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nCiel and Sebastian are old news. Elizabeth has very obviously taken a liking to Ciel, even more so than is noticeable in the first season. And sadly, you don\u2019t get to see much of her after the first few episodes. And then we get to Alois Trancy. A homoerotic, sadistic **(actually gay, as we see in the first scene)** freak. **People may argue that he was forced into it, but he doesn\u2019t seem at all deeply affected by it. Almost like it just doesn\u2019t bother him.**  He is utterly disgusting and despicable to say the least. It\u2019s not because he\u2019s gay, but because of the way he acts and the way he treats others.  His butler, Claude, is another freaky one. When you meet him, you sort of get the feeling he\u2019s like\u2026Sebastian from wal-mart. Like, Sebastian is a nicely polished Lamborghini or BMW, and Claude is just a cheap knock off, like a  90\u2019s era Toyota Corolla, or Dodge Grand Caravan. They just don\u2019t compare. Maybe I\u2019m being a little biased, perhaps because I already know Sebastian from the first season and have seen just how good he is at what he does. And, his humor has upped its ante from the first season \u2013 there was one specific part that I couldn\u2019t stop laughing about midway through the series that I had to watch again and again. You also start to wonder what the hell other characters are even doing in the story. And the truth is, you won\u2019t know until you get to episode 5 or whatever, when the story starts to make sense, as they\u2019re all explaining what has happened thus far. In simpler terms, your favorite characters don\u2019t exactly get enough air time this time around. I was honestly hoping for some more bonding with Lizzy. But that was shot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I still wouldn\u2019t exactly categorize this show as pure fan service or maybe even partly fan service, it does deliver a lot of what you\u2019re hoping to see. Not because its eye candy, although that is sometimes the case, but because it relates to the story, or helps set up a premise to the next or future setting. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Even though the first few episodes you\u2019re confused to no end, the last few episodes stick to the main plot and the point it is trying to get across is received clearly. Though, the ending was probably a disappointment simply because it ended, and made you think that the story could honestly have just not even started if it was going to end the way it did.  **With Sebastian being trapped into eternal loyalty.**\\n\\n\r\nFaults:\\n\\n\r\nI think the series was a great piece of work, but to be perfectly honest, it almost seems like the creators tried to make something out of nothing. I think that they wanted another season, and to make it possible, they brought Ciel back. He was dead at the end of the first season, and it should have just ended there. If the production team had wanted to do more work, they could\u2019ve just chosen to do an entirely new series. I wanted to watch this sequel because I assumed it would ONLY be based on Alois Trancy and his butler.  **Now, however, they\u2019re both dead.** And it only seems like it\u2019ll get worse, as word of a possible 3rd season is going around.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis being a direct sequel, you are obligated to watch the first season in order to get this one. I honestly thought this was going to be a standalone show with just Alois, but that was wrong. Way wrong. Anywho, it was a great watch. I have personally been getting pretty bored with all the new anime coming out this season, as they are either too clich\u00e9 or they haven\u2019t finished (I had a bad experience waiting for Bakemonogatari to finish, since I started watching it a week before the last episode was supposed to come out, only to find out that the last episode was going to be coming out HALF A DAMN YEAR LATER). I\u2019ve started to watch MM! and the new To-LOVE-ru, and hope to finish them soon to write a review. \\n",

The fact that they made a second season made me leap for joy in a way but I'm utterly disappointed with what I've seen in this season. For the most part it doesn't have anything to do with the manga. The story from the beginning is really confusing and was really hard for me to understand. It was really obvious that the producers were only making a second season to please the fans. I would rather have Kuroshitsuji ending the way it did rather than have this crazyplot put together as a dire last method to make us happy. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a consistent storyline this is not the anime to watch. Some episodes I enjoyed and some I thoroughly didn't understand at all. Alois and Claude were newly made characters for this season; first off understanding the two is really confusing. Their personalities are hard to describe. One thing I noticed was that their behaviors were hard to follow but I'm not sure if this is just me or if they're just like that. I'm guessing it's both. From episode 1 to episode 12 it just makes me wonder what the hell happened. The ending was absolutely ridiculous to me but then again I'm sure this might have pleased many other fans out there. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the moment you begin to love a character you suddenly start to hate them as well towards the end. For some of the fanservice moments I laughed and enjoyed myself, but these moments didn't last too long. I'm not sure how to explain how confused I was by this season, the dialogue and events occurring didn't flow well and you don't get the answers to certain questions until you're at the end of the anime and even then it still leaves you puzzled. \\n\\n\r\nWatching the second season was still great because I got to see Ciel and Sebastian again. Kuroshitsuji fans I'm sure will watch this second season but I am honestly disappointed with the outcome of this season. The fanservice was still enjoyable though but the overall expectations I had for this season were not even close.",

There's plot elements that don't get discussed or explained until well into the season (e.g. episode 6/7) Now I haven't read the manga so all my opinions are purely based on the anime.\r\nThe setting, the art and the commitment to the victorian gothic feel are just as good as they were in season one. The atmosphere is dark and creepy and I loved it.\r\nThe new character are frankly gross, Alois Trancy is a sadistic child who gives off the impression of...wanting to be Ciel? wanting to be like Ciel? I still don't know. But he was genuinely so vulgar and overall unpleasant I was just disturbed by him.\\n\r\nThe new butler? acceptable, but he does feel like a Sebastian 2.0 in every sense of the word\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I had enjoyed about season one is that it didn't use the typical anime version of women, big breasts, tiny waist, zero personality. Season two somehow.... it almost seems like they're trying to make up for the lack of nudity from season one??? Which is something that I didn't really need. It would have stood and been just as if not more enjoyable (for me) if there wasn't.\\n\r\nAlois Trancy's maid suffers constant abuse from him and is basically just an excuse for thinly veiled extremely disturbing porn.\\n\\n\r\nin conclusion, I am so disturbed by this season and I don't even know what to think anymore. \\n\\n",

I can name only a few sequels that have been almost or even better than the original, but this...not even close. I don't count this as a 'sequel'. \r\nPlot: \r\nWith the story, the first five episodes are clearly fillers, except maybe the first when introducing Alois. But we don't really get a proper story line until the middle of the season. It's a bit disappointing when you reach it and say, \"so what was the purpose of the last few episodes?\" clearly the writers weren't thinking when they wroteit. I do understand this strays far from the manga, but I found many scenes where it...just didn't make a whole lot of sense. Having the random episodes and humour is fun, but does it fit? Probably not. \\n\\n\r\nNow the themes of death and sacrifice were clearly there. Good. Some symbolism with the rings, marks, etc. But I found it repeated some mistakes from the first season. However, I won't hold season II responsible for a cliche plot. They did well to establish something original, creating a darker more gory atmosphere the first one didn't have much of. \\n\\n\r\nThere is one thing that bugged me was how Sebastian felt like a supporting character in this. It was all about the new characters and less about developing the character of Sebastian and Ciel. When watching this, don't be surprised when they don't show up in the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nI have no problems with the art. The same comments apply from my review in the first season. Very clear effects. We had some rain, blood spilling out, shiny spiderwebs we all know and love, and many other things. The castles are well designed and animated, showing the dark-Gothic, 19th century theme in the show, and the characters the same. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThere is actually natural sound in this. The music fit perfectly with the selected scenes, and added the touches of the mood to the story. There are even the eeriness moans and screams from children and other things in the night. Adds to the horror genre this show wanted to come across as. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nOh boy...here we go. Let's start with Alois, shall we? \\n\\n\r\nCan someone please get this kid a psychologist? Clearly he has some major mental issues and even sexual issues. Now we do get a backstory on him, but I don't think it went far enough. We never got to see the relationship with his parents. Perhaps his birth father sexually abused him and his brother to make him the way he is. Who knows. But I have a feeling his parents or at least his father are to blame for his behaviour as the Lord and how he comes up with such vile things/ideas. He has no fear, and probably is diagnosed with PTSD or separation anxiety. I can say he is one messed up kid. \\n\\n\r\nThe good thing about him is he is not a stereotype. That is a relief right there. The writers created a very dark character though. I was shocked what I saw at the beginning. No child should ever be doing that sort or thing, which is probably one of the reasons why this show is rated R. \\n\\n\r\nOnto Claude. He is another Sebastian except a spider version of him. He doesn't really have a personality of his own. I don't have anything else to say other than that... \\n\\n\r\nHannah seems to hold a darker secret, which if you read the synopsis you'll know who she is. But she is probably the second darkest character after Alois.\\n\\n\r\nNow Ciel. I actually liked Ciel in this season. He's changed and his character has developed. He turned into a likeable character, something the first season failed to do. But Sebastian is still the same lovable, demon butler. He didn't change as much. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI'll say it again, I didn't enjoy this season as much as the last. The ending was...a bit odd for my taste. Black Butler I and II is it's own series in itself. It doesn't follow the manga plot at all. And remember the cliffhanger ending in the first one? BB II doesn't show what really happens until a little while later. Go ahead and watch it to let go of your tension of wanting to find out after the last one, but don't be surprised if it's not what you expected. I was rather confused at first until I hit the fifth or sixth episode. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Black Butler II a C+ or a 68% on the soul scale. \\n",

But I was really disapointed upon the 2nd season (I expected that).\r\nSTORY: starts with the most annoying character(s) in Kuroshitsuji franchise but in the 2nd episode everything was almost the same like in the 1st season. From about 5th or 6th episode the story started to lose it`s sense; the ending didn`t have it anymore so I give it 4.\r\nART: that`s the only thing I enjoyed while watching the anime; it was clear, detailed (especialy in gore moments) and enjoyableto watch. Score: 10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I don`t pay too much attention to sound but it was alright and the soundtrack was good to listen. I give it 8.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: They`re the same as in the 1st season + new characters (Alois Trancy and his servants) but some of the old characters didn`t appeared much during the season. Almost all new characters were really annoying, but toward the end their true selves were revealed and I liked that. Score: 5\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Despite the mistakes and whole sense of this series I still enjoyed in it because of action, development of story along with the characters. Score: 6\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: this season wasn`t necessary because the story was already finished in the 1st one and yet the developers decided to stretch it. I give it 3 because of annoying new characters and story without sense, but also very good action and plot twists. If you watched the 1st season and enjoyed it, I disrecommend watching this one because it`s not worth of your time. Score: 3",

            "content": "Black Butler 2 is a sequel that was not needed in the first place. That being said, I did enjoy it, but there are definitely problems.\r\nStory-3\r\nThe ending of season one was one of the best endings and needed no continuation. But I would be lying if I said I was not excited for another season. We get more mystery, more demons and just more Black Butler. The plot had an interesting premise even if it seemed like something you could find on fanficiton.net.  But the story was done very poorly, hence the score I gave it. It has too many plot holes and evenmore unexplained moments. If you don't mind these things and don't question and look to closely, this shouldn't matter. I did enjoy the parallels between both the demons and their contractors, and it shows how people can react different in similar situations. It was also interesting to see how someone else interacted with a demon and why the made a contract. \\n\\n\r\nArt-7\\n\r\nThe art is the same as season one and looks very nice. The animation is fine, though there are a few mistakes, nothing major, and the new characters' art looks nice. Shout out to the both of the openings, both looking very nice. Nothing else much to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7\\n\r\nThe opening music is catchy and I didn't skip it once. While the music is all used at the appropriate times, they are for the most part forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-6\\n\r\nThis was actually what carried the show for me, and the character that most fans seem to hate is my favorite this season, Alois. Ciel was a bit of a let down for me- basically all developing he went through was reset, and seems brattier than the first season.  Season 2 Ciel I still enjoyed, and he is the only other character I really cared for. Sebastian is very different from  season 1. In the first Black Butler fans can decide if Sebastian feels more for Ciel than just another meal-be it romantic or in platonic way. This is definitely answered in this season. Characters from season 1 show up for a small amount of time. The other demon butler we meet is Claude, and he is the most unlikable character in the show, that is all I have to say on it. Alois. So much hate. Many times there will be a horrible character, one who you hate, but is given a tragic past which to the writer means they have an excuse and is justified in their evil actions, which really they are not. I did not hate Alois like everyone did. Sure I found him a bit annoying, but actually very entertaining in his sadistic ways. And he doesn't actually do anything especially evil. He is given a sad past, and I thought it explained his actions and motives. This character does go through a bit development, and I don't mind what he does in the end. The rest of the new characters have nothing I particularly liked or disliked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6\\n\r\nAlois I found to be the most enjoying thing in this show, the for many it was the least likeable thing. I can understand why some may not like him, but I feel he gets more hate than deserved. The yaoi (BoyxBoy) undertones that are in the first season is definitely not an undertone in this one. Much of it is fan service, except with Alois.The humor in season 1 is less in season 2, and some of the times it showed up felt unnatural to the scene, but was still good. It was overall enjoyable, but some parts felt like a chore to watch.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? If you liked Black Butler than yes. It isn't as good as the first, but if you enjoyed the first season, odds are you will find at least one thing you will like. It is not a must though, only if you really liked Black Butler. If you thought the first was okay, than just out it away for a rainy day to watch.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEWARE!\r\nWell, it looks like this will be my very first review of a second season. Already reviewed the first by the way. Anyways! Black Butler (Kuroshitsuji)! Did I like it? HELL YES! To quote on my review of the first season, Black Butler is one of the only few fan bait anime I really enjoyed. It\u2019s not because Sebastian is hot, but the fact that the show takes place during Victorian-era London as well as its mystery and supernatural elements made me love it. The first season may not fully follow the manga, but it is still a fun watch with andtwisted story, memorable characters, nice art style and awesome music ranging from classic to jazz. One of the most enjoyable shows I\u2019ve seen. It would have been an almost perfect anime franchise - if it wasn\u2019t for this piece of crap!\\n\\n\r\nNow, Black Butler II. Known as one of the most disappointing anime sequels to ever exist. Why? Because of a lot of things! It is a sequel filled with nothing but fanservice. BLOODY VICTORIAN FANSERVICE! Whether if it\u2019s a man, woman or boy! It is literally what many people call a Black Butler fanfic turned into an anime. Wait, did I say fanfic? I meant this season had nothing to do with the freaking manga. I myself haven\u2019t read the manga, but even I can\u2019t stand an anime adaptation like this!\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: 5/10\\n\r\nWhen the season starts off, there are 6 words that everybody will say. \u201cWHO THE HELL ARE THESE GUYS!?\u201d The story opens with a boy and a demon butler that is not Ciel and Sebastian, and are instead Alois Trancy and Claude. The first parts of the first episode only shows these new, anime-original characters. I thought this show was going to be big a disaster until finally later on in the episode, Sebby comes to take his rightful place as the main character. Along with Ciel of course. The next few episodes after the first are not really that bad. In fact, they were one of the only good things about this season. And then halfway throughout the series we come back to Mr Trancy and his gang. But hey, at least Ciel and Sebastian are still the main duo. To be honest, the idea of two pairs of a boy and his demon butler, battling each other wasn\u2019t so bad. In fact, it was interesting. It was going pretty alright \u2013 until the ending came along. I won\u2019t spoil any details. But let me just say that it is one of the worst anime original endings that I could possibly ever imagine. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 6/10\\n\r\nOne of the best things that Black Butler can offer are its characters. Ciel and Sebastian are back for another adventure and are both still as good characters as they were. Sebastian is still your favorite badass and sexy anime butler; and Ciel is still a cute, rich detective boy with a mysterious past. As for the other returning characters like the servants, the Grim Reapers, the Indians and Ciel\u2019s friends, they are pretty much the same as last time too. Except the fact that they have very little screen time throughout this season. Sadly.\\n\r\nAnd now, for the new characters. First let\u2019s talk about Claude, Hannah and those purple-haired triplets. They may look interesting, but since they\u2019re anime original characters, they\u2019re quite unimpressive. Claude is basically a Sebastian wannabe and is nowhere near as awesome as he is (I mean, in the first episode he was doing a strange dance before he started setting up the table). Hannah on the other hand is nothing more than a fanservice bait who gets brutally tortured by Alois, there isn't much to say about her because if I do, I would go into spoiler territory. For the triplets, they\u2019re pretty forgettable am I right.\\n\r\nAnd then there Alois Trancy himself. He\u2019s what I call a 50/50 type of character (a character whom many people love and many people hate at the same time). Some people like him because he\u2019s cute, for some reason; but most people hate him because he\u2019s an annoying and whiny brat who complains about every single damn thing. As for me, I don\u2019t know if I hate him or not. On one hand at first, I felt sorry for what happened to his little brother and being abducted. But on the other hand, after seeing the ending, yeah, he deserves to be a little bastard hated by many people alike. Overall, the new characters are pretty pointless.\\n\\n\r\nART: 9/10\\n\r\nMuch like the first season, Black Butler 2 is produced by A1 Pictures. There isn't much to say about the art style. It's basically like the first one, but more improved. And that's basically one of the few ways of how the season improved more from the first one. Let's also not forget about those crappy CGI carriages. Yep, they are still out of place.\\n\r\nOh by the way, there is a train murder episode in this season and you know what that means; they're going Baccano! At this moment, I am quite confused if whether I'm watching Black Butler, Baccano or even Gosick (which also has a train murder episode). Hence why I dubbed these three the \"Historical Mystery Trio\". Going back to the subject, Black Butler 2's animation is still as nice as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC: 9/10\\n\r\nAlso nothing much to say in here. Music is still good with a mixture of classical, jazz and rock. Mostly classical since this is a much darker sequel than the first. The opening SHIVER by The Gazette may be a very catchy opening, but I do think that there is a flaw about the opening choice. Take a look at the first and third season's openings which both are sung by SID; they are one of my favorite bands to do an anime tune because they are known to mix classical music with rock (if you've seen Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Magi, you know how good they are). And they do it perfectly with Black Butler's openings. When you look at SHIVER, is only plain rock and it doesn't fully fit the show's theme. The ending, Bird by Matsushita Yuuya, on the other hand sounds pretty nice but it's one of those many endings that you just skip in order to watch the next episode. \\n\r\nAnd finally, let's talk about the other ending song, Kagayaku Sora no Shijima ni wa, which I have to admit is the best song that my favorite Japanese band Kalafina has ever done. The only downside to it is that it only plays in two episodes and the fact that it is played in such a disappointment like this season. \\n\\n\r\nDUB: 8/10\\n\r\nAnother one of the only improvements of this season 2 is the dub. Mey-Rin, Finny and Soma, who I've mentioned in my review of the first that they sounded a bit cringy in the dub, had little screen time so it is much easier to enjoy the dub. J Michael Tatum and Brina Palencia are still good at their roles as the main duo. As for the newer characters, they are voiced by well known veterans such as Jason Douglas (Claude), Caitlin Glass (Hannah) and Luci Christian (Alois). Despite how pointless they are, they still deliver good performances in the dub.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 7/10\\n\r\nBlack Butler 2 is not the worst anime sequel to ever exist as it does still have some of the elements of what made the first season good. But it is still a very disappointing sequel with an unlikable new cast, a very terrible ending and the fact that it has nothing to do with the manga. If you really love Black Butler, then I suggest you give it a shot (only once). But if you don't like Black Butler as much as others, I suggest you go and skip this season and read the manga. Or if you want more Ciel and Sebastian in an anime format, there is always the more superior Book of Circus. Speaking of which, I will review that next! \\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n+ More Ciel and Sebastian!\\n\r\n+ Still has some of the elements of what made the first season good (the art, the music and the dub)\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n- Absolutely worthless\\n\r\n- Pointless shota and yaoi fanservice\\n\r\n- Everything about the new characters (especially that bastard Alois)\\n\r\n- One of the worst ways to end an anime ever\\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 9/10\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I need to cure myself right now after watching this one hell of a disappointment of one hell of a butler and a boy.\\n",

            "content": "Firstly, I will assume anyone reading this review will have seen the first season of Black Butler, although this review will only contain minor spoilers for the first season.\r\nBlack Butler II is a clear divergence from the overall attitude of the first season, being fairly dark and twisted, and is certainly a risky departure from what made the first season so appealing to me. What it does have however is the plot and villains the first season needed to be great \u2013 characters that are truly evil and can truly pose a competition to the Sebastian and Ciel.\r\nAlois is possibly the perfect villain for Ciel.Both are two children who have gone through the same harrowing experience and emerging both twisted, but very different in their overall attitude to the people that surround them. While not necessarily the best bad guy ever written, he certainly stands head and shoulders above the underwhelming angelic villains of the first season, and Alois\u2019 backstory is expanded upon so as to provide a convincing justification for the conflict between himself and Ciel, who has not lost his loveable but merciless spark from the first season thankfully. Despite being much less suave, Alois\u2019 butler Claude also acts as the perfect contrast to Sebastian, who like Ciel has not lost any of his mysterious and cheeky personality from season 1. Seeing our main characters being put in an uncomfortable new season is exactly what I would have asked for from the second season. Sebastian in particular is pushed to his limit, and watching him fighting at his best is a very welcome change to the incredibly overpowered position he held in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nPlotwise, the frustrating cliffhanger ending to Black Butler 1 is tied up very nicely indeed, and the plot overall is pretty great, with an abundance of twists and turns that does not fail to maintain your interest throughout \u2013 the one-off story episodes that were the strength of the first season persist to a degree in the second season, but are now satisfyingly tied into the overarching storyline. It is important to take into account though that this season is much, MUCH darker and noticeably more violent than season 1 \u2013 definitely a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective, although I think it was much more fitting for the supernatural theme of the show. If you found yourself enjoying the later episodes of the first season, which took a gradually darker turn than the first half did, you should be giving season 2 a try.\\n\\n\r\nThis season\u2019s darker tone however means that the first season\u2019s abundance of comic relief is conspicuously absent. While the comedy was placed very well in season 1, it would not have been welcome at all in the shorter and more focused plot of season 2. As a result, perhaps the greatest strength of this season is that it is 12 episodes long compared to 25, reducing the requirement for filler episodes of the first season (curry competition arc anyone?). That is not to say though that this season has no sense of humour at all, far from it. The comedy of the show remains strong when it is included, and at the start the show nearly breaks the fourth wall in some of its more teasing and light-hearted moments - all very enjoyable stuff, and an opportunity to bring back the fun characters from season 1. The ridiculous romance of the master-butler relationships portrayed in the anime forms its own form of comedy as well, if you don\u2019t take it too seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation for season 2 is, as you would expect, improved, particularly in the fight scenes, which are now beautifully choreographed (thanks largely to the addition of another butler on Sebastian\u2019s level for him to compete with). Sebastian no longer glides through the air repetitively, he weaves and dodges and is pushed to a degree he never was in season 1, making fight scenes a joy rather than a chore to watch. The bloodiness of some fights certainly caught me off guard, season 2 definitely makes the best of its boosted age rating.\\n\\n\r\nBy contrast with the improved animation, this season\u2019s music is perhaps slightly weaker, largely down simply to the excellent music the first season had. Despite being half the length, the series does has one op and two eds, just as Black Butler did. By no means did I desperately feel the need to skip them, but at the same time they never hyped me up in the same way season 1\u2019s soundtrack did. The use of two different opening animations to indicate whether the episode focuses on Ciel or Alois was a very nice touch though, extra effort that wasn\u2019t necessary but does well to set the theme of an episode.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I end this review, I want to point out how accompanying the violence, the fan service side has been noticeably toned up as well, in both the yaoi sense Black Butler is known for, and surprisingly the more traditional sense designed to appeal to male viewers. Some of this is easily ignored if not your sort of thing, although it does detract from the plot (there is still a strange insistence on lines such as: \u2018I will pierce your soul with my needle\u2019. See this as you see fit\u2026). If anything, some of the \u2018fanservice\u2019 doesn\u2019t really deserve the title of fanservice. It\u2019s more vulgar than that, and is often used as a case to put on display just how twisted and exploitative Alois is, reinforcing his position as the antithesis to Ciel\u2019s more refined character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show is a much more mature take on the overall Black Butler concept, an attitude which the writers hinted at but overall decided to avoid in the first season of Black Butler (both have their strengths and weakness in this way). This I understand disappointed some fans immensely, including myself at first. However, this take on Black Butler definitely holds its own ground and for that reason I feel it\u2019s fair to give an equal score to this season as I did the last season. Black Butler II uses the themes and characters introduced in season 1, but puts them in a different situation. The enjoyment to be gained out of this season is watching the characters we know and love adapting to the challenges of their new environment, and they perform an admirable job in doing so.\\n\\n\r\nStop here if you don\u2019t want mild spoilers about the ending\u2026\\n\r\nAs an aside, Black Butler\u2019s ending was certainly not entirely satisfying, I see it though as inevitable that the ending to a story about the relationship between a demon and his prey wouldn\u2019t be very uplifting. If you have seen Madoka Magica\u2019s ending, it\u2019s the same bittersweet disappointment that leaves you not wholly satisfied, but feeling that this was the way the story was meant to end.\\n",

            "content": "Alot of the reviews have touched on the things I thought mentioning in a review already, so I will be writing whatever I thought should still be said in a review. There will be lots of spoilers\r\nUnlike the original series, there is ALOT more ambiguous yaoi material. The farther off the anime goes from the manga, the more ambiguous yaoi material. Thankfully, Sebastion and Ciel aren't responsible for this, its the two new characters, Alois and Claude. \r\n Alois has a pretty dark past, and its much nastier than Ciel's. Also, especially after certain incidents, Claude...the best way to say this is that Sebastianhas more honor than Claude will ever have. \\n\r\nBut the most horrible thing about the second season was the extreme yaoi concerning Alois's past as well as Claude himself. It hurt to get past that crap and those scenes were easily the worst I've ever seen. If you don't like yaoi, you might need to get used to skipping ahead\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nThe household staff and other minor characters don't show much at all after episode 6. Alois may seem like a complete and utter douche, but as more of his past is developed, he isn't what he seems to be.ts ironic that the character everybody assumed would have a horrible end to his existence would actually end up the most satisfied one out of the show. \\n\r\nClaude...is not what a demon is supposed to be, manga or anime wise. Imagine Grell, but a jack*** who is still in the closet, and you've got Claude. Hannah may seem like a victim, but by the end of the 10th episode, you'll want take a lesson from Alois and stick a finger in her eye. \\n\r\nGrell is more or less the male incarnation of a fan girl in this season, and the only source of comedy within the later episodes. The story reason for his reappearances is for Sebastian to use him, but its probably because theres no room for comedy by the main characters, Grell must contain it all. Its not a bad thing, just something you should keep an eye out for.  Though Grell's fangirl moments are funny, the only true hilarious moment was when Sebastian found that adorable basket of kittens...aww..\\n\r\nThe Viscount's  portrayal in this season is a perfect example of the anime being COMPLETELY out-of-character. Last time I checked, Viscount is an sadistic person AUCTIONING PEOPLE FOR SACRIFICE. So how come HE FAINTS AT THE SIGHT OF BLOOD? No logic at all. \\n\r\nAll the main characters are well-developed, and I have to admit, Ciel and Seb haven't changed too much from their original anime counterparts. But if you do anything, do not jump to conclusions. \\n\r\n\\. But, as with the predeccessor, I strongly dislike when they try to speak in English. I know, its awesome how they are trying to be authentic and all, but it sounds horrible. I am compelled to throw up every time I hear \"Your highness\" or \"Yes my lord\". I know its unfair to criticize japanese voice actors for their English, but its one of the pet peeves of the show.\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\n You know the feeling of when you see a movie adaption of your favorite book, and its really good until they forgot one major detail or skipped over something that you were looking forward too, and then you get extremely pissed and temporarily detest the movie?  That's what happened here. \\n\r\nI have to admit, the show has quite a lot of almost-random twists, which is what Kuroshitsuji the anime is known for. \\n\r\nCiel probably wouldn't be able to get a better ending, but the problem here is that the ending isn't balanced. \\n\r\nThe protagonists (or anti-heros) are supposed to BOTH have satisfying endings, not just one. I know this isn't easy for this show, but this season is cruel towards Sebastian. Sebastian can't have Ciel's soul, despite all the effort of having protected it from everything thats happened (Seriously think about that for a second), only to find out it was all for nothing, and is stuck in a contract with a another demon FOREVER, and can't have the world's most delicious soul, let alone any. \\n\r\nI I have to admit, the first half of the last episode was spetacularous (made that word up) but I'm in shock. When I first started the season, I thought there would be no way to get further out of the manga's reach. I WAS WRONG. All, I MEAN ALL, of the characters besides Sebby and Ciel are more or less deleted from the anime, because they all think Ciel's dead. Even the basic idea of Kuroshitsuji *A kid is in a contract with a demon to do whatever he pleases in exchange for the kid's soul* has been erased. Only Sebby and Ciel left, and I have no idea whats in the next season at all. \\n\r\nIf the Kuroshitsuji 2 ended with Ciel's awakening as a demon, and let the beginning of season 3 be the last half, I would have been more satisfied.\\n\r\n But despite everything, I still anticipated every week's episode, and have rated this a 7.  The first five episodes are more focused on the Sherlock Holmes aspect of the original kuroshitsuji, but only after does the show go wild. But thank god, theres NO FILLER. Maybe because of the fact the season is only 12 episodes, but I digress. \\n\r\nAnd the funny thing is that in the first five episodes, they constantly refer to Claude, but his role in the events of the first five episodes IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND IS NEVER MENTIONED AFTER THOSE EPISODES. Why include him at all then in the beginning?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7\\n\r\nThis depends if you've got a strong stomach and how much you like the fanservice directed to the girls. Yes, its a lot more present then in the first series, but the plot is amazing. It isn't Yona's style of story after the first five episodes, but that isn't a bad thing concerning how good the story is. There are probably plot holes towards the end, but that was the same as the first season. Its definitely worth watching, but the conclusion is going to slightly spoil your feelings toward it.  I don't recommend this to any newcomers to anime. But if you liked the first anime series, go ahead and enjoy. If you loved the manga, don't come here hoping for the Circus arc. It isn't here, and trying to watch this will probably get you mad.\\n\r\n Note: For those reading this, please click \"Helpful\" or \"Not Helpful\" according to your opinion. For those who do, thanks! :)",

            "content": "I'm going to be honest. I went into this season totally ready to hate it, but did find myself enjoying certain aspects of it. Does that make it actually good though? Not... really.\r\nThe biggest problem with this season is also the most obvious one: it doesn't have any reason to exist. It follows after the first season of Black Butler, which itself had a very definitive ending, and the excuses they come up with to continue the story are weak and frankly ridiculous at times. They desperately try to bring back old characters that had their character arcs end long ago, and all of thatso they can come up with an ending that isn't nearly as satisfying as the original one.\\n\\n\r\nEven with that in mind, though, the story just doesn't make much sense when you get down to it. The narrative has a pretty big ego when it comes to disclosing important plot points, and often doesn't reveal them until a lot later than it should. Heck, there's a piece of information regarding how this story could happen in the first place that isn't revealed until episode 11, (and may I remind you, this season only has 12 episodes). I have a feeling they did this to make the narrative seem more interesting, but if you're going to tell your story like this, it should make more sense the more information you get. Here, it's surprisingly the other way around. This may be especially because the reasonings for a lot of the most important plot points are never properly explained, nor is it ever built up or foreshadowed that they are possible. (This gets especially jarring with the ending.) It also doesn't help that the first episode is immediately followed by two very blatant filler episodes that don't explain the plot at all, (although episode 3 was admittedly the highlight of the season to me).\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, this season introduces a new kid and a demon butler, the psychopathic brat Alois Trancy and the cold and uncaring demon Claude Faustus. These two characters are glorified way too much, to the point where they get more control over the plot than the original main characters, Ciel and Sebastian, almost like if this was a fanfiction where the writers inserted their own OCs, (which, in a way, it kind of is, considering that this season has nothing to do with the manga the series was originally based off of). Now, this wouldn't have bothered me if they truly took over the spot as the main characters, but they did not. The story still mostly focuses on Ciel and Sebastian, but neither of them get to be as interesting as in the last season, especially Ciel whose character development from the last season has almost entirely vanished by plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Alois and Claude themselves, I'm a bit conflicted. Alois is definetely a terrible person, but he is a bit interesting regardless, (which, to be fair, is rather similar to Ciel). It's clear he has been through some terrible things, and his motivations do become understandable as the story goes along. The problem, though, is that at no point is he really likable. Even in his backstory he's already a psycopath. I still did get somewhat invested in this character, and even sometimes felt sorry for him, which is more that I can say about Claude, who is definitely the blandest of the main characters. His personality is essentially a cheaper version of Sebastian, but less passionate about what he does, and his motivations are laughably simple. At one point in the story his motivation even changes at the flip of a coin and he breaks the rules simply because he wants to.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of that said, though, there are a few things I like, as mentioned earlier. In my opinion there are three saving graces in this season.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off is the visuals. The animation and the artwork are a big step up from the previous season. With Book of Circus having come out afterwards, this is no longer the most beautiful Black Butler has ever looked, but it was for a while. All the environments are gorgeous to look at, and the action is more bad-ass than ever.\\n\\n\r\nSecond is the voice acting. Obviously the voice actors from the first season do just as good of a job now as they did then, and still portray their characters perfectly. Maaya Sakamoto, the voice of Ciel, does an especially good job in the last three episodes, where a rather wide range is required from her, and she still pulls off her acting flawlessly. The new actors also do a very good job. Even though Alois is a psycopathig brat, his voice actress does a very good playing a psycopathic brat, and Claude's voice actor pulls off the demon butler part almost as good as Sebastian's voice actor does.\\n\\n\r\nThird is Grell. Just Grell. She is honestly becoming one of my favorite characters, she's just so much fun, and in this season she is being particularly delicious and her voice actor sounds like he is having so much fun doing the part. Even when the series was pissing me off, I couldn't help but smile anytime she showed up.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, there are a few things to enjoy about this season. If you want my honest recommendation, don't watch it, as it is mostly just a waste of time. But if you've seen everything else from the series and have a Black Butler-shaped hole in your heart you desperately need to fill, I guess this series is a harmless waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending is very likely to piss you off, though.",

            "content": "After I complete the first season, I started to hear the complaints of other fans about Kuroshitsuji II ... that it deviates completely from the manga , that the new characters are horrible and that this series destroyed the franchise. I choose to give it a chance so here is my review of Kuroshitsuji II.\r\n At first, we have the story (9) ! The episodes are only 12 so there aren't many fillers. Instead we have the story of Ciel's return and his clash with the house of Trancy. I was interested to see how Ciel escaped from what happened in Season 1 (whichwas one of my favourite anime endings) and I liked the explanation. Well , to be honest the whole story had some holes but it has a nice pacing and great twists. It really has nothing to do with the manga, but it's a nice what-if. A big what-if is also the ending of the series, which is so much ambiguous and it has the smell of a fan-fiction. It's an interesting one but I can't accept it as canon to Ciel's story !\\n\r\n The art (10) is perfect, as it was in the first season. The whole Victorian scenery returns, with new places, like the Trancy's mansion, as beautiful as the old ones.\\n\r\n As for the sound (10) , it's very interesting. They are giving the same operatic vibes with the first season's soundtrack. My favourite tracks were Dance macabre and The butler of Trancy's. The opening , Shiver from the GazettE , is as epic as Monochrome no kiss and it has two versions , much like the first season's , one for Alois and one for Ciel. There are two endings also for each one of these main characters.\\n\r\n The characters (9) who had came back , like Ciel and Sebastian , are just as interesting as before. In this season , Sebastian returns with more concern and sympathy for Ciel and this time he has met his match in the face of Claude Faustus , the Trancy's butler , who becomes the antagonist of this series. For the new butler , there is a new master. The notorious Alois Trancy is the most interesting character of the season ... something like the dark alter ego of Ciel. Meanwhile , Ciel Phantomhive struggles to regain his memories and learn his destiny. \\n\r\n Finally , it was a fun to watch series , which served good as a sequel and a conclusion to the story. As I said before , I liked the series' ending but I can't say that it's canon. We can assume that the second season is an enjoying homage in the Black Butler series that any fan can easily watch !",

            "content": "-Black Butler II has a LOT going for, but only if you ignore the final few episodes of the previous season. I already had some mixed feelings about the ending of the first season, but that's for a different review somewhere else, and to see a continuation after such a concrete ending is definitely a red flag already for those wondering about seeing the second season. \r\n-The story here is an absolute MESS. It feels like a first draft written by a intern than it does something that can be similar to Yana-sensei's original artwork in her manga. There's so many continuity issues, plot holesand dropped side plots that it's almost pathetic here. A character is alive despite clearly dying in the last season, it is never explained how Sebastian knows Claude, another character gets a random twin brother that looks/acts more like their manga counterpart despite the original character stating they were a lonely orphan, why did Claude pick Sebastian of all people to make Alois think he needed to act revenge on and what happens to the Trancy estate by the end of it. There's so many here i feel like this review would go on forever here. It's just a flat out mess and definitely needed either 12 more episodes (making it 24 like the last season) or maybe even 2 more. 12 episodes were just not enough to fix the issues. For those wondering as well, no OVA fixes any of these plot issues as well. \\n\r\n-The art this season is at it's all time low. The first two episodes are really great with their animation but the rest it is extremely inconstant. Look at the style of episode 4 and then to episode 7 where there is a clear change in style and lighting. It almost looks like two different people drew different episodes. Not to mention the awful errors i noticed and pretty poorly drawn faces not even in the background. I noticed a heavier use of CGI this season as well. Last season i didn't notice it but this one was way more prominent especially with the train and horses. You would think with how much they made off the first season that they would actually have a higher budget, but no apparently. The promotional art is a million times better than the art in the actual anime unfortunately. \\n\r\n-Music is pretty good this season, a lot of fast paced violins and a few pieces from the first season's soundtrack do make a return occasionally. A enjoyable classical style though i find a few rock-sounding songs don't really fit the tone of Black Butler at all outside of the opening. Speaking of which, the openings (2 for this season) are both pretty good and i enjoy the song quite a lot. \\n\r\n-The characters have a LOT of potential. Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus are the most interesting characters this season and are a fascinating pair considering they are almost a opposite/dysfunctional version of Sebastian and Ciel. However their characters never really get a opportunity to shine. We never see Alois and Claude on their own and how Alois' position with the queen really works. I honestly feel that maybe Black Butler II should have focused solely on these two instead of trying to shove in Ciel and Sebastian (Perhaps make this season like Yu Gi Oh GX where the torch is passed to someone else). The other newly introduced characters are the demon triplets, but they don't talk and very underdeveloped so it's hard to properly judge them. I suppose they're alright, but it's hard to judge characters only in the background. There is Luca, who is Alois' brother (though we honestly have no clue if it's biological or adoption) and the reason behind his motivation. He's quite adorable, to some his motivation MAY be a little psychopathic but he is a small child with no sense of right/wrong so...\\n\r\nThe last character introduced is Hannah Anafelloz - the worst newly introduced character. Sure she had done her job and had faced compelling forces, but her motivations made no sense. She wanted Alois and to attack Claude, it makes no sense for her to go after Sebastian as well when he has done nothing but defend himself (and even said something decently polite to her when they first met). It also makes no sense for her to hide what she knows, all she would have had to do is say the truth when Alois was most vulnerable during a fit and then none of those would have happened! She just feels like a awfully written foil character and while they try to make us feel bad for her, her negatives outweigh her positive ones. Everyone else is the same, except Lau made no sense. He had done some awful things to Ciel yet continues to still work for him? That felt immensely desperate that i almost wonder if he was a Easter egg for a species from the manga (as the atlantic arc was written around the same time i believe). Everyone else's roles were too small to judge but they are from the original cast and i still enjoy them (such as Finny, Lizzy, etc) \\n\r\n-Overall Black Butler II is almost a guilty pleasure. It's a mess and completely awful to watch but the characters of Alois and Claude honestly make up for it just a little bit. I still don't recommend this unless you are a major Black Butler fan and just want to see Ciel and Sebastian do anything even just standing and breathing. For regular fans, i don't recommend this. Just skip this and watch the reboot.",

            "content": "I am very late to the Kuroshitsuji train. About ten years too late. Whilst all of my friends were gushing over animated demons, I was re-watching Free! for the thirteenth time, and now, after four years, I have finally finished the ever so divisive Black Butler. And, though I quite enjoyed season one, season two was definitely not a very enjoyable experience. Most people had told me to avoid it, and continue on the the much better Book of Circus, and I wish I had, for this season very much ruined a lot of my perception of the show andthe fanbase surrounding it.\\n\\n\r\n     First off I was not opposed to the idea of Black Butler receiving a sequel, even after finishing its predecessor. From a critical standpoint it probably wasn't the best choice, but there was still a lot of material to cover from the manga, and I wasn't quite satisfied with the ending of season one (for solely emotional reasons, as even though it fit well in with the story, it ripped my heart into pieces). It not following the manga wasn't much of an issue for me either since I've never finished it, so overall it didn't pose any problem with me.\\n\\n\r\n     As the story progresses however, you begin to see jarring flaws with pacing and development of the new editions to the cast.  In the first episode you are introduced to Alois Trancy, head of the Trancy household, and survivor of much sexual, emotional, and physical abuse throughout his life. Despite this however, he is entirely unlikable, and an over all tragic character, both in his construction and his actuality. His butler, Claude, is equally as unlikable, but not for any main reason other than him just being like a slightly less appealing Sebastion, lacking in originality down to his design. Their house staff and the entire concept of the Trancy household is designed to be some sort of opposing side to the Phantomhives, and this is where one of it's main flaws resides.\\n\\n\r\n     Black Butler, from my analysis, is about the balance of good and evil, and about the sacrifices you have to make in order to have a balanced world. You cannot have the good without the bad, and sometimes the honest, noble, holy people aren't always good-intentioned. This is illustrated plainly throughout the second half of the first season, with the episodes featuring the church and other symbols of purity. You literally root for the devil because, while his motives are selfishly rooted, he is on the right side of the story, advocating for balance as opposed to achieving good through dangerous methods. What Kuroshitsuji II does is more so pit bad against bad. Ciel and Sebastion are, generally speaking, the bad guys. They are the protagonists, but in theory they are connected with darkness. By pitting these two houses against each other, it creates a confusing sense of conflict, to where you don't know who is really on the right side. It relies solely on the attachment built up with the original cast to create conflict, which may work for fangirls, but makes the average viewer question their entire perception of the show and it's characters, and left me confused and upset at whoever green-lighted the season. This also makes Claude and Sebastion's battles quite conflicting, because they both essentially want the same thing, and are basically just two guys fighting over their next meal. Instead of creating a proper counter for the darkness of the Phantomhive Estate, they tried to create a textbook antagonist, which doesn't work when the main characters are technically evil within themselves.\\n\\n\r\n    Characterization is another big issue I had when watching. Part of what makes Ciel such a good character is that his actions are justifiable. He acts the way he does because of his past, but did not lose qualities of basic human decency in the process of coping with his trauma. He is arrogant and troublesome at times, but his behavior is backed up by his willingness to do the right thing and bring people to justice who have wronged him and those he cares about, even if his motives behind it are selfish. Alois is the exact opposite, displaying traits of narcissism even before undergoing years of abuse, and while that isn't a problem for an antagonist per-say, it makes him incredibly insufferable for his whole run on the show. He treats his staff as verbal and physical punching bags, and then turns around and starts tap dancing. This, again, wouldn't be such an issue if the show didn't try to garner sympathy for him, by showing the backstory with his brother and all. It's as if the writers couldn't decide if they wanted you to love him or wish death upon him, and his character was ultimately created as a big ploy for Claude's motives, without giving you time to fully understand his character. And don't get me started on Claude. He gets a special spot reserved on my least favorite character list, due to the fact that I literally wanted to kick his teeth in every time he made an appearance.\\n\\n\r\n    Claude and Alois's relationship also left me very unsettled, and was a product of this poor character development. Ciel and Sebastion's relationship is one of mutual understanding, beyond that of their contract. Sebastion understands Ciel's need for revenge and helps him achieve so, while serving and protecting him in the process, and eventually caring about him as much as his demonic intentions allow. Ciel knows this and is fully accepting off the fact his soul will be taken in exchange for his service, as he has been broken to the point of no return. It is an exchange, whereas Alois and Claude's is an unhealthy desire for protection. Claude enables Alois's toxic behavior, and uses him as a stepping stone for his goals, whereas Sebastion and Ciel have a mutual understanding of each-other and their true intentions. This makes sense, as they are designed to be polar opposites, but is done in a rushed and very shallow way, caked with fan service and dancing metaphors. It also helps perpetuate the fandom's very toxic view of Alois's character, treating him as some damaged baby, when he's more of a sadist brat then anything else. \\n\\n\r\n   The show has a plethora of other flaws, particularly the ending, which I will not go into for spoilers sake. The ending was incredibly disappointing for a number of reasons, and left me very, very sad for just about every character in the show, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. On the plus side, however, the artwork is stunning as usual, with the quality improving even more so from the already gorgeous first season. The designs for the newer characters are okay, though I particularly enjoyed Alois's attire with his shorts and fancy boots. The OP was quite forgettable, which saddened me as The Gazette is a band which I know and enjoy from time to time. The ED and music throughout the show, however, were both very high in quality, with this ED being my favorite next to \"I'm Alive\" from season one.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Kuroshitsuji II was quite disappointing. The show had flaws to begin with, and then it was completely blown out of the water with the incredibly upsetting ending, leaving viewers with an abundance of negative emotions. I regret watching it, as it has tainted my impression of the show, and while it was fun to watch given its stunning animation and decent soundtrack, in the end it left me feeling less to be desired. Though I don't think this season needs to be completely ignored, I like to consider it a poor spinoff of a very strong show and manga. Whether to watch it is up to your discretion (and whether you like it or not is your opinion!), but I wouldn't recommend it if you have any sort of respect or enjoyment for the original Black Butler, because you will just be let down and disappointed.\\n",

            "content": "Do not watch this season. Do your research on Black Butler, maybe read the manga, and only watch the canon episodes of the anime. The rest is simply a waste of your time. The storyline made no sense at all, and all it will do is confuse you. \r\nThe reason I haven't rated this season as a 1 is because I do still love Sebastian and Ciel as characters, Alois and Claude were interesting for a while, and the ending was poetic in a way. Had Claude and Alois been a part of the manga, I think their addition to the anime would've been stunning.For people thinking that these two are just a rewrite of Sebastian and Ciel's characters, that is not the case. They have a completely different relationship, and each of the characters have their own, interesting backstories. That is one of the few things I enjoyed about this season.\\n\\n\r\nBesides those few things, this season just made me sour towards the whole series. The plot didn't make sense, to me. The ending of the previous season, in my opinion, was not adequately explained in this season. Even if it was explained properly, that still wouldn't make sense of the plot for this season. Alois's motives for entering Ciel's life just didn't feel thought through to me, as is the case many times with anime and that diverge from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the third season will probably change my opinion (or so I hope) since it is canon material, unlike this second season. For now, though, I'm quite unhappy with the direction this anime took. \\n\\n\r\nMy final advice for you would be: stick with the canon. It'll save you a lot of headaches.",

            "content": "[STORY: 2/10]\r\nOne of the most boring and disappointing sequels I've ever had the displeasure of watching. While the original \"Kuroshitsuji\" wasn't a masterpiece by any means, at least it featured passable filler. This show is the epitome of a fan-fiction that some teenage girl wrote out of her undying love for the show. Except these were adults who wrote this and thought the material was passable. Maybe hardcore fans of the series may enjoy it, but as someone who just wants to watch a good series, it disgusts me. \"Kuroshitsuji II\" just makes me want to curl up and fall asleep. That's all the storyis good for.\\n\\n\r\n[ART: 6/10]\\n\r\nThe artwork has always been the greatest part of this series. Not that it's amazing, but it beats out everything else quality-wise. The problem this time around is that nothing worthwhile is animated, which wastes the talents of the animators that have to animate this show to get paid.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND: 4/10]\\n\r\nLike the previous part of the series, this sound is just passable, whether it be the voice actors or music. Though the major thing that downgrades this section is what comes from the audio: alot of uneventful and boring filler that's barely passable. Not a whole lot to say about it besides that.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER: 3/10]\\n\r\nLaughable. Did you enjoy the character development of the canon material? Well that's completely disregarded in \"Kuroshitsuji II\". Generic characters and a completely filler chain of events and character interactions make the previously present characters feel cheapened and the new ones like what they are: filler. The good character design remains, but there isn't anything super creative about the new characters. If it weren't for \"The Book of Circus\", this franchise's animated version would lose all appeal.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT/OVERALL: 3/10]\\n\r\nThis part of the series pretty much hits rock bottom in terms of story and character quality. The only \"saving graces\" for the show are its average sound direction and above average art. I would never recommend this boring, unengaging snooze fest to anyone sane, unless they're a hardcore fan who has no sense of quality and just wants to see their favorite characters do anything on screen.",

Let me tell you it was messed up, at the beginning. Two words for you. No joke. I don't even know how they thought of all this plot, but it was so weird and strange and random and unreal and not following the original story at all! They practically turned it into a fanservice giving perverted anime that knows no tomorrow, unless if you'rea Ciel x Sebby BL fangirl like me, then you'll probably enjoy it. Seriously.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, other than the fanservice and BL, it was nothing, nothing that the general audience would probably appreciate. Everything was random, off the charts, total wacko if I do say so myself. Not something you would want to watch unless you're an insane madman...who's just really perverted...or if you're a devoted Kuro fan. Trust me there were lots of those perverted times, enough that you could tag it as \"ecchi.\"\\n\\n\r\nAt least the ending was good. That was probably the best part of Kuroshitsuji! I enjoyed it thoroughly, which is what made me change the score I gave Kuro II.\\n\\n\r\nBe warned that Kuroshitsuji season two can be described as a chaos of horror, gore, pain, lust, and whatever is in between, if there is even indeed anything left at all between those cracks of inhumanity. However at the end, they prove to explain some of the plot they've twisted, so it makes matters better.\\n\\n\r\nSo I won't suggest you to watch it. Unless, you are like me, a devoted fan of Kuroshitsuji who just needs to know what happened at the end, when they end it all, or if you are into blood or lust or BL. Watching this has indeed become a pain at the beginning, somewhat, but eventually at the end of the episode you wonder so badly what's going to happen next, what twisted adventure they will have, what kind of gruesome \"dance\" they will perform next, and what kind of showdown they will have that will devour everything and all the souls of all the people...\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound were definitely out of the ordinary, not in a bad way. The animation was stunning, as was the sound, a very nice quality.\\n\\n\r\nDefinitely one of the most craziest animes that I've watched, since they've mixed up the plot so much and created random scenarios with random new characters, but of course, we're all just watching this for the hot butlers and action scenes between them, speaking of which have very brilliant butlers within themselves, like for example the triplet demons.\\n\\n\r\nIt blew my mind away, especially in the end, where it ends off nicely, but I won't tell you what happened. You'll just have to watch it yourself if you're interested enough.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Okay, to sum it all up, for a BL fan, you'll probably enjoy this, as they give lots of \"hints\" of pairings. But if you're not and you don't like BL, then you probably will find this disgusting, so don't watch it. But if you like gore and lust and the like, then you should consider watching this, even more so if you're a Kuro fan. The plot is very twisted and weird, but at least they have awesome art and music, and at the end they even explain everything, finishing off with a nice touch of a sort of \"cliff hanger\" kind of ending.",

            "content": "(This is a review of the anime Kuroshitsuji II. I won't judge it based on the fact that it did not follow the manga, therefore you might think I'm giving it a high score. You should also note that this is one of my first reviews, so please bear with me..)\r\nKuroshitsuji, the first season, is an anime that I always felt, while good, was over-hyped and overrated. Overall it was a good series, but nothing really stuck with me after seeing the last episode. The sequel, Kuroshitsuji II, on the other hand, is a completely different story.\r\nThe sequel to the borderline BL anime is bothdifferent and similar to the first season; it still follows the contract between Ciel, a 12 year old boy who lost his parents at a young age, and Sebastian, a demon. The characters from the first season are all there, hell even Soma and Agni makes a few appearances. The thing that makes it so different though, is the new pair: Alois and Claude. These two characters are as different as can be; Alois is a sadistic 14 year old boy with a terrible past, Claude is a composed demon who appears to have no feelings at all. Claude is a lot more demon-ish than Sebastian, a lot more evil and plotting. The atmosphere this season is a lot more darker; the rating here on MAL even went up from PG-13 to R-17+.\\n\r\nI won't say much about the plot as I feel it might spoil the series too much but I think it's a really good story although they should have given the season more episodes as it feels a little rushed towards the end. \\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters might just be my favorite part of the entire \"franchise\". It's easy to like them, it's easy to hate them. They're not all two dimensional characters with nothing but fancy hair or huge boobs (although the girls seem to be a little two dimensional). Alois, for one, is one of the most complex characters I've ever seen. Some are in there only for comical relief as the season turn darker and darker (see: Grell and the Phantomhive servants). Still the characters are great. I can't tell you how many of them I have had on my \"favorite characters\" list since I watched the first season. \\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe music is outstanding. Even if you don't like the anime, saying that the OST for this is horrible is just plain ignorance. You have The GazettE, Yuya Matsushita (a personal favorite of mine), and Kalafina. Taku Iwasaki, the guy in charge for the music, really did a good job.\\n\r\nThe voice actors are great too. \\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the animation.. What can I say? It's (I'm getting tired of repeating this word now) great. It's not outstanding nor excellent, but it gets the job done and more.\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this series was amazing. True, it might be because it aired during the summer season and there wasn't really much good airing back then, but I still found myself counting down the days till the raws were out. And then cursing myself for watching the raws without understanding what was going on. Here's a tip: If you don't know a lot of Japanese, don't be an idiot like me and watch the raws before the subs. It could really ruin the experience. Still, I found myself watching the raws as the subs didn't come out for days. And as opposed to some other airing stuff I've watched, it didn't ruin my enjoyment.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSo, then, what do we have? A flop or a masterpiece? It's defiantly not a flop, anything with the name Kuroshitsuji could not be considered flop (at least for me). It's not a masterpiece either, though. The plot is rushed, characters seems to be brought back as fanserivce rather than for a real reason, it's terribly depressing if you find yourself loving some of the characters, and the season in general seems to be to either please fans (though it seemed to have the opposite effect for some) or milk the cash cow for all it's worth. But.. even so, I can't bring myself to hate it.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji II is a big hit or miss. A lot of fans curse it for using no plot elements from the manga at all, other praise it for being original. And some just want nothing to do with it. For me this is one of the best animes of 2010, and I really wished more people would see past the cons and watch it as what it's supposed to be; entertainment.",

            "content": "What do you do when you have a huge fan-base filled of fan-girls who want more out of your Anime's twelve-episode-long first season which had an incredibly confusing messed up finale? Give them a sequel, of course!\r\nKuroshitsuji II introduces new and fairly interesting characters: Alois Trancy, a sadistic and bipolar fourteen-year-old who you will either love or hate, no in between. Claude Faustus, the butler of said boy, who gets a lot of hate from fans through the season for just, you know, being a demon and wanting to eat human souls and such. The triplets, who do not speak a word but still manageto be cute. And, of course, Hannah, who we will classify as \"just a maid\" in order to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nWell, first things first: the producers present you with an interesting story. We are reminded that Ciel is not the first and certainly not the last boy to have contracted a demon, by introducing us to Alois and his troubled past. Then, we get to see the differences between the two of them and stand by while it slowly morphs into a rivalry, which is what everyone wants to see, of course. It makes you question how much can a simple human change a demon and how much a demon can change a simple human.\\n\\n\r\nArt is as beautiful as ever, only failing in one or two episodes, but noticeable enough for fans to care. They manage to get the whole \"18th century\" atmosphere, though in this season we rarely see anyone who's not on the main five: Ciel, Sebastian, Alois, Claude and Hannah. Elizabeth and the servants have been relegated to extras and only appear to save/help the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus do a great job capturing each character's personalities and transforming them into a single voice. I specially liked the fact that you could sense Alois's constant struggle with himself and his own personality only through his laugh \u2014 that was quite creepy, may I add. The Opening got me singing aloud but the Ending was just too slow for me, though I didn't \"dislike\" it.\\n\\n\r\nDo I even have to talk about characters here? The old ones I still loved. The new ones I learned to like and eventually love some of them. Ah, that's a warning: you ARE going to hate at least one character by the time you reach the end of Kuroshitsuji II. Maybe the one you've hated through the whole season or maybe the one you though was going to be your favorite when it all started. Either way, you will have conflicting feelings.\\n\\n\r\n\"So, you're saying Kuroshitsuji II had an interesting story, good art and sound and great characters; why are you rating it with a six?\" You might be asking yourself right now. The answer is easy: it got boring. I know many people would disagree with me and many more would agree, but I just couldn't, for the life of me, get into it. It disappointed me to the point where I don't think I want to see a third season.\\n\\n\r\nYes, I'm aware it doesn't follow the manga and it's an entirely original story, but that doesn't make it absolutely good (or bad). The fact is that this sequel could have been great but couldn't and instead failed embarrassingly. Maybe it was because expectations were so high for it or maybe because it just was bad. \\n\\n\r\nMy advice is this: if you've got time and patience, watch it. If not, don't. You'll certainly not be missing anything big.",

No, not at all.\r\nYou grow very fond of the antagonist Alois Trancy, and as the story plays on you begin to wonder if he really is \"The bad guy\" of the story.\r\nSure, he does his job of creating a conflict, but in the end you feel a bittersweet taste in your mouth toward him, as well as one of the Trancy servants\"Hannah\". He is truly the sour patch kid of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nAt first you hate the guy, he's a total snob, a child, and one of the most annoying creatures I have ever seen Then you slowly start to feel bad for him, his past is a total tearjerker to say the least, right up there with Ciel's. Then, to put it in short he's just gone, no indication of what happened after or anything.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much the entire story leaves you with this \"Well what the fuck happened after that\" feeling. So many changes In such a short 12 episodes left me feeling unfulfilled and quite sad it was over. It was a long bumpy ride, cliff hangers are really one of the few things that keep you Interested and to be honest for a long time I didn't want to watch the last episode, to the point where I went back and watched the entire series over just to be back in the same spot until I gave in.\\n\\n\r\nNow my reason for a 9 as my enjoyment is because I really enjoy the series, it's full of mystery and emotion, which I look for in an anime and they often fall short or not up to my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art truly is eye catching and to be honest I really enjoy the style, the characters are well drawn, although some do lack in back story.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, very nice, the OP is well made in appearance as well as the song\\n\\n\r\nNow, I give a 6 for the story only because ... well in many places I almost hate the writers for making me feel so many emotions, my unfulfilled feeling is still very much so present and I don't really know how to feel about it.\\n\\n\r\nFunimation does a wonderful job with the dub and watching with subtitles is also enjoyable. In the end it depends on your personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe in being too nice, after all if writing this after Thanksgiving and being packed full of ham and mashed potatoes may be clouding my judgment, but hey who knows.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I don't know if I really recommend it to people, depending in what order you watch the series some parts of other seasons as well as this spin off may feel almost lack luster, but in the end it is up to you.",

            "content": "I was really afraid of how this would turn out for me, since sequels are often not as good as the original series. After having seen the first season and not read the manga, I wasn't really sure about what they would do since I had heard that it didn't follow the path of the manga (characters like Pluto and the angels were only in the anime). Since the story had sort of gone along the lines of a gothic Scooby-Doo (and I say that in every positive way possible, because I ADORED season one), I was curious about the new material the writers hadcome up with.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't even a little disappointed. Kuroshitsuji II was absolutely stunning, just as good as the first season, the addition of Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus helping in that aspect. It was a lot more of a story than season one, instead of various crimes/mysteries for Ciel and his demon-butler Sebastian to solve. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the opening theme: Shiver by The GazettE is an AMAZING song, one of my favorites, and the two different animations for it, one for a Ciel-centric episode, and one for an Alois-centric one, really had a positive effect on the enjoyment of that first 2 minutes of each episode, something I normally skip. \\n\\n\r\nAlois and Claude were quite the characters. I extremely enjoyed their anti-Ciel and Sebastian mannerisms, like Alois' outward sadism and affinity for causing trouble, and Claude's never smiling but flashily getting the job done ways; it was a change I was very open to. As soon as I saw Alois gouge out Hannah's left eye with an insane grin on his face, and Claude do a tap-dance performance and throw the tablecloth into the air as he flawlessly set the table for dinner without batting an eyelash, I knew these weren't just your run-of-the-mill filler characters to mercilessly bash to my hearts content. They were the real deal. \\n\\n\r\nI won't say anything further (so as to not accidentally release some spoilers), but I highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys amazing visual and audio aesthetics, an excellent story, and deep characters with fantastic histories.",

            "content": "Criteria \r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story does not leave from where Season 1 left off however it does eventually get to that point, Black Butler S2 thrown us in with a brand new \u2018Highness\u2019 and Butler; their names being Alois and Claud.  After the first few minutes however we finally get to see Sebastian and then eventually Ciel, which leaves us with a thousand and one question\u2026.\u2019what the hell happened at the end of Season 1??\u2019\r\nHowever these questions and more are eventually answered.\r\nEnding: 8\r\nI found the ending of S2 to be a lot better than that of S1, were S1 leaves us asking \u2018WHAT THE HELLJUST HAPPENED!!\u2019 S2 is a solid and conclusive ending yet also has possibilities of opening it up for a Season 3. If they did make a season 3 I reckon it would me majorly epic due to the final events of S2.\\n\\n\r\nSolid Plot: 8\\n\r\nWith 12 episodes only it would be hard if the plot wasn\u2019t solid. Black butler S2 basically follows the 2 \u2018Masters\u2019 on the brand new quests for revenge, but Ciel already got his revenge\u2026\u2026.or did he? The plot does not waver too much and stays on course for most of the 12 episodes; except for when the mission for the queen except even they are related in some way.. Also in season 2 the plot is a lot more solid as he doesn\u2019t take up that many missions any more from his majesty the Queen.\\n\r\nAnd lastly there are also the plot twists that I don\u2019t think anyone including myself ever saw coming, so that was a good new addition to the plot of Black butler S2.\\n\\n\r\nMoral: 0\\n\r\nI honestly do find the moral of any anime should be one of its high points; one of the main criteria\u2019s to be essentially ranked any judged after finishing an anime or on the completion of reading a manga. We see how important it was to the Second Season of Black Butler as Black Butler S2 did not have one, they focused too much on action scenes, fighting scenes and comedic scenes that I failed to see any real moral to this story. There were no themes such as forgiveness as the whole anime was basically about deception. Due to this and the fact it clearly did not want to teach its audience anything, it did not want to leave the audience with a scene of \u2018enlightenment\u2019 it scores a perfect 0. \\n\\n\r\nSense: 5\\n\r\nOh where do I begin with the sense of this anime, even though our questions are answered and the answers do make sense, the answers also sometimes bring arise to new and more questions which then don\u2019t make any sense. It also stays too much to its clich\u00e9d butler choice of weaponry being a knife and fork. And then there\u2019s the fact that getting skewered in the head won\u2019t kill you\u2026..but hey you\u2019re a demon so whatever.\\n\r\nAnd then there are the first 5 episodes which are just in some scenes make absolutely no sense at all, for example one scene where Claud throws a table into the air and is able to set the table with dress cloths plates knifes, spoons and forks etc. whilst the table is still into the air and then when the table hits the floor everything is glistening clean and the table is set\u2026\u2026yer I call BS.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nNot a lot changed with the music from Black Butler S1 to S2 except for the opening and endings and I actually liked the opening and ending of S2 better than that of S1. The music was very complimentary to the mood of the scene, the pitch and tone would rise and fall depending on the pace of the scene which was very nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nAlso the same as S1 of Black Butler, that being I really liked it. The characters where drawn exceptionally well and so were all the different types of scenery. Also things like water and fire where drawn really well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nFor some reason the characters of Season 2 felt duller than that of Season 1, like they were missing their backbone, they just didn\u2019t have that essence that a character needed. Everyone just felt too comedic like everything was a joke; even Ceal has a sense of comedy to him. But the thing I hated most was how much Sebastian and Claud looked alike. In some scenes I didn\u2019t know if it was Sebastian or Claud until somebody addressed them. Also we didn\u2019t get that much of a back story on each of the new characters from season 2 like we did in season 1. There was also no \u2018Old\u2019 Tanaka and \u2018New\u2019 Tanaka had a screen time of like 30 seconds. (Tanaka was basically my favorite of the servants)\\n\r\nAnd then the uncharacteristically behavior of a demon who fell in a love with a child she knew for like 20 seconds because he said thank you to the demon before she consumed his soul.\\n\\n\r\nBoredom/Captivation Scale: 7\\n\r\nDue to the fact that the anime was jam packed with both comedic and action scenes I rarely felt bored and for the most part I quite enjoyed watching it.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Score: 5\\n\r\nThe biggest let down of Black Butler Season 2 in my own opinion were the characters, even though there was no moral and that got a 0 the characters just didn\u2019t do it for me. Not only where the uncharacteristic there was also the problem of two butlers looking exactly the same. Then the was the obvious problem with it having no moral and basically saying that it doesn\u2019t want to teach its audience anything, and lastly there was the sense of the anime which was just pure average, because at times it made sense and then and times in made utter nonsense.\\n\r\nHowever I won\u2019t say I hated the anime yet I obviously didn\u2019t love it. I simply enjoyed it, it was 4 hours of my day that I don\u2019t feel I wasted, however if it was 24 episodes then that would be a different story entirely and instead of getting an average of 6 I probably would have given it a 1.\\n\r\nLastly would I recommend this anime: if you watched season 1 then yes watch season 2 to answer the questions who had from season 1, however if you haven\u2019t watched season 1\u2026\u2026..then don\u2019t watch this anime, because combining season 1 and 2 then I feel this anime would be a waste of time because season 2 doesn\u2019t completely do season 1 justice\\n\\n\r\nGenres\\n\r\nComedy: 8\\n\r\nFor 12 episodes and only 4 hours I found that were a lot of comedic references in  Season 2 of Black Butler which made it quite enjoying to watch. \\n\\n\r\nAction: 8\\n\r\nWhen there where action scenes they were always over the top and exuberant, with maids pulling tommy guns out of dresses and butlers skewering three enemies at the same time, really a nice watch.  \\n\\n\r\nMystery: 7\\n\r\nWell nobody saw that ending coming that\u2019s for sure and just because of that I gave it a 7. There were also quite a lot of other plot twists and mysteries a lot of which you won\u2019t see coming and other are just clear as day\\n",

            "content": "I really did enjoy the first season of Black Butler. If you enjoyed the first season of it, do not expect to love the second. I was expecting the same joy and thrill of enjoyment in the second season as I did the original Black Butler, but oh boy, was I in for a surprise. While the first one was a pleasant watch for all viewers, the events and eye-twitching moments in the second season left me, as I'm sure it did most people, disappointed rather than pleased. To note, I watched Black Butler Season 2 about a year ago.\r\nStory (6)\r\nUnlike the eye catching firstseason of mystery and darkness, the second season is full of events that leave the fans hating the characters that are introduced in the story. New characters Alois Trancy and Demon Butler Claude Faustus take the stage as the season's antagonists, and many times I felt like yelling at the TV screen to change the events of the story. It left me irritated, upset, and sometimes just plain bored. It's simple enough to say - there are many events in this that I wished were NOT canon, and you shouldn't take this season as seriously as the first one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for the mystery elements, those are gone as well. Honestly, some things that happen in this anime, just... ughh.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10)\\n\\n\r\nThe character design was just as flawless, the new demon Butler Claude Faustus as beautiful as demon enemy Sebastian Michaelis and Alois Trancy quite a stunning boy for his age. The animation is just as smooth as it was in the first season, despite some times it would fall just a slip out of line. For the most part, the graphics retained a beautiful appearance and wonderful theme, matching the Victorian London as well as it did in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8)\\n\\n\r\nI found there to be a significant drop in the Victorian music in the second season of Black Butler, as well as entertaining sound effects. The quality of the sound dropped so much between the two I begin to wonder if the anime took place in Victorian London anymore (Not really). What had me so captivated in the first season was gone in the next one. Shame.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7)\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to focus on Season 1 characters, since they make Black Butler as beautiful as it is. This focuses on Season 2 characters, who are incredibly dull and annoying at times, but often relatable and sympathetic. At specific times. Alois Trancy is the perky and often annoying 14 year who also runs a demon Butler estate, but instead, he has 5 demons instead of 1. He has incredible passion for his Butler, Claude, and mistreats the others because of this passion and obsession. Ok... But Claude Faustus is such an unlikeable character in the end of this anime that I honestly don't see HOW I tolerate him other than those beautiful spectacles on his head. The other characters are pretty minor. It involves the other Demon Butlers that work for Alois Trancy. They're pretty boring and aren't too major.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7)\\n\\n\r\nThere are many times I enjoyed this, and many times I didn't. Several parts made me want to throw my body off a cliff and wonder why the anime creators went this road. Several parts of this season are going to have you grinding your teeth in frustration, nails digging into your chair with anger, and eyes narrowed with hatred for Claude Faustus and what an absolute douche-bag he is. Then there are the good parts with Sebastian and Ciel, and your life is finally set complete again... until the real ending, and then you're glad you have Book of Circus and Murder to watch to get the bad ending out of your mouth and refresh your view on Black Butler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is good, but if you are a fan of how the original turned out, you probably are going to want to enter this anime with caution, at best. The ending is going to be so rough for the people who want to see it end in a... better shade of light, even if this anime is one of the darker ones when it comes to the story. So go ahead and finish up your next season of Kuroshitsuji, but be weary as it will probably make you see dreams in your sleep about a different ending... a better ending... than what Kuroshitsuji season 2 gave you.",

They haven't gained any new character development as the season changed. The sad thing is that it almost appears that Alois is the one with the most character development, and he's not even a likable character through anything but pity over his constant rejections from Claude. \r\nThe story was definitelyimproved from the first season, although I am aware that the second season was an original plot that was not part of the manga. It had more depth (although sadly, as I mentioned, the characters failed to match the depth of the story itself) and was vastly entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, when problems with the first season were taken away, this season gained new problems.\\n\\n\r\nSeason two was an explosion of fanservice, from Alois's implied sexual obsession to the obvious Sebastian x Ciel scenes. (I love Sebastian x Ciel, and I am aware it's still kind of obvious later, but this season seems to be something else.) \\n\\n\r\nAnd here's the other problem. Around halfway through the season, things started getting really confusing, and by the end things didn't make sense at all. After thinking things through repeatedly and re-watching a few episodes I understood what was going on, but it was still strange how things slowly began making no sense. Sebastian and Claude's quarrel messed things up because every aspect of it was constantly changing, Claude couldn't seem to decide what (or who) he wanted, and Alois was constantly having dramatically dangerous mood swings and also couldn't decide what or who he wanted.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, season two was still a lot better than season one, and I'm glad I watched it. But everything has its flaws.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II is unfortunate - the best way to describe it. Stellar animation and sound can't make up for the poor plot line and bad characters. I won't address this as a sequel to the first season, but as it's own because I still want to make this fair. \r\nUnfortunately, it falls very flat for me. Much like the second half of the first season, the second season features no manga material, but putting that aside, it lacks everywhere. We're introduced to a new demon/master pair, Alois Trancy, and Claude Faustus. Immediately, we see Alois has had a not so great past featuring some pedophilia,which could have set him up to be a good, fleshed out character, but his cruelness and selfishness outshine what sympathy I could have had for him as a viewer. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike its predecessor, the second season features much more violence and blood, not that the first didn't have any, but it's different in its usage. \\n\\n\r\nA rivalry is set up between Ciel and Sebastian (the returning master/butler duo) and Alois and Claude, for a very poor reason and tries to escape the inevitable end of the series (i.e Ciel's death at the hands of Sebastian) by using a cheap fanservice tactic that could be read in a bad fanfiction. \\n\\n\r\nThe storyline is just sad - and not in the way it intends to be. The writing fell flat where it should have and the entire storyline feels ridiculous in the latter half and drags out too long. It's twelve episodes but each episode feels like a drag to get through. There was no comic relief in this season at all, making it a depressing, disturbing and sad anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I say disturbing, I mean a scantily clad fourteen-year-old teasing and making sexual advances on his butler. The entire thing just feels like such ill taste, considering the past this character has seen. \\n\\n\r\nOverrall, as Kuroshitsuji fan, I won't be going back to this season. If you like darker anime then you might like this season, but if you're looking for a sequel with the feel and atmosphere of Kuroshitsuji, I'd say give this one a pass.",

It'snice to see Sebastian finally lose. Ciel also became much more likable in this season, but Sebastian was as annoying as ever. When I started watching Black Butler, I thought that the problem would be Ciel, but the problem is Sebastian. Thankfully, there is less of Sebastian in the second season.\\n\r\nFrom a storytelling standpoint, this show is batshit insane, but I definitely respect it.

            "content": "I watched this right after I watched Black Butler and I was very hyped up and am still pretty hyped up about this anime and so I will try to keep it unbiased as possible.\r\nWarning: There might be some Spoilers.\r\nFirst, I wanna say sooobaaaahhhraaahhhhshiiiiyaaa dis anime!\r\nI found out about this anime in an anime store in Taipei, Taiwan. I was looking at a small preview of Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus, and I thought it was very interesting and it caught my attention (With the gunfighting and the guy getting owned cuz his men got taken cared of and what not) so I stayed a littlewhiles to find out what the anime was called and I found out it was Black Butler.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I returned home I journeyed upon my laptop to watch this Black Butler. What I found was a world of SUBARASHI! So after that I decided to wait for Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus, which is when I realized, they already made a Black Butler II and that Book of Circus is simple the third series, and so I quickly rushed to anime1 and watched this whole series. This plot will take you on a journey of twists and turns when you least expect it. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story:\\n\r\nAs noobie in the mystery industry, this story to me is pretty damn mind blowing and mind fuddling, that I didn't even understand what happened in the beginning. Later on as I watched on I came to understand what went on and in my mind all the mini cells that were working hard to understand finally started resting, but not for long. Anyways, unlike Black Butler, Kuroshitsuji II focuses on helping Ciel remember his revenge rather than achieving his revenge. All in all Ciel remembers his revenge and the nemesis dies! That's good right? NO! At least not good for Sebastian (Whom i deeply [no homo] love). This series is still pretty dark like Kuroshitsuji, it includes some themes of hope in a hopeless place as you can see with Alois Trancy as he forms the contract with Claude, although he had to go through some painful (ewwww) and sad obstacles to achieve it. In the end he loses his trust from everybody and no one likes him anymore, and in the middle of that hopelessness Hannah reaches out her hand to him reigniting the hope in a dark place theme again. The only people I guess who don't get hope in a bad situation are demons...\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\\n\r\nWith the art I find little faults with it, I guess you can hate the artist for Alois Trancy's Dad. I loved the opening theme song, especially the way how sebastian was walking towards Ciel in the beginning, that made me want to be a butler. Anyways I felt like the openings and endings were drawn out very well and excellently as I always watch the openings and most of the ending songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\\n\r\nI love the theme songs, as well as the animation that goes along with it as I said above. SHIVER is just one of the best opening theme songs I've heard in a while. I feel like the GazettE did a very good job in composing this song, as I feel like it fits with the animation and all. As for the sound effects, I can't find much flaws in it, they don't have any out of the ordinary awesome sound effects that add to the epic meter but it does it job just fine.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nFor the characters, well this series was much more detailed and more \"mixing\" with the characters. This time this series begins to fuddle with psychological trauma, and creepy scientist things. This time they involved much more of the love theme with Alois Trancy and his brother (the things they share in common are not really normal....). To make things brief, the character is very detailed and intricate (especially with Hannah feeling compassion for humans who viewed merely as snacks), I was very impressed when I watched this.\\n\\n\r\nMy Enjoyment:\\n\r\nReally? Really? Infinity and Beyond -Buzz Lightyear\\n",

They really should have let the series end where it did with season one. Straight forward, sad and LOGICAL. BBII made mad more times than I care to count, mainly because of how much I hated the new characters and how much they altered original characters. Ciel being the main altered personality. In season one he was a little reluctant to kill Queen Victoria. He knows killing isn't right and it bothers him a little. WELL NOT IN SEASON TWO. Now*SPOILER* he willingly shoots some random guy in the face and stabs Alios. Poor character structure and poor plot line is what made me mad through out. Now, the ending. Oh the ending was... the worst ending ever. It put a bad name on endings and anime both. *SPOILER* I mean, how come the writers cannot just let Ciel die?! He is the one character that from the very begging is supposed to die at the end. But nope. He never does. It was possibly the worst anime I have ever watched. It took 3/4 of the series to get me interested. I wish I had never learned that there was a second season.",

I was wrong. The first episode is mainly to introduce the new characters that will soon become Ciel'senemies. Our original protagonists that we all know and love soon come on screen, and when I saw Sebastian the first time in this show, it made me really happy.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nIf you've been online and seen anything about Black Butler II, you've probably seen a lot of hate towards Alois and Claude.\u00a0I thought I would end up hating them like everyone else, but the truth is, I thought they were great characters. Many people think of them as a Ciel and Sebastian 2.0, but I believed they were quite unique in their own way. I wish the show was longer because I would have really loved to see more of Alois and Claude. I feel like they were very interesting characters and it's sad that they don't get enough praise in the Black Butler fandom.\\n\\n",

But I liked it, and no worries, Ciel is still in it.\r\nStory: The story, I thought, was more interesting than the first season. A lot of people dislike the second season's story because they were just used to the first season's storyline. There are new and interesting characters. The story is a little more morbid than the first season and it doesn't have as much comedy as the first season.\r\nArt: As always, the art is beautiful. Even though the animeis categorized as shounen, the artwork is more on the shojo side. The colors are on the darker, gothic side.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music on Kuroshituji 2 is pretty much the same as the first season. It's not the mest factor to the anime but I wouldn't call it bad. As for the voice actors, they all are tolerable and fit the character's personalities. The only problem is Lizzy's voice. It's so high pitched and just.....awful D :\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The character development in this anime isn't the best and when it comes to the reapers, you practically don't know anything about them. But I found that in the second season, Alois's backround story was very interesting unlike some of the other characters in the first season. The deigns for the characters are pretty but not the most unique or detailed. But they are fun to cosplay and draw.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: This season of Kuroshitsuji wasn't as funny as the last season. It is much more dramatic. As for the fanservice, it is much more limited to the first season. Grell occasionally goes crazy over Sebastian but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I'll give it a 9 because I enjoyed it almost fully. If you are looking for a slightly more morbid anime than this is for you. Or if you are just wondering whether or not to continue on with the series form the first series than I recommend try watching it.\\n\\n\r\nHope you watch it and enjoy it. ^^",

            "content": "Okay you anime gurus. Forget being all judgmental and biased against fillers or sequels. I loved Season 1 of Kuroshitsuji, I watched it 8 years ago, but due to busy sched I only got to watch: Book of Circus, Book of Murder, OVA's and FINALLY Season II in that same order, this week, 2015, September!\r\nI was aware of the Alois arc 5 years ago but I heard it wasn't part of the manga so I avoided it until 5 hours ago and I fell in freaking-love.\r\nSo many reviews, so many opinions, so many debates going on. So basically, this Season is about another nobility andanother demon butler. Count Aloise and his Butler, Claude takes on Ciel and Sebastian with a different kind of twist. Sick reasons and twisted history.\\n\\n\r\nIt's 5 am and I can't resist a review. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime and its animation can't be missed. At 2015, that kind of delicate, high quality animation can't be seen anymore and even at the time it was made, was an absolute diamond. Okay, so, your mind will experience a roller-coaster ride, from 100% ridiculous, non-logical, crazy humor to 100% sick, twisted, genius- that alone is enough. I understand why the author's editor made her avoid writing it in yaoi- the plot: A demon butler serves a master whose soul he's waiting to devour, in return for his loyalty and  obedience to his master's every whim and desire, that plot is rich at its best. I've got a major pet peeve of manga/japanese works using English in a weird way but I got over it since the story and art, and animation, were all very stellar.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it made me lose sleep, the art is tdf, which makes me rate it a 9! \\n",

            "content": "I'm really split after watching Kuroshitsuji/Black Butler II. After watching the first few episodes, I was really pleased with the story, not understanding how anyone could be unhappy with the sequel. But now, after watching all of it, I'm not so sure... \r\nLets get it straight, the art is just as perfectly beautiful as the original, the sound a little less interesting, yet fitting. All the technical stuff is just as the first season. But I am unhappy with the ending. My first thought after watching the last episode was: \"I wish I hadn't watched it\". Because as joyful as it was to get towatch more of the anime, just as unsatisfied it left me feeling. When I had watched the first season, I was ecstatic. The ending had my heart racing. It was surprisingly creepy, exactly as I wanted it. I felt some kind of pleasant unease. But now, having watched season 2 as well, I don't even feel like watching more (In a bad way - I think a good anime should leave you hungering for more, yet without any unanswered questions). So I guess my advise is: If you are satisfied with the ending of the first season, don't watch the second. Let the satisfaction settle and be pleased with that ending. You can always watch the second season later. I'm going to watch the last episode of season one again - maybe I'll forget the confusing sequel.",

            "content": "I may be among the only ones to prefer the second season above the first.\r\nTrue, it wasn't a sequel. True, it did not follow the manga. True, it had many cliches. True, it downplayed many elements that most loved from the first.\r\nBut I still much preferred it. I'm a fan of the darker side of this kind of story, of the tragedy. And while it's always been there in Kuroshitsuji, II was tear-inducing. No matter how narmy it got.\r\nThe art was different from the first, something I didn't appreciate at the beginning. I had been used, at that point, to the gorgeous and well-animated firstseason, from which II came as a slight disappointment. But in the end, it was unnoticable. \\n\\n\r\nThe music in this season was gorgeous, like in the first, but A Slightly Chipped Full Moon with all its bad English still has me in tears.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the thing. More specifically, Alois was the thing. Alois isn't a revelation in characterisation. His character arouses disgust and pity in almost everyone, but there's something deeper there that's even more tragic than Ciel's character. Ciel's been through a lot of the same stuff as Alois, down to the defilement issue, but Alois reacted in such a different way to being broken that his character has much more impact on me than... practically any other character I've encountered (with two exceptions - Peter Pan and Jack Vessalius from Pandora Hearts).\\n\\n\r\nI can't explain it. But there's something here that the first season doesn't have. This is the season where the horror of selling your soul to a demon comes in - this season is darker, more mature, and in the end more poignant. I highly reccomend it, even (especially, perhaps? I'm not a fan of the comedy in the first series) without previous knowledge of the series.",

Firstly the plot is so half assed and genuinely unneeded that it makes you wonder if they just decided too churn thisout too get that kuro-cash, secondly it actually made me hate the characters whereas before i had kept a level of love and hate between sebastian and ciel because they both had their redeeming and awful qualities but this season just made them both hit the shitter.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly this is its only redeeming factor, its OVA's. The OVA's and the amusing appearances of the reapers is all that saved this anime for me (and also some parts were so bad it became amusing), but because even the OVA's and the season isnt canon there isn't really much point in watching it except for mild entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah watch the OVA's but not the whole season the new characters were unlikable and sebastian got nerfed.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

            "content": "I had very mixed feelings when I was told about this anime, thinking \"How could they continue something that ended so perfectly?\" and I had very mixed feelings watching it. I was happy to see some of my favourite characters return (God Bless Grell), but I was also upset to see the story I had enjoyed and the ending I loved be so heavily messed up. I'm going to explain the good and bad of this anime, and leave it up to the reader on their own personal preference.\r\nStory: The story in this was at times great, but those were only for a few moments.As an overall it was fairly mediocre, some events happen with characters I didn't care about and I found myself slowly getting less and less invested in the story until I reached the end and contemplated throwing my computer out a window. This is getting a 6/10, purely because of its good moments boosting it's score.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in this season was of similar quality to the last, although it was less pretty at times, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I really liked Shiver as an OP, and the rest of the OST was okay from what I recall of it, nothing to write home about but still not horrible, 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I'm giving characters a 6/10, the new additions appeared to be quite shallow and nothing about them seemed that unique from things I've seen before in this anime, they just did a slight swap and contrast of Ciel and Sebastian, nothing original. They also ruined what I liked about Ciel in this season, Sebastian was not as good as he had been in the similar season, losing some of his suaveness that made him \"one hell of a butler\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10. This is more from just averaging out the others, but I don't believe it deserves anything lower than a 7. I twas unfortunate in a lot of ways, but it was an original creation and a sequel to something that was already perfected, so it could only really go downhill in the eyes of fans.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: In total, I believe that this was worth watching once, but definitely not anymore than that, unless you really enjoyed it, or are just a diehard fan (even though most diehard fans prefer to pretend this doesn't exist). I'm giving this an overall score of 7/10.",

            "content": "When I first heard about Kuroshitsuji, I was intrigued by the idea of a human signing a contract with a demon. The original Kuroshitsuji kept me very happy and entertained, and I really got into it. I remember crying like a baby at the end, because it was just so beautiful. That being said, when I learned they made a part two, I was a bit confused. How could they continue the story when it had all just ended so blatantly? Needless to say, I was wary when I started watching this. I'll have to admit, I wasn't impressed at all with the first coupleepisodes. I absolutely hated Alois and Claude, thinking of them as a disgrace to the whole idea of Kuroshitsuji. Luckily, Sebastian came and saved the day, and I knew that this one would be tolerable if Sebas-chan was there. The first couple episodes were indeed a bit rocky, many mysterious things were happening and I just didn't understand it. Supposedly dead characters were alive, Ciel seemed to have no memory of anything at all, and there was something completely mysterious about Claude and Alois. Even if I didn't like them, I wanted to know more. The whole anime keeps you in suspense, just begging the characters to reveal to you what happened, and why everything that is happening now is happening. I was a bit annoyed with the fact that I, as a viewer, was kept in the dark with what was going on, but it all was revealed in good time, and that was absolutely brilliant. I couldn't wait to get home so I could finish watching the last six episodes today. Everything was cleared up for me, and it all made sense at the end. It kept you wondering up until the final episode, the last five minutes, which is brilliant. Plus, everything was unexpected and the story was very unpredictable, right up until the end. I must admit, I wasn't entirely impressed by the ending, but I loved it nonetheless. It was just as beautiful as the ending to the first season, even if it didn't end up making me cry. That unexpected and slightly annoying ending just left me speechless. Even now, I still can't find the words to describe what I feel, and what I was feeling, upon viewing the last five minutes of that show. I can honestly say that although I found this second season unnecessary, it was very enjoyable to watch. The sound and art were amazing, as usual, and character development wasn't too lacking. There were a few characters that I could've known more about, and Alois's past is still left in somewhat of a mystery, but it didn't take away from the story not knowing.\\n\r\nBrilliant show, 10/10.",

            "content": "I can't say that I didn't enjoy it, but I really couldn't put my finger on how I felt, exactly.\r\nAt the beginning, I was very frustrated, because they made it seem like my favorite character, Ciel, was not going to be included, and introduces this bratty, annoying, reckless kid that also made a contract with a demon, Alois Trancy. He certainly was special...\r\nDeeper into the series, they explained him a little more and depending on how you see what he's been through, you may or may not start to pity him. I thought that yes, he had a very very tragic past, but it doesn'tcompletely excuse his behavior. And so he is part of the reason that I rate the characters a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was still as impressive as the first seasons. The GazettE is a personal favorite and I enjoyed \"SHIVER\" for the opening. \\n\\n\r\nArt style and animation is still wonderful, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story an 8 and I'm debating if it's worth it or not, or maybe worth more. the thing about this anime is that it doesn't really have a clear and reasonable explanation on why exactly the following events happen. You'll know what I mean once they introduce why exactly Ciel is back.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not that I wasn't happy that Ciel was back, I truly was since he is my favorite, my issue is that, it didn't really make sense. I actually would not have been fine if it just ended the way Season I did, but I'm not completely satisfied with this, either. \\n\\n\r\nI don't know. It's complicated.\\n\\n\r\nI would have just preffered if they had continued with what happened in the Manga for Season II. This is kinda of like a Filler Season, I guess. They just made their own thing, but I think that they should have sticked with the original. \\n\\n\r\nOther than some issues, I did enjoy this anime and I would recommend that, once you watch Season I, you watch this as well. It still has answers and a conclusion and so it wont hurt (That much, at the most) so check it out ^-^",

            "content": "In my very opinion Kuroshitsuji did not need a sequel. What happens here is not related to the the first season at all. In the first episode I was was like, \"What the heck, this does not include the original characters in the beginning.\" As I went on watching the story progressed Sebastian and Ciel are back into the story, not like as it started in the first episode.\nCharacters\nThe story starts out with new characters you have know idea about. Unless you read summaries and heard from your friends, you already know about the different characters. They introduce Alois Trancy and his butler Claude. Justlike Sebastian and Ciel, Claude is a demon, Alois he's also the \"son\" of a rich father. It hints that he may have been adopted. Not like I'm sure about it. Alois is like a spoiled brat. I know his only family was killed and all, but he doesn't need to act like that. Ciel had the same thing happen to him, he's not like that. Sebastian shows his protectiveness of Ciel toward the end of the series, which is a bit cute, in my opinion. Claude....he creeped me out man!! Personally I do not like the new characters. I'll give it a 6\\n\\n\nStory\\n\nThe story wasn't bad, nor was it good. It basically was leisure time spent. The story does not drag you in as the first one. It basically revolves around the fight between Claude and Sebastian over Ciel's soul. With Alois in between. I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll keep it at that. I give it a 7. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first one.\\n\\n\nArt\\n\nAs usual the art is really good. Detailed and all that stuff. I give it a 10. Not much to say here.\\n\\n\nSound\\n\nThe OP I really like, just I can't find it without the sound being blocked. Geez Youtube. The ending kind of ruins the mood of the seriousness of the episode. It's like calm and I just couldn't get used to it. I'll give it a 7.\\n\\n\nEnjoyment\\n\nTell you the truth it wasn't bad, but since they made a 2nd season, I'd prefer it to have different plot, or just follow the manga with some filler episodes from the start of the entire anime series, 1st and 2nd season. But we are stuck with what we have. I enjoyed bits and pieces. It had its small humor. The dark tone of the series. It spent my leisure time (most of it) and sometimes I was like \"Awww\" or \"WTF!!!\" or \"Eh.\" Lots of mixed emotions. I give it a 7.\\n\\n\nOverall\\n\nIt continues from the 1st season, but some may not like the story line. I'm in the middle. If you are satisfied with the 1st season's ending, I recommend that you don't watch the ending of the 2nd one. The ending just made me like \"WTF JUST HAPPENED!!!\" So if you are the one to on a rage on a ending that you don't like. Don't watch this during the night when everyone in your house is asleep, because you are going to wake them up, and possibly the neighborhood. Go on and watch if you are curious, but if you aren't then just skip it. All I give it overall is a 7.\\n",

            "content": "This show is somewhat different from Kuroshitsuju I: it has a more continuous plot than the previous installment, and it offers a conflict that is almost internal instead of introducing a \"global\" supervillain that everybody fights. I can see why some people might dislike the second installment, and likewise why some might like it more. They're different enough.\r\nIt must be noted that despite Kuroshitsuji II not following the manga at all, the plot was written by the original mangaka. As well as new characters, which were created by her. So if you get an instant turn-off when you hear about some anime not following themanga, don't get discouraged about this one: a spin-off it may be, but it was created by the same mangaka.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT:\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of the show consists of a few disjointed episodes at first, followed by the rest of the episodes neatly linked to each other by a continuous plot. The very first episode introduce us to new characters, and the goal of the second and third ones are to confuse the viewer, I believe (in the best meaning of the word, as in presenting a mystery). I'm not sure if it was a great idea, as some members of the audience might lose their patience and decide that \"mystery\" is no mystery but simply a lazily thought out occurence with many unexplained holes. However, the mystery unravels gradually, and by the 5th or 6th episode the confusion dissipates.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that the story focuses on what makes a soul tasty to a demon, the question that gets explored during a row of adventures (or should I say misfortunes?) that feature quite a few unexpected plot twists along the way. We get to see a little about how demons think and what they really want, although demons in this story can have different preferences and even switch between them. I liked the part about preferences: after all, otherwise the story would be teaching everybody to be a certain way and calling it \"right\". Yes, it would be \"right\" only to demons, however, the admiration shown by them to certain character traits isn't alien to us human beings at all. It's easy to agree with the demons, and I think it would be unfair and wrong in many ways. In the end, you're the one to decide what you like and whether the demons had a weird taste or were right.\\n\\n\r\nConveniences that help the plot move along that I complained about in Kuroshitsuji I are gone in this series, now everything is quite logical, if logical is a word that can be applied to such an anime :) The only thing I could issue a very minor complaint about is some pointless fanservice introduced. I don't mean beautiful clothes or poses, it's all right, but there's some heavier fanservice involved and it goes nowhere. I would love such things to death if they actually went somewhere and got woven into the plot, but total pointlessness of them was killing me. However, I believe that many viewers will love them for being present. And let's face it, the show features underage characters, it would be unlawful if anything clearly went anywhere :)\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable thing is that this time there's some fanservice included for a male part of the audience, too, however it's even more pointless than that included for a female one, and for me personally it horribly stood out because of that. At least you can think of fanservice-for-females as playing a part in the story (in some way it serves as a \"red herring\"), but the typical \"let's show huge boobs at random moments\" thing comes off as clearly pointless from the start, ruining the atmosphere at some moments.\\n\\n\r\nAnd how should I put it... I LOVED the ending! So nice, I can't stop giggling triumphantly over what I saw. A very unexpected and nice ending, although whether it's nice or cruel depends on your perspective and which character you were rooting for.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nIt's hard to write about characters without spoilers, because even mentioning some of the characters is a spoiler already. So I'll start without them and make a huge announcement before moving on to something spoilerish, so that anybody who haven't watched yet can comfortably stop reading at that moment without getting spoiled. Or not stop, if she is too curious. :) That said, those spoilerish characters are freely mentioned in many reviews, so you've probably already been spoiled about them anyway.\\n\\n\r\nAs can be seen from the cover, there are two new characters in this anime, a new boy and a new butler. They can look like bad copies at first, but just you wait. The boy is a strange one, I'd say a high-speed yandere who switches from being annoying or cruel to childishly weak at the drop of a hat. It looks a little shocking, because believe it or not, it's extremely realistic! Unlike the yanderes I've seen before, his nature is well-explored in the anime, and even in the very first episode you can see something interesting if you squint, namely, one of the motives for cruelty. That motive surprised me a lot, to be honest, there's much more to that character than merely the \"tragic past\" excuse. I would even argue that the past merely helped to shape him into being as he was instead of \"forcing\" him to be like that. But the best part of it is that he's so easy to relate to.\\n\\n\r\nThe new butler has a face of a professional poker player, however, some of his emotions are shown, too. Just enough to make things interesting and... again, confusing! It's intentional, believe me. You'll find yourself wondering what the real nature of the relationship between the two is, and that will turn out to be a very important thing in this anime. Unlike the previous installment, this one focuses on the relationship between the butler and his owner a lot, and it's not static, either, you will see it changing more than once. I personally preferred Kuroshitsuji II over I for this very reason, because I love to see characters and relationships get shown well and how they change or develop.\\n\\n\r\nMINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW NEXT (characters only)\\n\\n\r\nA few characters make a comeback in this series, or should I rather say all of them. Especially Ciel and Sebastian stand out :). They're the ones who create a mystery I was talking about in a spoiler-free beginning of the review, the mystery that you're going to be solving called \"How come Ciel isn't dead?\". Ciel's character is a little different now from the ending of the Kuroshitsuji I, or at least from my take on his character at its ending. It's sort of static now, which didn't exactly delight me, but tastes differ. On another hand Sebastian becomes more interesting in this anime than before: we get to see some of his traits that couldn't be shown earlier, his wishes and thoughts about Ciel are much more defined. And as I said, this show focuses on the relationship between the butler and his owner, that goes for Ciel and Sebastian just as much as another pair.\\n\\n\r\nART: Great as ever, although I can't help but think that Hannah could be prettier, any man in the anime is prettier than her, after all. But I won't complain much, because I care for men more anyway. :)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: I didn't pay attention, as always. But I guess it means that it was neither bad nor outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIt's impossible to predict whether you'll like it or not, but I'd say if you like characters more thoroughly explored than usual (especially villains), it's definitely your thing. Even if it's not your thing, you could like it for many other reasons.",

The characters lack the characteristics that made the first season so good.  In the first season Ciel (the main character of the first season) was a smart, strong minded and loveable kid that strived for revenge with a passion.  This season we have a kid that is arrogant and despicable and with no sense or strive for anything but for the love and acceptance of the butler.  The first episode leaves you with a lot of questions and for meat least hate for the new characters.  I really hope they do better on the second episode and hopefully unravel the mystery of the new character\u2019s revenge.",

            "content": "Story:\r\nTruth be told, I felt that the storyline was not good. I\u2019d have much rather preferred the ending of the 1st season to have been the ultimate finale. It would have left a better impression. This second season is more for very loyal fans than the odd viewer. The plot puts an unexpected twist to the 1st season\u2019s ending, and has an unexpected ending itself! Though I didn\u2019t like the main story, the ending was not so bad. Another disappointing feature of this season is the minimal appearance of some of characters from the 1st season (i.e. the Phantomhive servants \u2013 man, they were awesome!).\r\nCharacters:\r\nNewcharacter designs were impeccably done as per usual. By far, the stand-out character for me was Hanna. Not only was she hot, but her role in the story was surprisingly unpredictable. And the new butler, Claude Faustus?\u2026not so much. It might just be me, but I think his looks are fairly similar to the shinigami, William T. Spears, thus lacks originality. I didn\u2019t really like Alois Trancy. Yes, he is a pretty boy, but Ciel\u2019s still better.  The personas were developed well enough for a 12ep season.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nAnimation was per usual as well (when I say this, I mean it has the same standard as season 1\u2032s = i.e. as good). Apart from some pretty cool all-out battle scenes (that occurred at a disappointingly fast pace), there was really nothing out-there or extraordinary to note.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSame-same, though I reckon I liked the EP of season 1 more. Kalafina also sings one of the EPs for this season (they are awesome!).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe first episode wasn\u2019t too bad, but everything went downhill from there, until the last episode where, though slightly confusing, things become resolved with a likable ending. I found some scenes particularly disturbing (and unexpected\u2026). Bit of a pity really, because season 1 was so awesome and all.",

            "content": "After watching season 1 of Kuroshitsuji, I was confused as to why there would be a need for a second season as it had a pretty satisfying conclusion. But my curiosity got the best of me, and so I decided to watch season 2.\r\nHonestly, I was extremely disappointed with the outcome as the plot was mainly too convoluted and the characters were just cringe-worthy. I was hoping to see how Alois and Claude would turn out as they seemed kind of promising in the first episode, but all they managed to do was to get on my nerves.\r\nIt was rather interesting at first to seehow Claude was willing to break his contract with Alois to fight Sebastian for Ciel's soul, but what annoyed me to no end was how Alois still seemed to revere him? And don't get me started on his relationship with Hannah. Alois was very abusive to Hannah, which is evident when he gouged her eye out in the first episode, leaving me to wonder why she still tolerates his abysmal behaviour. In the end, it was because of her love for Luka that left her at the mercy of wanting to make Alois happy, just like what Luka aspired to do. But then Alois formed a contract with her, and then shit just got even more messier.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Sebastian won the duel with Claude, Alois' soul was consumed by Hannah and Ciel was brought back to life. But as a demon. Yes, a demon. Like why would you do that? It is understandable that that was done so that Sebastian can no longer consume Ciel's soul, but it also means that you sat through about 300 minutes of complete plot wastage. Lots of characters and events were underdeveloped (Abberline's brother, Lau still being alive etc) for the sake of having more screen time for Sebastian and Claude's battle for Ciel's soul, only to have neither of them consume it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nThat managed to make me pity Sebastian in the end, as you can see how hard he worked (though his intentions were purely on consuming Ciel's soul rightfully as bound by his contract with Ciel) to have been roped in as his eternal slave. His misery was clearly evident and I too felt the same discontentment at how the story turned out.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing worth mentioning was how Ciel's amnesia was hardly developed throughout the story. It was enjoyable seeing how the people around Ciel had to put on a facade and pretend the events from season 1 didn't happen, but all this was only really mentioned in 1-2+ episodes, and that was it. The rest of the time, it felt like his amnesia was only a convenience for the plot to continue. \\n\\n\r\nI implore anyone who has read this to only watch it if you want to see two attractive demon butlers fight over the soul of a very muddled boy or if you just want to waste a lot of time that would be much better spent re-watching the first season or reading the manga itself.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji 2 is the worst anime I've ever watched to completion. Not only does it completely fall flat as a sequel, it's also just poorly crafted. The story's pace all over the place, moving from intense developments to nothing happening for episodes on end. In that respect, it almost feels like 2 different shows: one is a half-assed and really boring sequel, while the other is a disturbing but kind of interesting story that is constantly interrupted by plot contrivances. Really the only strength it has is an interesting antagonist, but I feel like he would have thrived much better in a different show witha much more adult tone (something more along the lines of Berserk than a Kuro sequel). The writing is pretty abysmal, and the story's conclusion is an absolute unsatisfying mess. In my opinion, it's not worth watching. Go read the manga or watch Book of Circus.",

            "content": "I don't know what the deal is with sequels.There is just this weird habit of making a continuation of a story that was fine by itself with no request of it whatsoever. It may not be the case with this show,but like most other sequels,it taints the actual resolution and continues with a story that comes out of nowhere and doesn't live up at all to the original.This is the case with Kuroshitsuji II or Black Butler II\r\nThe first season of Black Butler was actually one of the first works of anime that I have watched and it was a fun journey overall. I likedseeing the Queen's loyal guard dog walking around with his Butler solving crimes and doing jobs.The show was epic, dramatic,funny,and chaotic at times.And then this huge scale ending comes along in which almost all of London is destroyed thus wrapping up everything and ending the story there...UNTIL season II came along reopening a wound that should've stayed closed.This story follows around a bunch of Kuroshitsuji wannabes called Elois Trancy and his butler, Claude who is also a demon and for most of the story when the Phantomhives and Trancys collide, you can't help but wonder why is this happening anyway.You can tell that this second season really did not need to happen since they put in this whole thing about Ciel losing his memory instead of ...something happening to him if you watched the end of Season one.Also, this show will definitely go down for having one of the most insufferable antagonists I have ever seen in anime,PERIOD.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI didn't pay attention to the art style too much because there was nothing to pay attention to.This was made by the same studio who did the first one so their styles and animation are similar.There are times when things are colorful and pretty much the rest of the show is really grey or just plain black(get it?).The animation is good though but its not the best that A1-Pictures had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI'm kinda torn between the two opening themes.The first season had a really good opening theme with visuals that fit with the whole gothic aspect of the show, and the second doesn't do that but still has nice visuals and a really catchy opening.But when it came to enjoyment , I think the first opening trumped over the second manly because I looked forward to watching the episode after the opening played, but there were many times in this season where the opening was the only thing I looked forward to.The OST wasn't bad either since it sounded the same in both seasons.\\n\\n\r\nHoly Crap,okay so remember when I said that this show to me had one of the most insufferable characters in an anime PERIOD?Well, I meant it! Elois Trancy is such an ass of a person.He is such a spoiled brat who thinks the whole world revolves around him.It's like he was born just to be a tribute act to Ciel.He has tragic backstory that is nothing compared to what Ciel faced as a child and somehow Ciel is more wise and clever than Elois would ever be. He is so cruel for no reason at all and takes his anger out on things when they don't go his way.There is like this duel scene between him and Ciel at a part in the show that proves he is all talk and absolutely no walk at all.When he is on the verge of death he acts like such a baby that deserves to die and it doesn't make up for all the crap that he has done.In the whole Trancy household, the only character that I like was his butler ,Claude. Claude is cool and all but he is just an offbrand version of the Sebastian that we all know in love.I mean, that will be the day when a man with glasses who can tap dance like crazy will surpass that guy who introduced Curry bread and broke up a fight with a literal deer head on him.\\n\r\nThere are also the other servants in the show,BUT they are not as interesting as the servants of the Phantomhive manor,Not by a long shot.I liked the characters from the first season though, but when these two different groups clash , things get way too unnecessary and confusing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnd then the ending came along and sotomized the story so hard that my mind tried to reject that such an ending happened and I came to a conclusion that this story DOES NOT EXIST.I feel like someone would like this show only if they want more Kuroshitsuji, but thats what Book of Circus, Book of Murder, and that other movie I haven't seen yet are there for.These extra seasons/OVA's are exactly what you need if you can't get enough of Black Butler.These stories have other stories but they don't interfere with the core story of the Phantomhives at all.They're kind of just parts in the show that did not appear in the first season because they're wasn't enough room i think.But really there is no point in watching this show since it screws up everything that was planned in the first season(as in its ending) and just adds extra screen time to the characters just to put them in the spotlight when their story was supposed to already be finished.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-5\\n\r\nTHIS SHOW DOESN'T EXIST! \\n",

            "content": "This review will contain spoilers, I advise you read this after finishing season 2. Pardon me if this review is a little messy.\r\nThis season was like a fanfiction brought to animation. One of the moments I enjoyed was the sword fight scene between Ciel and Alois, Ciel defending himself and not needing nor allowing Sebastian to intervene.\r\nThe season doesn't fit in to S1 nor does it even have a connection to it. Ciel's amnesia is confusing, as if an excuse to fit the \"continued\" story, something to somehow fit in between somewhere in S1. But it doesn't.\r\nAlois could've been a better character. There are partsof him that should've been better explained like the assumption he doesn't like women and why he treated Hannah poorly. There's no explanation as to why he treats her that way. It's more of a fill in the gaps; he treated her poorly because he probably saw women treated poorly when he was taken in as a slave. There isn't any proof to that.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also perplexing why Hannah was treated poorly until towards the end, like someone to be abused in all different ways. Why was she scared of Alois if she was an apathetic demon? She was shown to be strong and powerful, not someone that could easily be taken advantage of.\\n\\n\r\nHeck, even Sebastian's poor treatment to Grell was uncalled for.\\n\r\nAnother problem is how Grell being a transwoman wasn't addressed, ever. Her gender expression was treated like an awful gag.\\n\\n\r\nThis season was too fanservicey, a big reason it took me years to get back into the series and complete the seasons before getting to Book of Circus. Claude grew infatuated in Ciel, and Alois knew that both Claude and Sebastian loved him.\\n\\n\r\nClaude's obsession to Ciel was creepy and those fanservice moments between Ciel and Sebastian was creepy too. Sebastian's appearance is based on Ciel's dad, making that even worse.\\n\\n\r\nIt could have played better if Claude had little to no involvement. It could apply to Sebastian as well. If Alois had known sooner how much Hannah loved and cared for him rather than finding out in the end.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the elements of the series in general that captures my interest is the traumatic experiences the characters had gone and went through.\\n\\n\r\nIf they were going for a whole new thing, it would have been nice if the story focused on not only Ciel and Alois, but with Mey-Rin, Finnian, and Baldroy. Ciel and Alois had potential to become friends, giving a little taste of how they could've gotten along as seen at the final episodes. Even Finnian could've been friends with them as all three had some similar experiences.\\n\\n\r\nThis season could've done so much better.",

            "content": "Sequels are always a gamble. I can name 2 bad ones for every good one. I can name far fewer great ones. Being a huge fan of the first season of \"Black Butler\" I was more than curious to see what was in store next. After finishing, I now ask why did I- and more importantly- the creators even bother?\r\nWe are introduced to two new characters. The new demon butler Claude Faustus and his young master, Alois Trancy. Had the series been entirely about them and their story, I think I would have enjoyed it more. But when the cast of the first season showsup, not only does it take away from this second season, but the first as well. A double play of disappointment! \\n\\n\r\nThat's not to say this season is terrible- it's not. It dives into the nature of the demon butler and the contracts they make. Alois is an interesting and despicable little *bleep*. But, watching his story arch and motivations was the most interesting thing about this season. All the rest just needlessly complicated things and took away what was a great ending to Season 1. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and music are just as nice as Season 1, the other characters that are introduced are pretty forgettable minus Alois. The biggest fail is Claude, the new butler, who should have been the draw of the show. He is boring. Predictable. And just dull as dishwater. Sub vs. Dub is a win for Sub. J. Michael Tatum was the loan bright spot for the English cast. Alois' English actor, Luci Christian, seemed to be imitating Jack Wild in the film \"Oliver!\". It was effective however, the voice was like nails on a chalkboard! \\n\\n\r\nI was really, really disappointed in this season. It was unnecessary to drag in the cast from the first season and they really missed a chance to tell a new story with new characters and take a different road. The only reason I can recommend to watch this season is if you're really hungry for more \"Black Butler\" and don't care how you get it. I really wish I could make a deal with a demon to make Season 1 stand alone... Actually, after watching this season, scratch that idea. Cheers!",

            "content": "So many people were against this season when it first came out, and it was because of Alois and Claude. Hell, even I was, I love Ciel and Sebby and didnt want to see them replaced.\r\nHowever as I started watching it, I grew to love it. Alois surpassed my love for Ciel and became my favourite character, even if he is a bit gone.\r\nThis review may contain very light spoilers.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story begins with a new butler and a new \"insane\" master. Alois Trancy hurts his maid badly and Claude...does nothing. It starts dark and kind of confusing but as it progresses, questions are answersand ideas are explained.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the second episode--which shows more of Sebastian and Ciel-- is mostly filler, but it also gives more background, sort of, of what happened at the end of Season One. \\n\\n\r\nAlois and Ciel meet and there's an instant rivalry between both the butlers and the masters. Alois wants Ciel, and Ciel doesn't want Alois alive. Claude and Sebastian do their best to protect their masters from each other, but things get a bit..hairy when they form a contract with each other. As this is a huge spoiler, I will not say the reason or description of the contract.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKuroshitsuji 2's art is a bit lighter than K1's, but it still holds the dark Victorian-era style that we all loved. A few minor things-- that, depending on how much you paid attention, you may or may not notice-- were done to the characters, such as Sebastian's eyes being a darker red and Ciel's eyes being a different shade of blue. That is really the only difference though.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI can't really say much about the OPs and EDs as I skip them in every anime, but from what I heard the first time, I did enjoy them. They gave the right mood for the series and allowed people to set into the feeling  faster.\\n\\n\r\nAlois's voice had the perfect insanity level that was needed to portray a character like him, and Claude's had the right amount of monotone that held  just a bit of sadism. Ciel's and Sebastian's were up to par too, and even Grell, who is still only a minor character, had a good \"I'm afraid T_T\" voice when he needed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAlois has to be one of the most believably emotional anime characters I've ever come across, if not THE most. I felt so sorry for him, and just wanted to hug him and tell him everything would be okay when I learned about his past.\\n\\n\r\nClaude.. Gah I hated him, but he did have his good [aka humourous] moments that made him almost likeable. Especially when he got into childish fights with Sebastian.\\n\\n\r\nSebby turned a bit more childish in this series, as he had to prove he was better than Claude, but his protection over Ciel increased tenfold. He unleashes his anger/jealousy pretty rapidly in this season, but he's still got a slight hold.\\n\\n\r\nCiel..the little bitch boy XD he does nothing, really, still, except get kidnapped and become something useful for Alois. But his awesomeness/bitchiness increases at the end of the series, which is good.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the original characters-- the three Phantomhive servents, the old man, Elizabeth and her maid and a few others-- have returned but once again, they dont't do much. In fact, I think you see Elizabeth for one and a half episodes at most.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot. It was fast-paced enough, gave a bit of fanservice, and a bunch of emotion that I wish other anime would have. It did have it's bad points, but what anime doesn't? \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI would have liked a bit more but as it was, it was still highly enjoyable  and one of my favourite animes that I've seen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bit of humour, doesn't mind some obvious shounen-ai hints, and enjoyed Kuroshitsuji 1 so theyre not completely confused xD.",

The anime bring in new characters and put the old main characters in the background there still there just less present. Alois is a new character and with him is Claud his demon butler they have struck a contract much like ceil and sebastian an are for the most part polar opposites. The anime took a new approach for its sequal and have been penalized  by alot of there fans and even though i enjoyed iti still would have liked to have seen option 2. Black butler II is an action packed anime with more fights and Drama then the last. I recommend you to watch it",

Yes, Grell reappears as Sebastian's fangirl/guy. Anyways, it was very well composed and congratulations to the makers of this anime for doing such a great job on it!!! A lot of references to Ciel's past, which I LOVED!! Makes you really think about the previous season. So don't think that stuff from the first season will be forgotten. Really loved the action, not only can this be a shoujo or tragedy, it can alsobe shounen, so an anime for mixed audiences, a little gory, or should I say on about a 1-10, a 6 on the gore-o-meter. A little bit of language, which can really set a mood of anger or distress, and works well with the storyline. A must watch for otakus!!",

            "content": "We return to the world of Black Butler, to see what adventures may be continue among Sebastian and Ciel and\u2026..wait, what? Season 2 isn\u2019t just about them? They have some new characters? Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus?\r\nOK. They may not seem so bad. A good change of characters could help the show.\r\n*after watching a few episodes*\r\nOr not.\r\nIn late-nineteenth century England, one year and three months after the dramatic conclusion of the original series, Kuroshitsuji II introduces a new butler and young master. The sadistic yet cheerful Alois Trancy has faced some harsh times. He was kidnapped as a baby, and was forced to work ina village as a slave. Gradually, he lost his parents, his best friend, and everyone he knew. Alois eventually returned home and became the head of his mansion, but seemed to exhibit some strange behavior ever since. Even more curiously, he returned with Claude Faustus, an enigmatic, emotionless butler with unfathomable talent\u2026.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOK\u2026..I want to get this out of the way as soon as possible. I hate Alois Trancy. I hate him and his guts. If I was in that show, I\u2019d be the first one to kill him because he is that insufferable of a character, he\u2019s basically who I thought Ciel would\u2019ve been in the first season: A spoiled, sadistic, bratty, creepy-ass little boy and while they explain his backstory and how messed up he is, it doesn\u2019t excuse the bullshit insanity he causes throughout the series. Hell, in the first episode, he gauges Hannah\u2019s (his demon maid) eye out and he keeps torturing her throughout the series. I really felt bad for that character (Yes, I felt bad for the demon maid!!) yet she stills shows compassion for the little shit. Oh, and Claude\u2026..I take him as \u2018meh\u2019. I\u2019m not calling him the proto-Sebastian but they are sometimes I think they are match evenly, even though Claude can be a bit creepy sometimes (and that\u2019s toward Ciel). Also, I felt like the chemistry between Ciel and Sebastian lessened here than the first season, saying \u201che\u2019s nothing more than a butler\u201d. That could be him masking his true feelings but I thought we were over that already when Season 1 concluded.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story, not really that interesting but it does stick to one narrative being that Alois and Claude wants Ciel\u2019s soul and to kill Sebastian and I couldn\u2019t really care less about the story as into the 2nd episode, I was mostly like, \u201cWhat the hell happened? I thought you two weren\u2019t around anymore?\u201d but then again, after seeing Alois in the first episode, I was relieved that those two were back again and the plot doesn\u2019t linger on to those other two.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t got much to say about animation except that it is quite the same as the first season, which isn\u2019t a bad thing because the animation and art A-1 Pictures provided was stunning but I will say for character design, did they even try to not make Claude look like a clone of Sebastian? I would sometimes get confused with those two when they are on screen together or even separate.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusically, the only opening theme for the show, \u201cShiver\u201d by The Gazette was actually quite good once going into the show and I never once skipped the theme or opening sequence. The ending song, \u201cBird\u201d by Yuya Matsushita was also just okay, too and if you want to know if the Kalafina song was my favorite, then you\u2019re right because it actually was my favorite. Yes, I happen to like the group Kalafina. The music score overall was fine.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs for the dub performances, they were quite the same as the first season as J. Michael Tatum does shine again as Sebastian and Brina Palencia as Ciel but enter the two new players, Luci Christian as Alois Trancy and she does play the role of a despicable little brat very well and Jason Douglas as Claude was also very decent in his part. It does remind me of Tatum\u2019s performance but everything about Claude reminds me of Sebastian.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: Black Butler II is\u2026\u2026very much of a step down from the first season. I can see why some people did not like this season but I don\u2019t completely hate it. The writing just seems more fan fiction-like while some of the rest did stay the same and that could be for the best. It also seems for fans, this season is quite 50/50 for some of them. Some like it, others don\u2019t. Would I recommend it though? Well\u2026.maybe as a standalone or alternate universe of Black Butler maybe but not a continuation from Season 1.\\n\\n",

At first, it feels as thought the show has reached the end of the story and the rest is just lengthened to make the story continue longer as seen in many other shounen anime/manga(with the cliche ****sia). But as you keep on watching the continuation finally gives some meaning with an unprecended ending that will surely surprise you.\r\nFor those of you craving to see more of the 'ikemen' Sebastian, you'll be surprised to find yet another butler added to the crew called Claude(Just do not droll) with his annoying Master, Alois Trancy. The rest, watch ityourself, so that I do not spoil it for you.\\n\r\nIf you watched the first season and if you want to watch the whole series then I highly recommend you to watch this season too. But if you do not want to watch the whole series, you may skip this season as it is not that interesting. With the cliche type of shonen story, the plot just feels too normal with parts that you can feel are overused in anime. If you plan to watch the whole series then this season becomes indispensable as it explains a crucial thing.\\n\r\nAs a side note, do not sell your soul to a demon.",

            "content": "Kuroshitsuji II exceeded my expectations by far. To say it quickly, I was expecting crap and I got a carefully planned series, with an interesting story and captivating characters. Where season 1 made me think \"an original story could never be as good as the manga\", season 2 changed my mind to \"well, after all an original story can still be a good idea, if well made\".\r\nKuroshitsuji II is -- guess what -- the sequel of the anime Kuroshitsuji. Unlike the first season, this one is a completely original story, featuring 3 important original characters. It has nothing to do with the manga, since itstarts where the previous series ended. If you've watched Kuroshitsuji I you probably know that it's no easy feat to create a story from *that* ending. Yet they managed to do it.\\n\\n\r\nI think it's impossible to write a review without spoiling at least the second half of the first episode, but if you're a fan of Kuroshitsuji you will probably already know it, and if you aren't you won't even care. I won't spoil anything else, though.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators of this anime majorly trolled the fans 6 months before it aired. About half a year after announcing the production, they showed the first trailer of the new season at a special event (the \"Red Valentine\" event, it's available on DVD). The trailer only showed the two main original characters, Claude Faustus and Alois Trancy, and so did all the pictures and interviews that came out in the following months. All of this led the majority of the fans to believe that they would be the new main characters, substituting Sebastian and Ciel. Needless to say, the production staff and even the author of the manga received loads of harsh criticism for leaving out the fans' beloved characters from the show.\\n\\n\r\nEventually, that was not the case.\\n\r\nAs everybody realized after watching the first episode, Sebastian and Ciel (together with the rest of the cast) were still there and were still the main characters. Claude and Alois are still essential to the plot (I wouldn't call them \"villains\" though), but knowing that the characters you know and love are still there makes the new additions appear a lot less offensive. You can actually get to like them.\\n\r\nI used to think that they were just stupid clones created to reuse the \"demon butler + young master\" setting, but watching the anime you can clearly see that they have very different personalities (definitely better planned that the lame characters of season 1 if you ask me) and totally deserve to have a part in the story.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to the previous series, season 2 is half the size, being only 12 episodes. The first few episodes apparently look like fillers and you are left wondering why they are losing time even though the series is so short, but then you realize that everything -- or almost everything, at least -- has a purpose and is leading to something. Or it's just there to troll you, but that's a purpose too I guess. After these few episodes, though, you finally learn \"the truth\", which also solves most of the doubts you were having, and from that point on the series becomes fast-paced, with lots of story packed into each episode, all bringing to the final, quite shocking climax.\\n\\n\r\nI followed this series \"live\", week after week, and I must say it was extremely enjoyable. Every time you were left craving for the next episode, with the previews (the \"next episode\" previews) only serving to deceive you, since the scenes where always mounted so as to make you misunderstand what would happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, the animation is nice and smooth, the music is maybe even better than in the previous season (a special mention goes to the insert song \"Kagayaku Sora no Shijima ni wa\" by Kalafina, beautifully sad and perfect for the scenes they used it for). The seiyuu are of course the same as in season 1, with the addition of a few quite popular names to play the original characters (well-known seiyuu as Takahiro Sakurai, Nana Mizuki and Aya Hirano). The author of the manga, Yana Toboso, once again took part in the production by designing all of the clothes, original characters and even objects that appear in the series (she asked herself to do it, by the way). She also had a say in some of the decisions regarding the plot, though of course it was written by different people. It's quite obvious that they put lots of efforts into this anime, and I personally think that it shows. I realized that, as much as I love the Kuroshitsuji manga and think that it's better than the anime (story-wise), I can still appreciate a Kuroshitsuji original anime if the story and the characters are good enough.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this series is not 100% perfect (otherwise I would have given it 10). The plot holes are to blame for it. The story that we actually see is carefully planned, so the \"present\" is mostly OK. The past of some characters, however, ranges from vague to outright unknown. Some characters are there but we don't really know how they managed to be there, some characters' motives are never explained yet you would think that it's important to show why they act like they do, even though it's not necessary to bring forward the plot that we see. The series composer, Mari Okada, said in an interview that sometimes it's nice to leave some \"gaps\" that the viewers can fill in how they want, but I still would have liked to be showed a bit more of the characters' past. Also, since the anime is only 12 episodes long and many of them are very fast-paced, you have the impression that the series ended right away and it's a pity that for once that we have interesting original characters we get to see them so little.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, despite the flaws, I've really enjoyed watching this anime and I missed it after it ended. The original characters, that I used to dislike because of the creators' trolling, grew on me very quickly, to the point that I'm somewhat sad that we won't see them anymore (well, probably) and that I was disappointed at them barely showing up in the OVAs that were included with the DVDs.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Kuroshitsuji I, then I recommend Kuroshitsuji II. If you disliked the anime but like the manga, I still recommend Kuroshitsuji II. I personally think that if you adapt the manga into an anime then you have to make it faithful to it. If you don't want to make it faithful, I'd rather see something completely different than a bad adaptation of the manga. Kuroshitsuji II managed to be the latter. Do not let the original characters turn you off. Give a chance to this series, because in my opinion it's very much worth it.",
