            "content": "Shuffle! is a classic Supernatural, Harem, Romance, Comedy, Drama that feels fairly average to begin with but it&rsquo;s full of surprises as you go on. My overall score may be somewhat biased but this show is just truly amazing. ^_^\r\nThe story is just your basic harem anime as it follows a male protagonist (Rin Tsuchimi) an average high school boy who lives with his childhood friend Kaede (girl). Of course to make this a harem there are more girls included into the mix (5 in total) and not to forget the all important supernatural element to the show, by adding gods and demons to theplot. As the series begins it is your typical Rom/Com with plenty of cute and hilarious moments and heaps of casual fanservice. It is until halfway into the series that the drama kicks in, bringing forth a great deal of heartfelt moments, which will get most viewers all teary eyed and plenty of character developments.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are compelling and fun to watch as they all have something unique about them, including the guys. It&rsquo;s true that the set-up for the girls is pretty clich&eacute;d (childhood friend, eccentric, tsundere, shy girl, loli) but they all bring something special to the story. What&rsquo;s more amazing is that the male protagonist also brings a great deal to the story, including deep-rooted jealously that all us guys feel whilst watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality for Shuffle! was somewhat unique, with its own style and having subtle differences with similar anime. This allows the animation aspect of the show to excel amongst others; with amazing environments, well animated character expressions/emotions and most importantly the superb character designs. One thing I noticed is how most of the characters wear around 5-10 different outfits throughout the series, which is rarely seen in your average harem. It would be perfect but there were instances when the quality of the animation degraded. \\n\\n\r\nOn another note the music for the series was great and went well with the mood of the situations (comedy &amp; drama), nevertheless it became somewhat repetitive. At least there were some really good insert songs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Shuffle! is the epitome of what a harem romance anime should be; one guy + cute girls = a variety of romantic outcomes. The best thing about the show would have to be the characters because they are all developed incredibly well and their actions aren&rsquo;t always questionable, seeing how it suits their personality. And because the male protagonist isn&rsquo;t a worthless guy, there are numerous romances and a number of possibilities. The series managed to end well without relying on too many clich&eacute;s. So in the end this is a classic series that most romance anime fans would enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "This is going to be the shortest review I ever write, because Shuffle! is a piece of crap that doesn't deserve even 50 words describing it.  It starts out as a harem comedy, and is mildly entertaining until about the half way point, whereby it has already trapped you in its mediocrity and you are now a victim to find out what/who the (very terrible) main character eventually chooses out of all the girls.  \r\nOnce you make it past the halfway point the show devolves into a burning trainwreck that will eventually leave you with an aneurysm.  The majority of the casteventually disappears from relevance about 3/4 of the way through.  What was once a light hearted harem romp is now a ridiculous anime soap opera drama.  The main character is terrible, indecisive, and enjoys ruining other peoples lives.  Many stereotypical harem leads at least do SOMETHING for the girls in the harem - make their lives a little better, somehow.  Rin does nothing.  It is frustrating to watch him.  The only lead I can consider worse than this guy is that retard off School Days or the guy off Ichigo 100%.  Protip: Don't watch those shows either.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are just as frustrating.  Their motivations for liking the guy are pretty bland and basic - one of them has a more solid reason that is touched on towards the end of the show.  But the girls are unbelievable.  They get rejected and cling until the end of the show.  All their worries and development is washed away by the finale.  They each love the main character because he is 'kind' although to the viewer he is very obviously a loser.\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy ecchi?  I guess you might enjoy Shuffle.  The sluttiness in this show is laser guided.  Whether it's an alternate personality, little sister character with see-through top or crazy ass yandere that just wants to bang, there's a different girl for every taste.  There are better harems out there though.  Like if it has \"harem\" listed as a genre it is probably a better show.\\n\\n\r\nYea, I'm done.  Fuck you, Shuffle!",

The story of 6 lives, filled with jealousy & hope as well as with hope & joy.\r\nAt first I was hesitating to watch this series but it provided a lot of fun for me. The story didn't become boring either due to the fact that you get to know more and more of everyone's personality, character and history.\r\n:: Story ::\r\nWhen I read about this series and noticed that Gods and Demons play a roll in such a rather typical human environment like school life, I was doubting if I would enjoy watching it. But Idid. And that's because the story line is not just a straight line from the beginning to the end. There were moments I was surprised about, moments I laughed my butt off, and moments I couldn't really believe what I saw and heard. If you aren't too biased about the scheme you will enjoy the story, I'm sure. It's simply not an action packed anime. Rather a calm and funny one. Yet, you might find yourself surprised sometimes - just like I did.\\n\r\n~8 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Animation ::\\n\r\nIt's simply beautiful. The Characters, the environment, little details like water and leaves look great as well. Very nice art.\\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Sound ::\\n\r\nHaha~. Certain Character's ways of speaking still put a smile on my face. There's not much to say about sound - I didn't have the impression that there was anything that sounded not like it's supposed to.\\n\r\n~8 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Character ::\\n\r\nEach Character is different. They are all beautiful and have their ups and downs. \\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Enjoyment ::\\n\r\nI would have dropped it if I didn't enjoy it. But instead, I enjoyed every single episode and was always looking forward to watching the next one.  This anime will get a special place in my collection - but maybe that's just because I'm into these kind of shows.\\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Overall ::\\n\r\nAs I said, this anime is special to me. I'm really glad I decided to watch it and will surely check out the 'sequel' -\"Shuffle! Memories\"- as well.\\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n*I know it's a rather short review, but it's also my first one so bear with me. I'll do my best to write better ones in the future.*",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nI can't begin to explain how much disliked this anime. I guess It's your typical passive male character (who is beyond daft) surrounded by senseless females that throw themselves at him for ridiculous (and quite unimportant) reasons. It drove me nuts. \r\nI kept watching this anime because my friend insisted 'it gets better!'. I watched until the end ... and lets just say that the ending pretty much just spirals down into the most outrageous and pathetic ending i've ever seen. \r\nThe good: \r\n- Primula is an adorable character \r\n- The character design was pretty and the animation good. \r\nI'm sorry there'snothing else good about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\r\n- The main character is by far the worst part of this anime. If this is the kind of guy girls want... or the kind of guy other guys aspire to be... there is no hope for the human race. How hard is it to say 'hey! i'm not interested'... but nooo hes like 'i dont know how to express myself to i'm going to just let everyone believe i love them so we can be one happy family.'\\n\r\n-The ending (i cant go into detail because of the no spoilers.. but the last couple of episodes were painful to watch... it was like 'bad, bad, bad, happy ending (wait wut, how can this have a happy ending?')\\n\r\n- The girls... they just won't get a clue... I mean seriously. 'i will go on loving you with the hope you'll love me someday...' \\n\r\n- Kaede is also painful to watch... I guess some guys like their girls passive and easy to walk all over but it's not my cup of tea. \\n\r\n- Suicide attempt scene. I will say no more. \\n\r\n- ok with the gods and demons thing... but the sudden surprise about magic girl? it just came out of the blue and seemed to be thrown in there at the last minute to be able to give this anime an ending (and thank god it ended.)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Originality in harem anime is an oxymoron. It simply doesn't exist anymore nor will it ever exist again. Shuffle! is the same, but despite all odds, it manages to put a few chinks in the chain of mediocrity with some suprirsing twists.\r\nUnfortunately for potential viewers, Shuffle's raison d'etre won't make it's presence known until a little more than halfway into the series. Until then, enjoy a plauge of mindless expositional filler, all for the sake of seeing under every girl's skirt. Yes, even the loli's. This curse comes with a gift though in that the series progresses with an ambiguous nature toward who our haplessharem hero will eventually end up with. Then, when the twists kick in the series manages to redeem the crap it's put you through up to then. That is, unless you're already fed up with it. In which case, it won't matter much. \\n\\n\r\nThis relatively bland narrative is naturally helmed by a gaggle of too-good-to-be-true jailbait. While some of the girls are somewhat interesting (especially when you know everything about them), they are for the most part harem stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing spectacular. Being standard harem fare, it's only right the animation be mediocre as well. It's rough and choppy in places where a lot of action occurs, which tends to make some of the best scenes rather ugly. My biggest concerns though are the backgrounds. They look like standard H-game background frames. No attempt at being anything other than mediocre here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty lackluster as well, like it took about an hour and a half to compose and it was all recorded through a synthesizer.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely not a must-see but there were definitely points that made me feel like what I was watching wasn't an entire waste of my time. Since Shuffle!, all generic harems are following its lead and attempting some dark twists to make them more interesting. If you're in it for the dark twists, it's worth a look. But if you're in it for panty shots, you're more likely to come out a little happier than others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Shuffle! a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "I just had to write a review on how disappointment I was in the time i wasted on Shuffle!\r\nStory - 1\r\nSome out there (like the small amount of posts on the forum) seem to have liked the story.. But seriously it is so full of plot holes and terrible planning I can't begin to explain. Some of you have actually seen this may see this as a total hate, but honestly it isn't. The beginning episodes got me into the show - and I really only stayed for the humor and the princesses (I liked there personalities - they were a little too overcharged emotionallybut they had nice differences). Sadly the humor completely dies off - no real reason (The hilarious fan clubs just stop..).\\n\\n\r\nThe story arcs are sadly very underused. There was honestly so much potential that could have been utilized in the story... instead it's all wasted on stupid emotional charges and of course the large amount of echii (I'd be lieing if I said I hated Echii -_^). I could go on and on.. but seriously it's not worth the time waste.. there are so many plot holes where characters disappear as if they died and later resurrect, and without spoiling anything, IT JUST MAKES NO FREAKING SENSE!.\\n\\n\r\nArt- It was pretty well done, it never bothered me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music was so-so, it helped at some parts that were too overcharged with fake emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The main character is awful, he is just the single worst Anime character I have ever come across. He has literally no personality, they make you believe he might gain some, but never does, instead to me he is a total jerk. If you somehow decide to watch this - you will quickly realize that. That said, it managed to gain a 5 because the girl characters all had fairly different personalities. While a certain someone is my least liked of the girls - ahh s - it was still not too bad. The princesses are appealing in the sense of who they actually are - not the pathetically crafted love for Rin. \\n\\n\r\nPrimula (what a terrible name) is easily one of the most adorable/lovable anime characters I have run across... it's just something about her that would make one want to do anything to protect her. She is honestly the only TRULY bright light of wasting time on Shuffle!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - First 10 eps or so were pretty enjoyable for the comedy.. which is sadly what got me to continue watching hoping it would return in full force.. It's obvious my stance. The rest of the eps become so pathetically overcharged with fake emotions, story lines and ridiculous drama, so ridiculous I view it as a really lame joke.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1. I understand a 1 really isn't all that fair, I truly do. However the amount of plot holes, missing dialogues, fake emotions, ridiculous drama, terrible main character and numerous other flaws have led me to hate this so much as to be the worst Anime I've ever watched. Given my rage is a little reflected from wanting it to be good - I guess thats a redeeming quality. However I don't play into the \"Oh for being based off a H-Game its pretty good\" is just weak. Honestly I just hope I save at least one person from wasting time on this. Please do not understand my review as being subjective - Unless you're really itching for some heavy Echii (Yes, Nudity and explicit shots are aplenty - pointless even) then move on... just move on.",

            "content": "This is a review for the first volume (disc) of Shuffle! It was so bad that I just had to say something about it, so here it is. :P  there are spoilers BUT you will be warned before i get to them\r\n- Story -\r\nThis anime is about a regular Japanese high school boy who lives with a girl who is his childhood friend in his house. I'm not even going to mention their names because that is how forgettable they are...\r\nShe makes food for him every day and has been doing this since they were kids it seems. The twist to this show isthat Heaven and Hell have connected to our mortal realm in the middle, and now people from heaven and hell are immigrating to our dimension. The only visual aspect of these other-worldly beings is their ears (they don\u2019t have clich\u00e9s like horns or wings). People from Heaven have pointy ears that point up, and people from Hell have longer pointy ears that hang down. Surprisingly the people from heaven don\u2019t act like goody-goodies and the people from hell don\u2019t act evil, they all act like any normal human. They do have magic powers, but this is only shown once in disc 1. The theme of this whole Heaven-and-Hell thing is barely involved in the first episodes, and becomes quickly irrelevant. I do not know if it\u2019s supposed to be subtle or if this is just a lazy move, but it\u2019s leaves me wondering why they even bothered to put it in the plot in the first place if the creators won\u2019t even use this plot device. You won't even get to see what Heaven or Hell looks like (at least for the first 4 episodes), nor will you see anything super-natural except for pointy ears and 1 magical attack (at least for the first 4 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nThe main ''protagonist'' boy gets two new neighbors: God and Lucifer. God and Lucifer act like normal people and are even good friends. They both have an only-child-daughter. The daughter of God and the daughter of Lucifer have encountered the main character boy on one occasion  when they were all very little. The guy was kind to them one time, and they\u2019ve both had a crush on him ever since. Now God and Lucifer are offering the guy their daughters to marry him so that he may become the next king of either Hell or Heaven, and so he is stuck with this choice of which girl he wants to be with. There is also a very little girl who has come to Earth from Hell. This little girl named Prim has heard all about how nice the guy was (one time) to Lucifer\u2019s daughter, so she likes him too. However, he completely ignores this huge choice he has to make, and decides to try to live his life normally. He gets annoyed when anything interferes with his normal life.  He's kind of a jerk.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy doesn\u2019t seem all that interested in girls. He\u2019s got something like 5 girls who want him but he doesn\u2019t care at all. He has no interest in girls. I swear something is wrong with him. His super-perverted friend is envious of his position.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that bother me about this anime\u2026 One thing that bothers me about Shuffle! is that the main character guy is portrayed by the director as a \u2018nice guy\u2019, but he expects the girl he lives with to cook for him everyday and a whole bunch of other stuff, and she obeys. If she doesn\u2019t do a good job then she feels guilty and he is disappointed. At one point he thinks to himself something along the lines of, \u201cI feel kind of bad not helping her out with the housework and cooking\u2026,\u201d but instead he decides to continue sitting on the couch (literally). That is the only single moment he even considers helping her out with stuff. I think she even cleans his whole freakin house.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea why these girls like this guy besides him being nice to them 1 time years ago, and the fact that he looks like every average anime boy.  He has no skills, no hobbies, no interesting past, no talents; he's just a guy.  That's the only way I can describe him; just a guy.  Perhaps he has no traits because the creators of the show wanted a blank slate that male viewers can use to feel ''in-the-show'', but the reason why the girls want him still eludes me....\\n\\n\r\nWhoever made this show has a twisted perspective of the world, and thinks that what defines a ''nice guy'' is a guy who looks average, acts average, has no brains, expects women to do his bidding and [SPOILERS] is allowed to punch his best friend in the gut with all his might (really happens in first episode).\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS]  Let me elaborate on that ''punching'' thing. The guy and girl are walking to school. The guy opens the door to the classroom and his best friend jumps out and embraces the guy, thinking he is the girl as he shouts her name. The guy then punches his best friend in the gut with a great amount of force as a shock-wave can be heard and seen votrexing out from his best friend's back. This is portrayed as a comic relief, but I wasn't laughing... Anyways...\\n\\n\r\nSince this guy has so many girls wanting him, there are armies of perverted creeps who are jealous of him. I\u2019m not exaggerating, there are literally hundreds of perverted guys who stalk him and try to abduct him and/or kill him in mob-formation, and they insult him every chance they get. They come out to ambush him at his school and in the streets, and chase him. They are in stereotypical \u2018manly\u2019 groups like jocks or delinquents, etc. They are in every episode I\u2019ve seen and they freak me out. They also stalk the girls once in a while, peeking up the skirt of Lucifer\u2019s daughter at one point. This makes me sick. They are drawn with ugly faces and creepy expressions.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls don\u2019t seem to mind the competition of one-another, as if this guy is soooo great that he is worth the self-esteem they have to put aside for him.  [SPOILER YOU SHOULD READ] One episode is about a picnic that the group is planning. The girls all want to cook a meal to impress the guy. However, the daughter of the Devil doesn\u2019t know how to cook and is feeling worthless. The guy tries to reassure her, but instead of saying something encouraging like \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s the thought that counts,\u201d or, \u201cI don\u2019t need a fancy meal or material objects to know that you care about me,\u201d instead he says something along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make a great meal for me.\u201d He says this with a smile. I was like, wtf? What an ass. And so they have their picnic and he expects to eat all the girls\u2019 food that they made for him.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the only things I liked about this show was [SPOILERS] the comic relief that the daughter of God brings to the show. Whenever God says embarrassing things about his daughter, she somehow appears behind him with the nearest heavy/sharp object and hits him over the head with it, knocking him out. She then drags him home. I thought this was hilarious.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Art Style -\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 faces are drawn in a subtlety unique style that I have not seen before. For example, the girls in Air TV and Kanon have an identical style to how their faces are drawn, but I have not seen the faces of Shuffle! anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is average, meaning it\u2019s not so great that I noticed it, but it\u2019s not so bad that I noticed it either. It\u2019s meh.  Nothing to note here in animation quality, background paintings or graphic quality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Final Score -\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely shallow, the girls are dumb and the main character guy is a free-loading jerk. He doesn\u2019t do anything to make him a jerk, but it\u2019s what he Doesn\u2019t do: he doesn\u2019t care about the girls almost at all; he doesn\u2019t feel guilt for not helping the girls with things like housework or food preparation or hurting their feelings; and he doesn\u2019t show any sincere compassion or deep thoughts (this guy\u2019s head is totally empty). The story is just about a bunch of girls wanting some guy who was nice to them on 1 occasion, years prior. The whole Heaven and Hell thing barely exists in the story in the beginning, and is completely unimportant after a few episodes. If you want to see hot anime chicks then by all means watch it, but that\u2019s all this anime is: hot anime chicks, nothing more or less. [Shuffle! in a nutshell: a bunch of girls like some guy and he doesn\u2019t care, and they don't care that he doesn't care.]\\n\\n\r\nWorst of all (and the thing that horrifies me the most) is that this show takes itself seriously!\\n\\n\r\nFor the unique cute faces of the girls and the comic relief of God\u2019s daughter, I can only give this anime a Horrible score of 1/10 (a generous score imo).  Those are the only things keeping me from giving this 0/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a female with self-respect, or if you're a male who respects females, I would NOT recommend this anime for you.  On the contrary, I'd tell you to stay away from it.  It's grotesque. It's disgusting.  It's degenerate. I hate to offend fans of this show but it's hard to deny what the show is trying to impose on its audience, which is ''Women belong in the kitchen.''  If you're into that, regardless of your gender, then by all means, don't let my review dampen your spirits.  It's just my (strong) opinion :P\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're a female who wants to cook, clean, etc. for your man who doesn't show you any affection, or if you're a male who thinks females should cook, clean, etc. for you without any obligation, then this anime is Definitely for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGranted, I only reviewed episodes 1-4 so there might be things in later episodes that contradict my review, but come on, the first episodes were a hugely distasteful first impression, and 4 episodes goes beyond giving the benefit of the doubt.  This show has told me what it's about and I'm dropping it.  It got it's chance, and I even gave it the benefit of the doubt by going all the way to episode 4.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's shows like Shuffle! that give anime a bad name, and allows mainstream media to politically attack otaku culture as vulgar and in poor moral taste.",

            "content": "Shuffle is a harem anime with a mix of Angels and Demons, that really peaks ones interests... at first.\r\nThe anime starts off innocently enough, theres the required single male character, and a plethora of female leads who all want him to be theirs. Typical Harem stuff. One of the girls is a childhood friend, one is a mutual friend of him and the childhood friend, one is the daughter of the king of the demons, one is the daughter of the king of the angels, and one is an off limits loli choice with a spoiler background.\r\nDuring the first half of the series or sothe show is typical in its course of harem, having funny situations with the occasional serious bit of romance going on.\\n\\n\r\nThen the main character makes his choice as too which girl he likes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other girls don't take it so well, with one of them becoming mentally unbalanced due to his choice. The series rapidly falls from typical yet funny, to overly emotional and bad. I do like some emotion in my anime, but when the conflict between characters becomes so over the top that that actually attack one another... in a romance anime? No thank you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it had a decent begging, but a horrible ending that killed it. If it went on as it was in the begging, I couldn't foresee anything special happening that would have pushed it up to being a stand out anime, it was forced to be one of the average rated harems for all time, but then it had to go and mess that up on itself,  ending up on the bad side of things.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say most of us have better things to watch.",

            "content": "The show starts as usual with introduction of the female candidates from Rins point of view, Rin is the narrator giving their opinion on the characters and development along the way. At the start there will be plenty of ecchi and school comedy like any other Harem but Shuffle! is much more then that, soon more girls are introduced and a couple episodes later the dark pasts start to be uncovered and, as we learn more about the girls the show changes into a more dramatic development, not everything is happy and Rin always being kind and helpful tries to help everyone solve their problemsand make them happy.\\n\r\n The indecision last for most of the show as usual but the episodes are used to give the viewer a deep understanding of each girl, their personality and traits are fully explored and explained. \\n\r\nThe character development is long but well constructed and even Rin develops so expect changes and a decision towards the end. Both the comedy and ecchi scenes are very good separating right away Shuffle! from your standard harem, the beauty of this show lies in the development and the strong emotional load although, the characters are interesting and as mentioned, the development is very good, the change into a dramatic plot, featuring dark pasts and some of the stronger sad moments I ever watched is a fresh breeze in this genre. Its also easy to fall in love with the charismatic characters.\\n\r\nThe girls and the clothing are expertly drawn, all beautiful, fit perfectly composing a cheerful environment.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another plus, the music accompanies and leads the situations portrayed not only as a complement but defining the scenes and taking them to another level. The opening and ending is of the best I have seen and blends right in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note Shuffle! was based from an hentai game, a non hentai version was also launched for ps2.\\n\r\nThis is the king of the Harem style, technically superb and featuring interesting characters and plot Shuffle! defines its own style carrying great scenes in several genres: romantic, ecchi, comedy and drama, the character development is good and everything together makes it stand out from the crowd and shining on his own merit.  If you like strong dramatic scenes this show will specially interest you, features some of the best I ever seen.\\n\r\nIt immediately became one of my personal favorites of all time, I never dreamed a ecchi comedy could ever reach such high quality overall and Im afraid my words alone aren't enough to display its beauty.\\n\r\nThe only negative aspect I can possibly squeeze is the first half of the show which episodes are only \"normal\" ecchi harem style and may discourage the viewers to continue watching.\\n\r\nThe ending also feels a little light but that's just because its right after some really heavy dramatic scenes and you pretty much know who he ends up with a couple episodes before, so despite being a good end pales a bit next to the episodes right before it.\\n\\n\r\nI personally am a sucker for tragedy so I might overrate it a bit but it was so unexpected that hit me that hard. Must watch if your into drama or like me eager for an ecchi harem with deeper content.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nShuffle is an early 2000s Harem anime based on an eroge. I was recommended this title by an offline friend and my initial expectations couldn't possibly be lower. I was expecting \"Girls Bravo\" or \"DearS\", or at best something like Monster Musume or Sekirei. Instead I got an anime that while flawed...wasn't actually that bad. Stocks are rated each quarter based on whether or not they met expectations. Shuffle is basically like a small cap stock that wildly surpassed expectations. I kind of have to give it a decent rating!\r\nPros:\r\n1. \r\nShuffle, unlike most harem anime I've seen, actually has multiple characters that are likeable! Noneof them are Naru from Love Hina clones (THANK GOD). None of them were complete morons with no characteristics besides boobs. Personally I liked Sia, Narine, and Asa. Sia is the princess of the \"Gods\", although it is never explained that they created our world and are actually Gods. They are likely just an alternate dimension. Sia is fiery, athletic, and a bit of a bonehead. However, she cares deeply about her friends and respects the feelings of her romantic rivals. Narine is the princess of the \"Demons\", although they don't seem to torture the souls of dead humans and have nothing to do with traditional demons. She is a shy, intelligent, and introverted girl who wishes to court the main character to fulfill the wish of her dead sister, who had a crush on him. In many ways she predictably serves as a foil for Sia. Then there is Asa, who is constantly sickly but maintains a positive attitude despite the rough hand she has been dealt. Asa is generally the voice of reason in the series and the most reliable person to talk to when our MC male has problems. \\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\n Shuffle is a harem anime where the MC actually picks a girl at the end! Not only that, but he picks a choice you wouldn't initially expect. I was blown away by this. This may seem trivial, but in all my years of watching Harem anime I've never actually seen both of those things happen in the same show.\\n\\n\r\n3. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle doesn't have the black bars of doom or steam clouds of frustration. You want tits and ass? BAM! There it is! You don't even need to buy a special DVD. You get everything up front and in today's market that is damn refreshing!\\n\\n\r\n4.\\n\\n\r\n Shuffle not only brings the comedy with its self awareness and slapstick, and the eroticism with its constant nudity, it actually has some surprisingly touching moments. The last thing I was expecting was for an eroge harem to take me on a \"Feels Trip\". Well played Shuffle!\\n\\n\\n\r\n5. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle actually has a well done \"yandare\" character. She never does kill anyone or go on a rampage, but you constantly worry she might hurt the MC or herself. Unlike a Yuno Gasai where you know exactly what she is going to do next, this Yandare is truly unpredictable and that makes her much more nerve racking to watch. She also feels much more like a real person and less like a Loony Toons character. All of this...from an early 2000s eroge harem. I'm speechless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMajor Flaws:\\n\\n\r\n1. \\n\\n\r\nThe last 2 episodes are TERRIBLE! This is a series that could have ended with a strong resolution in episode 22, but just HAD to have 2 extra episodes and shat itself. The plot is extended thanks to a melodramatic and out of nowhere sub-plot that could have been solved immediately, but the usual voice of reason girl decides to act completely out of established character in order to stretch out the series. I can't think of much worse writing sins than having sudden \"character derailment\" for the sole purpose of extending the plot.\\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is 24 episodes, but in all honesty it could easily have been 13 with maybe 3 OVAs like a Baccano or Spice and Wolf. This is supposed to be an ecchi romantic comedy. This is supposed to be fun. I should NEVER be feeling bored, yet there were some parts I found both boring and totally pointless beyond the aforementioned final 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nFan Disservice. Of all the characters, the most pointless and least developed was by far the underage token \"Loli\" character. I realize almost all harems have this character because Tenchi did it with Sasami, but I think it's time to stop. If you aren't going to even give her character development and are just checking off a box, don't bother doing it! Also it was a REALLY bad idea to give this character full frontal scenes. At least most harems are smart enough to figure that out. Shuffle wasn't. I know it was the early 2000s and the anime industry was probably at their most lax when it came to underage nudity, but this was still stupid. Yeah some anime I like are guilty of this. The Berserk manga has its cringy as fuck \"Schierke service\". Elfen Lied had Mayu and Nana's totally pointless bath time. At least those characters were NEVER romantic options for the MC. Primula on the other hand was a possible sexual partner in the game and is clearly an official part of the harem in the anime. Damn it Japan! \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIs Shuffle the 2nd coming of Christ? No. Obviously not. However, it is still far better than the average harem anime and actually is worth watching. If nothing else you can compare it to the harem anime of today and see what has changed for the better and what has changed for the worst. Shuffle is a time capsule of the early 2000s and is the kind of anime that couldn't have been made either before or since. If you are interested in anime history and progression, and you want a harem that doesn't totally suck, Shuffle is a strong choice.\\n\\n",

            "content": "-Story\r\nThe story takes place in an alternate reality where people from the world of the gods and world of the demons can live together in peace in the world of the humans. It revolves around the main character named Rin who is a 17 year old high school student who just happens to be an inexplicable stud that girls can\u2019t seem to get enough of. One day two attractive female students show up at Rin\u2019s school to confess their love to him. Sia and Nerine are the princesses of the world of the gods and the world of the demons, respectively.  Each girl fellin love with Rin when they were young children who traveled to the world of the humans for a day. There are three others girls in the mix for winning Rin\u2019s heart and this is what sets up the premise of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe first eleven episodes are what you\u2019d expect from a typical harem anime. The girls are each trying to win Rin over and there is a nice amount of comedy involved. The series starts off fairly entertaining but does a complete 180 about halfway through. This is where things get bad. The series decides to get serious out of nowhere and the scenario leading to this serious tone is completely random and not well explained. I won\u2019t go into detail to avoid spoilers, but this is the only time we get a glimpse into the world of the demons. Just a brief look into a secluded laboratory residing in the that world. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle introduced us to the interesting concept of various worlds but the idea is completely abandoned for no good reason. It would have been great to explore both worlds and see what makes them unique and how the gods and the demons live and interact with each other in their own environment. Unfortunately, we get no insight into these worlds. Other than being a polygamous society, which is mentioned countless times, we know nothing about the gods or their world and we get very little information about the demon world as well. One of the things that set apart demons and gods from humans is their ability to use magic which is hardly ever explored and only used two or three times. \\n\\n\r\nEventually the first serious predicament comes to a resolution, which is achieved with no explanation and things just \u201cgo back to normal.\u201d The series then goes back to a more light-hearted nature for a couple of episodes and resumes the girls pursuit of Rin. However, most of the girls are literally thrown on the back burner from the get-go. Rin makes his decision out of nowhere and his choice is certainly unexpected. Shortly after the serious tone comes back into play. More random revelations lead to a bunch of drama that eventually results in a terrible ending.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\\n\r\nSia is the princess of the gods. She has a bubbly and playful personality, but packs a mean punch. Her reasons for falling in love with Rin are about as stupid as they come. One day when she was nine (approx. 8 years ago) she got lost in the human world where she ran into Rin who played with her and helped her find her way home. Of course it makes sense to fall madly in love with a kid you\u2019ve met once when you were nine, so naturally you would leave your own world to confess your love and marry this stranger. Sia is a likable character but her personality is one-dimensional and her reasons for loving Rin are straight up senseless. \\n\\n\r\nNerine is the princess of the demons. She\u2019s very introverted and has a shy and innocent personality. She fell in love with Rin for very similar reasons as Sia, however, thanks to one of the random revelations in the latter half of the series her reasons for loving Rin are even more illogical than Sia\u2019s. Ultimately, Nerine is a dry character who contributes little to the story and is often shoved to the side and forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nKaede is Rin\u2019s roommate and childhood friend. After Kaede loses her mother and Rin loses both parents in a car accident, that occurred when they were kids, Kaede\u2019s father takes Rin in and they\u2019ve lived together ever since. Kaede is the most dull character in the series and one of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. Her only reason for living is to take care of Rin who clearly has no interest in her and often treats her like crap. She rarely displays any emotion outside of the occasional whimpering for Rin and has the personality of a rock. I think they want you to fell sorry for her but I find it very hard to feel sorry for a character who is so dense and emotionless. Later in the series her personality takes a massive turn. I won\u2019t give anything away but the transition is out of the blue and made me go from feeling indifferent to her character to flat-out disliking her. But of course she just snaps back to her old dull self like nothing happened later on. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about Primula. She\u2019s a cute and likable character but she possesses little in terms of personality and feels like a supporting character with little to add to the series (other than the random turning point). \\n\\n\r\nAsa is my personal favorite. Her personality is similar to Sia\u2019s, bubbly and energetic, and she seems to have the most genuine reasons for liking Rin. She displays a wide range of emotions and receives the most character development. However, the stubbornness and sheer stupidity that she displays in the last couple of episodes is quite annoying.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we\u2019ve got our main protagonist, Rin! Rin has a dull personality, he\u2019s extremely indecisive, and is often an asshole to girls. He often leads the girls on and then displays random spurts of affection that come off as disingenuous. Rin is, simply put, a terrible lead character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some supporting characters as well. Two of them are the king of the gods and the king of the demons, Sia\u2019s and Nerine\u2019s dads, respectively. Both of the dads add great comedic relief to the series but, unfortunately, after the first eleven episodes they\u2019re almost completely forgotten. Itskui is the typical pervert who is Rin\u2019s best friend and also does a fair job of adding some comedy to the series. Itskui\u2019s sidekick Thyme is the \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who is always keeping Itskui in check and one of the few females in the series who isn\u2019t head-over-heels for Rin.\\n\\n\r\n-Art & Animation\\n\\n\r\nNothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\\n\r\nAverage at best. The opening is pretty good. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall\\n\\n\r\nShuffle had some potential. It took a unique approach to the Harem genre by taking a very serious tone to the series. Its also one of the few Harem anime that results in the protagonist actually choosing a girl to date. However, it abruptly switches gears from a light-hearted comedy to a serious drama. The transition is random and alarming. I don\u2019t mind it going in this direction and as I mentioned its actually a unique and an unexpected approach to the genre. Unfortunately the plot becomes convoluted and relies heavily on unreasonable events, poor character development, and random shock value. There are countless plot holes and interesting concepts that were introduced in the beginning of the series are abandoned and never revisited. Most of the characters take a backseat to Rin and the girl that he chooses halfway through the series and any vested interest in those other characters is gone with the wind. The last few episodes crank up the drama to full-blast and in true Shuffle fashion slams on the breaks and delivers an ending that feels random and out-of-place. \\n\\n\r\n-Final Verdict \\n\\n\r\nI give this series a 4 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be hard for me to recommend this series, but if you have a lot of free time on your hands and want to watch an unconventional harem I guess you can give it a shot. Just remember to keep your expectations very low. \\n",

            "content": "I'll start out my review by saying this is my first review, and it is all my personal opinion, and I wanted to write this review because I find the other reviews to be too optimistic and praising of this somewhat mediocre anime.\r\nThat said, lets begin the review of Shuffle!\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nShuffle! is a Harem/Romance series mostly, and although it has an ecchi tag it's only minor, and the fanservice is very limited. (Honestly, I've seen more fanservice in non-ecchi series.) In the beginning of the story, the main character gets introduced to a couple of girls who want to be with him, and sothe average harem story begins. The first 18 or so episodes, it's very unoriginal and actually quite boring to watch, and only after that it gets \"serious\". I can't really say what happens without spoilering it, but this arc in the story is pretty good and there's plenty of suffering. However, this does not change the fact that the first 18 or so episodes were absolutely horrible and the fact that I gave the anime a 7 is thanks to this last arc. Without this last arc, it would probably be a 5 or even lower. So it is worth it to grind your way through the first part of the anime.\\n\r\nSure, there is character developement but it's nothing major or groundbreaking and it's also quite vague why all those girls like the main character. (Seriously, liking someone because he played with you one time eight years ago?)\\n\r\nThere's also this story of the world being linked with the word of Gods and Devils, but this is very forgettable and it seems like the only reason they added this was to have girls with pointy elf ears. Only one time in the story these linked worlds are actually apparant, and it's not even something great or cool, they just go there for one episode and it's never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough it's not really my taste (I like the more modern anime style more) it's pretty good but nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nNothing too special here either, the voice actors were pretty okay and they fit their character. OP/ED were not noteworthy, background music was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nThe fact that I gave it an 8/10 does not mean all characters are good and well developed. I'll start by saying the most negative things; the \"God\" and \"Devil\" characters are complete retards who do nothing noteworthy the entire story, and are only there for comic relief. How people like that came to be the King of Gods/Devils is impressive. The main character is also very dense but near the end of the story he gets his act together and actually does some good things.\\n\r\nNow there's the girls, the daughter of God and the daughter of the Devil are your average MC-liking girls, and while they do have somewhat of a backstory, it's nothing that develops the story in any way (or interesting).\\n\r\nThe girl who lives with the main character, Fuyou Kaede is very kind and has a somewhat interesting backstory. There's also the energetic Senpai who is deadly ill, and while she can recover any time she wants, she doesn't want to for some reason which is never explained. (I can't elaborate without spoilering, just watch it and judge.)\\n\r\nThere's also the usual perverted friend, and for some reason every boy in the school is out to kill the main character just because they like his girls too.\\n\r\nOverall, this show has some good and really bad characters. Most girls are likable too and in my opinion the best one won, but I feel bad for the one who mainly lost.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\r\nI honestly do not know why I kept watching this anime. As I've said, the first 18 or so episodes are absolutely horrible and only after that the story gets good. I kept watching with the hope of something interesting happening, and to my enjoyment the last story arc was pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nShuffle! is an allright anime. The first 18 episodes are just horrible and unoriginal while the episodes following are interesting and good. I can not recommend this anime to anyone, unless you have the time and patience to watch through the first 18 episodes and get rewarded with an allright/good-but-not-excellent last arc. The story ends with a winning girl, but a potential season 2 hint is also included (although eight years later they probably won't make another season). \\n\r\nThe part about Gods and Devils adds absolutely nothing to the story and there is little Ecchi to speak about. If I were to name the genres for this anime they would probably be [\"School\", \"Drama\", \"Romance\", \"Harem\"].",

            "content": "This anime isn't good and isn't bad. I honestly have to say that it's in between in terms of what they did right and wrong with this series.\r\nFirst of all, making an anime series based off a visual novel is definitely a difficult thing to pull off, especially a visual novel with \"explicit\" content. Not only do you have to somehow incorporate each character into the story, whereas in visual novels it typically focuses on just one character, there's the ending where the main character eventually ends up with only one girl. \r\nThis usually throws off the entire idea of a visual novel where youcontrol the character and the choices he makes. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off this review, let's go over the plot of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story evolves around a typical visual novel character named Rin Tsuchimi. He's indecisive, fairly dense, moderate in terms of looks and talent, and of course a lot of girls that are in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nRin's parents died when he was very young, and moved in with Kaede and her father. Although he was never officially adopted, they still live under the same roof. \\n\\n\r\nRin lives in a world where the angel's realm and the demon's realm met up with the human realm, and they all started living together because we all love peace.\\n\\n\r\nWhen he turns seventeen, however, he meets two girls who are the princesses of their realm. There's Sia of the angel realm and Nerine of the demon realm. Each met him when they were only nine years old and he helped them when they were lost in the human realm. Now that they are of age to marry, they both choose Rin as the most suitable candidate.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are a lot of other girls in this anime who fall in love with Rin, and in the end there can only be one. Who did he choose out of the girls that were in love with him?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm not going to give off any spoilers, but I'll break it down for you as much as I can without giving too much away. And this is the part of the anime where I review what was good and what was bad.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the comedy in this anime is perfect. Most notably the parts where the king of the angel realm and the king of the demon realm hang out together. That's right, they're best friends.\\n\\n\r\nThese two made such an incredible combo, and they could have made an incredible spin-off series just based on these two characters. But alas, we only have the original anime.\\n\\n\r\nRather than the royal duo (see what I did there), there are a lot of moments where you'll laugh out loud rather out of irony, coincidence, or simple second-hand embarrassment. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what truly ruined this anime for me was the character and plot development.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the anime seemed like pure filler after the first episode. For the first twelve episodes, there's nothing but comedic relief and a few parts that make you connect to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until the second half of the anime where the series tries to create a real story and develop the characters more. Did they pull it off?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely freakin` not.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was rushed and made absolutely no sense at all. \\n\r\nThat, or it completely made you lose hope in the character all together since they turned out to be someone that they're not.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the character development was overdone, senseless and extremely melodramatic. Not to mention the unnecessary fan service parts. It completely ruined the characters and any hope that I had in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can't even begin to talk about the protagonist. All I want to say about him is that he's simply a pathetic human. And if this is really the kind of guy that a \"perfect\" girl will fall head over heals for, then there is no more hope for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I said earlier that there can only be one girl in the end that the main character falls for? \\n\\n\r\nActually, I can't really say who it is, even though I want to tell you so badly\\n\r\nsince there's rules on this site that tell me I can't give off spoilers. But if you\\n\r\nabsolutely want to find out, read the first column of this paragraph. \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoilers, though, the character which Rin falls for wasn't incorporated into the story that well. In fact, she felt more like a side character rather than the girl Rin should have fell in love with. Again, I refer to this anime's terrible character and plot development. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I now find it easy to believe that any anime that's based off a visual novel, or any echi-style anime. Only a few anime's I know based on a visual novel or a harem setting worked out. One of them is Clannad, but even that anime had a few problems in terms of story development.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely would not recommend this anime. It was a complete disappointment despite it's excellent comedic.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\n+ Great Comedy\\n\r\n+ Good Animation/music\\n\r\n- Pathetic Lead\\n\r\n- Terrible Character/Plot Development\\n\r\n- Unnecessary Fan Service\\n\r\n- Too Much Filler\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDo Not Watch!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to hit all of the bases with this review because Shuffle! has a wide range of mixed views and I can see everyone's point on why they did or didn't like it.\r\nPlot: Me being a Fantasy lover, I did enjoy the plot. In Shuffle!, there are two worlds that parallel the human world, the world of the Gods and the world of the Demons. Each ruled by a king, who are actually best friends and each one has a daughter that at one point in their lives, comes to the human word and falls for a guy named Rin (pronouncedR-EE-N). Both of these girls wish to marry him. With this being a harem anime, there are also many other love interests involved such as the girl Rin lives with and one of his best friends he's known for a long time. They all go to the same high school and they are friends, but each one has individual secrets that are revealed throughout the series.\\n\r\nSince I am not a fan of girls throwing themselves at a guy, but I love the idea of the different worlds, so I gave the plot an 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I rated the artwork a 10, because it was original and the characters didn't look anything alike so unlike other anime, it was difficult to get them confused. The art was a ten for me, but the high amounts of fan service was ridiculous and ruined some of the anime for me, but not enough to stop watching it, because the anime itself was original and I wanted to finish it without regrets.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I have to admit that the opening and  ending songs got stuck in my head, so I gave the sound a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where many people found that Shuffle! failed many viewers. (I'm trying my best not to include spoilers) Rin himself is surrounded by beautiful girls and each one goes on individual dates with him at one point or another, and yet he never tells any of the girls his feelings. It frustrates many that he is willing to lead girls on with no emotion whatsoever. I myself found it frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters later in the show develop glitches in their personalities that ruins the individuality that I can to love at the beginning of the show. The sweet character turns a complete 180 and turns into an aggressive crazy chick, which I can only compare to School Days (I really didn't like that anime btw). One of the characters that I enjoyed because of her independence turns not only clingy, but slutty as well. \\n\r\nThe other characters kept to the personalities that they originally started with. Because of my love for the characters toward the beginning of the show, but the unfortunate let down towards the end, I'd have to give the characters a 6. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: My love for certain characters throughout the entire series is what kept me going, and I still have to say that it wasn't TERRIBLE, but it doesn't make my top 10 when it comes to characters and outcome. Certain aspects of this show will stay with me and I might even watch the first episode every once in a while or listen to one of the songs now and again. \\n\r\nTo summarize it to just a number: 6.5 (rounded up to seven)\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for reading!        \\n",

Exactly at the 20th episode I was like \" I should have done my nails instead\". The story was so shallow...... yeah shallow couldn't think of a better word to describe it. \r\nArt: Great.. its the only thing that got me to finish the anime.\r\nCharacter: This is why I had the urge to write a review. I'll start with the protagonist. Fine.. he is kind thats why everybody is going gaga 'bout himbut his indecisiveness is really lame. I've seen quite a few harem type animes and this is the first  one that got me really annoyed about the protagonist.  There isnt really a strong force that would make you feel attached to his character.  And then the girls.. I guess their characters are fine except for being martyrs. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had a fairly good laugh once in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor.  Not a good recommendation to anybody.

            "content": "To start off, I must start by saying that if you are having second thoughts about Shuffle; give it a try. At first, I didn't really want to watch it either. What I loved about this anime is that in the end main character Rin Tsuchimi needs to decide who he wants to spend the rest of his life with. I admire how they dont just end the anime with all of Rin's lovers deciding that they are all going to love him together like in the ending of To Love Ru, Asobi ni Iku Yo!, etc... I tend to dislike the animes that justgive up and say, \"Hey, let's just make all the girls fall in love with this one guy.\" Shuffle is different, as I said earlier our main character, Rin, needs to make one of the biggest decisions of his life.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Shuffle is definetly one of those animes that you can easily predict what will happen next. I found myself scene after scene saying to myself... \"OMG SHIT'S GOING DOWN NOW!!! __________ is guna happen next and 9 times out of 10. It happened, However Shuffle makes up for this with it's very amazing character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Some of the characters such as Shigure, Asa and  Mayumi, Thyme completely make the anime into an amazing comedy. I won't reveal any of the scenes because I'm not into spoiling animes. \\n\\n\r\nI understand this review short, (to ur standards maybe poor), and doesn't really go into depth, but to tell you the truth if you looked at my review and said to yourself, \"You know what, maybe I will watch this anime and have myself a good laugh and see who Rin chooses in the end.\"\\n\\n\r\nMy goal for this review is to get the reader to make a second decision. If you are thinking about skipping this anime I strongly recommend that you reconsider. Shuffle is full of classic comedy, and i can promise you that you will find it enjoyable. My main inspiration of writing this review is after seeing yet another anime where the main male character falls in love with every single female character that he meets in the harem. To me, that's just like a middle finger to us viewers. Now don't get me wrong, those types of animes are still very enjoyable. However, after a while they do get repetitive and Shuffle is a nice change of pace. I can guarantee that you will like what Shuffle has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, it's literally my 3rd review and I don't really have much experience. But as long as my short review got some sort of reaction in you then that's what I was aiming for. \\n\\n\r\nNow do us all a favor:\\n\r\n1. Open a nice can of Mountain Dew\\n\r\n2. Turn on your laptop (or if you have a ps3 or Xbox (Netflix) )\\n\r\n3. Watch Shuffle for at least 6 episodes\\n\r\n4. You will definetly get hooked\\n\r\n5. Get another freaking mountain dew \\n\r\n6. Finish Shuffle XD",

            "content": "Shuffle!\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nShuffle is your stereotypical harem. There's one guy and five girls and they all want to win his affections. There's really not a heck of a lot of originality put into the plot or the back-stories of any of the girls, either, but they're different enough save for two that it doesn't get repetitive. The good thing about the story is that it's straightforward -- you can really turn your brain off and stuff enjoy the ride and have the emotional thrills, laughs, and sadness. Despite being so stereotypical in its setup it manages to incorporate a good variety of emotions.\r\nThe best thing story-wiseabout Shuffle was unlike most harem you never know which girl the guy is going to pick until he picks her. That's one of the core things that kept me watching. I kept hoping he'd pick the girl I was rooting for. Of course I won't spoil who Rin picks in the end, but I'll just say keep watching, because you're constantly guessing at it throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nThe art in Shuffle was nothing spectacular. It was nice, and that's really all there was to it. Sometimes it can get kind of choppy but most of the time it was fairly nice and flowed well. No real complaints here. Although I do have to say I love Aoi Nishimata's art and the character designs were cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe sound was good. Again, nothing special, but it was good. The seiyuu did a very good job (I personally think Kaede's and Primula's seiyuu were the best) and the music was okay and fitted the anime nicely. The opening song was incredibly catchy though! Will forever be on my top 25 most played, probably.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nSince Shuffle is a harem, all the main characters are different broad archetypes of personalities and looks. Thankfully, instead of the characters just being empty stereotypes, they have fairly interesting back-stories and just a little more to the archetype with their own little individualities. As I said above when I was talking about the art/animation, the character designs are cute and Aoi Nishimata does pretty good artwork. It's almost guaranteed you'll come out of Shuffle liking at least one of the girls and having a favorite that you wanted to win Rin's affections, whether this girl was the winner of the war of love or not.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nEnjoyment varies from person to person. However, even though Shuffle is a stereotypical harem with generic character archetypes, merely decent art and a good dose of ecchi, which usually isn't for me... it was fun. It was a very fun ride. Shuffle has this mysterious element of enjoyability to it. So if you're looking for a fun romance with a good deal of comedy and ecchi (though it has a good deal of very serious bits too) try and pick up Shuffle.",

            "content": "Shuffle!\r\nStory: 9/10.\r\nThe story is about a Japanese Highschooler named Rin Tsuchimi. He's been living with his childhood friend who's been taking care of Rin for a while now. Her name is Kaede Fuyou. But one day Rin meets 2 girls from his past named Sia and Nerine. But soon after the girls fall in love with Rin. \r\nThis anime is full of heartwarming and heartbreaking moments. A story of one man's decisions and adventures, full of love triangles, and memories. \r\nThis story is loveable because it has Comedy and Drama in it all at the same time. The story should deserve a 9/10 because it'sa heartwarming story of love and hate and it's twists and turns. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Shuffle! is flawless. Thanks to Suzuhira, Hiro and Nishimata, Aoi for creating the characters. They all look gorgeous, stunning, perfect. It makes it realistic and believable, just like any good anime should. The scenery was what it should be. Japanese neighborhoods and homes, Japanese schools, malls, train stations, rainy days, sunny days. Watching the sunny days on my moniter made me feel all warm. It was complety real. Good job! &lt;3\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were perfect. It fitted the story plot/theme. [: Yuria is a good singer, I love that song &quot;You&quot; by her. The lyrics were genius.  Also the people who did the voices for the charaters. It really did fit the charater's apperence and personailty. And they really did show emotions in their acting, which is sometimes hard to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Shuffle! were ah-mazing. They were alive and realistic, more than you can ask for. I loved every character, and none of them felt boring or dumb to me. Also, their outfits and apperence were great. I loved the hair and the eyes. :D But, I gave the characters 9/10 because sometimes I just felt that there wasn't enough information given on them, they really needed to show who they were in the inside and outside.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime so much. It made me laugh it made me cry, it made me feel what I should feel, and that's what makes up a great anime. Of course, a person who doesn't like  Comedy, Romance, Drama, Harem, and Ecchi animes might not like this one, but don't get my wrong, this is a fantastic anime. Shuffle! was truely addiction, every single second of it was splendid. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Shuffle! I suggest you try Shuffle! Memories. It's basically a lookback on Shuffle and more. [:",

So fine that they live together and what not all peacefully! A teenage boy named Rin gets extremely lucky one day. He becomes the main character of a freaking harem Anime! To begin, he lives with his childhood friend Kaede, but his new neighbors are totally in love with him too. He has many admirers: the daughter of the Gods, Sia, and the daughter of the demons, Nerine, are both deeply in love with Rinafter having met him the past. Along with his friendship with older woman Asa and his encounter with the silent but cute Primula, Rin has much on his hands dealing with the affections of all of these insane girls who love him way too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReactions:\\n\\n\r\nWell personally I thought that this Anime was so-so. Seeing as it is based on a triple X wtf eroge game, I kind of figured it was about one guy and a lot of women surrounded by him. To begin, the guy was kind of ugly and his personality was meh. If I was a woman I would personally go for another guy, but of course as you can see...they all love Rin. Each of the girls has a different type of personality from childhood friend to hyper-active upperclassmen...etc. Which kind of makes it fun, but then again most of the time they are all catering to this lame, pathetic excuse for a man Rin. JUST FREAKING DITCH THIS MAN ALREADY PEOPLE. He sucks. \\n\\n\r\nThis plot totally makes no sense. It seems rather dry because all that the character do is...CATER TO THIS MAIN CHARACTER. I'm sure they catered this to the average man who would want girls on their hand and foot like that. The whole Anime feels rather fake. Maybe they should make these girls more 'realistic' ya know?\\n\\n\r\nRin only ends up with one person in the end of course. But who? Well I am going to have to make you watch the crappy drama and what not to find out. Too bad, I can't spoil the Anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this Anime is like some kind of funky Japanese Soap Opera. It has its ups-and-downs. Watch at your own risk. I was about to drop it myself, but I was just curious as to who the jerk would end up with!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you do not want to watch it because I would never, ever want to watch it again...look it up online.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this Anime for guys more than girls in the end. It is more of a guy anime than a girl anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHappy Anime Hunting!~ The above review is my opinion and it may not be the same as yours. I respect other people's opinions because one person's vision of an Anime can be totally different from another vision. People perceive things in different ways.",

            "content": "Shuffle! is a generic romance harem story, featuring most of what is generally accepted to be good and unfortunately bad about its type of show. For those who have never seen a show of this genre, it's probably a good place to start to accumulate a background on the common traits of these types of shows.  Besides that it's a pretty unexceptional show, and a rather poor adaptation of its related visual novel (having experienced both, I will immediately tell you the visual novel is by far superior).\r\nStarting with whats good, this show is not particularly animated most of the time being more onthe lines of slice of life (although there are a few notable exceptions). That being said it's mostly an aesthetically pleasing show with well drawn characters, and of course, it can't really hurt to have a lot of beautiful girls in the main cast can it? A few dramatic moments here and there did get some good visual emphasis as well. The voice actors (both English and Japanese) are pretty well chosen for the most part, and fans of the visual novel can at least appreciate the reuse of the same Japanese actors. Being based on an eroge, this show does present some obvious nudity, but for the most part it's not overdone, and it's usually humorous, so it generally shouldn't detract from your viewing experience much, if it even does.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel doesn't necessarily have the best plot ever, and unfortunately one of the problems with this show is trying too hard to fit too much all at once. Besides the fact that obviously Rin is only supposed to end up with one of the girls, the way Shuffle! attempts to translate all the routes into some kind of relevant single story ends up leaving our main protagonist Rin a very weak and indecisive man. This above all else is the single biggest flaw of Shuffle! the anime, a horrible main protagonist who is never willing to commit to anything, leaving many many people hanging and feeling desperate. This alone makes most of the characters (namely the girls and Rin) have seemingly shallow motivations, and is a primary reason why the visual novel is superior, since there is no indecision on Rin's part when you as the player make all the important choices.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the show generally tries to cut and paste stuff that happened from the visual novel into the show. To be fair though, a few things like Kaede's background and maybe to a lesser extent Sia's as well do get directed in a more interesting way than the visual novel presents. So for the sake of saying whether or not the anime does anything to separate itself from the visual novel, there is something to consider.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Shuffle! is a fairly average show. It's mostly okay, a few good moments here and there, and unfortunately the show is held back by a lame protagonist, who as a result makes much of the plot a lot more lame than it should be.  If you're still curious about learning what the romantic harem genre has to offer, this show is definitely one to consider looking into.",

            "content": "Shuffle! is a classic Supernatural, Harem, Romance, Comedy, Drama that feels fairly average to begin with but it&rsquo;s full of surprises as you go on. My overall score may be somewhat biased but this show is just truly amazing. ^_^\r\nThe story is just your basic harem anime as it follows a male protagonist (Rin Tsuchimi) an average high school boy who lives with his childhood friend Kaede (girl). Of course to make this a harem there are more girls included into the mix (5 in total) and not to forget the all important supernatural element to the show, by adding gods and demons to theplot. As the series begins it is your typical Rom/Com with plenty of cute and hilarious moments and heaps of casual fanservice. It is until halfway into the series that the drama kicks in, bringing forth a great deal of heartfelt moments, which will get most viewers all teary eyed and plenty of character developments.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are compelling and fun to watch as they all have something unique about them, including the guys. It&rsquo;s true that the set-up for the girls is pretty clich&eacute;d (childhood friend, eccentric, tsundere, shy girl, loli) but they all bring something special to the story. What&rsquo;s more amazing is that the male protagonist also brings a great deal to the story, including deep-rooted jealously that all us guys feel whilst watching the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality for Shuffle! was somewhat unique, with its own style and having subtle differences with similar anime. This allows the animation aspect of the show to excel amongst others; with amazing environments, well animated character expressions/emotions and most importantly the superb character designs. One thing I noticed is how most of the characters wear around 5-10 different outfits throughout the series, which is rarely seen in your average harem. It would be perfect but there were instances when the quality of the animation degraded. \\n\\n\r\nOn another note the music for the series was great and went well with the mood of the situations (comedy &amp; drama), nevertheless it became somewhat repetitive. At least there were some really good insert songs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Shuffle! is the epitome of what a harem romance anime should be; one guy + cute girls = a variety of romantic outcomes. The best thing about the show would have to be the characters because they are all developed incredibly well and their actions aren&rsquo;t always questionable, seeing how it suits their personality. And because the male protagonist isn&rsquo;t a worthless guy, there are numerous romances and a number of possibilities. The series managed to end well without relying on too many clich&eacute;s. So in the end this is a classic series that most romance anime fans would enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n^_^",

            "content": "This is going to be the shortest review I ever write, because Shuffle! is a piece of crap that doesn't deserve even 50 words describing it.  It starts out as a harem comedy, and is mildly entertaining until about the half way point, whereby it has already trapped you in its mediocrity and you are now a victim to find out what/who the (very terrible) main character eventually chooses out of all the girls.  \r\nOnce you make it past the halfway point the show devolves into a burning trainwreck that will eventually leave you with an aneurysm.  The majority of the casteventually disappears from relevance about 3/4 of the way through.  What was once a light hearted harem romp is now a ridiculous anime soap opera drama.  The main character is terrible, indecisive, and enjoys ruining other peoples lives.  Many stereotypical harem leads at least do SOMETHING for the girls in the harem - make their lives a little better, somehow.  Rin does nothing.  It is frustrating to watch him.  The only lead I can consider worse than this guy is that retard off School Days or the guy off Ichigo 100%.  Protip: Don't watch those shows either.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls are just as frustrating.  Their motivations for liking the guy are pretty bland and basic - one of them has a more solid reason that is touched on towards the end of the show.  But the girls are unbelievable.  They get rejected and cling until the end of the show.  All their worries and development is washed away by the finale.  They each love the main character because he is 'kind' although to the viewer he is very obviously a loser.\\n\\n\r\nDo you enjoy ecchi?  I guess you might enjoy Shuffle.  The sluttiness in this show is laser guided.  Whether it's an alternate personality, little sister character with see-through top or crazy ass yandere that just wants to bang, there's a different girl for every taste.  There are better harems out there though.  Like if it has \"harem\" listed as a genre it is probably a better show.\\n\\n\r\nYea, I'm done.  Fuck you, Shuffle!",

The story of 6 lives, filled with jealousy & hope as well as with hope & joy.\r\nAt first I was hesitating to watch this series but it provided a lot of fun for me. The story didn't become boring either due to the fact that you get to know more and more of everyone's personality, character and history.\r\n:: Story ::\r\nWhen I read about this series and noticed that Gods and Demons play a roll in such a rather typical human environment like school life, I was doubting if I would enjoy watching it. But Idid. And that's because the story line is not just a straight line from the beginning to the end. There were moments I was surprised about, moments I laughed my butt off, and moments I couldn't really believe what I saw and heard. If you aren't too biased about the scheme you will enjoy the story, I'm sure. It's simply not an action packed anime. Rather a calm and funny one. Yet, you might find yourself surprised sometimes - just like I did.\\n\r\n~8 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Animation ::\\n\r\nIt's simply beautiful. The Characters, the environment, little details like water and leaves look great as well. Very nice art.\\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Sound ::\\n\r\nHaha~. Certain Character's ways of speaking still put a smile on my face. There's not much to say about sound - I didn't have the impression that there was anything that sounded not like it's supposed to.\\n\r\n~8 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Character ::\\n\r\nEach Character is different. They are all beautiful and have their ups and downs. \\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Enjoyment ::\\n\r\nI would have dropped it if I didn't enjoy it. But instead, I enjoyed every single episode and was always looking forward to watching the next one.  This anime will get a special place in my collection - but maybe that's just because I'm into these kind of shows.\\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n:: Overall ::\\n\r\nAs I said, this anime is special to me. I'm really glad I decided to watch it and will surely check out the 'sequel' -\"Shuffle! Memories\"- as well.\\n\r\n~9 out of 10~\\n\\n\r\n*I know it's a rather short review, but it's also my first one so bear with me. I'll do my best to write better ones in the future.*",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nI can't begin to explain how much disliked this anime. I guess It's your typical passive male character (who is beyond daft) surrounded by senseless females that throw themselves at him for ridiculous (and quite unimportant) reasons. It drove me nuts. \r\nI kept watching this anime because my friend insisted 'it gets better!'. I watched until the end ... and lets just say that the ending pretty much just spirals down into the most outrageous and pathetic ending i've ever seen. \r\nThe good: \r\n- Primula is an adorable character \r\n- The character design was pretty and the animation good. \r\nI'm sorry there'snothing else good about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe bad:\\n\r\n- The main character is by far the worst part of this anime. If this is the kind of guy girls want... or the kind of guy other guys aspire to be... there is no hope for the human race. How hard is it to say 'hey! i'm not interested'... but nooo hes like 'i dont know how to express myself to i'm going to just let everyone believe i love them so we can be one happy family.'\\n\r\n-The ending (i cant go into detail because of the no spoilers.. but the last couple of episodes were painful to watch... it was like 'bad, bad, bad, happy ending (wait wut, how can this have a happy ending?')\\n\r\n- The girls... they just won't get a clue... I mean seriously. 'i will go on loving you with the hope you'll love me someday...' \\n\r\n- Kaede is also painful to watch... I guess some guys like their girls passive and easy to walk all over but it's not my cup of tea. \\n\r\n- Suicide attempt scene. I will say no more. \\n\r\n- ok with the gods and demons thing... but the sudden surprise about magic girl? it just came out of the blue and seemed to be thrown in there at the last minute to be able to give this anime an ending (and thank god it ended.)\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Originality in harem anime is an oxymoron. It simply doesn't exist anymore nor will it ever exist again. Shuffle! is the same, but despite all odds, it manages to put a few chinks in the chain of mediocrity with some suprirsing twists.\r\nUnfortunately for potential viewers, Shuffle's raison d'etre won't make it's presence known until a little more than halfway into the series. Until then, enjoy a plauge of mindless expositional filler, all for the sake of seeing under every girl's skirt. Yes, even the loli's. This curse comes with a gift though in that the series progresses with an ambiguous nature toward who our haplessharem hero will eventually end up with. Then, when the twists kick in the series manages to redeem the crap it's put you through up to then. That is, unless you're already fed up with it. In which case, it won't matter much. \\n\\n\r\nThis relatively bland narrative is naturally helmed by a gaggle of too-good-to-be-true jailbait. While some of the girls are somewhat interesting (especially when you know everything about them), they are for the most part harem stereotypes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is nothing spectacular. Being standard harem fare, it's only right the animation be mediocre as well. It's rough and choppy in places where a lot of action occurs, which tends to make some of the best scenes rather ugly. My biggest concerns though are the backgrounds. They look like standard H-game background frames. No attempt at being anything other than mediocre here.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty lackluster as well, like it took about an hour and a half to compose and it was all recorded through a synthesizer.\\n\\n\r\nIt's definitely not a must-see but there were definitely points that made me feel like what I was watching wasn't an entire waste of my time. Since Shuffle!, all generic harems are following its lead and attempting some dark twists to make them more interesting. If you're in it for the dark twists, it's worth a look. But if you're in it for panty shots, you're more likely to come out a little happier than others.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Shuffle! a 6 out of 10.",

            "content": "I just had to write a review on how disappointment I was in the time i wasted on Shuffle!\r\nStory - 1\r\nSome out there (like the small amount of posts on the forum) seem to have liked the story.. But seriously it is so full of plot holes and terrible planning I can't begin to explain. Some of you have actually seen this may see this as a total hate, but honestly it isn't. The beginning episodes got me into the show - and I really only stayed for the humor and the princesses (I liked there personalities - they were a little too overcharged emotionallybut they had nice differences). Sadly the humor completely dies off - no real reason (The hilarious fan clubs just stop..).\\n\\n\r\nThe story arcs are sadly very underused. There was honestly so much potential that could have been utilized in the story... instead it's all wasted on stupid emotional charges and of course the large amount of echii (I'd be lieing if I said I hated Echii -_^). I could go on and on.. but seriously it's not worth the time waste.. there are so many plot holes where characters disappear as if they died and later resurrect, and without spoiling anything, IT JUST MAKES NO FREAKING SENSE!.\\n\\n\r\nArt- It was pretty well done, it never bothered me.\\n\\n\r\nSound - The music was so-so, it helped at some parts that were too overcharged with fake emotion.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- The main character is awful, he is just the single worst Anime character I have ever come across. He has literally no personality, they make you believe he might gain some, but never does, instead to me he is a total jerk. If you somehow decide to watch this - you will quickly realize that. That said, it managed to gain a 5 because the girl characters all had fairly different personalities. While a certain someone is my least liked of the girls - ahh s - it was still not too bad. The princesses are appealing in the sense of who they actually are - not the pathetically crafted love for Rin. \\n\\n\r\nPrimula (what a terrible name) is easily one of the most adorable/lovable anime characters I have run across... it's just something about her that would make one want to do anything to protect her. She is honestly the only TRULY bright light of wasting time on Shuffle!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - First 10 eps or so were pretty enjoyable for the comedy.. which is sadly what got me to continue watching hoping it would return in full force.. It's obvious my stance. The rest of the eps become so pathetically overcharged with fake emotions, story lines and ridiculous drama, so ridiculous I view it as a really lame joke.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 1. I understand a 1 really isn't all that fair, I truly do. However the amount of plot holes, missing dialogues, fake emotions, ridiculous drama, terrible main character and numerous other flaws have led me to hate this so much as to be the worst Anime I've ever watched. Given my rage is a little reflected from wanting it to be good - I guess thats a redeeming quality. However I don't play into the \"Oh for being based off a H-Game its pretty good\" is just weak. Honestly I just hope I save at least one person from wasting time on this. Please do not understand my review as being subjective - Unless you're really itching for some heavy Echii (Yes, Nudity and explicit shots are aplenty - pointless even) then move on... just move on.",

            "content": "This is a review for the first volume (disc) of Shuffle! It was so bad that I just had to say something about it, so here it is. :P  there are spoilers BUT you will be warned before i get to them\r\n- Story -\r\nThis anime is about a regular Japanese high school boy who lives with a girl who is his childhood friend in his house. I'm not even going to mention their names because that is how forgettable they are...\r\nShe makes food for him every day and has been doing this since they were kids it seems. The twist to this show isthat Heaven and Hell have connected to our mortal realm in the middle, and now people from heaven and hell are immigrating to our dimension. The only visual aspect of these other-worldly beings is their ears (they don\u2019t have clich\u00e9s like horns or wings). People from Heaven have pointy ears that point up, and people from Hell have longer pointy ears that hang down. Surprisingly the people from heaven don\u2019t act like goody-goodies and the people from hell don\u2019t act evil, they all act like any normal human. They do have magic powers, but this is only shown once in disc 1. The theme of this whole Heaven-and-Hell thing is barely involved in the first episodes, and becomes quickly irrelevant. I do not know if it\u2019s supposed to be subtle or if this is just a lazy move, but it\u2019s leaves me wondering why they even bothered to put it in the plot in the first place if the creators won\u2019t even use this plot device. You won't even get to see what Heaven or Hell looks like (at least for the first 4 episodes), nor will you see anything super-natural except for pointy ears and 1 magical attack (at least for the first 4 episodes).\\n\\n\r\nThe main ''protagonist'' boy gets two new neighbors: God and Lucifer. God and Lucifer act like normal people and are even good friends. They both have an only-child-daughter. The daughter of God and the daughter of Lucifer have encountered the main character boy on one occasion  when they were all very little. The guy was kind to them one time, and they\u2019ve both had a crush on him ever since. Now God and Lucifer are offering the guy their daughters to marry him so that he may become the next king of either Hell or Heaven, and so he is stuck with this choice of which girl he wants to be with. There is also a very little girl who has come to Earth from Hell. This little girl named Prim has heard all about how nice the guy was (one time) to Lucifer\u2019s daughter, so she likes him too. However, he completely ignores this huge choice he has to make, and decides to try to live his life normally. He gets annoyed when anything interferes with his normal life.  He's kind of a jerk.\\n\\n\r\nThe guy doesn\u2019t seem all that interested in girls. He\u2019s got something like 5 girls who want him but he doesn\u2019t care at all. He has no interest in girls. I swear something is wrong with him. His super-perverted friend is envious of his position.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of things that bother me about this anime\u2026 One thing that bothers me about Shuffle! is that the main character guy is portrayed by the director as a \u2018nice guy\u2019, but he expects the girl he lives with to cook for him everyday and a whole bunch of other stuff, and she obeys. If she doesn\u2019t do a good job then she feels guilty and he is disappointed. At one point he thinks to himself something along the lines of, \u201cI feel kind of bad not helping her out with the housework and cooking\u2026,\u201d but instead he decides to continue sitting on the couch (literally). That is the only single moment he even considers helping her out with stuff. I think she even cleans his whole freakin house.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea why these girls like this guy besides him being nice to them 1 time years ago, and the fact that he looks like every average anime boy.  He has no skills, no hobbies, no interesting past, no talents; he's just a guy.  That's the only way I can describe him; just a guy.  Perhaps he has no traits because the creators of the show wanted a blank slate that male viewers can use to feel ''in-the-show'', but the reason why the girls want him still eludes me....\\n\\n\r\nWhoever made this show has a twisted perspective of the world, and thinks that what defines a ''nice guy'' is a guy who looks average, acts average, has no brains, expects women to do his bidding and [SPOILERS] is allowed to punch his best friend in the gut with all his might (really happens in first episode).\\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS]  Let me elaborate on that ''punching'' thing. The guy and girl are walking to school. The guy opens the door to the classroom and his best friend jumps out and embraces the guy, thinking he is the girl as he shouts her name. The guy then punches his best friend in the gut with a great amount of force as a shock-wave can be heard and seen votrexing out from his best friend's back. This is portrayed as a comic relief, but I wasn't laughing... Anyways...\\n\\n\r\nSince this guy has so many girls wanting him, there are armies of perverted creeps who are jealous of him. I\u2019m not exaggerating, there are literally hundreds of perverted guys who stalk him and try to abduct him and/or kill him in mob-formation, and they insult him every chance they get. They come out to ambush him at his school and in the streets, and chase him. They are in stereotypical \u2018manly\u2019 groups like jocks or delinquents, etc. They are in every episode I\u2019ve seen and they freak me out. They also stalk the girls once in a while, peeking up the skirt of Lucifer\u2019s daughter at one point. This makes me sick. They are drawn with ugly faces and creepy expressions.\\n\\n\r\nThe girls don\u2019t seem to mind the competition of one-another, as if this guy is soooo great that he is worth the self-esteem they have to put aside for him.  [SPOILER YOU SHOULD READ] One episode is about a picnic that the group is planning. The girls all want to cook a meal to impress the guy. However, the daughter of the Devil doesn\u2019t know how to cook and is feeling worthless. The guy tries to reassure her, but instead of saying something encouraging like \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s the thought that counts,\u201d or, \u201cI don\u2019t need a fancy meal or material objects to know that you care about me,\u201d instead he says something along the lines of, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make a great meal for me.\u201d He says this with a smile. I was like, wtf? What an ass. And so they have their picnic and he expects to eat all the girls\u2019 food that they made for him.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the only things I liked about this show was [SPOILERS] the comic relief that the daughter of God brings to the show. Whenever God says embarrassing things about his daughter, she somehow appears behind him with the nearest heavy/sharp object and hits him over the head with it, knocking him out. She then drags him home. I thought this was hilarious.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Art Style -\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 faces are drawn in a subtlety unique style that I have not seen before. For example, the girls in Air TV and Kanon have an identical style to how their faces are drawn, but I have not seen the faces of Shuffle! anywhere else.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is average, meaning it\u2019s not so great that I noticed it, but it\u2019s not so bad that I noticed it either. It\u2019s meh.  Nothing to note here in animation quality, background paintings or graphic quality.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Final Score -\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is extremely shallow, the girls are dumb and the main character guy is a free-loading jerk. He doesn\u2019t do anything to make him a jerk, but it\u2019s what he Doesn\u2019t do: he doesn\u2019t care about the girls almost at all; he doesn\u2019t feel guilt for not helping the girls with things like housework or food preparation or hurting their feelings; and he doesn\u2019t show any sincere compassion or deep thoughts (this guy\u2019s head is totally empty). The story is just about a bunch of girls wanting some guy who was nice to them on 1 occasion, years prior. The whole Heaven and Hell thing barely exists in the story in the beginning, and is completely unimportant after a few episodes. If you want to see hot anime chicks then by all means watch it, but that\u2019s all this anime is: hot anime chicks, nothing more or less. [Shuffle! in a nutshell: a bunch of girls like some guy and he doesn\u2019t care, and they don't care that he doesn't care.]\\n\\n\r\nWorst of all (and the thing that horrifies me the most) is that this show takes itself seriously!\\n\\n\r\nFor the unique cute faces of the girls and the comic relief of God\u2019s daughter, I can only give this anime a Horrible score of 1/10 (a generous score imo).  Those are the only things keeping me from giving this 0/10.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a female with self-respect, or if you're a male who respects females, I would NOT recommend this anime for you.  On the contrary, I'd tell you to stay away from it.  It's grotesque. It's disgusting.  It's degenerate. I hate to offend fans of this show but it's hard to deny what the show is trying to impose on its audience, which is ''Women belong in the kitchen.''  If you're into that, regardless of your gender, then by all means, don't let my review dampen your spirits.  It's just my (strong) opinion :P\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you're a female who wants to cook, clean, etc. for your man who doesn't show you any affection, or if you're a male who thinks females should cook, clean, etc. for you without any obligation, then this anime is Definitely for you.\\n\\n\\n\r\nGranted, I only reviewed episodes 1-4 so there might be things in later episodes that contradict my review, but come on, the first episodes were a hugely distasteful first impression, and 4 episodes goes beyond giving the benefit of the doubt.  This show has told me what it's about and I'm dropping it.  It got it's chance, and I even gave it the benefit of the doubt by going all the way to episode 4.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIt's shows like Shuffle! that give anime a bad name, and allows mainstream media to politically attack otaku culture as vulgar and in poor moral taste.",

            "content": "Shuffle is a harem anime with a mix of Angels and Demons, that really peaks ones interests... at first.\r\nThe anime starts off innocently enough, theres the required single male character, and a plethora of female leads who all want him to be theirs. Typical Harem stuff. One of the girls is a childhood friend, one is a mutual friend of him and the childhood friend, one is the daughter of the king of the demons, one is the daughter of the king of the angels, and one is an off limits loli choice with a spoiler background.\r\nDuring the first half of the series or sothe show is typical in its course of harem, having funny situations with the occasional serious bit of romance going on.\\n\\n\r\nThen the main character makes his choice as too which girl he likes.\\n\\n\r\nThe other girls don't take it so well, with one of them becoming mentally unbalanced due to his choice. The series rapidly falls from typical yet funny, to overly emotional and bad. I do like some emotion in my anime, but when the conflict between characters becomes so over the top that that actually attack one another... in a romance anime? No thank you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it had a decent begging, but a horrible ending that killed it. If it went on as it was in the begging, I couldn't foresee anything special happening that would have pushed it up to being a stand out anime, it was forced to be one of the average rated harems for all time, but then it had to go and mess that up on itself,  ending up on the bad side of things.\\n\\n\r\nI'd say most of us have better things to watch.",

            "content": "The show starts as usual with introduction of the female candidates from Rins point of view, Rin is the narrator giving their opinion on the characters and development along the way. At the start there will be plenty of ecchi and school comedy like any other Harem but Shuffle! is much more then that, soon more girls are introduced and a couple episodes later the dark pasts start to be uncovered and, as we learn more about the girls the show changes into a more dramatic development, not everything is happy and Rin always being kind and helpful tries to help everyone solve their problemsand make them happy.\\n\r\n The indecision last for most of the show as usual but the episodes are used to give the viewer a deep understanding of each girl, their personality and traits are fully explored and explained. \\n\r\nThe character development is long but well constructed and even Rin develops so expect changes and a decision towards the end. Both the comedy and ecchi scenes are very good separating right away Shuffle! from your standard harem, the beauty of this show lies in the development and the strong emotional load although, the characters are interesting and as mentioned, the development is very good, the change into a dramatic plot, featuring dark pasts and some of the stronger sad moments I ever watched is a fresh breeze in this genre. Its also easy to fall in love with the charismatic characters.\\n\r\nThe girls and the clothing are expertly drawn, all beautiful, fit perfectly composing a cheerful environment.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another plus, the music accompanies and leads the situations portrayed not only as a complement but defining the scenes and taking them to another level. The opening and ending is of the best I have seen and blends right in.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs a side note Shuffle! was based from an hentai game, a non hentai version was also launched for ps2.\\n\r\nThis is the king of the Harem style, technically superb and featuring interesting characters and plot Shuffle! defines its own style carrying great scenes in several genres: romantic, ecchi, comedy and drama, the character development is good and everything together makes it stand out from the crowd and shining on his own merit.  If you like strong dramatic scenes this show will specially interest you, features some of the best I ever seen.\\n\r\nIt immediately became one of my personal favorites of all time, I never dreamed a ecchi comedy could ever reach such high quality overall and Im afraid my words alone aren't enough to display its beauty.\\n\r\nThe only negative aspect I can possibly squeeze is the first half of the show which episodes are only \"normal\" ecchi harem style and may discourage the viewers to continue watching.\\n\r\nThe ending also feels a little light but that's just because its right after some really heavy dramatic scenes and you pretty much know who he ends up with a couple episodes before, so despite being a good end pales a bit next to the episodes right before it.\\n\\n\r\nI personally am a sucker for tragedy so I might overrate it a bit but it was so unexpected that hit me that hard. Must watch if your into drama or like me eager for an ecchi harem with deeper content.\\n",

            "content": "Overview:\r\nShuffle is an early 2000s Harem anime based on an eroge. I was recommended this title by an offline friend and my initial expectations couldn't possibly be lower. I was expecting \"Girls Bravo\" or \"DearS\", or at best something like Monster Musume or Sekirei. Instead I got an anime that while flawed...wasn't actually that bad. Stocks are rated each quarter based on whether or not they met expectations. Shuffle is basically like a small cap stock that wildly surpassed expectations. I kind of have to give it a decent rating!\r\nPros:\r\n1. \r\nShuffle, unlike most harem anime I've seen, actually has multiple characters that are likeable! Noneof them are Naru from Love Hina clones (THANK GOD). None of them were complete morons with no characteristics besides boobs. Personally I liked Sia, Narine, and Asa. Sia is the princess of the \"Gods\", although it is never explained that they created our world and are actually Gods. They are likely just an alternate dimension. Sia is fiery, athletic, and a bit of a bonehead. However, she cares deeply about her friends and respects the feelings of her romantic rivals. Narine is the princess of the \"Demons\", although they don't seem to torture the souls of dead humans and have nothing to do with traditional demons. She is a shy, intelligent, and introverted girl who wishes to court the main character to fulfill the wish of her dead sister, who had a crush on him. In many ways she predictably serves as a foil for Sia. Then there is Asa, who is constantly sickly but maintains a positive attitude despite the rough hand she has been dealt. Asa is generally the voice of reason in the series and the most reliable person to talk to when our MC male has problems. \\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\n Shuffle is a harem anime where the MC actually picks a girl at the end! Not only that, but he picks a choice you wouldn't initially expect. I was blown away by this. This may seem trivial, but in all my years of watching Harem anime I've never actually seen both of those things happen in the same show.\\n\\n\r\n3. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle doesn't have the black bars of doom or steam clouds of frustration. You want tits and ass? BAM! There it is! You don't even need to buy a special DVD. You get everything up front and in today's market that is damn refreshing!\\n\\n\r\n4.\\n\\n\r\n Shuffle not only brings the comedy with its self awareness and slapstick, and the eroticism with its constant nudity, it actually has some surprisingly touching moments. The last thing I was expecting was for an eroge harem to take me on a \"Feels Trip\". Well played Shuffle!\\n\\n\\n\r\n5. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle actually has a well done \"yandare\" character. She never does kill anyone or go on a rampage, but you constantly worry she might hurt the MC or herself. Unlike a Yuno Gasai where you know exactly what she is going to do next, this Yandare is truly unpredictable and that makes her much more nerve racking to watch. She also feels much more like a real person and less like a Loony Toons character. All of this...from an early 2000s eroge harem. I'm speechless. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMajor Flaws:\\n\\n\r\n1. \\n\\n\r\nThe last 2 episodes are TERRIBLE! This is a series that could have ended with a strong resolution in episode 22, but just HAD to have 2 extra episodes and shat itself. The plot is extended thanks to a melodramatic and out of nowhere sub-plot that could have been solved immediately, but the usual voice of reason girl decides to act completely out of established character in order to stretch out the series. I can't think of much worse writing sins than having sudden \"character derailment\" for the sole purpose of extending the plot.\\n\\n\r\n2.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is 24 episodes, but in all honesty it could easily have been 13 with maybe 3 OVAs like a Baccano or Spice and Wolf. This is supposed to be an ecchi romantic comedy. This is supposed to be fun. I should NEVER be feeling bored, yet there were some parts I found both boring and totally pointless beyond the aforementioned final 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\n3.\\n\\n\r\nFan Disservice. Of all the characters, the most pointless and least developed was by far the underage token \"Loli\" character. I realize almost all harems have this character because Tenchi did it with Sasami, but I think it's time to stop. If you aren't going to even give her character development and are just checking off a box, don't bother doing it! Also it was a REALLY bad idea to give this character full frontal scenes. At least most harems are smart enough to figure that out. Shuffle wasn't. I know it was the early 2000s and the anime industry was probably at their most lax when it came to underage nudity, but this was still stupid. Yeah some anime I like are guilty of this. The Berserk manga has its cringy as fuck \"Schierke service\". Elfen Lied had Mayu and Nana's totally pointless bath time. At least those characters were NEVER romantic options for the MC. Primula on the other hand was a possible sexual partner in the game and is clearly an official part of the harem in the anime. Damn it Japan! \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIs Shuffle the 2nd coming of Christ? No. Obviously not. However, it is still far better than the average harem anime and actually is worth watching. If nothing else you can compare it to the harem anime of today and see what has changed for the better and what has changed for the worst. Shuffle is a time capsule of the early 2000s and is the kind of anime that couldn't have been made either before or since. If you are interested in anime history and progression, and you want a harem that doesn't totally suck, Shuffle is a strong choice.\\n\\n",

            "content": "-Story\r\nThe story takes place in an alternate reality where people from the world of the gods and world of the demons can live together in peace in the world of the humans. It revolves around the main character named Rin who is a 17 year old high school student who just happens to be an inexplicable stud that girls can\u2019t seem to get enough of. One day two attractive female students show up at Rin\u2019s school to confess their love to him. Sia and Nerine are the princesses of the world of the gods and the world of the demons, respectively.  Each girl fellin love with Rin when they were young children who traveled to the world of the humans for a day. There are three others girls in the mix for winning Rin\u2019s heart and this is what sets up the premise of the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe first eleven episodes are what you\u2019d expect from a typical harem anime. The girls are each trying to win Rin over and there is a nice amount of comedy involved. The series starts off fairly entertaining but does a complete 180 about halfway through. This is where things get bad. The series decides to get serious out of nowhere and the scenario leading to this serious tone is completely random and not well explained. I won\u2019t go into detail to avoid spoilers, but this is the only time we get a glimpse into the world of the demons. Just a brief look into a secluded laboratory residing in the that world. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle introduced us to the interesting concept of various worlds but the idea is completely abandoned for no good reason. It would have been great to explore both worlds and see what makes them unique and how the gods and the demons live and interact with each other in their own environment. Unfortunately, we get no insight into these worlds. Other than being a polygamous society, which is mentioned countless times, we know nothing about the gods or their world and we get very little information about the demon world as well. One of the things that set apart demons and gods from humans is their ability to use magic which is hardly ever explored and only used two or three times. \\n\\n\r\nEventually the first serious predicament comes to a resolution, which is achieved with no explanation and things just \u201cgo back to normal.\u201d The series then goes back to a more light-hearted nature for a couple of episodes and resumes the girls pursuit of Rin. However, most of the girls are literally thrown on the back burner from the get-go. Rin makes his decision out of nowhere and his choice is certainly unexpected. Shortly after the serious tone comes back into play. More random revelations lead to a bunch of drama that eventually results in a terrible ending.\\n\\n\r\n-Characters\\n\\n\r\nSia is the princess of the gods. She has a bubbly and playful personality, but packs a mean punch. Her reasons for falling in love with Rin are about as stupid as they come. One day when she was nine (approx. 8 years ago) she got lost in the human world where she ran into Rin who played with her and helped her find her way home. Of course it makes sense to fall madly in love with a kid you\u2019ve met once when you were nine, so naturally you would leave your own world to confess your love and marry this stranger. Sia is a likable character but her personality is one-dimensional and her reasons for loving Rin are straight up senseless. \\n\\n\r\nNerine is the princess of the demons. She\u2019s very introverted and has a shy and innocent personality. She fell in love with Rin for very similar reasons as Sia, however, thanks to one of the random revelations in the latter half of the series her reasons for loving Rin are even more illogical than Sia\u2019s. Ultimately, Nerine is a dry character who contributes little to the story and is often shoved to the side and forgotten. \\n\\n\r\nKaede is Rin\u2019s roommate and childhood friend. After Kaede loses her mother and Rin loses both parents in a car accident, that occurred when they were kids, Kaede\u2019s father takes Rin in and they\u2019ve lived together ever since. Kaede is the most dull character in the series and one of the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. Her only reason for living is to take care of Rin who clearly has no interest in her and often treats her like crap. She rarely displays any emotion outside of the occasional whimpering for Rin and has the personality of a rock. I think they want you to fell sorry for her but I find it very hard to feel sorry for a character who is so dense and emotionless. Later in the series her personality takes a massive turn. I won\u2019t give anything away but the transition is out of the blue and made me go from feeling indifferent to her character to flat-out disliking her. But of course she just snaps back to her old dull self like nothing happened later on. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t have much to say about Primula. She\u2019s a cute and likable character but she possesses little in terms of personality and feels like a supporting character with little to add to the series (other than the random turning point). \\n\\n\r\nAsa is my personal favorite. Her personality is similar to Sia\u2019s, bubbly and energetic, and she seems to have the most genuine reasons for liking Rin. She displays a wide range of emotions and receives the most character development. However, the stubbornness and sheer stupidity that she displays in the last couple of episodes is quite annoying.\\n\\n\r\nFinally we\u2019ve got our main protagonist, Rin! Rin has a dull personality, he\u2019s extremely indecisive, and is often an asshole to girls. He often leads the girls on and then displays random spurts of affection that come off as disingenuous. Rin is, simply put, a terrible lead character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some supporting characters as well. Two of them are the king of the gods and the king of the demons, Sia\u2019s and Nerine\u2019s dads, respectively. Both of the dads add great comedic relief to the series but, unfortunately, after the first eleven episodes they\u2019re almost completely forgotten. Itskui is the typical pervert who is Rin\u2019s best friend and also does a fair job of adding some comedy to the series. Itskui\u2019s sidekick Thyme is the \u201cflat-chested\u201d girl who is always keeping Itskui in check and one of the few females in the series who isn\u2019t head-over-heels for Rin.\\n\\n\r\n-Art & Animation\\n\\n\r\nNothing to write home about. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound\\n\\n\r\nAverage at best. The opening is pretty good. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall\\n\\n\r\nShuffle had some potential. It took a unique approach to the Harem genre by taking a very serious tone to the series. Its also one of the few Harem anime that results in the protagonist actually choosing a girl to date. However, it abruptly switches gears from a light-hearted comedy to a serious drama. The transition is random and alarming. I don\u2019t mind it going in this direction and as I mentioned its actually a unique and an unexpected approach to the genre. Unfortunately the plot becomes convoluted and relies heavily on unreasonable events, poor character development, and random shock value. There are countless plot holes and interesting concepts that were introduced in the beginning of the series are abandoned and never revisited. Most of the characters take a backseat to Rin and the girl that he chooses halfway through the series and any vested interest in those other characters is gone with the wind. The last few episodes crank up the drama to full-blast and in true Shuffle fashion slams on the breaks and delivers an ending that feels random and out-of-place. \\n\\n\r\n-Final Verdict \\n\\n\r\nI give this series a 4 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be hard for me to recommend this series, but if you have a lot of free time on your hands and want to watch an unconventional harem I guess you can give it a shot. Just remember to keep your expectations very low. \\n",

            "content": "I'll start out my review by saying this is my first review, and it is all my personal opinion, and I wanted to write this review because I find the other reviews to be too optimistic and praising of this somewhat mediocre anime.\r\nThat said, lets begin the review of Shuffle!\r\nStory - 6/10\r\nShuffle! is a Harem/Romance series mostly, and although it has an ecchi tag it's only minor, and the fanservice is very limited. (Honestly, I've seen more fanservice in non-ecchi series.) In the beginning of the story, the main character gets introduced to a couple of girls who want to be with him, and sothe average harem story begins. The first 18 or so episodes, it's very unoriginal and actually quite boring to watch, and only after that it gets \"serious\". I can't really say what happens without spoilering it, but this arc in the story is pretty good and there's plenty of suffering. However, this does not change the fact that the first 18 or so episodes were absolutely horrible and the fact that I gave the anime a 7 is thanks to this last arc. Without this last arc, it would probably be a 5 or even lower. So it is worth it to grind your way through the first part of the anime.\\n\r\nSure, there is character developement but it's nothing major or groundbreaking and it's also quite vague why all those girls like the main character. (Seriously, liking someone because he played with you one time eight years ago?)\\n\r\nThere's also this story of the world being linked with the word of Gods and Devils, but this is very forgettable and it seems like the only reason they added this was to have girls with pointy elf ears. Only one time in the story these linked worlds are actually apparant, and it's not even something great or cool, they just go there for one episode and it's never mentioned again.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7/10\\n\r\nAlthough it's not really my taste (I like the more modern anime style more) it's pretty good but nothing outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7/10\\n\r\nNothing too special here either, the voice actors were pretty okay and they fit their character. OP/ED were not noteworthy, background music was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 8/10\\n\r\nThe fact that I gave it an 8/10 does not mean all characters are good and well developed. I'll start by saying the most negative things; the \"God\" and \"Devil\" characters are complete retards who do nothing noteworthy the entire story, and are only there for comic relief. How people like that came to be the King of Gods/Devils is impressive. The main character is also very dense but near the end of the story he gets his act together and actually does some good things.\\n\r\nNow there's the girls, the daughter of God and the daughter of the Devil are your average MC-liking girls, and while they do have somewhat of a backstory, it's nothing that develops the story in any way (or interesting).\\n\r\nThe girl who lives with the main character, Fuyou Kaede is very kind and has a somewhat interesting backstory. There's also the energetic Senpai who is deadly ill, and while she can recover any time she wants, she doesn't want to for some reason which is never explained. (I can't elaborate without spoilering, just watch it and judge.)\\n\r\nThere's also the usual perverted friend, and for some reason every boy in the school is out to kill the main character just because they like his girls too.\\n\r\nOverall, this show has some good and really bad characters. Most girls are likable too and in my opinion the best one won, but I feel bad for the one who mainly lost.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6/10\\n\r\nI honestly do not know why I kept watching this anime. As I've said, the first 18 or so episodes are absolutely horrible and only after that the story gets good. I kept watching with the hope of something interesting happening, and to my enjoyment the last story arc was pretty interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7/10\\n\r\nShuffle! is an allright anime. The first 18 episodes are just horrible and unoriginal while the episodes following are interesting and good. I can not recommend this anime to anyone, unless you have the time and patience to watch through the first 18 episodes and get rewarded with an allright/good-but-not-excellent last arc. The story ends with a winning girl, but a potential season 2 hint is also included (although eight years later they probably won't make another season). \\n\r\nThe part about Gods and Devils adds absolutely nothing to the story and there is little Ecchi to speak about. If I were to name the genres for this anime they would probably be [\"School\", \"Drama\", \"Romance\", \"Harem\"].",

            "content": "This anime isn't good and isn't bad. I honestly have to say that it's in between in terms of what they did right and wrong with this series.\r\nFirst of all, making an anime series based off a visual novel is definitely a difficult thing to pull off, especially a visual novel with \"explicit\" content. Not only do you have to somehow incorporate each character into the story, whereas in visual novels it typically focuses on just one character, there's the ending where the main character eventually ends up with only one girl. \r\nThis usually throws off the entire idea of a visual novel where youcontrol the character and the choices he makes. \\n\\n\r\nTo start off this review, let's go over the plot of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story evolves around a typical visual novel character named Rin Tsuchimi. He's indecisive, fairly dense, moderate in terms of looks and talent, and of course a lot of girls that are in love with him. \\n\\n\r\nRin's parents died when he was very young, and moved in with Kaede and her father. Although he was never officially adopted, they still live under the same roof. \\n\\n\r\nRin lives in a world where the angel's realm and the demon's realm met up with the human realm, and they all started living together because we all love peace.\\n\\n\r\nWhen he turns seventeen, however, he meets two girls who are the princesses of their realm. There's Sia of the angel realm and Nerine of the demon realm. Each met him when they were only nine years old and he helped them when they were lost in the human realm. Now that they are of age to marry, they both choose Rin as the most suitable candidate.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, there are a lot of other girls in this anime who fall in love with Rin, and in the end there can only be one. Who did he choose out of the girls that were in love with him?\\n\\n\r\nWell, I'm not going to give off any spoilers, but I'll break it down for you as much as I can without giving too much away. And this is the part of the anime where I review what was good and what was bad.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the comedy in this anime is perfect. Most notably the parts where the king of the angel realm and the king of the demon realm hang out together. That's right, they're best friends.\\n\\n\r\nThese two made such an incredible combo, and they could have made an incredible spin-off series just based on these two characters. But alas, we only have the original anime.\\n\\n\r\nRather than the royal duo (see what I did there), there are a lot of moments where you'll laugh out loud rather out of irony, coincidence, or simple second-hand embarrassment. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what truly ruined this anime for me was the character and plot development.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of the anime seemed like pure filler after the first episode. For the first twelve episodes, there's nothing but comedic relief and a few parts that make you connect to the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn't until the second half of the anime where the series tries to create a real story and develop the characters more. Did they pull it off?\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely freakin` not.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was rushed and made absolutely no sense at all. \\n\r\nThat, or it completely made you lose hope in the character all together since they turned out to be someone that they're not.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the character development was overdone, senseless and extremely melodramatic. Not to mention the unnecessary fan service parts. It completely ruined the characters and any hope that I had in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can't even begin to talk about the protagonist. All I want to say about him is that he's simply a pathetic human. And if this is really the kind of guy that a \"perfect\" girl will fall head over heals for, then there is no more hope for humanity.\\n\\n\r\nRemember how I said earlier that there can only be one girl in the end that the main character falls for? \\n\\n\r\nActually, I can't really say who it is, even though I want to tell you so badly\\n\r\nsince there's rules on this site that tell me I can't give off spoilers. But if you\\n\r\nabsolutely want to find out, read the first column of this paragraph. \\n\\n\r\nWithout spoilers, though, the character which Rin falls for wasn't incorporated into the story that well. In fact, she felt more like a side character rather than the girl Rin should have fell in love with. Again, I refer to this anime's terrible character and plot development. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I now find it easy to believe that any anime that's based off a visual novel, or any echi-style anime. Only a few anime's I know based on a visual novel or a harem setting worked out. One of them is Clannad, but even that anime had a few problems in terms of story development.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely would not recommend this anime. It was a complete disappointment despite it's excellent comedic.\\n\\n\r\nTHE VERDICT:\\n\\n\r\n+ Great Comedy\\n\r\n+ Good Animation/music\\n\r\n- Pathetic Lead\\n\r\n- Terrible Character/Plot Development\\n\r\n- Unnecessary Fan Service\\n\r\n- Too Much Filler\\n\\n\r\nSCORE: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nDo Not Watch!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I'm going to try to hit all of the bases with this review because Shuffle! has a wide range of mixed views and I can see everyone's point on why they did or didn't like it.\r\nPlot: Me being a Fantasy lover, I did enjoy the plot. In Shuffle!, there are two worlds that parallel the human world, the world of the Gods and the world of the Demons. Each ruled by a king, who are actually best friends and each one has a daughter that at one point in their lives, comes to the human word and falls for a guy named Rin (pronouncedR-EE-N). Both of these girls wish to marry him. With this being a harem anime, there are also many other love interests involved such as the girl Rin lives with and one of his best friends he's known for a long time. They all go to the same high school and they are friends, but each one has individual secrets that are revealed throughout the series.\\n\r\nSince I am not a fan of girls throwing themselves at a guy, but I love the idea of the different worlds, so I gave the plot an 8. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I rated the artwork a 10, because it was original and the characters didn't look anything alike so unlike other anime, it was difficult to get them confused. The art was a ten for me, but the high amounts of fan service was ridiculous and ruined some of the anime for me, but not enough to stop watching it, because the anime itself was original and I wanted to finish it without regrets.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I have to admit that the opening and  ending songs got stuck in my head, so I gave the sound a 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is where many people found that Shuffle! failed many viewers. (I'm trying my best not to include spoilers) Rin himself is surrounded by beautiful girls and each one goes on individual dates with him at one point or another, and yet he never tells any of the girls his feelings. It frustrates many that he is willing to lead girls on with no emotion whatsoever. I myself found it frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the characters later in the show develop glitches in their personalities that ruins the individuality that I can to love at the beginning of the show. The sweet character turns a complete 180 and turns into an aggressive crazy chick, which I can only compare to School Days (I really didn't like that anime btw). One of the characters that I enjoyed because of her independence turns not only clingy, but slutty as well. \\n\r\nThe other characters kept to the personalities that they originally started with. Because of my love for the characters toward the beginning of the show, but the unfortunate let down towards the end, I'd have to give the characters a 6. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: My love for certain characters throughout the entire series is what kept me going, and I still have to say that it wasn't TERRIBLE, but it doesn't make my top 10 when it comes to characters and outcome. Certain aspects of this show will stay with me and I might even watch the first episode every once in a while or listen to one of the songs now and again. \\n\r\nTo summarize it to just a number: 6.5 (rounded up to seven)\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for reading!        \\n",

Exactly at the 20th episode I was like \" I should have done my nails instead\". The story was so shallow...... yeah shallow couldn't think of a better word to describe it. \r\nArt: Great.. its the only thing that got me to finish the anime.\r\nCharacter: This is why I had the urge to write a review. I'll start with the protagonist. Fine.. he is kind thats why everybody is going gaga 'bout himbut his indecisiveness is really lame. I've seen quite a few harem type animes and this is the first  one that got me really annoyed about the protagonist.  There isnt really a strong force that would make you feel attached to his character.  And then the girls.. I guess their characters are fine except for being martyrs. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I had a fairly good laugh once in awhile.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Poor.  Not a good recommendation to anybody. Well I have to move on now.",

            "content": "To start off, I must start by saying that if you are having second thoughts about Shuffle; give it a try. At first, I didn't really want to watch it either. What I loved about this anime is that in the end main character Rin Tsuchimi needs to decide who he wants to spend the rest of his life with. I admire how they dont just end the anime with all of Rin's lovers deciding that they are all going to love him together like in the ending of To Love Ru, Asobi ni Iku Yo!, etc... I tend to dislike the animes that justgive up and say, \"Hey, let's just make all the girls fall in love with this one guy.\" Shuffle is different, as I said earlier our main character, Rin, needs to make one of the biggest decisions of his life.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: Shuffle is definetly one of those animes that you can easily predict what will happen next. I found myself scene after scene saying to myself... \"OMG SHIT'S GOING DOWN NOW!!! __________ is guna happen next and 9 times out of 10. It happened, However Shuffle makes up for this with it's very amazing character development\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Some of the characters such as Shigure, Asa and  Mayumi, Thyme completely make the anime into an amazing comedy. I won't reveal any of the scenes because I'm not into spoiling animes. \\n\\n\r\nI understand this review short, (to ur standards maybe poor), and doesn't really go into depth, but to tell you the truth if you looked at my review and said to yourself, \"You know what, maybe I will watch this anime and have myself a good laugh and see who Rin chooses in the end.\"\\n\\n\r\nMy goal for this review is to get the reader to make a second decision. If you are thinking about skipping this anime I strongly recommend that you reconsider. Shuffle is full of classic comedy, and i can promise you that you will find it enjoyable. My main inspiration of writing this review is after seeing yet another anime where the main male character falls in love with every single female character that he meets in the harem. To me, that's just like a middle finger to us viewers. Now don't get me wrong, those types of animes are still very enjoyable. However, after a while they do get repetitive and Shuffle is a nice change of pace. I can guarantee that you will like what Shuffle has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review, it's literally my 3rd review and I don't really have much experience. But as long as my short review got some sort of reaction in you then that's what I was aiming for. \\n\\n\r\nNow do us all a favor:\\n\r\n1. Open a nice can of Mountain Dew\\n\r\n2. Turn on your laptop (or if you have a ps3 or Xbox (Netflix) )\\n\r\n3. Watch Shuffle for at least 6 episodes\\n\r\n4. You will definetly get hooked\\n\r\n5. Get another freaking mountain dew \\n\r\n6. Finish Shuffle XD",

            "content": "Shuffle!\r\nStory (7/10)\r\nShuffle is your stereotypical harem. There's one guy and five girls and they all want to win his affections. There's really not a heck of a lot of originality put into the plot or the back-stories of any of the girls, either, but they're different enough save for two that it doesn't get repetitive. The good thing about the story is that it's straightforward -- you can really turn your brain off and stuff enjoy the ride and have the emotional thrills, laughs, and sadness. Despite being so stereotypical in its setup it manages to incorporate a good variety of emotions.\r\nThe best thing story-wiseabout Shuffle was unlike most harem you never know which girl the guy is going to pick until he picks her. That's one of the core things that kept me watching. I kept hoping he'd pick the girl I was rooting for. Of course I won't spoil who Rin picks in the end, but I'll just say keep watching, because you're constantly guessing at it throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nThe art in Shuffle was nothing spectacular. It was nice, and that's really all there was to it. Sometimes it can get kind of choppy but most of the time it was fairly nice and flowed well. No real complaints here. Although I do have to say I love Aoi Nishimata's art and the character designs were cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe sound was good. Again, nothing special, but it was good. The seiyuu did a very good job (I personally think Kaede's and Primula's seiyuu were the best) and the music was okay and fitted the anime nicely. The opening song was incredibly catchy though! Will forever be on my top 25 most played, probably.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nSince Shuffle is a harem, all the main characters are different broad archetypes of personalities and looks. Thankfully, instead of the characters just being empty stereotypes, they have fairly interesting back-stories and just a little more to the archetype with their own little individualities. As I said above when I was talking about the art/animation, the character designs are cute and Aoi Nishimata does pretty good artwork. It's almost guaranteed you'll come out of Shuffle liking at least one of the girls and having a favorite that you wanted to win Rin's affections, whether this girl was the winner of the war of love or not.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\r\nEnjoyment varies from person to person. However, even though Shuffle is a stereotypical harem with generic character archetypes, merely decent art and a good dose of ecchi, which usually isn't for me... it was fun. It was a very fun ride. Shuffle has this mysterious element of enjoyability to it. So if you're looking for a fun romance with a good deal of comedy and ecchi (though it has a good deal of very serious bits too) try and pick up Shuffle.",

He's been living with his childhood friend who's been taking care of Rin for a while now. Her name is Kaede Fuyou. But one day Rin meets 2 girls from his past named Sia and Nerine. But soon after the girls fall in love with Rin. \r\nThis anime is full of heartwarming and heartbreaking moments. A story of one man's decisions and adventures, full of love triangles, and memories. \r\nThis story is loveable because it has Comedy and Drama in it all at the same time. The story should deserve a 9/10 because it'sa heartwarming story of love and hate and it's twists and turns. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe art for Shuffle! is flawless. Thanks to Suzuhira, Hiro and Nishimata, Aoi for creating the characters. They all look gorgeous, stunning, perfect. It makes it realistic and believable, just like any good anime should. The scenery was what it should be. Japanese neighborhoods and homes, Japanese schools, malls, train stations, rainy days, sunny days. Watching the sunny days on my moniter made me feel all warm. It was complety real. Good job! &lt;3\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were perfect. It fitted the story plot/theme. [: Yuria is a good singer, I love that song &quot;You&quot; by her. The lyrics were genius.  Also the people who did the voices for the charaters. It really did fit the charater's apperence and personailty. And they really did show emotions in their acting, which is sometimes hard to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Shuffle! were ah-mazing. They were alive and realistic, more than you can ask for. I loved every character, and none of them felt boring or dumb to me. Also, their outfits and apperence were great. I loved the hair and the eyes. :D But, I gave the characters 9/10 because sometimes I just felt that there wasn't enough information given on them, they really needed to show who they were in the inside and outside.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nI loved this anime so much. It made me laugh it made me cry, it made me feel what I should feel, and that's what makes up a great anime. Of course, a person who doesn't like  Comedy, Romance, Drama, Harem, and Ecchi animes might not like this one, but don't get my wrong, this is a fantastic anime. Shuffle! was truely addiction, every single second of it was splendid. \\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Shuffle! I suggest you try Shuffle! Memories. It's basically a lookback on Shuffle and more. [:",

So fine that they live together and what not all peacefully! A teenage boy named Rin gets extremely lucky one day. He becomes the main character of a freaking harem Anime! To begin, he lives with his childhood friend Kaede, but his new neighbors are totally in love with him too. He has many admirers: the daughter of the Gods, Sia, and the daughter of the demons, Nerine, are both deeply in love with Rinafter having met him the past. Along with his friendship with older woman Asa and his encounter with the silent but cute Primula, Rin has much on his hands dealing with the affections of all of these insane girls who love him way too much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nReactions:\\n\\n\r\nWell personally I thought that this Anime was so-so. Seeing as it is based on a triple X wtf eroge game, I kind of figured it was about one guy and a lot of women surrounded by him. To begin, the guy was kind of ugly and his personality was meh. If I was a woman I would personally go for another guy, but of course as you can see...they all love Rin. Each of the girls has a different type of personality from childhood friend to hyper-active upperclassmen...etc. Which kind of makes it fun, but then again most of the time they are all catering to this lame, pathetic excuse for a man Rin. JUST FREAKING DITCH THIS MAN ALREADY PEOPLE. He sucks. \\n\\n\r\nThis plot totally makes no sense. It seems rather dry because all that the character do is...CATER TO THIS MAIN CHARACTER. I'm sure they catered this to the average man who would want girls on their hand and foot like that. The whole Anime feels rather fake. Maybe they should make these girls more 'realistic' ya know?\\n\\n\r\nRin only ends up with one person in the end of course. But who? Well I am going to have to make you watch the crappy drama and what not to find out. Too bad, I can't spoil the Anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this Anime is like some kind of funky Japanese Soap Opera. It has its ups-and-downs. Watch at your own risk. I was about to drop it myself, but I was just curious as to who the jerk would end up with!\\n\\n\r\nHowever, if you do not want to watch it because I would never, ever want to watch it again...look it up online.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend this Anime for guys more than girls in the end. It is more of a guy anime than a girl anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nHappy Anime Hunting!~ The above review is my opinion and it may not be the same as yours. I respect other people's opinions because one person's vision of an Anime can be totally different from another vision. People perceive things in different ways.",

For those who have never seen a show of this genre, it's probably a good place to start to accumulate a background on the common traits of these types of shows.  Besides that it's a pretty unexceptional show, and a rather poor adaptation of its related visual novel (having experienced both, I will immediately tell you the visual novel is by far superior).\r\nStarting with whats good, this show is not particularly animated most of the time being more onthe lines of slice of life (although there are a few notable exceptions). That being said it's mostly an aesthetically pleasing show with well drawn characters, and of course, it can't really hurt to have a lot of beautiful girls in the main cast can it? A few dramatic moments here and there did get some good visual emphasis as well. The voice actors (both English and Japanese) are pretty well chosen for the most part, and fans of the visual novel can at least appreciate the reuse of the same Japanese actors. Being based on an eroge, this show does present some obvious nudity, but for the most part it's not overdone, and it's usually humorous, so it generally shouldn't detract from your viewing experience much, if it even does.\\n\\n\r\nThe visual novel doesn't necessarily have the best plot ever, and unfortunately one of the problems with this show is trying too hard to fit too much all at once. Besides the fact that obviously Rin is only supposed to end up with one of the girls, the way Shuffle! attempts to translate all the routes into some kind of relevant single story ends up leaving our main protagonist Rin a very weak and indecisive man. This above all else is the single biggest flaw of Shuffle! the anime, a horrible main protagonist who is never willing to commit to anything, leaving many many people hanging and feeling desperate. This alone makes most of the characters (namely the girls and Rin) have seemingly shallow motivations, and is a primary reason why the visual novel is superior, since there is no indecision on Rin's part when you as the player make all the important choices.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part the show generally tries to cut and paste stuff that happened from the visual novel into the show. To be fair though, a few things like Kaede's background and maybe to a lesser extent Sia's as well do get directed in a more interesting way than the visual novel presents. So for the sake of saying whether or not the anime does anything to separate itself from the visual novel, there is something to consider.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Shuffle! is a fairly average show. It's mostly okay, a few good moments here and there, and unfortunately the show is held back by a lame protagonist, who as a result makes much of the plot a lot more lame than it should be.  If you're still curious about learning what the romantic harem genre has to offer, this show is definitely one to consider looking into.",

            "content": "NOTES:\r\nFirst review ever, so don't be too angry if it's not as good as you'd like.  :)\r\nThis is a review for people who are looking to watch the show/interested in overarching details.\r\n------------\r\nI'm going to try and be as absolutely forgiving to this anime as I possibly can be, because for the better part of the series, I enjoyed the living hell out of it.\r\nHowever, after investing my psyche in a story about a supposed harem contest between what you could call a flock of girls (three of which happened to be supernaturally-inclined), I got a serving of the most unnecessarily dramatic and overly playedformula that the writers could have come up with, and for that, I have to call this anime what it is: contrived dreck.\\n\\n\r\nOn with the review!\\n\\n\r\nThe ART was amazing - really over par for the time in which it was drawn.  Sometimes when the characters' faces would be at different angles, I was a bit upset with the hasty way that the animators would kinda just slap some facial features on there and really not care about where they ended up, but hey, it's a cartoon first and foremost so I can't really be too judgmental about that.  The backdrops, the animation and the visual stills were really well done, so I gave it an 8 overall.\\n\\n\r\nThe SOUND was also well done.  Seiyuus portrayed their characters just how I would have thought they would have sounded, and the emotion was definitely where it needed to be.  I never watched the OP/ED, but from what I did get just by not being able to be completely accurate with my video position bar, it sounded like every other cheesy harem anthem, so I can't really call it out for that (maybe for lack of originality - I digress).  The music was largely forgettable and didn't really sound as though it was a large part of the budget, but it added to the mood when necessary and wasn't overtly unwelcome - gave this category a 7.\\n\\n\r\nHere's where I get nasty.\\n\\n\r\nThe CHARACTERS were stereotypical, unimaginative, overly dramatic and largely disappointing.  To avoid spoilers (and the rage that would spill into my writing from thinking about their personas in-depth again), I'm going to simply give an  overarching synopsis of why I felt the characters could have been about 178,000 times better than they were.\\n\\n\r\nIn most situations, the characters played their assigned role - by about episode 7, every character you were introduced to had their persona already laid out flat, and you or I could have written the dialogue for them from there.  This is not what upset me the most, as it is what those of us who watch the harem/rom-com/drama genre have come to expect in terms of character depth (which in and of itself is kind of a travesty - I digress).\\n\\n\r\nWhat really pissed me off about the writers' lack of imagination is that they tried to cover it up by throwing curveballs at both the characters and the viewer that were ABSOLUTELY contrived and COMPLETELY irrelevant whilst still trying to remain in a genre that they had forsaken long before then.  A note to the writers on this: when you write a character the same for 2/3rd's of a series and then decide LET'S CHANGE THEIR PERSONALITY BECAUSE WE CAN or some other bullshit, this does not \"make things fresh\" or \"add intrigue\" - you'll get some \"what the fuck\" factor and it infuriates most involved viewers.\\n\\n\r\nSome would argue that the twists thrown in add to the atmosphere and that the drama was necessary - to these people, I say \"Did you watch the first half to two-thirds of the show?\"  It is both DISMANTLING to a plot line and VERY UNSETTLING to see a show go from overly cute and bubbly to downright nasty in the span of an episode.  There's no build up, and over the course of the past twelve to thirteen episodes, you've given me nothing but panty shot after panty shot mixed in with an un/fortunate situation thrown in every now and again - now you slap me in the face with an overly serious situation that rivals Jersey Shore levels of what these writers would call dramatic plot movement WITHOUT maintaining the cuteness you'd been stringing me along with for the past FOREVER?  M. Night Shayamayamyamaymayamalan could write better twists, AND at least he'd have the decency not to lie to me for 15 episodes about it.  It's like the show tried to emulate what another show (Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, a FANTASTIC dark comedy) did, but they forgot to tell their viewers.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is screen time: at one point in the series, the two most important girls to the story up to that point (those who are vying to marry our male lead) completely disappear without a word from the other characters as to what's going on with them, even though ; this would have been acceptable and even welcome had it been for an episode - maybe two, but it literally happens for about three to four episodes, and when they finally DO come back into the story, they've been relegated to overtly stereotypical dialogue and AT BEST an auxiliary character role.  I gave the CHARACTERS category a 4 because before the writers decided to screw up the roles and give every character some atrocious character flaw, I actually enjoyed the stereotypical interactions.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the STORY.  This is probably where I find the most wrong with the anime, and also where I have the least to say - simply because, the one and only thing I found atrocious about this story is that there really wasn't one, and they were trying so hard in the beginning to present a coherent comedic romance.\\n\\n\r\nWith a few, very MINOR exceptions, there is no such thing as 'missing an episode' with this series; because of the way that the writers decided to introduce character flaws and try to add what they thought were appropriate levels of drama, they completely destroyed what semblance of a plot line they had and any interaction at all before those points becomes absolutely meaningless - not to mention the LITANY of re-uses of written lines and plot devices to try and maintain said levels of what they thought was \"drama\".  I gave the STORY category a 5 as well, simply because for the majority of the beginning of the series, I was enjoying what could be called the plot.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL, I found this series to start fantastically strong but finish with a bitter taste in my mouth, an underhanded and unwelcome attempt to become a different genre, and characters that (as time went on) became more and more unbearable to watch.  Had Shuffle! stuck with the rom-com/harem-style from start to finish, this could have been another fantastic addition to the genre (and not to mention some super pantsu shots) - instead, the writers tried to add depth where it wasn't necessary, drama where it wasn't wanted, and twists that not only made the characters dull and used, but also overly self-righteous and sometimes downright stupid.\\n\\n\r\nHope you find this review helpful!",

            "content": "Story:\r\nThis is where Shuffle! excels the most. There are at least 4 or 5 arcs packed into 24 episodes, so by the time you finish, you can&rsquo;t say you didn&rsquo;t get your money&rsquo;s worth. I was hesitant about watching at first, but this anime can&rsquo;t be judged by the impression the first two episodes give, because there&rsquo;s a whole lot more to it. Every episode you learn a little more about a certain character, which makes a good incentive to continue. Most of the plot is filled with twists, but some episodes (especially the last few) are predictable. \r\nArt:\r\nThis anime looks much older than itreally is. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because of the shading or choice of colors, but the characters look really flat, which takes some getting used to. If I had to make a comparison, I&rsquo;d say this anime looks like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. What I do like is that the animation is very fluid. It&rsquo;s like watching an oil painting in motion. The backgrounds and lighting effects are especially nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP and ED themes immediately became one of my favorites the first time I heard it. It was hard to stop listening and sometimes I found myself humming them. The BGM on the other hand is a whole different story. Most of the tunes sound like something out of a 90&rsquo;s video game. Again, it makes the anime feel more dated than it really is. Although I guess you could call it nostalgic if you want to, since the characters are in their teens. It&rsquo;s unique, but definitely not for everyone. Even worse, it gets repetitive pretty quickly, but at least the right tunes are always played at the right time according to what&rsquo;s happening on screen.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nRarely have I seen characters with this much personality. Both the male and female characters are nicely developed (no pun intended). The girls are beautiful on the outside, yet they each have their own set of flaws. I&rsquo;m sure everyone who watches Shuffle! will find a favorite character -- mine&rsquo;s Kaede, followed by Primula. XD But I wish some characters would have had more screen time. It seemed two or three girls took over the show while the rest of the cast was placed behind, which is really unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI recommend everyone to watch Shuffle! because there&rsquo;s something for everybody -- comedy, romance, happiness, sadness, and even good fan service. Shuffle! is downright funny, but will have you on the edge of your seat just as often.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThere are many harem animes out there, but Shuffle! is one of the few that does it right. As I mentioned above, despite its looks, this isn&rsquo;t your run-of-the-mill anime. If you&rsquo;re looking for a good romance, a light-hearted comedy, or just something with a bunch of twists, Shuffle! is one anime that you won&rsquo;t forget about anytime soon.",

            "content": "Let me just explain that when I picked up this anime, I had just finished watching AnoHana, and was hoping for a light-hearted romance/comedy/harem to let my brain settle before delving into another intense anime. But Shuffle! was NOT as easy-going as I was expecting. So although this anime was good, it was not what I was expecting, and therefore I may be a tad bias in my review. \r\nStory: 7\r\nAs far as the story goes, I liked the idea of Gods, Demons and Humans all living together. I'm a fan of the comedy/romance/drama/harem genre. And I like how they tie magic into the wholeseries. So why am I only giving the story a 7? \\n\\n\r\nLet me try to explain my thinking with a simple episode breakdown:\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 1-12ish: Character building episodes. Really basic. A simple problem each episode that is resolved by the end of the episode, and reveals bits and pieces of each characters personality. Although these episodes are essential for the rest of the anime, they do tend to drag on a little. So I wasn't a big fan of that. NOTE: The atmosphere in these episodes are light and romantic, standard for the genre.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 13ish-16ish: An arch is given that takes all attention off of the main plot(Rin's love life) and focuses on one character(Primula, who is not fighting for Rin's affection). Although the arch wasn't bad, it was a complete and sudden change of atmosphere, from light and romantic to dramatic and magical. This again isn't a bad thing, it's just not what I was expecting from the show. ANOTHER NOTE: Throughout this point, the anime did a really good job of keeping me guessing as far as who Rin would choose, which is surprising. In this kind of anime, it is usually painfully obvious which girl the main character is going to end up with. But in Shuffle!, i thought I had it narrowed down to one of two girls, but I was completely wrong. Which is a big plus for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEpisodes 17ish-24ish: ALL. HELL. BREAKS. LOOSE. An obsessive girl with the inability to move on + a guy who is ready to move on + a whole lot of tears + one character being hospitalized + a late game suicide attempt + somehow a happy ending = My brain falling apart and me repeatedly asking \"what the hell is going on here?\" The anime plunges into emotions, drama, and painful flashbacks at a pace that left my head spinning. Again, I love emotion-filled romance/drama animes(like AnoHana), but I had JUST finished AnoHana before watching Shuffle!, so these episodes were NOT what I was expecting/hoping for from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story didn't have any major holes in it, and it all wrapped up nicely without leaving me feeling overly rushed. Had I been expecting the ending to be so... dark... then I would have gladly given the story a 9, but whereas I was hoping for a lighter watch, I only gave it a 7. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I know, the anime had pretty good art for an anime created in 2006. The series did go a tad overboard with fan service, but I'm a 17 year old guy, so I'm not complaining.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nAgain, as far as I know, the sound effects were pretty good for an anime created in 2006. The opening song was rather catchy, and the end song was nothing spectacular, so an 8 here seems fair.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show had a terrific cast of characters. Each girl had their own unique background story, so even though each fell into one clich\u00e9 or another, they still felt fresh. Primula was one of those characters that won't be forgotten easily, just because of how adorable she is. \\n\\n\r\nI did have one big problem with this anime though; Rin, the male lead. It was downright annoying how 99% of the people around him would do ANYTHING to get closer to him. It was just obnoxious. It's impossible to put into words how much I detest Rin. BUT, aside from my strong hatred of Rin, all of the other characters bring something cute/unique/hilarious to the table, so I give it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7 \\n\\n\r\nAgain, my enjoyment is heavily affected by how different the show was from what I expected. But I still enjoyed the show quite a bit, so a 7 seems fair enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nThis show has a little something for everyone; whether it be the romance, comedy, drama, school life, magic, or fan service, you name it, this anime has it. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who is willing to deal with an annoying male lead in exchange for a pretty darn good romance/comedy/harem/drama/school life anime.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is my first review, so if you have ANY feedback(good or bad) just send me an email/message/whatever, and I will try to make my next review better. :)",

In fact, there are only 2 serious/emotionally-driven scenes where they use magic in this series and neither are against any adversary/foe and bothare in the more-to-the point second season. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle is probably one of the better harem anime. The first season has a lot of comic relief whereas the second is much more serious comparatively, though both have their pros and cons. The first season is more about character connections than it is the main plot which, you'll find, is very necessary when watching Shuffle!\\n\\n\r\nAs stated, the second season is much more emotional and in depth story-wise than the first with one of the more emotional arcs (12-15) coming at the beginning of the second season. Basically, the first season is much more involved with character development and the second with story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe animation quality was excellent. On the more unique side of things, the character design/clothing for each main character changes a lot throughout the series and you can't grasp any character in one outfit for long, further adding to the variety of the overall series. For those who prefer to watch the dub, don't hesitate as Shuffle! is one of the better English dubbed anime and each of the characters voices fit nicely.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series a lot more than I thought I would by initially seeing reviews of it and I expect anyone who watches it with an open mind to do the same, though I can see if it really isn't your style. In short, my Shuffle! experience was great and I wouldn't change that much. The fan-service doesn't interfere with the main plot, though there are a few ecchi situations. \\n\\n\r\nOverall rating of the series: 9/10. Exceeded expectations.",

            "content": "Shuffle! is a harem anime that suffers from ADD, depression and drunken incoherence. The original opening concept is actually pretty interesting. This universe has your standard Earth and humans but also openly welcomes Gods and Demons which are basically elven looking humanoids. The King of the world of the gods and the King of the world of the demons each have a daughter and the one who marries them will become the ruler of the gods or ruler of the demons. Naturally, these girls are in love with a Japanese loser from highschool. Yeah, that makes for a pretty interesting concept right? not super originalbut damn entertaining... throw in some additional girls and you have a recipe for an amazing anime, right? Wrong. While the premise is good, its execution fails so spectacularly that it is almost hard to believe. \\n\\n\r\nThe whole entire premise that would make it interesting is almost instantly dropped. It becomes a simple \"confused feelings\" anime and this main character manages to literally ruin several lives in the process. I have never EVER seen a main character who I hated more due to his thoughtless and selfish nature that they wanted to come across as innocent. It was hard to stomach. I wont say who he ends up with but needless to say that the whole \"Becoming king of the gods or king of the demons\" is almost never mentioned again and the kings are rarely seen past the opening episodes. What a damn waste.\\n\\n\r\nIf this anime wanted to be what it ended up being, then fine... but why introduce the element king of the god or demon world at all? I have no problem with the main character ending up with whoever but it could have been done much better.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime tries very hard to be as ridiculous as possible with the character personalities. You have characters who start to go insane, literally, out of the blue... and degenerate into a completely different character, doing things uncharacteristic of their pre-established personalities and then by the end going back as if nothing had happened. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a lot of pointless drama. I don't mind drama, hell I like it if its done right... but here it is not... at least not towards the second half. I guess that is what it comes down to thought. The series gets progressively worse, to the point where it seems like one director was fired halfway though and another took their place and wanted to re-write the entire story.\\n\\n\r\nYou can find better.\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you liked Shuffle! fantastic. I didn't. My review is based on that basis.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY: Great concept. Unforgivable execution.\\n\\n\r\nART: The animation was pretty good. Nothing to write home about but overall it was fluid and nice. I don't have any complaints but it didn't blow me away or anything. The thing that stood out were the eyes... in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND::The opening theme is awesome. I liked it a lot. The rest though isnt memorable. you will forget it in T-minus 30 seconds.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Uhgg... no. Just no. I have never seen characters that are more all over the place in terms of personality. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: Very little but what little I did enjoy, I enjoyed quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I personally found little enjoyment out of this title, but the stuff I did enjoy was pretty good. I couldnt get passed the fact that they managed to be so all over the place with the story. Virtus Signum gives this a 4/10. Below Average.",

            "content": "Shuffle wasn't an anime I was ever keen on watching to be honest. Partly because of Nerine's ears and partly because it just didn't appeal to me. I ended up watching it because a friend gave it raving reviews and I just couldn't believe I'd ever been stupid enough to pass it over.\r\nBefore I get on with the review, I'm going to have to give out two warnings:\r\n1) This anime will repeatedly threaten to compromise your manliness, if you're a guy. \r\n2) This anime also contains one of my favorite characters and she was the one who awakened my inner lolicon. She could do thesame to you.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9\\n\r\nUnusually for a harem this anime had an abundance of story. Whilst it lacked a plot that stretched throughout the whole 24 episodes, each heroine had a few episodes that was dedicated to her with minimum interference from the other female leads. This makes a nice change from the usual constant squabble-fest of other harems which, whilst entertaining enough, do get a little old. Even the filler episodes served to let the background characters take center stage for a little and to see how they are going about their business. The ending is also one of the most satisfying in the harem genre. Shuffle covers just about every genre going, so don't be put off by the word 'harem' because it is so much more than that.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9\\n\r\nI'm giving the art a 9, even though it is the area of Shuffle I have the most beef with. Particularly with the character art. Some characters are visually superb, such as Reena and Sia. Then you have a character like Asa who walks around with hair that looks like a huge chunk of green and Kaede who has hair so glaringly orange it would make oranges cry. These are minor faults  and are just the result of me having high standards so I'm not going to be petty and lower the score for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 9 \\n\r\nThe opening theme, You (song name, not you you), is one of my favorite theme songs in anime to date. The music seems to fit the events and emotions of the anime no matter what is happening, which, considering how diverse Shuffle is, is pretty impressive. I won't give it a perfect score because nothing about the rest of the sound is really memorable to me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nJust to be clear, I do not like all of Shuffle's characters. The daydreamer Kareha being the main culprit and the main Rin, not far behind. This isn't because they are bad characters though. I don't like them purely because of one or two minor things they do/did that irked me.\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are just..... amazing. They all have a past that, thanks to the dedication of episodes specifically for them, are explained in enough detail so we feel we know the character without their pasts becoming the dominating theme. I think the creators did very well juggling character development from the past and character development in the present. They are hardly 'generic' either. You do have the normal generic types of girls found in harems but each come with their own twist in Shuffle that really brings a breath of fresh air to the genre.\\n\r\nAnd Rimu. I have to give Rimu her own paragraph. I defy you to watch this and  then to not like Rimu. She fills the 'emotionless loli' role but still somehow manages to convey emotion. Her background story is heart wrenching to watch. I was genuinely concerned about her, a fictional character. She is just such a lovable character. Cherami Leigh's performance as Rimu is nothing short of spectacular.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9 \\n\r\nI enjoyed Shuffle immensely. It's a new type of harem anime, it's diverse and interesting, the fanservice is kept to an absolute minimum (maybe once or twice in 24 episodes.) You cannot help loving at least one character. It's a horrible analogy but it was similar to betting on the horse races. I had my favorite girl and wanted her to be chosen over the other by Rin (or win the race, in other words.) It was definitely enjoyable rooting for my favorite.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9 \\n\r\nAll the reasons why this is just a great anime to watch are ^^^^^ up there.\\n\r\nI might've given it a perfect 10 but for one or two itty bitty issues here and there which some people would ignore but I can't. This is purely personal preference though. Also the fact I have so much to say about an anime I last watched in March gives testament to how... memorable this is. \\n\r\nDefinitely one to watch.",

            "content": "Tsuchimi Rin is a high school student who attends National Verbena Academy. He spends his time with childhood friend Fuyo Kaeda and Shigure Asa. One day, two beautiful girls from the world of gods and devils transfer to his class and another artificial life form moves in with him. All 5 girls love Rin. Now he has to decide who will be the one he spends the rest of his life with.\r\nStory & Characters (8/10)\r\nThe story of Shuffle! is yet another twist on the romance/comedy genre. While staying traditional to the harem style scenario, Shuffle! adds magical elements and outstanding character development into the mix.The favoritism of the childhood friend scenario seems to play prominent in the series and all of the characters have their good points. This is great when trying to create characters that you can get attached to, however it does make it rather difficult to choose a favorite as you don't want to see any of them get hurt. Also, because the characters all seem to have some sort of promise, it makes the balance seem slightly off. Still, it's a minor complaint. Fans of such series as Ichigo 100% and Sister Princess will find it easy to grasp Shuffle! as it stays with the traditional multi-girl style without becoming too ecchi in the process.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\r\nThe artwork was originally conceived from a dating sim game of the same title. Thus all of the character designs are very crisp and the execution is quite capivating. The backgrounds are lush and continue to flow steadily with every scene but you find almost all of your attention on the characters themselves. The males are portrayed accordingly the the females are all beautiful in their own way. As far as the traditional harem genre is concerned, I have found Shuffle! to maintain some of the best artwork.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nThe music in Shuffle! is outstanding to say the least. The intro song \"You\" but YURIA is a fastpaced song that is well coordinated with the intro animation. The lyrics also give off a sense of desperation from the singer which promotes well with the female leads in the anime. The ending theme \"Innocence\" is slower and more peaceful than the intro, but the lyrics continue to grasp the series well and will leave you wanting more. The song tone and lyrics are well delivered as well. Follow the series into the OSTs, and you'll find quite a bit of music to keep your ears happy. \"In The Sky\" is another prominent song that emerged from the game and you will find it to be an excellent piece if your a fan of the traditional music in the anime. The normal background music isn't anything to snear at either. Without being too prominent, the background music is soft and blends well with the animation scenarios at hand. The variations are kept to a minor note but are still distinctive enough to embrace the situation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nI feel that the overall aspect of Shuffle! was quite enjoyable. The humor of the series is rather clean for the most part and the overall story flows nicely from episode to episode. Unlike a lot of series in the same genre, Shuffle! has captured me with its lack of filler episodes. Every episode seems to play nicely into one another even if only to show the tightening bonds betweem the male protagonist and one of the female leads. There are also a few story arcs that are thrown into the mix to keep the flow straight forward and on task. There is a small span in which Nerine is the primary focus of the male lead, then there is another with Sia as the focal of attention, then you will find a lot of tension with the Primula arc that has yet to be completed. Throughout the series, they manage to keep your interest captivated with a different scenario. The execution of the art is by far superior to that of other titles in the same category and the music only serves to smoothen the delivery of it all. Taking everything into account, Shuffle!'s crisp artwork and excellent soundtrack with leave romance/comedy fans planted in their seats and asking for more. So, I would totally recommend this anime who like these kind of genre or to people just starting out.",

            "content": "Shuffle! is a truly great harem in the world of anime. It certainly had the potential to be a masterpiece if it wasn't for the overly unrealistic setting. Then again of course, it's not something these type of animes worry about. Most harems have an unrealistic setting that would not be possible in the real world. Therefore, you're either going to like or hate this anime straight away. \r\nThe story might seem cliched ie. one guy x lots of girls = suspence and drama (+ the occasional fanservice). That's not the case in Shuffle! however. This anime manages to suprise us all the time withthings we wouldn't expect to see in it after watching a few episodes. Having watched quite a few harems myself, I expected the same old routine... guy wakes up, guy goes to school, guy meets dozens of girls. Girls fall in love with the guy, guy doesn't know what to do but somehow he \"accidentaly\" ends up groping all of them. \\n\\n\r\nI was pleasantly suprised that Shuffle! decided to reverse the roles and in fact it's the male lead getting groped... and not accidentaly. Very similar to how it was done in nagasarete airantou, albeit with less nudity. \\n\\n\r\nWhat most Harem animes lack is comic relief. Every anime needs it. Even death note had a few scenes which were designed to make the viewer laugh. Shuffle! doesn't disappoint. A lot of characters in this anime were made just for that. Like the \"defense forces\" for example. As it turns out there ARE actually jealous men in this anime which is definitively a first. I've never seen a jealous guy in any other harem anime that I've watched. It's usually something like \"ohh yeah that dude... meh who cares.\" Out here it's more like \"GAH! he's got all the girls, let's get him!\" which also suprised me. \\n\\n\r\nSo what are the defense forces? Organised groups of adult (and not so adult) men who try to capture the male lead with the intention of executing him in various ways. Of course, they always fail miserably. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are awesome. We have Rin Tsuchimi, the prontagonist of the series. He's an average highschool dude, with one exception. He's a powerful chick magnet. What's more (and this is where total unrealism I mentioned earlier sets in), most of the girls that are interested in him are either demons or gods. Rin shrugs off the girls' advances most of the time which just makes them more daring and determined. Add to that the fact that most of the fathers and mothers in this anime want their daughters to get intimate with the male lead (wtf) and... wham, you have the perfect recipe for \"what the hell did I just watch\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nSound is really nothing special, just your average anime music. There is seriously nothing I could write about on that. Well no, there is one thing - the opening is very long, it probably constitutes 15% of every single episode. Likewise art is good but it's not super awesome... or even awesome for that matter. It simply is good. No mistakes or anything but it's not breathtaking. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is probably what this anime is about. It's not one of those \"teach you a lesson\" or \"tear-jerker\" animes, it's simple here to entertain you. That said though, you're gonna have to get used to the unrealistic setting and simply focus on the story instead. A bit like in \"ah my goddess\". Anyway, I encourage you to take a look, Shuffle! is a fine addition to the Harem genre. \\n\\n\r\nGreat anime, great score.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nI like to think of Shuffle as one of the few gems of the Ecchi/Harem area because instead of relying on fan service with a lot of action it focuses more on character which is what drew me to it in the first place.\r\nThe story is set in a world where God's, Demon's and Humans co-exist, the MC Rin Tsuchimi and his friend Kaede Fuyou find that the king of both God's and Demon's have become their neighbours who also have daughters who are in love with Rin so Rin must make a choice on who to pick.\r\nEven though the story does whatmost harems do it also decides to concentrate on the female characters too as each girl in the show that are a part of the harem have a dark backstory and that is what made the story good in my opinion because it doesn't rely much on fan service and out of 24 episodes I probably only saw nudity like 4 to 7 times which is pretty low for and Ecchi/Harem this long and when it does do it, it seems like a realistic situation for it to happen, it's also intresting finding out about the God's and demon's worlds, what differences they have and whether they have different abilities too, but the most interesting aspect is that the story focuses on a different girl at some point in the show some get more screentime than others which kind of annoyed me, but this is one of those few Ecchi/Harems where the MC actually picks someone in the end making the journey more worthwhile.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were certainly an interesting bunch Rin compared to other Harem MC's isn't too bad and when he does something dense he actually acknowledges it and despite avoiding the big question all the time he does generally care for each of the female characters making him a more likeable character too.\\n\r\nThe female characters are definitely the most interesting part of the show considering almost every one of them has a dark backstory of sorts like for example Sia has a split personality complex, Nerine has a similar sort of complex, but is much different compared to Sia's, Kaede is a yandere just gonna say that, Primula is a God + Demon experiment and Asa has a dark secret that shows she isn't fully human. Seeing each of these characters stories become more complete was a very thrilling and emotional journey because some fared worse than others and it makes you feel sorry for them.\\n\r\nThe other supporting characters that aren't a part of the harem were also enjoyable too like the God and demon kings who seemed like really friendly guys, but can also be serious when the time comes for it, the other two characters like Mayumi who is a Tsundere mainly because people pick on her breast size which is always funny and Itsuki who is a perverted womaniser, but does have a gentle heart and these characters were actually entertaining whenever they were on screen.\\n\\n\r\nNow the artstyle was interesting it reminded me of When They Cry you know Female characters with small heads and large amounts of hair which made them stand out a lot.\\n\\n\r\nNow the Romance in this show was actually pretty good considering I didn't know which to stick up for mainly because they were nice girls the dark part of their lives was also something to take into account, but I was generally surprised that Rin actually picked someone which happens rarely in the Ecchi/Harem so it was a nice change for it to go into this direction and of course there is fan-service, but this time it feels more mature compared to other Ecchi/Harems and whenever it did show nudity it felt like a realistic situation that would actually happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think this was an enjoyable and entertaining show and if you're someone who enjoys watching Ecchi/Harem anime's then I'd consider this since it is more mature compared to the majority and it also focuses more on it's characters too.",

The reason is because of the very serious issues it addresses, that the writers buried in the harem aspects.\r\n    It is the only anime I've ever seen that addresses ALL of the following issues:\r\n   Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\r\n   Abortion and the possible consequences thereof.\r\n    Just how far is it ethical to go when experimentingon humans?\\n\\n\r\n    What should the rights of clones be?\\n\\n\r\n    How should we react to family groupings that are outside the norm?\\n\\n\r\n    What do you do when you find out that someone you've blamed for years for a horrific situation was actually protecting you and it was your fault?\\n\\n\r\n    Not discussing a situation with someone who could help you can result in a potentially fatal result.\\n\\n\r\n    How do you deal with guilt over a situation that you didn't participate in but which was of great benefit to you?\\n\\n\r\n   The writers also handled the use of symbolism, in the literary sense, in an excellent manner.  They used it to emphasize the other questions they presented.  It was done so well/smoothly that I suspect that most people missed it.",

It's a head scratcher tho , the plot and the main character along with the other characters have been fairly questionable their actions, what happens etc.\r\nit's been kind of sad to be honest, I got real mixed feelings about this anime,\r\nIt seemed like your ordinary harem eechi until the whole asa-senpai date plan\r\nThat's when this anime really opened up I feel and the main character really really took thought of who he likes and or loves\r\nandyah, It's really weird. really really weird. \\n\\n\r\nThe best parts of this show are easily the art, music and the ability to make you go WTF?!\\n\\n\r\nThe cons: the one overly psychotic female character, no to mention the  piss poor progression of some of the other female characters.\\n\\n\r\nLeaving me shaking my head? Leaving me wondering whats going to happen in the last two episodes? Like I don't even know.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like they are gunna mass suicide or something unbelievably ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThis has to be one of the strangest harems I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad tho, it def has it's positives. The non perverted main character is honestly a first. Like Really really non perverted. Theres some really decent moments with the main character you definitely see he's got way too good of a heart.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of that I gave it a 6.9 (literally six point nine not sixty nine...) / 10",

            "content": "Shuffle! was something that I went into with very few expectations. I generally don't watch older anime for a myriad of different reasons, but shuffle! did interest me for some reason. The plot seemed kinda out there for what you generally get in a romcom and it was that reason alone that made me decide to start watching it. I will say this much about it, if you are tired of the same formula in romcoms and want something a bit different then shuffle! might be the anime for you. Not only is the world it takes place in different, but how they go aboutwith character development and even who the MC actually ends up with are quite un-expected and interesting because of that. It's an anime that has genuine plot twists. Some stuff you can see coming, but some of the bigger events that take place genuinely catch you by surprise and that's always something I welcome with open arms when it comes to the anime industry. \\n\\n\r\nStory- A basic rundown of the synopsis is this \" God, demons, and regular humans now co-exist together. The kings of both the demon and god realm move into houses next to the MC and want him to marry either of their daughters.\" That is the setup for the plot and imo it does follow some of the basic tropes of \"girls move into the mc's house or next to him\" but what makes it interesting is his connection to either of those girls. Not only that but they're the daughters of the king of demons and gods respectively and with that comes some unique circumstances. Those aren't the only girls he has a connection to, but they're the ones that are presented to us at the start. Where things progress from here are rather...well fundamental I would say. It does for a while follow a basic path that most romcoms take, which is fine, afterall you can't exactly get a connection the characters and care about them without anything happening, but what I loved about the story is the fact that it doesn't stay on this path for long. It lets you get to know and care for the characters, it gives them enough time to get to know the MC and most importantly it gives all the characters enough motivation to pursue the MC for different reasons rather than just \"Daddy said I had to\". Where the anime gets really interesting though is after it strays from this path. Certain events take place that leads to a sort of second arc where the dynamic of the show changes and that is where the good and memorable parts of the show happen.\\n\\n\r\nArt- I'm not gonna lie here, the art and animation in general is fairly generic despite the type of universe the anime takes place in. I feel like they could have done more to emphasize the kind of world they were in. One gripe I do have is that they don't show nearly as much of the demon and god worlds as they should have despite them seeming very interesting from how they're described.  It's not bad by any means, but this is one of the animes that would have benefited a lot more from having better art design. It's serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nSound- The sounds assets and design are good, but nothing really original in my mind. It does what it's suppose to and the music sets the mood, some of the tracks are actually quite good to be honest, but there weren't any tracks I would say were mindblowing. The intro was the best piece of music in the whole anime imo. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- To me the characters and rather un-predictable plots twists are what make shuffle! a memorable show and experience. The characters in shuffle! have true character development, not all of them, but some of them truly change for the better or worse throughout the series. To me what really made the show interesting was who the MC actually ended up with, not only that but how much the character he chose developed. A character I didn't care too much for all of a sudden became someone that I cared for deeply. The only bad thing about romcoms with multiple girls are that the enjoyment of the show can hinge on who the MC ends up with. I can see why some people wouldn't like the girl he chose and that could ruin the show for them, but the bottom line is that Shuffle! has a great cast of characters all of which are well fleshed out and portrayed. Each girl does get a fair chance with the MC, there are even times when you think that he is gonna end up with some of them, but ultimately I think he makes the right choice. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- The enjoyment of romcoms hinge on you liking the plot and characters. If either of those fall flat that usually makes for a bad experience, who the MC ends up with can also determine if you enjoyed the show or not. The setting of Shuffle! while quite unique, could be seen as something that would be a turn off for some people. The characters on the other hand I think are objectively well made and well portrayed, not everyone is going to like a tsundere character for example, but that doesn't mean a tsundere character isn't well made and well portrayed. I enjoyed the setting, plot, and characters ton in shuffle!. Combined with some genuinely surprising plot twists and developments along with pretty good pacing and amazing writing makes for a great experience in my opinion. It's entirely understandable why some people wouldn't like shuffle!, but it's worth giving a shot if the premise of it sounds intriguing to you, it's also worth giving a shot if you want something a bit different from the standard romcom animes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- Overall shuffle! was a great experience for me and I really enjoyed my time with it despite me going into it not expecting too much. I would reccomend this to people that want something a bit different from the romcom genre.",

            "content": "For all the people that disliked this anime and are about to question my line of thought for it's rating, or are about to \"unhelpful\" this review, hear me out.\r\nShuffle! is a great anime that shows supernatural, comedic, dramatic, and romantic scenes in beautifully constructed ways. The show is structured very simply at the beginning, where it's just Rin's normal way of living with Kaede, who takes care of him and goes to school with him. Later on in school they meet up with Asa Shigure, as they probably usually do. But there is a surprise in their class when it is said there aretwo new students transferring. These happen to be princesses of the Gods and Demons, and also happen to know Rin from their childhood. They both fight for his hand in marriage, and they're fathers try really hard as well to help out their daughters. The reason i'm stating everything like this is because many people believe that everything was introduced so quickly. But that's where they're wrong. The anime started where all the events started to occur, and the transitions seemed smooth, because it felt like everything, up until the two princesses came along, seemed to happen everyday. So I feel like it had started at the right time.\\n\\n\r\nSomething about school oriented animes seem to enrage people. If one of the genres say \"School\" and your not a big fan of it, then why watch it? I feel like Shuffle! would be stupid without this setting. Kaede wouldn't have met Asa, so Rin wouldn't have met her either. This would destroy the series, so there's no reason to dislike it. I feel like itis a huge help to the anime, and most of the scenarios do not even occur in school.\\n\\n\r\nSorry for my ranting, here's the Genre Rating:\\n\r\nComedy, Drama, Ecchi, Fantasy, Magic, Romance, School, Harem, Seinen\\n\\n\r\nDrama - 30 out of 30\\n\r\nThe series doesn't start off too dramatic, usually only through jealousy from the girls. But what really hits hard is Kaede's and Asa's arc. The amount of anxiety and depression between these two arcs are insanely emotional. I won't go into detail due to spoilers, but these scenes caused me to keep constantly thinking back on them well after I finished the series. Primula also has a pretty emotional arc, and that's why Drama get's all of it's points.\\n\\n\r\nHarem - 25 out of 25\\n\r\nYes, I consider the Harem genre as second to drama. But the whole Harem idea is crucial in Shuffle! Not only do they all try to get Rin to love them without regard to his feelings, he also tries very hard to spend time and be kind to them all equally. Only later does Rin realize his stupidity and how he's only hurting each of them more the longer he waits to choose. So I give Shuffle! a lot of credit for the skillful use of Harem.\\n\\n\r\nRomance - 20 out of 20\\n\r\nTo be very honest, there's isn't much romance to go on about in the beginning, with some exceptions here and there. But then, when you figure out who Rin really loves, romance booms, to the point where it is surprising. And then there are many circumstances that come with this love, causing in many heart-warming scenes and very saddening scenes all the same, which causes the romatic parts to be somewhat enhanced.\\n\\n\r\nSchool - 13 out of 15\\n\r\nI did just make a big deal about how school was very important to Shuffle!, yet there is one thing that kept it from getting a perfect score. Lisanthius and Nerine both switch into Rin's class. Right then, it seems like all the main characters are all in the same class and are also sitting next to each other, which bothered me a great deal. But as I said before, the series wouldn't be much without the school setting, so it was very significant in Shuffle!\\n\\n\r\nEcchi - 10 out of 10\\n\r\nCan you believe this? An anime that uses ecchi to increase problems for the main male protagonist and is used in these situations smartly? I couldn't believe that Shuffle! could actually use ecchi other than fan service, even though some scenes were obviously fan service. Besides those, the use of ecchi was all in all creating problems for Rin throughout, most notebly Kaede and Sia. Some people may complain that it is unneccessary, but don't realize the specifics behind it. So I find it as the last major genre that is worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 98 out of 100\\n\r\nShuffle! hit me hard with all of it's dramatic, romantic, and anxious scenes. I find this as one of my favorite anime and I can't see why anyone would find it any worse, but I guess personal opinions matter the most. If you are reading this and haven't watched Shuffle! yet, I highly reccomend you do, because it stirs emotions in you that you may never had experienced.\\n\\n\r\nI have written A LOT because I felt the need to show the people that dislike it are so very general with their dislikes. Hopefully reading my specifics helped clear some things up. And if you noticed that I didn't include comedy or fantasy as one of the rating scales, that doesn't mean they aren't important. The comedy helped get through some scenes, and Asa was completely full of laughter, as was the princess's fathers. And fantasy is hugely important due to the fact that Sia is from the World of the Gods, and Nerine being from the World of Demons. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this review. If you have any questions about my genre rating scale, then just message me. I leave you with the traditional ratings.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10/10\\n\r\nArt - 10+/10\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10+/10\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\\n\r\n\"I love you...please don't leave me...\"",

Rin ends up with the most randomest person and the last 5 episodes completely sucked and took a turn for something lame and tragic.\r\nI don't really recommend this anime unless you're bored and have nothing else to watch.",

            "content": "Hello everyone!\r\nNow let's review one of Navel's masterpiece of visual novels translated to anime.\r\nIt is a school life anime, but even with some extraordinary features from some characters, very, but very little of this aspect is used. So little in fact these \"powers\" just appears sometimes in the story, so a little slice of life is present. Romance is the main emphasis of the anime, and no, the main character doesn't save the world here (not directly by any means).\r\n--Story--\r\nHow everything begins, and why everything happens. (Skip if you already read synopsis)\r\nRin is a typical high-school main character, living under the same roof as Kaedesince they were children. In his school, humans aren't the only one who studies there, but also boys and girls from both heaven and hell, which some also happens to be Rin's friends, like Asa, his senpai from heavens, and Mayumi, another childhood friend who came from hell, dedicated to be journalist. A certain day, two girls, one from heavens and another from hell, joins the school and automatically wants to be together with Rin. Their fathers, kings of heavens and hell, go to the school too, and says Rin have to make a choice. Either he chooses one of those girls to marry, or they'll destroy the Earth itself.\\n\\n\r\nLots of love affairs, gossips and indecisions begins from there on, but I won't mention then or else I'd be spoiling the anime...\\n\\n\r\n--Time exploitation--\\n\r\nSome animes makes time pass faster when watching them, and some do the opposite.\\n\\n\r\nShuffle stands a little between in this case. Having the average duration of 24 episodes, filler scenes are inevitable, but if you played the Visual Novel, you'll find out the anime follows most of the script of the game, so it isn't as bad as you might think. The anime itself, in the beginning, dedicates a whole episode mainly for each one of the main girls at a time for introdutions, then following with a brief series of episodes (basically 2 eps for each) telling a bit deeper about the girls, some secrets of them, their past and how they met Rin in the childhood and made them follow in love with Rin, and finally, Rin's decision, followed by the final chapters about the couple. After saying all this, you can say the anime doesn't stop for long, so yeah, it exploits time well, but could be a little shorter.\\n\\n\r\n--Story and Characters Evolution--\\n\r\nStory (usually) grows as time passes, but how about the characters?\\n\\n\r\nTough topic. After the \"introductory\" episodes, the story evolves at slow steps until Rin make the decision for himself, so the story is mostly intact after the first episode until quite late in the anime. The main girl's \"arcs\" (meaning, on the episodes dedicated to them and their past/secrets) only serves as a background for who's watching the anime and who the watcher would pick in Rin's place, since it has a single ending only. Then you'd say \"Isn't it time wasting, seeing the other character's backstory then?\". Yes, but I'd consider this marketing plans to support all the other Shuffle!-branded games, audio and drama cds, mangas, radio novels, and so on, where you have multiples endings and stories about if he'd chosen other girls.\\n\\n\r\nIn other words, the characters remain static on most part of the anime, except on rare occasions and in the final chapters (I'll tell later).\\n\\n\r\n--PERSONAL Opinion--\\n\r\nExactly what it means. What I think about the anime ^^\\n\\n\r\nShuffle! is that love-or-hate kind of anime for me. At the time, I loved the anime, and I've played to VN later. For me, I didn't faced the character's backstory as \"time wasters\", because you end up sympathizing with the girls, and on certain moments, with Rin, since he has to decide only one from 5 girls and also having his own tragic backstory told in the anime. The best aspect of the anime, indeed, is the final chapters. In most animes, the girls would still be hitting on Rin after he made his choice, but here, all the others go on, some easier than others, changing their shyness and dreams, searching for other guys and just remaining good friends with Rin (girls: friend zoned!!).\\n\\n\r\nIt's really a mix between unreal and realistic anime, not because of the presence of magic and heaven/hell population, but as for the girls' static behavior along most of the anime. It's just sad. Sexual content is really short and present mostly on the first episodes to crack a laugh, but after this, it's very serious. Character design is full of details and decent motion, and even with static characters, each one has her own personality, so you'll end up falling in love for at least one of them, even on secondary characters (Kareha-senpai *-*)\\n\\n\r\nAs bad aspect, not to mention the obvious again, the music could really need an improvement, except for the opening theme, that alone made me watch the anime. Maybe if the anime didn't followed the game so strictly it could have been shorter and better, but again, I don't consider these aspects major flaws\\n\\n\r\n-- Score and Recommendation--\\n\r\nFinal score to me and to what people I would recommend.\\n\\n\r\n8.5/10.0\\n\\n\r\nIf you like romance/school-life/slice of life animes, without a doubt you should watch this. For the others, only if you have the patience to wait the story reach its climax or have played the game before (it has translations to english ^^)",

Watch it for yourself and see how great/horrible it is. \r\nAs for me, I enjoyed this anime from start to finish. It is definitely a harem anime but what surprised me the most was the amazing character development. \r\nStory - 9\r\nThe story wasn't perfect, but it caught my attention right from the start. I am not going to lie, but it does start out like any other harem anime. Although, I can't blame it. I mean, how else are harems supposed to introducecharacters? \\n\r\nAs the story goes on, you will learn the other side of each character that you will never expect from them. At certain points, you will tell yourself, \"Pft, I bet the story is going to continue like this!\" Later on, you will definitely have a different perspective.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nBeautifully made characters and romantic scenery. I like how they actually gave meaning to each place the scenes take place in and eventually use them at later episodes to emphasize/develop characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8\\n\r\nI guess it was okay. The dub actually wasn't bad and had a lot of famous voice actors from other dubbed animes (the good ones).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\r\nAs I mentioned from previous points, the characters are very well developed and you will see so many unexpected turns as the story progresses. It is true that the main character's decisions/actions aren't always quite soothing to the mind and heart, but later you will appreciate him. The ending satisfies all fans of each female character so it won't leave you angry (or at least raging if you're a die-hard fan of a specific female character).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nBy now, I think everyone knows what I will rate this category. The story flowed so well, from easy-going to romantic and finally dramatic scenes. All the characters have traits that everyone will love! You won't be disappointed with any lead character. If by chance you get disappointed in the middle of the show, please finish it first before getting mad at them. ;)\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nOutstanding. I will recommend to any fan of the romance/drama genre! Also, I will surely revisit this anime in the near future!",

            "content": "Although Shuffle is a kinda old anime now, I still felt like I had to make a review for it, because I felt it was a little underappreciated. This won't change that, but maybe it will help one or two people discover this anime.\r\nI have also played the VN before I watched this anime, something I don't think other reviewers for this anime mention. I'll talk about that at the overall section.\r\nStory: The story is pretty great. It starts off as a typical harem rom com, but by the middle, that is when the anime really starts. That's when everything begins to really come together,and you will know when it happens. When the comedic relief starts to disappear, stuff get's real. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: For its time, the art isn't bad. Inconsistent, a little, but not too horribly. It's also somewhat unique, as I haven't really seen anything quite exactly like it, although I must admit to not having seen much anime from this period. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: It's noticeable, I think, and I feel that it truly does help to enhance emotions in the sad and happy parts alike. The only thing that holds it back is lack of variety. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is really where the anime shines above all else. Character development becomes important and prevalent halfway in, so it's definitely there if you can get there. Although many other people say that jealousy and anger and emotions similar to them should be more prevalent in the girls, considering the MC takes a while to choose, you also have to consider a couple of things.\\n\\n\r\nNerine and Lisianthius are not human. This may not seem to be very important, but it also means that they don't feel or react like a human girl might. There is a culture gap there. You can easily tell why Primula wouldn't feel like that. Kaede and Asa are the only ones that feel this, but only eventually, and this is due to life problems, and for one of them, serious mental issues. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this anime. I watched it very happily, and it wasn't a waste of time at all. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The VN this is based off of, wasn't very good. I enjoyed it, but it was short, it didn't let you connect with the characters enough that you cared much when their story got tragic. In the anime however, this problem is taken and shattered.\\n\\n\r\nAll unexplained things, almost all loopholes, are resolved in the anime. Not only that, but the VN was short. I finished it in about 10 hours. So, 24 episodes is actually kind of a lot. But, the anime took everything in the VN, cranked it up to Super Saiyan 4, until the anime took a life of its own. The stories and characters connect with you deeply, and you actually feel the emotion.\\n\\n\r\nThe girl Rin chooses was definitely unexpected for me, but it also made sense to me. And the routes are all finished almost completely, (minus the endings where they get together and everything, obviously) with tons and tons of new material that adds to it.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a faithful adaptation, this isn't for you. However, it is a GOOD adaptation. Which is really rare, ESPECIALLY for a VN adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rate this anime a 9/10, one of my top 5 favorites now.",

            "content": "I disliked Shuffle! so much that it has prompted me to write my first review. That does not mean that you will dislike it, but if you've seen one harem anime, you might end up being bored by Shuffle! The review will contain some minor spoilers, but nothing major or explicit.\r\nStory: 3\r\nLet\u2019s start off with the premise. In a world where Devils, Gods, and Humans coexist, a mediocre guy has 5 girls fall in love with him for pretty stupid reasons. Sounds like your standard harem tromp with a supernatural element thrown in. This premise had so much potential; the interactions between the three worldsand their inhabitants could have been developed and fleshed out instead of providing fillers and needless drama (24 episodes were more than enough for that). They could have answered the question about how the gates between the three worlds opened (God knows they had the time to do that). However, we never even get a glimpse of the world of Gods, and just some episodes where we get to see very little of the world of the Devils. The differences between the three races are never specified, except for the fact that Gods and Devils can use magic. I know it's a harem, but adding these elements would not detract from the original story. Some of the developments in the story seemed to happen just for the purpose of drama and they were so easily resolved (read: clich\u00e9) that it made you wonder why they occurred in the first place. After around 11 episodes, the anime starts feeling a bit too much like a visual novel, with the MC doing each girl's route (with annoying numbers of pantie shots thrown in each). I know it is a VN adaptation, but it felt TOO much like a VN compared to other adaptations. I will admit, some developments the final episodes were surprising (the good kind) and they made sense within the framework of the story. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe anime is a bit dated, so I cannot really comment on the art. If you're used to new anime, you might get a dated feel from the art, but it isn't bad to look at, though the character designs take some time to get used to. Could have been better if they spent the budget on something other than pantie shots.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI really liked Shuffle!'s OP, and the ED wasn't bad either. Other than that, the sound wasn't anything special.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\r\nThe characters are what make or break an anime for you, and in my case, they made me dislike Shuffle!. I've seen enough harem anime to not expect originality from them, but still, let\u2019s get out our stereotype checklist. The pervy friend with the glasses: check. The cheerful, happy go lucky one: check. The subservient one who will do anything for the MC: check. The shy one with the manners: check. The loli: check. The emotionless one who eventually shows emotions: check. The one who likes getting physical: check. The intrusive parent(s): check. Other spoilery clich\u00e9s: check. Clich\u00e9s and stereotypes aren't necessarily bad if done well. They aren't done well in Shuffle!. Two of the girls have essentially the same back story. Every girl calls the MC kind.... but the MC is actually kind of a dick. He is indecisive and the annoying thing is, because of his MC status, he essentially resolves everyone's problems by himself. He is pretty selfish in some respects; he leads on the girls for most of the story because he wants things to remain the way they are. They couldn't have made the girls more passive and one-dimensional in terms of problem resolution, and the loli feels more like a side character. At a certain point in the story, I thought he had chosen a girl, but no, by the magic of a badly written story, all that had happened between them was essentially forgotten. A pretty horrible MC, even by the standards set by the harem genre.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nThe reason I finished Shuffle! was because I actually sorta enjoyed the first 10 episodes. After that, it slowly degraded, and then I was in too deep to stop watching, since I wanted to finish the story. I'm the type of person who will end up marathoning a whole anime on the weekend if i don't control myself, but I ended up finishing Shuffle! in 10 days, and I only finished the last 5 episodes in one go so I could be done with it. The ecchi is overly abundant, badly done and detracts from the story. Hope you like striped panties if you've decided on watching this anime. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Shuffle! is an anime with a lackluster story with potential which pulls you in the start, and some of the most boring and pathetic characters you might see in an anime. Its sound and art might be its redeeming features, though I wouldn't watch an anime solely for those two things. I haven't watched a lot of anime, but even I found Shuffle! annoyingly clich\u00e9d. I didn't hate it, hate is a strong word, but I came pretty close. To conclude, except for the fact that it actually ends conclusively, Shuffle! might just be everything wrong/boring/annoying about the Harem genre, especially if you've already seen a few anime already. \\n",

A harem without good characters is really just the worst. This show is a little more fun/light and comedy-based but it gives me Clannad vibes a bit. It certainly doesn't match Clannad's awesomeness but it's a good show if you're looking for something similar (aside from the other Key VN stuff).",

            "content": "\"Shuffle!\" had some surprises from the Harem genre...Not all of them good...My overall rating of about 7 is cos I really tried to generously execute \"suspension of disbelief\", and cos it left an emotional impression on me.\r\nAs I have read in other reviews, \"Shuffle!\" indeed follows the typical harem anime formula for roughly the first half of the 24 episodes, which was fun for me.  The King of the Gods and the King of the Devils were hilarious to me, and, as another reviewer has written, I would indeed like to see a spin-off with them!  I enjoyed the character development of eachof the girls, and found myself caring more for them than for which one would get to be with the MC.  The MC is nothing more than a thoughtless prick who gets handed to him ridiculously cute girls, who all are in love with him cos of one act of kindness done years before...And who does nothing else \"kind\" but for 3 scenes with 2 of the girls.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed the comedy in the first half, and especially enjoyed the girls' look and art.  There are indeed many panty shots, if that's your thing.  Titty shots are there, but mostly in scenes that were not hot (e.g., one girl is in the shower in extreme depression--Sorry, but not my thing).\\n\\n\r\nBut then, about halfway through, the story takes a heart wrenching turn with one of the girls...Ok, so fine...You then get an episode, or so, break where the characters say, repeatedly, \"we're back to normal\" a bit too much...Then it just gets downright DEPRESSING!  Characters you grew to like are simply cast aside to develop a relationship between 2 characters that I just didn't think was plausible, given how everything had developed up to that point.  And it happens after a majorly humiliating event that I just couldn't buy!  Keep in mind, I was willing to accept that years ago, a \"gate\" opened that connected the human world with Gods and Devils, and everyone is living in harmony and everyone is cool with that!  \\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it just becomes sad...One by one, girls I liked are now systematically eliminated from the \"harem competition\" due to their \"dark\" pasts, and lives are ruined by the MC selfishly being \"honest\" after stringing them along for so long.  This culminates in what can only be described as \"soap opera\" BS.  That being said, as I thought this out, I realized that perhaps this was symbolizing life as one progresses from the protected bubble of junior high, then high school, only to be met with the harsh reality of the real world and making the hard decisions.  Too artsy-fartsy?  Maybe... But this was why I gave it a better rating.  Not because I enjoyed that aspect...But because it reminded me that all things do change/progress whether you like it or not, and in ways you may like or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would say to someone about this anime, watch the first half and enjoy yourself.  After that, be prepared for a 180 degree emotional roller coaster that takes you into dark reality.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the King of Gods and the King of Devils, Primurula and Siga are the best characters!:)",

The Anime started off as a demon god harem comedy with girls competing with each other ( like in a normal harem anime) over one of most pathetic MC you will ever see. When you can become a demon king or god or both but you choose something off the list is when it drives me up the wall. Moreover MC is a pussy who thinks he can make others happy by friendzoning all the girls after that choosing someone who is off the list and he realise he has hurtingwhat was once precious to him by ignoring them he tries repent his sins by running away from home living separately because he think he was spoiled by the care given to him by someone who loves to serve him. More even being surrounded by beauties MC can't figure out his feelings whom he should date or should he date. If you like harem ROM com which stays on the track then this anime is not for you",

            "content": "The Bad:\r\nRin isn't the best main character I've ever seen. He's basically Jesus and acts as a panacea for every situation, this is probably the biggest criticism I have for the writing in this series. There are various scenes where the characters are having a conversation, yet they'll focus on one character who isn't speaking for a majority of the scene. This one small aspect could have been fixed by looping two or three frames so that they're not putting pressure on the animation studio. There are a few exceptions to this rule, but I when you're covering the speaker, it ends up looking lazy.The pacing was also everywhere. I also really didn't think his friend was necessary, you know who I mean, right? The perverted supporting character? I can't remember his name.\\n\\n\r\nThe Good:\\n\r\nThis series is really well written for a harem series. It has a varied cast of female characters that more than make up for Rin's bland character. Each of the characters ends up getting a good amount of character development over the short 24 episode run time. When the series needs to have good animation it does, and the animation adds to the scenes (which is why I would suggest watching it dubbed over subbed). If you watched this subbed think back, which scene was the most emotional for you, was it the scene where Remu just kind of walked around the house in a depressive state? Well, that's more so what it's like with the dub. The great vocal performances from the entire voice cast also added a lot to the feel of the series. this series has a lot of now-famous voice talent in it voicing main characters, so it was honestly really nice hearing what was the beginning of the Funimation voice cast. Overall this series was very good and I would suggest checking it out if you have the time.",

The fanservice is so poor all you get in the first half of the show is a wet-shirt event with a fucking  loli (fucking meant as adjective, not a verb). Anyone who agrees that this show classifies as ecchi must be an exotic mix of celibate amish muslim raised in an underground cell, deprived of any stymuli of human contact. I guess someonelike that would indeed consider a plot involving a guy living togerher with girls (again, not \"living together\", they really do nothing more than share the same house) sexually stimulating.\\n\r\nThere's no real plot, backstories that are revisited every 2-3 episodes are so shallow that a lobotomized viction of a brain stroke high on painkillers couldn't make them more bland and implausible.\\n\r\nMain character is a typical harem MC, in a bad way, being a freeloading girl jail-bait without a bait (he just attracts girls that want to dedicate their whole existences to him, because he actually was nice to them 10 years ago (the madman). And by saying \"was nice\" I mean \"he helped a stranger girl to find her way back home, this kind of thing. Not \"good childhood friends\" nice).\\n\\n\r\nMore on the technical side, the art is so 2005 bland I'm having childhood flashbacks, and the voice acting sounds like the VA were forbidden to approach microphones closer than 5 meters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the anime is not any kind of atrocity, and while it doesn't have a single good thing about it, it's still watchable. Think Slice of Life written by a little girl, starring all her dolls. or maybe an ecchi show devoid of any connection to human sexuality. It's not painful to watch, but doing literally anything else is most possibly more entertaining.",

            "content": "When I was first recommended Shuffle! I was put off by the gods/demons side of the plot. I'm not a fan of excessive supernatural elements in school based anime. That reason alone resulted in me avoiding watching it for a very long time, which was a shame because I was already aware of how outstanding the art style, quality and character design was.\r\nAfter watching a few series, I came back to Shuffle! and decided to look past the supernatural elements of the story and the pointy ears and just give it a go. I have to say I'm very glad I did. For anyone elseput off by fantasy elements in anime like this, please just ignore it as you'll find it really isn't as bad as you'd think. Although the Gods and Demons part of the plot is relevant at times, it doesn't really involve anything more than a source of comic relief for the majority of the series. So, if you like drama, school, comedy, harem or romance then get Shuffle! watched.\\n\\n\r\nI'm extremely picky when it comes to artwork, being an artist of sorts myself. By definition, I wont watch a series unless I like the art style and character design. Shuffle! has fabulous character design and the art quality and animation is top notch at all times. If you're looking for some well made anime, the art quality of Shuffle is definitely a 10/10. The last show I watched with this quality of artwork was Clannad, which also happens to be my favourite anime. Anyone who's familiar with will have a sense of just how well done the artwork of Shuffle! is. Definitely one of its strongest points.\\n\\n\r\nThe general story of this anime isn't really anything original. You have your main guy and several lovely ladies who all happen to have a thing for him. The series essentially revolves around this lucky guy named Rin having to choose one of these girls. Of course, as expected in this genre, Rin is pretty clueless when it comes to girls and even worse when it comes to making a decision.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing which really highlighted Shuffle! for me was the character development. In Shuffle! every single one of the main characters gets almost equal screentime. This is particularly important for a show like this, because it allows the viewer to establish which girl they'd like our lucky guy to end up with, in an entirely fair judgement, due to them all getting their equal chance to shine. There are a lot of other shows which fail to do this, and the fact that all of the characters were so well explored really helped me enjoy Shuffle!. In addition all of the girls have their own unique sides which really sets them apart from each other. Some are more shy and lightly spoken, whilst others are outgoing. We have those who are somewhat of a tomboy and others who are very lady like. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy elements of Shuffle! aren't outstanding but it certainly never gets dull. Of course a few of the characters don't really have a funny side, but others are complete comedians. Overall Shuffle brings out a few laughs every now and again, sometimes with originality, sometimes not. If you just want to sit back and enjoy a calm comedy/drama while you work then give it a go.\\n\\n\r\nFor those wondering there is a bit of fan service present in this series here and there. In many anime reviews people complain about this, but for me it doesn't boost or lower the rating. I don't feel it was excessive, and in some ways it actually helped bring out more of how certain characters think. So, I wouldn't call it excessive, and since the art is so beautiful I don't think it is anything to complain about. If it really bothers you then just close your eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThe second half of the series focuses more on story than comedy, unlike the first half. In the second half we have a lot more drama, but still the occasional comedy. All of the characters are explored once again, in most cases in more detail, and this detail tends to bring more intensity to the show. \\n\\n\r\nFor the most part I thought the writing wasn't incredible, but its definitely of a decent quality for this kind of show. The one story related thing I was disappointed with was predictability. This isn't to say the whole anime is predictable, because there were certainly moments which really surprised me, but in the last half of the anime some of the more dramatic scenes were a little too predictable in places. Without spoiling anything, one thing which was a pleasant surprise for me was who ends up together. I wont say who, but he ends up with who I designated my favourite character right from episode one. Lets just say as much as I loved her I certainly didn't expect her to be the choice, in fact I thought she'd be one of the last, so that was a nice surprise for me which definitely bumped my rating of the show up and made the last six or so episodes of the show far more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nFor those like me who prefer watching the English dubbed version of anime, I'd like to talk about that. When I originally came back and reconsidered Shuffle! I checked out the cast. Judging from the names I have to assume I didn't look at the cast the first time I was recommended this show, or I would've probably watched it then. There are some great actors in this, and in general although a lot of people seem to disagree I thought the English dub was outstanding. Some characters are definitely better than others but overall the English dub was great. Britney Karbowski and Carrie Savage did a great job bringing their characters to life, and Monica Rial gave an absolutely flawless performance as usual. If you're one who goes for dubs you should like this cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Shuffle! is a fun, easy going anime with a nice balance of comedy and drama, and a unique use of character development. If this is the type of genre you're interested in I honestly can't give a reason to avoid it. As many have stated it definitely isn't anything original, but the artwork is outstanding and all of the characters are lovely and perfectly developed. It isn't often for me that I like all of the characters, but in this case I did. At the very least I usually have one of two characters who annoy me, but this is definitely absent in Shuffle!. I would've liked to see a real second season of Shuffle! perhaps resembling the format of Clannad After Story, but at the same time the ending did have me satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nShuffle! isn't a series which will have you sitting in a pool of tears by the end, or something which will give you a lot to think about or change your life, but it definitely is one of the good shows of it's genre. As I've already said, if you like the genre and you like well designed anime then give it a go, or at the very least watch the first few episodes.",

However, out of sheer boredom, I decided to give it another shot and I must say I was quite pleasantly surprised. \r\nThe first half of the series is quite typical and mediocre. You get to know the characters and witness the typical harem nature of most anime in the said genre. You also get to witness a fair amount of ecchi. The latter half though takes quite a twice in the plot and this is where I really enjoyedit.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters seemed to mature to quite an extent. Although it did maintain the harem nature to the most part, it seemed a bit more mature I suppose. The latter half is also where you get to witness true romance. The romance between two character (whose names I will not mentions :P ) is tried and tested quite deeply. It's purely for the romance side of the plot that I chose to rate it 8 (whereas I rate most other harem/ecchi 7 at most).\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion all those who enjoy watching anime of the romance genre will enjoy this (if they can be patient with the first half that is)!",

He lives with his equally underdeveloped, life-long friend named Kaede who's only goal in life is to cook and take care of her precious Rin; not that he cares.  Despite his lack of character, every girl in anime land STILL wants him.\r\nYou're probably wondering by now why I gave this such a high score. By the time I got to the end of the episode I found the set up so ridiculous that I was actually laughing and so I clicked on to the next episode. Then the next. And I'mreally glad I did.\\n\\n\r\nThe focus on this anime is not really the male, of course, but all of his female interests. Kaeda's persona gets fleshed out to reveal a dark regret. Other characters include Sia, princess of the gods and Nerina, princess of the demonds, and Primella a young demon. All three have their own secrets to reveal.\\n\\n\r\nMagic doesn't play a huge role until the second half of the series and while the buildup to the finale  was great I found the reasons for conflict a little, well, stupid. Overall though, Shuffle! has some great moments that will reward people if they give it a chance.",

            "content": "Shuffle was an anime that changed the way I look at anime forever. \r\nShuffle was the 4th anime I had ever seen(school days being first, boy was that a mistake, and a few really ecchi ones). I came in looking only at the romance factor and the 18 and over rating. What I got on the other hand was an anime that would forever live in my \"Hall of Fame\" Animes so to speak.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story was unexpected, and that I believe made it even more magnificent. Prior to this I had seen titles like Omamori Himari, Kiss X Sis, and HOTD. They wereanimes that didn't lack a story line, but didn't have a suprising or \"hanging-on-the-edge-of-your-seat\" story line that Shuffle! has. It made me realize that anime isnt just big boobs and panty shots. I also like the fact that its all HUMAN emotions. The drama, the romance, the joy that they all experience is all realistic and I could easily see it happening in real life(except the whole angel demon thing). I also re-watch it and LOVE the fact that he choses a girl in the end. No the crap in every other harem in the world where he decides that he'll just love all of them equally.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10 \\n\r\nI am no art expert, but I thought it was done really well. The characters were well done and are all rather unique. The backgrounds were well done and everything looked crisp. Its exactly what I look for in \"good art\" in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 \\n\r\nOnce agian I am no expert. But I found myself listening to the OP and ED when the episode began and ended. By about episode 14 I had most of the OP memorized and decided that I had to have it on my iPod. I listen to it to this day(I watched this about 1 ago ago).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10\\n\r\nThe characters were by far my favorite part of this anime. Just about everyone had an amazing backstory.They were all compelling and a couple of them brought tears to my eyes. The main character is your run-of-the-mill super nice guy who helps everyone and is to dense to realize six beautiful girls love him. But theres something about him that makes him different, maybe the way he talks or the way he does thing makes me like him even more. All the other characters seem to be once agian your overused and cliched(tsundre, loli, childhood friend, shy girl, energetic)characters. But they put a twist on all of them. And by twisting these cliched personalities, you get somthing unquie. Something that makes you want to know more about them and why they ae like that, all of which are answered.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime immensley. It brought joy, saddness, and the wonder if there would be something as great as what I had just watched. It opened my eyes to a new horizen of anime. No longer stuck in the \"if its ot ecchi, its not good\" phase I went through.\\n\\n\r\nI reccomend to anyone, no matter what genre your into. \\n\\n\r\nTeam Sia for life!",

            "content": "Look, I have to be frank with this, and i realize that I might take a bit of heat for what i say here but whatever, I feel like this series could have been far better. I have a few reasons for this such as: most notably this is a harem series which allows for there to be a wide array of characters to satisfy a plethora of viewer desires, which is good. The problem however is that for harems to work the main guy CANNOT pick a girl, there can be moments with some, and small victories for others but theend result of who is actually chosen needs to be left open for interpretation by the viewer, because like i said, if it doesnt happen like this its not harem, but simply some show with a bunch of chicks who cant take a hint! \\n\r\n   Asa wasnt a romantic interest until about the last six episodes but she just shows up and takes over, whilst all the other girls are just all like \"awe good for them\" \\n\r\n   So yeah i feel like the romance just kinda goes out the window in the whole 2nd half of the series, except for kaede who actually discovers hers, albeit in a completely psychotic manner but hey, by that point it needed a little intesity and that just shows that she cares!-probably more than the rest combined... yes it was painful to watch kaedes slip into (dare i say) insanity, but personally i found it to be touching, plus when she got all up in asa's grill i was cheering becuase kaede was the only girl in the whole frickin series that wanted to stand up for herself, just her means of expression were a bit off and she is condemmed for it, but this side of her is what made her my personal favorite!!\\n\r\n  That brings me to my next point, it seems like all the girls have some metal disorders here, we have: 2 with disasociative identity disorder, 1 with severe depression, 1 with bipolar disorder(you have to watch for it, but trust me its there), and finally there are some signs of schizophrenia tossed in too so yeah... psych wardin it up... \\n\r\nSeriously though, towards the end my train of though was as follows: \"no no no no NO WHAT THE HELL BRAH!, THIS ENDING IS BULLSHIT!\" I literally threw shit across my room at the end, which was funny as hell till my mom started thinking that i was doing drugs or something... \\n\r\n   Still in all it starts great, but it is just a general progression of shitiness from then on out. ep 1~17- 9/10, ep 18~24- 1/10",

During the first few episodes, it was kind of boring. It was very hard to get into it but when it got to the different main females stories, that what made so good and a fresh thing to see. The first two stories were not my favorite but the last three were really good. My favorite story was Kaeda. It went very dark and before I reached that story arc, I used to dislike Rin but nowI really like him. He is probably one of my few favorite male protagonist in anime. the best part is that mostly harem anime protagonist do not choose or say who they want to be with. But this one changed the game. I gonna stop before I spoil anything else. I love to recommend this anime to everyone but you have to be patient with.",

            "content": "A harem anime that defied conventions and tropes, you just have to wade through a pile of fluff just to get there...\r\nShuffle! is an anime adaptation of the *ahem* H-visual novels with bleached underpants but having uncensored nudity and it follows ordinary high school student Rin Tsuchimi voiced by Tomokazu Sugita who lives with his childhood friend Kaede Fuyou voiced by Yuuko Gotou when suddenly his ordinary life is abruptly changed when the Kings of Devils and Gods appears before him and telling him to pick one of their daughters, Lisianthus \"Sia\" Eustoma voiced by Sayaka Aoki of the God faction or Nerine voiced byNaruka Nagami of the Devil faction so that he may become the King of Devils or Gods and thus the harem hijinks and later on, the in-depth serious character development of the cast comes in.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers Ahead!\\n\\n\r\nLA wasn't kidding when LA said that the first half of this anime is nothing but the entire core cast having the typical harem hijinks and it becomes a slog to get through, basically ALMOST becoming filler, LA says \"ALMOST\" due to the fact the fillery fluff harem hijinks actually does contribute to setting up the majority of the core cast and their soon to be character development while at the same time focusing on some minor characters like Mayumi Thyme voiced by Miki Inoue, a friend of Rin's and one part of the comedic relief for the school and the core cast's teacher Nadeshiko Benibara voiced by Mari Oda before getting into the more serious character development.\\n\\n\r\nThere's lots to unpack so let's start with Primula voiced by Hitomi, she has relations to Nerine, but she becomes sick and we later found out she's something of a homunculus, experimented to see the heights in which magic can be grown but her magic goes haywire in a ways. Primula is the first step towards the world building of Shuffle! but we at least get some backstory on her as she's probably the most mysterious character within the series and she become something of a satellite character together with Kaede later on. Yes LA will say she's the least developed character in the series but we at least see a behavioral change through all the events after her arc ends nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nNext is Nerine and she has some baggage and to be honest the rest of the harem does to some extent but Nerine has links to Primula as well. Well her backstory helps things with why she fell in love with Rin but at the cost of her identity, yup she played that card but it's more like she's accepted her own identity at the cost of a sacrifice from her past and this all being instigated by Primula's arc in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nSia even before her \"arc\" appeared she had the majority of the screentime and vying to be the girl who wins in a ways, but her \"arc\" was the shortest of the harem, her dealing with her \"split personality\" as it were and her personality switching from playful to almost femme fatale and her wanting to suppress the latter due to her like Nerine having to sacrifice something form her past. Where Nerine was accepting her identity by ultimately leaving her other self, Sia was actually having the identity crisis and accepting BOTH sides of her personality.\\n\\n\r\nKaede is up next and ohh boy was this the most interesting arc out of all of them, playing and deconstructing the trope of the childhood friend as part of the harem as we see some of the most infamous moments within the series, see Kaede as a childhood friend at first wasn't the pleasant, calming and caring childhood friend she was to Rin, as an incident involving Kaede's mother made Kaede place the blame on Rin and utterly tormented Rin to the point of wanting him DEAD, but when she found out the truth she tried any way to retribute her sins any way possible and LA sees this both ways, as Kaede didn't know at the time and placed blame on Rin but going to the extremes she did especially for some of the torment she made Rin go through was utterly deplorable and guess what with Rin distancing himself from Kaede and breaking routine as it were, well breaks Kaede's facade and goes back to her almost yandere state. The thing is this is a brilliantly, visceral depiction of what happens to an extreme spectrum of what the childhood friend not being chosen is like and with the classic trope of the childhood friend not being picked but the \"first girl\" was something of a refreshing breath of air as it were seeing this side of things,as visceral as it was and even the climax though somewhat anti-climactic was dealt with extremely well, quite honestly the best arc of Shuffle! if anything.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally Asa Shigure voiced by Miki Itou, Rin and Kaede's tomboyish friend and the eventual one true pairing the anime picked and we get little hints of Asa's backstory throughout the anime   but things only finally reveal themselves once her arc and the final arc starts and it ties up all loose ends with all the hints given and quite honestly some of the plot twists concerning Asa and her mother Ama voiced by Yuria that came out of nowhere but made perfect sense plotwise. If there was anything to say about Asa's arc was that it kinda dragged at bit but nonetheless with it's conclusion and wrapping up the anime itself, it was actually decent.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters and how much the entire core cast changes over the anime, they at first are stereotypical characters but the core cast at the very least develops and in the case of Kaede breaks convention even for the time it was released of 2005, but if LA had to pick a favourite character then it would of have to Asa Shigure, quite obviously for her calming laid back attitude and having some decent backstory to go along with her in which her potential as both the genki character of the series but ALSO playing up the \"sick character\" in nice conjunction. LA's least favorite and yes LA had one....was Sia. LA just didn't liked her hogging the first half of the anime and her lack of screentime even DURING her arc and the final nail being her squeaky voice was why.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the minor cast are comedic relief to say the least with some development as characters, those ONLY being the aforementioned Mayumi and Benibara, but there are also Itsuki Midoriba voiced by Hideki Ogihara the womanizer of the school comedic relief and one of Rin's friends, also both dads of Sia and Nerine are also put into the comedic relief pile, with Sia's dad being the bigger one from the two with him getting the most slapstick out of the dads. When the comedic relief is away, you know the anime is getting serious. No seriously if ANY of these characters don't even get a mention or screentime in any episode, it's all serious character development which is at least tonally consistent.\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY, what about Rin?, our main protagonist, well to say he's the typically dense main male protagonist IS correct but like his harem that develops over time, so does he and he for the typically dense main protagonist DOES develop as well as well as actually choosing one of the harem, heck he even moves on from his typical routine, sure it was to help and protect his loved one, but nonetheless. TONS of people hate Rin being the idiotic dense main male protagonist stereotype but besides his white knighting idiocy at times, he too does grow to be a better character. LA just wished that some of his choices were a bit more planned out.\\n\\n\r\nLA talked ALOT about the characters and well Shuffle! is VERY character-centric, but what about the production value. The animation done by Xebec and asread was decent enough for the time and with the distinct character designs and backgrounding was good. Comedic relief has the typical chibi overracted faces and all, but when the anime got serious, it bloody shows and LA means the psychotic Kaede faces. Ohh and the uncensored nudity, well it being adapted from a H-visual novel, well it was a given to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting wise, well LA aforementioned that LA really didn't like Sia's squeaky vocals from Sayaka Aoki, but aside from that, well Primula's voice actor Hitomi was VERY quiet BUT there was a plot reason so LA could give that some grace. Really there are TWO voice actors LA needs to give major props to, Miki Itou as Asa as she was in her 40's when she was straining her voice to sound like a 17 year old and LA COULD HEAR IT STRAINING. The other and most obvious being Yuuko Gotou as Kaede because DAMN could she switch easily from calm and caring to outright psychotic.\\n\\n\r\nShuffle! like it's namesake (LA hopes) is of the choices one makes, makes sense due to the arrows being something of a key point and what Rin and his harem went through, well it wasn't the typical harem LA was expecting and it is actually one of the VERY few harems LA has experienced in some time where the entire core cast and even it's minor cast gets time in the limelight and was executed rather well, whether it be themes of identity, sins of the past and moving forward, but where the anime falters is the first half where it does nothing but play around and LOOK like a typical harem anime when clearly it's second half is NOTHING like it but giving small hints to the bigger picture later on. \\n\\n\r\nShuffle! is one of those harem anime where YOU NEED to watch the anime fully, even if it's first half is all fluff and no substance as it's second half is one, extremely satisfying towards it's characters you'll be investing in and two, just Kaede's arc in it's entirety giving us something that defy conventions of the childhood friend stereotype and finally a something of an actual ENDING towards a harem anime and heck a main male protagonist who moves forward for the one he loves?...heck ya.\\n\\n\r\nColor LA surprised Shuffle! for the most part executed itself quite well in all regards, the core cast being developed and the changes stick, childhood friend trope being played and deconstructed to impressive degrees even if it goes into edgy, batshit crazy territory and a main protagonist that changes along with his harem, if you can slog through it's first half, then you will the satisfied one way or another, LA was certainly was.\\n\\n\r\nChildhood friends NEVER win amrite?...",

            "content": "The only redeeming features that this anime has are the artwork and the sound, and even those are fairly mediocre and simply typical art for the early 2000's. \r\nWhile I remember watching about half of this anime when I was younger and thinking it was pretty decent, upon finishing it recently, I realize just how awful it is. The story, scripts, and character design are all dreadfully mediocre. The entire anime can be summed up as follows: \r\nAn incredibly simple protagonist who doesn't know how to clearly tell women that he's not interested forms a harem with girls he knows at school, some of whichare demons, and one of which is his psychopathic childhood friend. The girls all fall in love with him just because he's \"kind\" and that's it. Nothing else. He has no redeeming qualities other than he's \"kind\" which ends up causing more harm than good as he never makes his intentions clear. By the end, he ends up with a girl that didn't have nearly the same amount of character development as the other characters (nearly in harem anime where the lead character ends up with one character, a good amount of time is spent on that character specifically with the other \"arcs\" simply acting as additional content to flesh out the world and interactions with other characters, not simply go from one girl's arc to the next, in order, so that the last one's arc is the one he ends up with with no real development leading up to that point) and, quite frankly, was an odd choice, in my opinion, for the girl he ends up with. \\n\\n\r\ntl;dr \\n\r\nA guy is \"kind\" to some girls -- including demon girls --, they end up absolutely in love with him, and he's not clear with his intentions which simply leads to cliche and incredibly mediocre \"drama.\" \\n\\n\r\nThe last several episodes don't even feel necessary. There's no need to have a whole 24 episodes. The same story could have been told in 21 or fewer. In fact, to be quite honest, this should have just been a 12 episode anime, from the start. There's not enough depth of story or character depth to keep it going for as long as it did. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the Japanese dub (as I always do) and this is one of the first times where I've watched an anime and felt that the Japanese dub was fairly poor. Almost the entire cast just came off as really whiny compared to most high school slice of anime casts. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I finished it was simply so I could mark it as \"completed\" and never think about it again. That, and because I like Nerine's character design. That's about it. This is one of the first, and so far one of the only, animes I've ever regretted watching. \\n\\n\r\npainfully mediocre/10.",

So if you wana hear a review of the Anime as a general please keep reading, you might find this very insightful. Lets start from the Start of my adventure with this anime, i was looking for a comedy, ecchi, somthing fun. I ignored the Drama setting on the side, and said its ok. I was wrong. This anime, i give it a 5 not because it was terrible, but because of the logic and understanding of it. I wont lie, the story anddevelopment is Amazing, down right amazing. Done well. But the characters, this isnt some happy thing, the first 10 episodes trick you. They make you believe this is all going to go smoothly, but after about episode 15, you see the true colors and it only gets worse. I already knew this anime was going to end not so well, but didnt expect it to end or even get close to such an ending as it did. This anime non the less is not for the weak of heart, nor the people that will linger of who the love selection is. This anime only showed me one that its trying to tell everything, and is how Weak and unstable people can get, that how the lowest point of your mentality can be. The characters are not smart at all, they are all redundant to be an Entity (an individual) they all feed off of others and can not find there own will to live. \\n\r\nIf your looking for enjoyment, please walk away you will not find any joy here, just a fake lie within the 10 first episodes to keep you drawn in, and then it bursts at you, and you wont even relize what you got yourself into, but your already to far in to back out. This anime, is only for those looking for an amazing story, that will not take it to a serious level, this is my first review, not because im angry at the anime, but because of how Terrible Amazing it was (a Paradox). In the end this animes characters are its down fall, and its success. This anime has stunned me and make me never want to see it again. But yet, i have respect for this anime, because of the story, and how it is. But on a lighter note, these characters personalities are soo @#@#@#@$@#@$ over xD its just sad to see. But yet its amazing with there personalities, what they still had done. I say, heres my check off for those wondering to see this anime\\n\r\nWant joy, and only a good time, dont care for story? Dont get close to this anime.\\n\r\nYou want story? and yet a laugh and a chuckle, and maybe even a WTF? then watch it, but honestly, even though this anime was Amazing and terrible at the same time, Im glad i watched, i just never want to see it again.",

            "content": "This review will contain some minor spoilers in regards to plot direction, but I will do my best to not include any specific details\r\nShuffle! really took me by surprise in a lot of good ways. It  is a harem comedy with some supernatural elements to it, there are plenty of girls to choose from with a main character that is fairly average in every way, except of course his luck with women. Now that is pretty standard, but Shuffle! takes risks in the plot department you don't usually see in harem anime of this type, and I feel that is to be commended. \r\nWhilemost harem anime tend to revolve the harem around a different plot entirely, Shuffle! is different in that the plot is the harem itself. Due to this, Shuffle! really does it's name a lot of justice for the majority of the show, with almost every character getting at least one episode of their romance being explored with the main character. Unlike most shows of this type, the main character Rin Tsuchimi is completely aware of the girl's affection for him, and spends most of the show trying to decide on which one to pursue romantically. This was really a fresh of breath air for me, when so many male protagonists embrace the Orimura Ichika (Infinite Stratos) style of obliviousness to the affection of those around him.\\n\\n\r\nIn direct contrast to that obliviousness, not only does Rin actively realize and address his harem's love and affection, but he even ends up choosing a girl to pursue and love above all others. As someone who has watched a lot of harem anime, that really surprised me. Now sure, in my opinion he chose the second best girl to pursue in this case, but that's not the point. The point is that this main character actually has the testicular fortitude to decide on what and who he wants, and make something of it. The only other MC I've seen do this has been Hyoudou Issei (Highschool DxD), but Issei decided in the first episode (and never gives up his dream for it to be a true harem style ending), whereas Rin fully explores his options - shuffles through if you will - and only truly decides at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, watching this also gave me some insight into why this isn't done very often. When there are multiple girls madly in love with one guy, choosing one creates problems that have to be dealt with. It gets messy and complicated, and I now understand why writers would have the main character NOT explicitly choose one girl, especially when there is an overarching plot line that needs to be addressed. The MC's choice is guaranteed to make a lot of people unhappy no matter who he chooses, and dealing with the fallout is a huge task of it's own. Shuffle! handles all of this spectacularly, because moving forward with a romance is the plot, and the rest of the major events are the subplot - exactly the opposite of what you would expect.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to that subplot however, there are some concerns and some things done right. The world of Shuffle! is one of Gods and Devils, but calling them Gods and Devils is a little disingenuous. They come from two different worlds, one for each, who have seemingly always been in contact with each other, and 10 years prior to the events of Shuffle a gate opened and all 3 worlds became connected. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, these gods and devils aren't nearly as different from each other as you would think they would be from the name, and whatever the deal with the gate is is never found out. Essentially, gods have short elf ears pointing up (and are polygamous, boiyoing), and devils have long elf ears pointing down. That's it. That's the difference. They're both nice, they work together, and the King of the Gods and the King of the Devils are best friends and live as neighbors in the world of humans so their respective daughters can have a shot at Rin.\\n\\n\r\nFleshing out this world is really the weak spot of the show. A lot of questions are raised about the world that is being shown, but very little is ever answered. There are scientific experiments resulting in sexy artificial beings as is to be expected, but no real villain or outside threat. The plot is the romance, and it definitely is fleshed out, but very little of anything else introduced results in a definite resolution or answer. This is the danger of the MC actually choosing a girl and dealing with the consequences as I stated above, very little else gets resolved.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and character design are good, but obviously a bit dated. You get used to it pretty fast but it's clearly an anime that's reaching 10 years old. The characters develop well though, and shows a great deal of depth for every one of them due to each one getting their time in the spotlight with Rin. \\n\\n\r\nNow it's time to talk about the fan service. It's there, nipples are drawn, but it's very casual and light for most of the series. I'd say that while it is definitely fan service, but most of it is done in a very classy way. Not a whole lot of gratuitous panty shots or \"Oh no I fell down and landed with my head in your crotch and hand on your boob\" moments. I wouldn't argue if it had more fan service, but what it does have is enough and is at least par for the course, though usually not particularly stimulating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this anime a 7/10. It's definitely good, but there is also a lot of room for improvement. A lot of things are brought up only to never be explained or even addressed. The Gods and Devils could just as easily have been called high and low elves and avoided a lot of unnecessary questioning and confusion by removing the gate altogether. That being said, the main romantic plot is incredibly satisfying for anyone who is tired of the MC of a harem being completely clueless and indecisive. I would suggest watching this to anyone who enjoys harem/romance anime resulting in an actual resolution (though albeit a resolution that isn't absolute), isn't bothered by slightly dated animation, and doesn't mind that there is basically no other plot other than the harem romance.",

            "content": "\"Shuffle\"  has a confusing storyline in my opinion. Its starts off as a typical harem but then has all these plot twists. The story sways from harem to romance constantly like as if the author/s couldn't decide what to do. Each girl has their own issue and their own 15 minutes of romance with Rin. That's where it gets confusing. Kaede despite having her own issues in the story does not however have her 15 minutes of romance with Rin even though the show seems to be about the two of them in the beginning. (more confusion). Other than that, the show has plentyof drama and comedy. I watched this show because It was a recommendation for \"Zero No Tsukaima\" but neither show has any similarity nor relation to each other which left me disappointed. I enjoyed watching though.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Free]\r\nWhile I do enjoy Harem Animes, I personally think this is one of the best out there. I liked the anime a lot overall, but like most animes, there is always something they could have changed. But the nice thing about this one, the things they could have fixed were very minor.\r\nStory wise, it had a pretty common plot. Multiple girls fall for the same guy, but that's what makes harem animes... well... harem animes. The unique thing about each of these girls was they were either humans, demons, or gods, so each of them were different, and each character had an individual storythat molded in with the entire story. While I found entertainment in each one, there were those small moments that seemed unoriginal. Overall, really good.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork, awesome. What can I say, I liked the scenery, the character art, pretty much everything. That's why I envy the artists who drew for the show, they're good at what they do. I can't complain about any of the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound was a solid 9. The voice actors and actresses put emotion into their roles, so it seemed realistic, although there were some \"overly-emotional\" moments in the show... but I can honestly say I approved of all the actors/actresses they got to play each character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were all lovable... everyone except for Itsuki. As everyone knows, harem animes always have a perverted best friend in the show (Daigo from Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi, Saruyama from To Love-Ru, etc.). I honestly hate all of the perverted best friends in most harem animes, but the main characters are all good. For once, the guy all the girls likes isn't a pervert who fawns over them, which was what I was most impressed with. All the girls were unique, cute, and easy to like. The most interesting thing about each of them was their split personalities and secrets they hide. I liked all of them.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this one a lot, although I can't say I was amazingly pleased with the ending of the show. Like I said before the review began, I won't give away any spoilers, but I will say I wish it would have ended differently. I did enjoy the show though, honestly I did, there wasn't a high amount of fan service in this anime (also another thing I was impressed by), and there was a lot of comedy in the show. Really good.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you found this review helpful.",

Nearly every character introduced does serve a purpose, and while in the first bits of this anime you may feel as if it isnt anything special, they all start to grow on you, by the time the ending arc starts, you feel such compassion and love for the characters that you want everyone to be happy! The story itself doesnt really containany filler episodes or anything of the sort, everything moves at a nice decent pace, though finding a good episode to stop after for the night it a real challenge! I do wish they had done a few more episodes myself, but that cant really be helped! Without giving anything away though, the end result actually had me a little surprised, be sure to see it all for yourself!",

            "content": "This anime sucked, plain and simple.\r\nMost of the time i watched this anime, i found it hard to watch as a result of boring storyline and largely boring characters.\r\nWhen I say largely boring characters, I mean they were just one Dimensional harem characters e.g childhood friend, aggressive girl. For a brief period of time somewhere after  episode 12, some characters began to show their darker sides. This was interesting.\r\nIt even led to a scene involving a knife (wont go into too much detail and spoil). As someone who who watches alot of film on top of anime, I can tell you this was oneof the best scenes I have ever seen (scene seen lol).\\n\r\nSadly though, one scene alone cannot lift a mediocre anime filled with clich\u00e9. Even the interesting character developement fizzled out after a while, leaving us with boring characters once again.\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth mentionin is that the whole demons and angel supernatural thing was kinda unnecessary. They seemed to at points want to make subplots about it but the anime would have worked much better as a traditional high school anime-sans supernatural.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, if you are foolish enough to watch this anime you will likely regret it. This review will probably get alot of votes down (as is traditional in anime fandom), but please save yourself by not watching. Or at least dont get your hopes up.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Yes. I know. It doesn't average out. Deal with it.\r\nShuffle! is a harem anime based off a visual novel, as you probably already know. Beyond that, the series completely lost me.\r\nStory: When it got to a certain point for me, there story blew right past me and everything kind of went downhill. Guy meets one girl from the past, then another, and soon has all sorts of girls around him. Typical harem, nothing special.\r\nArt: For the most part, I have found that animes that come from visual novels tend to have good art, and this series was no exception. The overall art to me wasabove average, but nothing that stands out.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Meh. Again, nothing special. Voice actors aren't bad. For instance, the voice actor for the main male protagonist Rin also did Kyon in Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi. Nothing particularly bad about the overall sound, but wasn't great either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I should really be giving this a lower score...The fact that some of the main characters were introduced for no apparent reason in the end really hurt the series. Still, anyone looking for a harem anime will find that there is a girl for almost all the general categories.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I didn't like the ending. There's nothing much more to say. Again, the fact that some main characters did not have a big impact in any way at the end really hurt. Other than that, I almost thought the series was going to turn out like School Days for a moment, and I almost stopped watching the end altogether.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you want a harem anime, it's right here. If you were looking for a romance series between the main male protagonist and one of the more main female protagonists, prepare to be badly disappointed.\\n\\n\r\n6/10",

            "content": "Warning this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions, so when I was first getting into anime this was probably one of the first v.n romance, harem shows I ever watched. So I didn't really know what to expect. and for most part it was all right for what was.\r\nStory,6/10\r\nSo the premise of shuffle is pretty much about are bland main character who lives in a world where demons and Gods live peacefully  with humanity. So while going to his school where Gods,demons,humans go together. He is given the opportunity of a life time to ether become the king of the gods or king of thedemons by marrying one of of the princess who of course likes  him because they meet him when they where children.\\n\\n\r\nSo from this you can tell it's going to be one of those happy if it's not broke don't fix it kind of harem plots where very thing is pretty idealistic and very thing is peachy as all hell.\\n\r\nSo some of you are  Probably thinking to yourself what's the point of watching this if everything is so happy go lucky. Dose that mean there is probably not going to be any drama to it and it's going to be a waste of time for someone like me that likes there rom-com's to be a bit more serious . Well if you said that to yourself then I have good news this is exactly what your are looking for if Your looking for something that takes itself seriously enough.\\n\r\nNow you're probably thinking how can this be if everything is happy and idealistic you must be trolling bio gundam please explain why you are saying theses thing.\\n\r\nOh ok will.\\n\\n\r\nSo shuffle for the first half plays out like a generic v.n rom-com harem school life.\\n\r\nWe have the Male lead who is bland as fuck who convent starts getting a few girls that of course  like Him and they go on all the usual slice of life, harem bullshit.\\n\r\nLike going on a few dates, going to beach together with his not harem group, doing school thing with them, and last and not lease the \"not\"on purpose fan service.\\n\r\nSore zzzzzzz sore sore zzzzzzzzzzz sore zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz sore zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\\n\r\nBio Gundam you were trolling this isn't serious at all reported the mods need to know about this.\\n\r\nWait wait you didn't let me finish, oh sorry there. \\n\r\nSo the first part is pretty much sore city because if you have seen enough of v.n anime you will pretty much find this exact same plot beet for this.\\n\\n\r\nBut where the story starts getting better from the point of v.n rom-com harem school life standards.\\n\\n\r\nIs the second half which starts getting a lot more serious.\\n\r\nBecause we get some much needed back story which explains why there girls like him and some drama about the harem girls.\\n\r\nFor example one of them become very sick and almost to the point of death.\\n\r\nAnother one being that one of the girls has a mental breakdown because of choices that the main character made.\\n\\n\r\nWhich helps make the main character realizes that he can't just have his cake and eat it to. That choices he makes has actual consequences  and he has to fix them himself.\\n\r\nWhich adds a sense of realism that I believe that this  series shares with the more realistic comparably speaking show school days that is willing to acknowledge the fact that when you try to have your cake and eat it to there is going to be consequences. \\n\r\nOf course shuffle never took as  far as school days did.\\n\r\nBut it's took itself seriously enough that you could take everything as serious.\\n\\n\r\nNow the ending is petty much the most disappointing part of it because the girl he chosen  is sick and is going to die if they don't do something. so the protagonist saves her and then the girls act like nothing happened like for example one of them saying the he has chosen a girlfriend but not a bride so we still have a chance.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I like Oh shit it's going to restart all over again fuck.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem that this story has is that by today's standard it's very dated and also story telling  like this pretty much helped kick start the decline of anime.\\n\r\nSo dated is my biggest problem with it.\\n\r\nBut it is well paced for a v.n. And it is probably one the better presented v.n anime.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe main character is pretty much your by the book v.n protagonist.\\n\r\nWho just happens to have life served to him on a plate literally.\\n\r\nHis personality can be summarized in about on sentence\\n\r\nHe is pretty much the nice guy and nothing else.\\n\r\nBut one thing I have to give him credit on is that he makes the choice of what he is in love with. And also him realizing that he can't take these girls for granted. So he stands out a bit for just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pretty much one note.\\n\\n\r\nExcept some of the harem girls because all of them I have an ok back story which dose add some depth to them.\\n\r\nAlso when you see these back stories in detail you can kind of understand why they would like the main character\\n\\n\r\nFor an example One of the harem girls who he lives with pretty much does everything for him and at the start your probity thinking why is she like this. She probably there for waifu bait.\\n\r\nBut when you see her back story it's makes a lot more sense why she does this. Because of a certain event that the Main character took the blame for And she treated him like trash for most of his life because of the event that he took the blame for. But after finding out the truth which the Main character was hiding for her own good she starts doing everything in her power to make the main character happy  Because she feels guilty for all the bullshit she put him though. And I am like damn this is an actual good reason for doing this shit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt,6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was pretty average at best. Even buy the standards of the year it came out.\\n\\n\r\nThe style is pretty much the generic Style number 452282222929 that has been used countless times.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters designs are pretty much generic v.n novel designs with fantasy flavoring to make it look different. \\n\\n\r\nThe colors for this anime are pretty much bright which fits with the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOp and ending was pretty nice to listen to.\\n\r\nIt not sound take worthy but it was quite a nice listen.\\n\r\nSo worth checking out. \\n\\n\r\nThe ost for me was pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're into getting ost  then you will probably not find anything else of interest here.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nNow even though shuffle is generic as all hell.\\n\r\nWith all the bland storytelling that has been milked to death in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nBut what I really enjoyed about it that for the most part took itself seriously.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it had a conclusion to its romance.\\n\\n\r\nWhich most story's like this don't have.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall,6/10\\n\\n\r\nSo overall if you like v.n,harem,school life that take themselves a little  seriously then shuffle is what you are looking for.\\n\\n\r\nBut If you have seen enough of stories like this then you will it pretty generic and dated.\\n\r\nAnd probably overall not worth your time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

These were the first few episodes that I really wasn't that into and I just watched it just for the hell of it. The story is of a guy named Rin who had 3 childhood friends from his past. One is from heaven, and the other is demon sort, and the last is human. There is also the beautiful cook whose also his friend and the loli girl that also likes him. (not a loli anime fyi) \r\nThe story gets kinda boring, as I said, in the beginning butthen it sort of gets kind of funny and you can tell that the perversion was fan serviced, but I wasn't complaining. Later it gets pretty entertaining as the later episodes made me laugh, as the girl fought for Rin, and that they wanted to be his wife, but then towards the end was where the anime had caught my eyes. It was as though it took a turn into very deep emotions and just deep insanity for one of the girls. (Not going to tell who), but that was the moment when I liked the anime was towards the end..\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you're not into harem, this might be the series that could get you into it. As what it did with me. \r\nAt first, one might be hesitant to see Shuffle! as any different from all the other generic harems out there; and, in some aspects, that's correct. Shuffle! is, by and large, a harem anime based on the life a teenage boy surrounded by beautiful teenage girls. There are some typical ecchi moments, awkward silences, confessions, etc., but Shuffle! manages to set itself apart from the crowd.\r\nFirst off, the story arc of the series might seem typical for the first few episodes, and itwill seem familiar. But, what's different about this one is that two of the main heroines already LOVE our hero, Rin, coming into the story. Already quickening the pace of the entire anime, forcing the other girls that had been interested in Rin to either step-up or step-down. This gives the viewer a sense of relief. The frustration levels that someone typically might have while watching a harem, or any other romantic anime are pleasantly limited, but not erased. Leaving the viewer with a warm satisfied feeling after each episode has been completed.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual story is really quite good. Adding in mix of the old, \"tried and true\" practice of harem, with some deep twists and emotions not often seen in the genre. I think that the viewers will enjoy the way that the show gradually eases you into the deeper parts of the anime. Which obviously come later in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe fantasy aspect: I'm not one who is particularly keen on watching any romantic anime with the word \"fantasy\" in the genre. This series does an incredible job at limiting the fantasy aspect but not too much so that the viewer forgets that it is. Overall, it's nothing over-the-top and I think everyone can appreciate that. \\n\\n\r\nMost importantly of all: this is probably the first harem anime I've seen in which the hero, Rin, decides on the girl he loves BEFORE the last episode. I find this truly refreshing and you get to see their relationship develop and blossom before the final episode. It's almost like watching a fanservice epilogue, except you still have a few more episodes to go before it ends; and their decision to show his final choice is one of the key reasons that makes this show great.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9 (Don't be hesitant, if you are, about it being partly fantasy. This show's story is a mix of harem goodness and original storytelling.)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 (Eh, not the best. But some scenes and lighting really are great)\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 (Both the English dubs and subs are some of the best I've seen. Plus, the voice acting is almost flawless)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10 (Very well-developed characters. You really feel like you know them when you reach the end.)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (I dare you not to have fun when watching this. I dare you.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9 (One of the best animes I've ever seen. Hoping for a legit second season.)",

            "content": "Alrighty, this is my very first attempt at a review, i hope its good =P.\r\n*Story* 8/10\r\nThe story for shuffle was above average for me, although it is your usual harem, the anime had instances where you could laugh out loud, as well a great climax, fan service seemed overpowering however (although this is supposed to be a harem ecchi), however the fan service provided did not totally derail the story itself. At times i wanted to just continue watching episode after episode, just because of the cliffhangers provided in the story. Overall the story was an enjoyable ride for me, and i strongly recommend thisseries. (and the ending was really really unexpected... *cry*).\\n\\n\r\n*Art* 8/10\\n\r\nArtwork remained consistent throughout the anime (however i noticed a slight difference during the ending episodes, however this may have been just the file), the artwork itself is detailed, and the anime itself simply looks beautiful. The environment was nicely done, and details like reflections were great.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound* 7/10\\n\r\nThe BGM was nothing outstanding, it wasn't overpowering, however i felt that it needed a bit more. Reflecting on this anime right now, i cant even remember any BGM that was really memorable. The seiyuu's were the only highlight of the \"sound\" with the emotions of the characters expressed profoundly and executed without flaws, eventually leaving me close to tears during some of the most poignant parts.\\n\\n\r\n*Character* 8/10\\n\r\nLike every harem/ecchi each character has a problem (trust me lol), the characters in Shuffle! are no exception. The development in each character was smooth at the start of the anime, and the whole idea of gods and demons (which made me think that it was going to turn out random), was actually a plus in the development part. Each character (be it human, demon or god) was given their own traits, which were developed to the extent that i loved every character, however nearing the conclusion of the anime it seemed that the development of each character just came to a standstill and i felt that everything was rushed towards the end.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment* 7/10\\n\r\nShuffle! was an enjoyable anime throughout, when i first started i just couldn't stop watching, even during the conclusion of the anime (which i hated for reasons i can't disclose, else ill spoil it), the anime still remained enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\n*OP and ED* 9/10\\n\r\nThe OP was upbeat, the ED was reflective, what more could i ask? Perfect transition into and out of the anime, the OP and ED of this anime has been added to my collection of all time favourites. (Reminds me a bit of how i felt whenever i watched True Tears)\\n\\n\r\n*Overall* 7/10\\n\r\nWhat stops this anime from being great is probably my own little bias for the conclusion to the anime, i felt that the ending was rushed and a bit half-assed (excuse the language), and i really thought it could end better differently. However this is my own opinion, im sure other people may find the ending very enjoyable. (Note, i wont be watching Shuffle! memories, as i don't want to =S).\\n\\n\r\nHope you liked my first review\\n\r\n~Savage the Fate/Stay Night Otaku~",

            "content": "At first glance, Shuffle seems like your average harem anime. And as you watch a few episodes, you realize that... well... its just that. Shuffle doesn't go off the beaten path. If this is not your first harem anime, you won't see anything new. The story is quite linear, and the characters will seem familiar. But nonetheless, it's still a fun and enjoyable show.\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe setting is original. In fact, its the most original aspect of the entire show. The idea of having humans, gods, and demons coexist in harmony is great in theory. However, the setting isn't exploited enough or in the right way.So in the end, the original setting sticks out like a sore thumb in a show where everything else is run of the mill.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story wasn't bad. The pacing was good, with several arcs and character development at the right time. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8\\n\r\nNo complaints here. Characters were drawn and animated beautifully, and the environments were detailed. But in the end, level of animation is just bells and whistles, especially in a character oriented harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Shuffle wasn't anything extraordinary. But it did its job, which was to set the mood for the scene. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nIn a romance story, the character is the main course. It is the difference between an unforgettable experience and a total waste of time. Unfortunately, this is where Shuffle falls through the floor. The characters all fall into old archetypes. In trying to keep the tone of the anime light, the dept of each character was sacrificed. As a result, I was unable to relate to the experiences each individual went through. This devastates the anime, as the drama will feel forced and out of place. Fanservice was also used way to often to compensate for the lack of personality of each character.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also an entourage of support characters whose roles I wasn't quite sure of. There would be times when a character would disappear for several episodes without adequate explanation, or would appear just for the sake of reminding the viewers of their existence\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nShuffle brings nothing new to the table. Almost every character seems like a clone of someone else. The story is linear and fails to grab the viewer's interest. The characters are shallow, and their interactions were forced at best. Shuffle isn't bad. What it is is average. But don't take my word for it, watch a few eps for yourself.",

            "content": "Imagine that you live in a world where heaven and hell have merged with Earth, and that there are no longer any barriers to travel between the three.\r\nIndeed, in this world, Gods and Demons are best friends, magic is common, and, as a high school student, you have to sit through a class on the history of all three worlds. As if regular old world history wasn't boring enough.\r\nNow, in this world, you are suddenly given the chance to either become God or Satan. Which would you pick?\r\nWell, there's got to be a catch, right? You're right: you have to marry either the daughter ofeither one. Now, would you still pick one?\\n\\n\r\nThis is the basic premiss of the anime Shuffle; Tsuchimi Rin is given the choice to pick becoming either god or Satan. Or will he decline both choices and go or another member of his harem, be it his childhood friend, his always happy and energetic senior, or the newest member of his family?\\n\\n\r\nShuffle's story is about all of this: a very stereotypical magic world harem type anime. However, there are enough twists and turns to set it apart from the average magical harem anime. It unfortunately, however, fails to impress in a very big way: it's story is not really extremely captivating and I really disliked the lack of humor in for large parts of the story. It falls short of my expectations in this category, but it really was a good story overall.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, Tsuchimi Rin is the protagonist of this story. He is a fairly regular male, but at points, his emotions are extremely dampened and unbelievable. This may not have been the intention of the creators, in fact it probably was not, but he often lacked responses that would be natural for any human put under the enormous emotional burden that these given scenarios would generate.\\n\\n\r\nWe also have our five heroines in this story. Although each character brings something nice to the story, none of them are really extremely exemplary. These characters are, however are all more realistic and just in general better characters than the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nAh, at last we move on to the supporting cast. They are, unfortunately, the virtual sole source of comedy in this show: we lack any other comic relief. They also, however, can provide very important insight into the story, and in general, are the best characters in shuffle.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the supporting cast were a strong point of Shuffle, I feel that one of its weaker points was in its art. Sometimes, the art was fantastic,  the characters well drawn, and everything done perfectly. Other times, however, the art lacked any real finesse. The inconsistency of the art style brings it to an average level, not worthy of praise, but not requiring condemnation.\\n\\n\r\nAlong with the art was comes another disturbingly weak thread in this anime's tapestry: its sound. Quite honestly, at the beginning, it was dreadful: the voice actors and actresses could not really get the emotion of a topic across, and could not portray anything like it might be handled in a real life situation. One of the biggest surprises in this show, however, was the surprising increase in quality in the voice acting, to the point where the actors could be considered good by the end of the show. Combining this with an amazing opening and general sound track allows for me to say that the sound, overall, was decent.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the most important part of this review: how much and why did I like Shuffle. Well, I actually liked it more than the average anime, and it gave me a fair amount of pleasure, especially as it approached the end. Although I would have typically dropped this anime after a few episodes, I'm glad that I stuck with it, and enjoyed it quite a bit, although it loses for the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nSo, all things considered, Shuffle was definitely an above average show, and is worth watching if there's not much else to do, but it would have been significantly better if the voice actors had started off as well as they ended and if the main cast was more involved in the development of the story. But if you start, finish through the end, which is definitely the stronger part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSo long Shuffle!",

            "content": "Shuffle!... it's dark and light mixed together, and I don't just mean the worlds of the Demons and the Gods.  Shuffle is an absolutely fantastic, and highly susepenseful, harem anime that can easily compete as one of the best in its genre.  If you want the \"Overall Review,\" skip to the bottom.  Otherwise, stay tuned.\r\nSTORY:  10/10  The story in Shuffle! is very good.  There are some plot twists that might leave some viewers scratching their heads, and the ending *spoiler alert* was quite the surprise, since it runs contrary to what one would expect from reading the official descriptionof the show.  The story remains comical and lighthearted, with plenty of action throughout the first half of the season... however, at episode 12, things take a dark turn for the worst, and the show's true ability to evoke emotion in a viewer comes to life.  This dark and devastating emotional rollercoaster that follows is by far one of the most heart-wrenching I have ever experienced.... and the ending, so satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nART:  9/10  There were few, if any places, where I could confidently say the art wasn't perfect in this anime.  Overall, I'm not going to dock it much in its rating!\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 10/10  While it may seem that Sound Design doesn't really add much to an anime, the sound engineering in Shuffle! adds depth and perspective to an otherwise flat soundscape.  That, and the soundtrack is optimally timed with emotional interludes that precisely emphasize the emotions of the moment.  *Spoiler Alert*  You'll likely find yourself listening for one key song throughout the entire season, which is quite the cue for when something dramatic is about to happen.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 10/10  While a stereotypical harem anime in almost every respect, I was pleased beyond measure to see that the male hero was not a loser or a pervert.  It was nice to see a guy whose \"knight in shining armor\" personality really added depth to the series.  As for the girls, enough said.... they were expertly, and perfectly, crafted.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10  To girls: don't watch this series without a tissue box handy, expect a lot of tears near the middle and end.  To guys: be prepared to cough up some ego/pride and shed a man tear.  Believe it or not, this series nearly made my eyes leak a couple times, and the ending gave me goosebumps.  Enjoyable, but one heck of an emotional battle throughout.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:  Why 10/10?  Shuffle! doesn't stereotype... it looks, sounds, and feels dramatic.  Everything about it draws you in, and the whirlpool of clashing emotions will keep you riveted to the end, which will either break your heart, or mend it... your choice.  My top favorite, and a top contender in its field.",

The comedy is what really gets you into Shuffle, as long as you don't mind fantasies and cheesy romance then you should find the story alright.\r\nI don't think I've ever gave an anime's art a 7 before, but the reason I did that was because of the way the female's bodies are. Thisisn't really a big deal but I wanted to point out that in most scenes every female has a small bust, until further into the show they'll have a C or D cup all of the sudden ( I just thought that was strange).\\n\r\nCharacter wise I thought there were two characters that had strange voices, such as the main character and his childhood female friend, but other than that the characters are likable and they also do a good job in reflecting on they're self.\\n\r\nOverall I did enjoy this anime and I thought it was pretty good, there isn't much ecchi in this but the ecchi was pretty funny. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for romance, comedy and drama.\\n",

What I got out of the anime that wasn't expressed in the visual novel was a much more intense and uncertain story line, which I enjoyed thoroughly. The first half starts out as you would expect any harem/comedy anime to start which brings a sense of undeniable comfort, however, the second half takes and unexpected twist (depending on whether you've played the novel and your definition of unexpected) and leaves you guessing, which is quite refreshing for an anime style thatis normally so predictable. \\n\\n\r\nThe character progression is top notch and you really feel attached to them through the entire thing. While this is in no way an anime to rival Clannad or Kanon, for all the Key fans such as me anyway, in terms of character endearment, it by no means falls short. If you're looking for a mix of comedy, romance, and a little bit of strife and sadness, Shuffle! won't let you down.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I personally was a bit dissatisfied with the adaptation, but only because I had a set ending in my mind I think. Shuffle! is a very good love story and one I don't think you should pass up.",

            "content": "It is often said that there is no originality to be found when watching Harem animes. While it is mostly true at this point there is no reason not to watch one. Shuffle! is one of those harems that seems to be quite stereotypical though it does add a twist here and there. \r\nStory: 6\r\nThis is a harem and the story is not exactly genius. The concept of gods and demons living alongside humans kind of irked me but it wasn't so bad that I wanted to stop watching it. While bland at first it does get quite deeper, especially concerning some of the characterslike Rin, Kaede and Asa. My biggest gripe with the story is that attempts to jam too many characters in and try to work histories with them. You grow attached to a character and BAM! you don't see them for two episodes afterward. The story would have flowed so much better had there not been so many characters. Which brings me to my next point.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry but I'm not buying Rin's character. He's quite a boring fellow and his bland personality makes it difficult to believe that all these girls are after him. And while he does mean well he makes some very silly, obvious mistakes that make you want to smack him. He does redeem himself in the end (IMO) but overall he's not the best one out of the bunch. On the other hand, Asa and Kaede were done extremely well with fleshed out histories that explain their motives and reasons as to why they like Rin the way they do. While Sia and Nerine are cute I honestly feel awkward when they come on screen. If it wasn't for the fact that the story revolved around this whole demon/god world thing the story would have gotten along without them. Asa, Kaede and Rin have history behind them that could have been expanded so much more if not for Sia and Nerine needing screen time. For that the characters are alright (with Asa and Kaede being exceptional) but there are simply too many of them.\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest gripe about the characters is how hunky-dory they all were. Sure one of them starts to lose it (won't say who) but for the most part I feel that all these girls get along WAY too well, so much so that I was almost tempted to stop watching the show. I really wanted some more drama and hate amongst the girls and I felt that the developers failed in this aspect. I really have a hard time seeing so many girls get along with each other when they are competing for the same man. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\\n\r\nWhile somewhat bland at times the animation is smooth and fluid. It gets noticeably better when the girls don't have their clothes on (I'm not complaining) but overall it is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe music was kind of blah. While it suited the mood it is forgettable. However the music used for the serious interlude (the one with all five girls standing naked looking miserable) is actually quite fitting and memorable, like something terrible is about to happen. \\n\r\nVoice cast wise I watched the English dub. Rin sounds...boring which suits his character. His sad voice doesn't really convince me either but he does a good job getting angry. The rest of the girls' voices fit and though not spectacular each do their job. Quite frankly I felt that Nerine's and Kaede's voice actresses did an admirable job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really is the sum of all its parts. While it was not the best anime I have ever watched it was enjoyable for what it was and did get me pondering on the characters for a bit of time. If you are looking for a humorous, light hearted harem that eventually turns up the heat this could be for you.",

If you don't get on with the main character then you're not going to get on with the Anime as a whole. It is for that reason and that reason a lone that after watching 21 episodes of Shuffle! i decided i had had enough and to drop this Anime entirely, probably never to finish it ever (much to my shame and annoyance)! \r\nIt started out promisingly enough, similar in many ways to other Animes of the genre, and the main character heldthe illusion of being a likeable character for much of the early episodes, tho i must say that he doesn't really stand out too much. Once i got to the mid point of the series i was finding myself getting more and more getting annoyed with him every time he opened his mouth but as i was watching the dub version i put this down to the voice actor, whom on the English dub is pretty awful (when you're shouting out at the TV \"Have emotion damnit!\" it's not a very good sign your getting quality acting). Having changed to the English sub on episode 15 i continued on hoping that i'll be able to reconnect with the main character and get back into the story, and it worked for a whole 3 episodes, but as the Anime got closer and closer to the final episodes his actions became more and more moronic and his emotional abuse of one of the girls got worse and worse (obviously intentional but i couldn't get on board with the way they were playing it out at all, that it was supposed to be for her own good kind of thing) and once it hit the point where you've got two of the girls just saying how much they wish this moronic arse happiness and how being with him makes one of them so very happy i was like \"That's it i'm done! This scene is supposed to mean something but i've got literary no connection to it cause i just can't bring myself to root for that dick!\"\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, that's it for me for this Anime, which i feel is a shame as so many of the rest of the cast is so likeable and the various side stories (involving OTHER characters) were both interesting and enjoyable, tho overall this is probably just an average Anime at best. As for you if you want to give it ago i suggest watching the first few episodes yourself and make an assessment about whether you like the protagonist or not, if you do keep going and hopefully you won't be put off by his actions later on as badly as i was, if not then get out of it fast!",

            "content": "Shuffle! starts out as an amazingly average harem comedy, nothing really stands out or surprises if you've watched more than a few of these before.(I should probably mention that I do enjoy harem anime, some of my favorite shows fall into this category) Unfortunately the show decided that it couldn't simply be average and that it need to be special by becoming a horrible drama half way through, and in doing so became a mediocre mess. The characters are average the story is average everything is average, but this show still left a bitter taste in my mouth at the end of the final episode.If anything I respect this show because it shows the logical consequences of what a harem would be (jealousy, girls getting upset/angry, etc.), but I still didn't like it. Looking back, I find it difficult to believe that the first and second halves were even part of the same show, the tone of each is so different. \\n\\n\r\nAbout a month after finishing the show, I was able to get my hands on an English copy of the game Shuffle! is based on (the game's name is also Shuffle!). Shuffle! the game is an average 18+ dating sim (I've played several others) with 5 arcs (Sia, Nerine, Kaede, Asa and Primula) of which I have completed 4. I'm honestly left wondering how the makers of the anime managed to screw up the show so badly after playing the game, their choices in what to include or not include seemed almost random, including plot points from every arc almost at random, leaving many of them unfinished in the anime, while also just making things up when they wanted to. Overall, I would suggest getting a copy of the game (available as a $40 download from mangagamer, or you can just get a pirated copy) and playing through each arc, you get the same story, told in a better way, with characters who are portrayed in a better way.",

            "content": "This may have been the first harem that I wish I didn\u2019t want to kill myself watching. \r\nNow before you shrug this off as another generic mess of a harem, I\u2019d like to point out that \u201cShuffle!\u201d was actually a very decent show. Maybe not the best, but it certainly had its heart in the right places for the most part. Starting off with the story, it\u2019s about as lazy as they come. The world is inhabited by three different races of people, yet it\u2019s never fully expanded upon. It just amounts to a flashy plot device so that it doesn\u2019t seem like typical highschool romance bull. However, since this very well establishes itself as a harem early on in the show, it\u2019s hard to really get attached to those types of characters when they generally amount to cardboard cutout archetypes with a range of breast sizes. Though, \u201cShuffle!\u201d dares to be a bit different. Essentially what it feels like is a romance that happened to be slapped the label of \u201charem\u201d because, well, fuck if I know. It certainly takes a few pages from more successful harem/romance shows of the past, and when it portrays romance, it does it exceedingly well. The love stories here, though typically cliched at first glance, become much more intimate and deeper once we get to know the pieces of the puzzle, being the girls. They have a surprising amount of depth to them, and given adequate time in the spotlight to really flesh out their characters. And speaking of characters, let\u2019s get to the main protagonist, Rin.\\n\\n\r\nI usually have problems with the male lead protagonists of harems because most of the time they\u2019re dull, clueless, idiotic dumbasses with no attractive qualities to them at all that makes you wonder why he has a slew of women chasing him. Rin\u2026 is no exception. He\u2019s about as dull as they come, and maybe it might be due to the voice acting, but he didn\u2019t for one second strike me as compelling enough to warrant all the attention he gets. He\u2019s quite a two-dimensional blah, come to think of it. What really draws you in are the girls themselves (shock of the century). They\u2019re all quirky and odd enough to be interesting, and each of them so psychologically damaged, Freud would have a field day. That\u2019s where Rin decides to work his wonders by trying to be an advocate of joy and happiness by solving their problems. Unfortunately he\u2019s not nearly as suave as Yukito from \u201cAir\u201d or Tomoya from \u201cClannad\u201d, so his dull personality makes for some rather dull emotional moments too. I\u2019m just saying, if you\u2019re looking for an interesting central character, you\u2019re better off being absorbed by the other girls\u2019 backstories. The anime does decide to stray far away from harem territory somewhere in the middle when it becomes quite dark in some aspects, and very romance-centered. This is ultimately it\u2019s strongest point.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn\u2019t anything to get excited about, sadly. While it does it\u2019s job, you can certainly tell it had a very tight budget to begin with, and a lot of noticeable shortcuts are taken that end up being distracting if you know what you\u2019re looking for. In the bulk of things, it\u2019s forgivable since you do get swept up along the way in the story, but the most praise I can give it\u2019s style is that it\u2019s very easy on the eyes. The soundtrack isn\u2019t anything to get excited about either. The opening theme, while catchy, isn\u2019t something that warrants much attention after the first few views. You\u2019ll forget it eventually. Since I watched the English dub, I can only criticize those aspects, so I\u2019ll just say that its passable, minus the absolutely horrendous and flat performance given by Rin\u2019s voice actor.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, \u201cShuffle!\u201d starts off as your typical harem garbage that casually builds upon itself and takes some very sharp corners in the plot. Mid-way through the series, it shifts to being an extremely dark (and sometimes unexpectedly violent) romance that might bring some to tears. While it\u2019s harem antiques are evident for at least the first half of the show, you\u2019ll end up being sucked into the plot midway and be taken along for a bumpy emotional ride\u2026 if you want.",

            "content": "As I'm writing this I just finished Shuffle and felt like I needed to do a review of this so, how was it?\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nStory is your basic harem anime where several cute girls are after a guy for one reason or another (read: because he's nice.) However this anime went with a supernatural element and featured girls from the worlds of Gods and Demons which are differentiated based on how big their pointy ears (Gods had ears that looked similar to Link from Legend of Zelda while Demons have the longer elf ears.) The first half of the series, simply put, was your average haremhi-jinx's while the second half went more into each of the 5 main girls character. My biggest problem with the story is that for the most part it's ok. It's not interesting but not boring, but with the added effect of lots of things I would've wished they went into more such as: How and why did the Gods and Demons decided to come to the world of humans? How did they find Rin after 8 years? Why did they hold affection for a guy they met once for 8 years? I don't think an anime has a good story when the first 17 episodes are nothing special and the last 7 are interesting. Why is this? Well you'll find out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nYes I realize that this anime came out in 2005 and yes I realize that anime looks much better art wise while anime in the mid 2000's are kinda ugly but there are still some nice looking anime that came out during this time. Unfotunately, Shuffle is not the anime. This anime is on par with Higurashi in terms of style, just without the random bits of horrible animation like in Higurashi and (for some reason) Shuffle's art style randomly changes, most notably in episdoes 7 and 21, which is why the score is low.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is an ok J-Rock song and the ED is alright. The reason I gave this a low score is because the OST during the show sounds like your generic visual novel OST when characters talk and such. It's...pretty bad.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the reason why I think the anime is what it is and the story is unintersting. Let's run down the main characters:\\n\\n\r\nRin Tsuchimi: For a harem MC he isn't too bad honestly. Yes he has some generic traits that all harem MC's have but in terms of being around women he's not afraid of them when they act lewd nor is he a massive pervert. Rather harmless character. \\n\\n\r\nKaede Fuyou: Childhood friend who's basically acts as a doormat/housewife for Rin. She's basically a background/minor character for almost all of the anime except for her arc (episodes 19-21) where we learn why she act's like she does towards Rin and it's one of the few interesting moments of the series. However I don't think it's good a character is virtually non existant for a large majority of the series. \\n\\n\r\nAsa Shigure: Probably the character I liked the most in the series. Tomboyish and the genki girl of the series, she acts like how she does to being frail as a child with episodes of sickness as she gets older. Probably the only character throughout the whole series that is somewhat interesting.\\n\\n\r\nSia and Nerine: Putting both of them together for good reason. Sia is a princess of the world of God's while Nernie is the princess of the world of Devil's. Sia is the bubbly, energic girl of the series. She's a mix of Asa and Kaede but she's not as smart as those two. A running gag is her hitting her dad in the head with a chair WWF style. Nerine is the dignified and intelligent one, referring to characters with the -sama honorific. She can't cook so in one episode she learns to cook egg omelets (she can only cook this and becomes her running gag of sorts.) All in all, these two are rather unnecessary and uninteresting characters in the long run (their arcs in the 2nd half have the same conclusion that Rin finds out about. Don't know the best way to phrase this without spoiling anything.) These two don't really advance beyond their character type unlike the other three. If these two were gone, and the story was changed a bit, probably would've like it better.\\n\\n\r\nPrimula: The Dandere of the series. Somehow knows Rin (which they never explain) prior to the series and ends up living with him and Kaede. As a dandere she doesn't really talk or show emotions (which they explain in the series) but of course she eventually breaks free from being a dandere. Another decent character.\\n\\n\r\nThere are of course other characters but just like everything else they're not too interesting. The two kings (Sia's and Nerine's dads) are probably the best of the minor characters in the show but the rest are forgettable at best.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is mostly because of the 2nd half (mostly the last 7 episodes.) The first half was ok but did nothing to make me like it or hate it. The last 7 were interesting, if because Kaede's arc was probably the best and (in a rare harem moment) the MC ACTUALLY PICKS A GIRL TO GO OUT WITH INSTEAD OF THE OPEN ENDED HAREM END NONSENSE. Plus the last few episodes you learn more about Asa and her mom which is..actually interesting but once again WHY DO YOU HAVE 17 EPISODES WHERE NOTHING HAPPENS THEN THE LAST 7 ARE RATHER INTERESTING?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't hate this anime nor did I like it. The characters were bland and mostly uninteresting except for Asa (and Kaede towards the end.) The overall series lacked charm. There were jokes that weren't really funny, gags that had potential (Kaede, Sia and Nerine had fanclubs that would chase Rin and at the end of the gag had some guy with binoculars crying and saying some one liner) but just felt kind of stupid mostly due to the writing. I felt the longer the series went on, the gods and demons (mostly Sia and Nerine) felt pointless. This could have been ok with better writing and less focus on Sia/Nerine (once again, the last 7 episodes prove to be the case.) The last episode had a big WTF moment which is another example that there was potential for it to be decent.  Disappointing overall as it seems like with more love and care put into the series it could've been at least decent but instead it's another harem/romcom/drama/ecchi anime that, outside of a few decent moments, falls flat. Watch if you like but don't expect too much out of this.",

The main character picks a girl who wasn't really even in his \"harem\" to begin with, he breaks the hearts of almost every girl in which the showgoes into too much detail in making me depressed as i watch it. \\n\\n\r\nI dropped this show but skipped to the ending just to find something quite mediocre, i personally don't recommend this to your average Harem anime watcher, however if your into tragic anime this might be for you.",

            "content": "When I started this anime, it seemed so much like any other harem anime out there; the nice guy who is surrounded by beautiful women who all adore him.  But as I got further into the story I was surprised at how deep some emotions go.  \r\nThere is a sort of mold this anime could fit into.  If you've seen Love Hina, if you've seen Ichigo 100%, shows like that, you can just about guess what will generally happen in this anime.  However, there's a few quality traits that set Shuffle! apart from these other animes.  \r\nFirst of all, thecharacters and their art level.  Each person in the anime has their own unique qualities, their own personality.  I found that I could identify with a lot of them so easily, as they seemed so human (although they were often a god or demon).  You begin to realize that this isn't just about multiple beautiful women and one lucky guy.  I personally would hate to be in this guy's position, having so many women falling that deep in love with you, having to break all but one's heart...  \\n\r\nBut I digress.  There are a few moments where character interaction seems forced, where a comment, an emotional outburst or something else, seems out of place and rather... awkward.  Most of the time it all flows, all seems to logically piece together.  \\n\r\nAs for the art, this anime was well drawn.  Nothing too special, but it's pretty fantastic, to me.  There are several pantie shots, and surprisingly, quite a few nude chest shots, at least one of each girl.  These too, are well drawn and seem somewhat natural (come on, a high school girl with DD size?) but not too fake.  There's a model ship that Rin is working on, and each shot of the ship itself is well drawn, lots of detail into it.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, there's quite a few things that make me love this anime but those other things that made me somewhat hesitant about it.  I would recommend this anime to someone who enjoys harem styled anime, someone who also enjoys realistic romance, truly falling in love, not some silly &quot;I've just met you once but I'll give you my whole body!&quot; line.  (Although there is something similar... ha)  I doubt any hardcore action fans will enjoy this, so make sure you like the sappy romance and mild drama before you start this.",

The story was quite well planned, every episode had it's feud, and every episode had it's twists; furthermore, the entire story also had it's epic moments. I love the overall story and how each episode played into it.\r\nArt - 10. Perfect animation, and greatly detailed art, I couldn't have been more happy.\r\nSound - 10. I ravaged the internet for the Original SoundTrack for this series. Does that tell you how much I enjoyed the sound? Plus, the voice actors did a great job in makingme feel like they were actually at the scene, but that doesn't seem to be a hard feat in modern anime anymore.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10. There was in depth history to each and every character, most had a dark past that at times, made me wonder why I wasn't crying for them. The main character himself was amazing, though he was the only character without any real background history I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10. It's one of those romantic comedies that makes you want to experience it for yourself. The problems each character faces isn't very far from realistic, and very easily connectable by the watcher.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10. Awesome average, I loved this series. I'd watch the next season if they ever come out with one.",

It has romance, comedy, powers, demon and the rest. But the anime like a few others is kind of a downer. It does start of in a good mood with the love and comedy scenes but 3/4 of the way the mood shoots down straight. You start to get shown the characters bad past, the heart break of choosing 1 girl from the 4  and when it is all view and you are really intoteh anime it can actually bring a tear your eye, I know this sounds stupid but if your really get into it and watch the whole anime you may understand what I am talking about.",

But unlike Rio:Rainbow Gate it doesn't really go too much in the way of things. It's still enjoyable if you don't let it bother you, but I think many series are just taking away points when they shower you with ecchi. I mean I have nothing against it, but it makes it seem trashy... that's why series like that can't get more than a7 in my book. I did enjoy shuffle though. It had interesting characters that were developed(except for Sia and Rina) and I did like the fact that the dark tone that came during the later episodes surprised me. I also like the fact that it ended like I wanted it to end. It is a good anime, but it kind of tries to hard... but it's relatively fun ^^.",

I by the middle of the series, I was definitely rooting for one girl in particular, but in the end I was disappointed with our hero's final choice. I would have given this show only 6/10, but since Rin did make a choice inthe end, I give one more star for that, rather than having the story end leaving it open.",

Also, while the characters are, just by the nature of the show, probably going to be a bit excessively enthusiastic about the male lead, I don\u2019t think it was overdone.Once the series enters it\u2019s second half, it starts getting into the main character\u2019s backgrounds, resulting in a darker and more serious turn in the series. I find this half of the show to be the more interesting half, since we start dealing with actual issues andproblems with the characters instead of just happily going around flashing panties, which is what mostly happens in the first half of the series. \\n\\n",

It is the basic harem scenario 1 guy many girls (which to choose type) but what makes Shuffle! different in my opinion is the way they deliver it. The characters are really unique and there are many funny moments. The plot slowly build up and is pretty good. This anime is basically for those of you who enjoy a happy cheerful storyline with many humorous moments. Also it may seem like it is going slow but it is not. The plot builds up at a good pace, and the ending was great. Also one keything I love about this anime is that it isn't like many harem situation where who the protagonist love can be predicted almost like right off the bat. You have to watch it, because it slowly creeps in almost unnoticeable. Which I really loved. Overall, just go watch it, give it a try, it really is a good anime. :D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n-To be honest, I watched this anime because the scanlated manga only went to chapter 12 and I was impatient to wait for ch.13-ch.36.Then when I started to watch the anime I LOVED it, it was really touching. The story is nice and cute and with many humorous moment thrown into. The characters looked great, like the artwork I mean. Plus each of the girls had a really interesting character and not the generic one's like in many harem situation. For more details just read on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\n-I really loved the story. I may sound like I am exaggerating but I think it really is good. Also the story does have a plot, and it is not like the typical harem situation where you know exactly from watching like the first 5 episode and know exactly who the main guy will end up with. _",

            "content": "In a relationship sense, this anime is a textbook example as to why a harem can be both the most amazing and the worst thing of your life. Still though, decisions that majorly affect your personal status with a larger number of close people, is never and easy choice to make.\r\n'Shuffle!' is an anime where the first half is so boringly slow and predictable it's almost hard to describe in words because instead of keeping tabs on the story, you're already thinking what happens three steps down the track just to pass the time until something worthwhile happens. A little after the half way markis where it really picks up and things start rolling at a much more interesting pace where it makes you want to watch the next episode instead of dragging you on like a boring chore. It really does make up for it.\\n\\n\r\nArt for scenery and backgrounds are most times Pleasing to the eye and well made however animation is quite the let down. The style at random times looses quality and looks as if a middle schooler made it. While it may be for comedic purposes, it more often kills the joke. Animated object more times than not can easily be picked out from the rest of the scenery which stands out to the point of almost looking out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound and Music are well placed and well made even if a lot are repeated more times than you can count and some pieces sound very similar to that of some other well known anime. The singing voices too sound all to similar as if they just recorded it once and put it in multiple places in the anime and sometimes ruins the mood the scene and dialogue had created.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are a major plus for this anime as each character is played out really well in terms of build up, learning to love and emotional breakdown later on. However one let down is that some characters could have done with a bit more screen time with explaining themselves or who they previously were instead of start to finish in but a couple of episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment is somewhat par as the first half of the anime is immensely slow to build up, play out and bridge one where as the second half plays it out a lot faster, more dramatic and a lot deeper. One scene towards the end will even send shivers up your spine. (warning do not watch the final two episodes after having a large feed as weak stomachs will lose it) Before finally the attempted prologue that just reverts back to the grade schoolers art style.",

            "content": "Watching Animes to pass your time seems quite the thing these days, and well, when I pick my animes, I pick 'em by the Genres. Shuffle! is not unique in it's type, that we can all deduce (Ecchi, Harem, Comedy type of Anime is more than all too common). However, after I finished watching the series, I noticed that whoever uploaded the Anime forgot to add \"Drama\" to the genres, and that's where the series goes wrong.\r\nFirst off, the characters' personalities are absolutely superb, all of them seem fitting to the supposed \"Ecchi-Harem-Comedy\" series, and the author did a job well done with that. Theart is also very eye-catching and neat. However, this review will only get worse:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors in this anime are all \"fine\". But \"fine\" isn't enough. How many times did you laugh when one ( or all ) of the characters scream: \"EEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHH!?!?\" or \"NANNNNNIIIIIII!?!?\" in surprise. Well, in Shuffle!, the voice actors lack that kind of talent, and couldn't bring themselves to act at their fullest. Not to mention the often, awkward sound effect accompanying the voices, as if it's being recorded in a poor, low-quality studio.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the above are relatively fine, and could not be mentioned, but my main complaint is the story, especially the ending. First of all, being Gods and Demons incorporated in the story, their presence and power AS GODS and DEMONS is barely shown. It's like it's barely touching the \"Magic\" genre involved in the description. That said, the main character, Tsuchimi Rin's decisions across the story are questionable, as well as some of the characters' pasts. I cannot even count how many times I shouted at my screen: \"DUDE, WHAT THE F*** ARE YOU DOING?! CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON!?\". The story's integrity and whole point, actually, nearly vanished around the final episodes. The whole point of: \"Who will be his girlfriend?\" completely disappears, and turns into: \"Wow, look at how devoted he is\", which is not cool at all. Not to mention that he gave up the opportunity to become GOD or SATAN! WHAT A FOOL! And about the characters pasts, it seems that the authors has a fetish with schizophrenia or something, as well as dark and depressing stories.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the paragraph above could be absolutely avoided if it had a \"DRAMA\"\\n\r\ngenre in the description, which it obviously didn't. Of course, a bit of Drama in any series is inevitable, but the Drama here plays a way too significant part. And the Comedy part is almost not playing any role at all to boot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude: If you want to watch a half-Ecchi, Drama, Harem, Romance and abusive use of Magic - Fantasy, then watch this series (By abusive I mean that it's used only to force constitutive moments in the series, which is kinda' cheap). Do not expect any worthwhile comedy, though. And be ready to get disappointed and extremely pissed off.\\n\\n\r\n6 is the Score for this.",

We have our typical tropes: Playful senpai, big chested oujo sama, cheerful airhead, considerate childhood friend. These are then mixed with a few twists that give them a bit offlavor, judging by the girls alone, I would score the characters a 7. However, when balanced out with the MC, the net character score becomes a 2. \\n\\n\r\nThe MC is your typical thickheaded man of mediocrity, except he lacks any common sense whatsoever, is extremely fickle and shallow, and shows no understanding and empathy to anyone around him, including those he has known literally all his life. Scoring this a 1 was very tempting just out of my desire to spite the dumb MC.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did enjoy the girls very much, this enjoyment was constantly hampered and destroyed by the MC. Some may find him tolerable, but as someone who has watched many, many harems with dumb MCs, I'm appalled by the fact that I still find his actions retarded, his train of thought impaired. Thus, the constant frustration I felt while grinding through the anime, especially over the last 6-8 episodes, completely ruined the enjoyment aspect.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nThis show is a 7 without the retarded MC, a generous 3 with. \\n",

This time I set out on Shuffle!, one of the many recommendations I got from other users as far as harems and supernatural types of anime goes. And I must say, I was blown away by some of the plot points and twists that went with them. I got jerked around back and forth so many times in all the right ways with what was going to happen next and who it would happen too. This anime is not just a comedy, my dearreaders. It is a veritable plethora of so many blended elements that begins as a run of the mill until you get engrossed by around episode 3. When things took off I was completely glued to the story. I felt for the characters, and I saw how a kindhearted person could be in a number of situations yet remain a good natured, helpful individual. I refuse to spoil as many parts of this show as I can and will be short here. WATCH THIS SHOW! it is as simple as that. Like I said, I had no idea how things were going to turn out, but I totally wish it would have taken longer to get there because I wanted to see so much more. This show just was not long enough for me. I liked it so much that the time flew by on me. It will suck you in that well, and I will again say to you all, if you are a harem, drama, supernatural, comedy anime fan. This one needs to be in your library.",

The first girl is named Kaede and she and Rin have lived together since they were kids. Rin went to live with kaede and her father after his parents died in a car accident along with Kaede's mother. Now that Rin and Kaede are old enough Kaede's father goes on business trips that last months. So while herfather is away she takes care of Rin as if they were married. There are two new students that come to Rins school and they both love him do to a past experience eight years earlier. There names are Nerine and sia. They are the daughters of the kings of the god and demon world. There fathers try to pressure Rin to marry one of them. There is also asa i childhood friend and a very energetic person. She doesn't start out loving Rin in the start of this an anime she falls for him later in the story. Then there is primula a demon who was a test subject for a experiment to cure any ailment that a demon or god might have. This experiment caused primula to lose all emotion she can not feel love,hate,happiness, or sadness. Though when she saw Rin her feeling came out. this was a very good anime and is worth watching.",

It just threw off the series for me.  Shuffle has pretty much everything an anime could have, It had comedy, suspense, drama, romance, and even fan service for those who areinterested.  In all it's not bad but just know what you're getting into before you decide to watch it.  Also if you have a heart somewhere in your body you will cry at least once during this series.",
