            "content": "A strong display of emotional resonance; the second season of 3-gatsu no Lion manages to go above and beyond expectations to provide something of overwhelming beauty.\r\nIt\u2019s a show of many acts; the first season\u2014while boasting many heavy themes\u2014is an elegant watch, which reels the viewer in with a soft mood, realistic characters and delightful interactions, but never hits you with strong emotions. The second season\u2014filled with melancholic tones, depressing themes and powerful messages\u2014gives the show raw emotional power to invest the viewer at full force.\r\nShifting from the focus of Rei\u2019s depression, this season brings more focus to the different mentalities of the supporting cast, bothin the real world and the back-drop of shogi. \\n\\n\r\nThe season starts off with a focus on Hinata, and the daunting problem of bullying. Bringing forth an insight into the mass hysteria it brings and the draining effects on the victims, and those caught up in the drama. This arc is nothing short of impactful, and although it\u2019s heavy, it never becomes painful to watch, something many other drama-oriented series fail to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this so powerful is down to the commonly relatable topic of bullying, the powerful visual presentation and the amazing characterisation found in the antagonist Megumi Takagi.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi\u2019s construct as a bully sets her apart from other archetypical antagonists\u2014in the sense that, there are reasons to her actions\u2014she clearly suffers problems in her mentality, leading her to torment others as a form of escapism, giving her somewhat an ability to be emphasised with for the wrong reason.  It\u2019s even easier to empathise with Hina, due to her characteristics, with her helping Rei with his struggles and inspiring him to escape his depression. Rei feels the same on the topic of helping her, creating a close bond between the two, something that plays importance throughout the rest of this season.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first arc is definitely in the lime-light of this season, the series continues to impress in its focuses on different characters. The character study of Souya Touji is a breath-taking display of a mind disturbed solely by the life-style of shogi, with stunning direction to show his inability to hear those around him. The shogi match between Shimada and Yanagiharai uses profound visual imagery to show the determination of both characters and the weight Yanagihara carries. And the pleasant moments with Hina give the show a relaxing and charming escapism from the heavier themes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t consider the cast to be merely characters, they feel human. From Rei to Nikaidou to Yanagihara; each one has strong human characteristics that allow for relatability and empathy for these personalities as we see into their differing lives. \\n\r\nEven though Rei has less focus this season, his role as the lead character is as strong as ever as he seeks a way to help those around him. It\u2019s inspiring to watch, as Rei\u2019s empathy drives him to assist in fighting the varying problems that arise for everyone close to him. His outlook and narration provide a strong connection from the viewer as he continues to improve his life which was once locked in place by his haunting past. As the main character, his journey is an impeccable experience and he is character of relatability and complexity.\\n\\n\r\nThis season exposes elements of characters unbeknownst from the first season, such as the extent of Nikadou\u2019s illness, the pressure Akari feels being unable to help Hina and the different psychological and emotional effects each character experiences in accordance to their surroundings. Each revelation is equally as tense and creates stronger connection to the characters once their situations are understood. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStudio SHAFT empowers storytelling through visual motifs and stunning presentation, bringing everything to life with powerful imagery to reflect the mood each scene portrays. Every visual element is a sight to behold, with gorgeous backgrounds, varying styles and ability to speak many words through its delivery that bring out many emotions from the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThis mood is only enhanced by the stunning soundtrack composition. Melancholic tracks reflecting the depressing yet elegant mood can easily bring you to tears, acting as peaceful additions to the stunning composition of visuals and story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a while now I\u2019ve been pondering over the topic of depression, this in turn has affected the way I view anime titles, and what I get out of said titles. While Cardcaptor Sakura healed me from having negative thoughts, End of Evangelion\u2019s existential elements blew my mind away so much that the thought of depression was no longer on my mind. But, I think the best form of escapism from a feeling like depression is facing it head on, and that\u2019s exactly what 3-gatsu gave me; giving me personal affection to its elements. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, 3-gatsu no Lion is the epitome of human emotion, an experience rivalled by none. A show that has brought me to tears almost every episode, and something I hope many others can appreciate in the same way.\\n",

            "content": "A shrill. As he stretches to fight the leftover sluggishness of a satisfying sleep, he decides to step out on the balcony. The warm wind of a mellow morning slowly brushes past his fragile frame as if greeting him friendly. The sunshine reflects from the river just beneath the railing; a lustrous shimmer signals the change of seasons. He leaves the apartment. A lot has changed over the past year: his listless demeanor is all but gone; he has made friends and acquaintances\u2014he isn\u2019t alone any more. His steps have become strong and determined. He has moved on.\r\nThis show is not about him. Just likeRei, it has moved on from the times of subdued, somber sadness; there is another storm brewing in the distance. Unannounced, but with utter and immediate intensity, the current changes as the happy-go-lucky Hinata gets home one evening: her face is pale, her expression pained; tears start a sinister stream. There is bullying going on in Hinata\u2019s class. After fighting for and protecting the previous victim Chiho who has since left the school, the bullies shifted targets towards her. She knows she did nothing wrong, that what she did was in fact right\u2014but it doesn\u2019t stop her stomach from aching nor her heart from breaking. During a crucial time in Hinata\u2019s life, she is left alone, being ignored by former friends and classmates, utterly isolated. With bullying, there is no easy way out; just one obstacle in the form of a weak-willed teacher is enough to create rips and ripples, all of which reflect, add, and cancel each other out\u2014resulting in complete chaos.\\n\\n\r\nIn face of a problem near impossible for an outsider to resolve, her family and Rei do their best to help: Rei tries to repay the debt of Hinata and her sisters saving his life from dreariness and depression in a misled attempt to rack up money; Akari on the other hand views Hinata\u2019s well-being as a responsibility relayed to her by her late mother\u2014a responsibility too big for her to carry. Both of them fail to accomplish their goals and experience what to them seems like an indisputable defeat. However, this assessment based on the self-centered and self-serving assumption that one can do anything if one tries couldn\u2019t be further off; their so-called failures led to them spending time with Hinata, listening to her. When she ran away, Rei ran after her; in times of sorrow, she found solace in a soothing and supportive home that let her smile again. Was it not for these small everyday gestures, for friends and family supporting her no matter how ferocious or frantic her feelings, she could not have persevered. They didn\u2019t fail. They did well.\\n\\n\r\nThe ripples may wane but they never vanish, Hinata and Chiho might never fully recover\u2014but in the end, these blemishes are part of what makes a human: they add another layer to their characters, dreams, ambitions and passions, to their relationship with family, friend and foe and add context to their everyday actions. As these values accumulate, they give form not to a character, but something greater. All of these people have their own stories to tell, some of which we may never hear of; their stories intermingle and paths cross, branching off and meeting up again\u2014sometimes. Some days, the torrents may grow harsh, but other times may bring with them a friendly flux; some of the tributaries may meet a dead end earlier than expected, others may follow along the river of life and flow until they are released into the deep, dark ocean.\\n\\n\r\nConsequentially, the further one coasts along, the more colleagues and communities one will lose to such bifurcations. For a person such as Kishou Yanagihara, there are no more people to lose: all of his former friends and rivals have thrown in the towel, and as they pass on what is left of their hope and passion for the sport, they also pass on from the world of shogi. Struggling against sickness and fatigue, this burden weighs down heavy on the eldest active shogi player\u2019s frame: their sashes seem suffocating, and like a farmer staring at the remnants of a burnt field, he has no one and nowhere left to turn to. However, just like the farmer he knows that this desolate and depressing wasteland will soon give rise to a new mellow-looking meadow, fertile and fruitful. He catches on fire: his burning passion paints the picture of a haunting human torch slowly burning to cinder and as his fiery fighting spirit overtakes his self-doubt, he finally comes to terms with the fact that life moves on\u2026 even if he won\u2019t let go just yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe show moves on, its natural flow harboring both healing and heartbreak; their paths continue to cross and their stories to intermingle. And as the pieces fall into place, they give rise to an unparalleled display of life and humanity, poignant and personal. March comes in like a Lion sets a new standard not just for Slice-of-Life as a genre, but for storytelling itself.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 100\\n",

            "content": "Outstanding, just as amazing as its first season.\r\nAfter watching the first few episodes, it feels like returning to a warm home on a chilly autumn day, being engulfed by the sweet scent of apple pie and hugging my cup of hot cocoa. \r\nStory: (10/10)\r\nEverything is told through such a beautiful way like a poem. Most of the emotions Kiriyama is feeling are presented to us through the art style, which plays a big part in how the story unfolds. It gives off subtle Your Lie in April vibes but without the extreme sadness.\r\nEach episode is composed simply and even without a lot of action withthe plot it still captures my attention. We follow our favorite protagonist from last season, Kiriyama Rei, as he embarks on a new journey. How his life has taken a turn and he now experiences new things he has never felt before.\\n\\n\r\nHe starts to feel welcome, realizes his worth, his character has made subtle changes from the beginning and it it heartwarming. Just seeing Kiriyama put thoughts into others and share his life with the sisters is such a wonderful sight. There are many more sights like this in the episodes to come, even if they are after boring shogi scenes you have to plow through them, promise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs stated previously, the way the style is drawn out captures the plot and conveys every emotion through color. It shows us what is going on inside Kiriyama without him having to give a monologue for us to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in itself is great, I admire how the producers created this masterpiece. Quality points I'd like to make, Kiriyama is stunning in the first few episodes so far, the colors are like watercolor and the lines are fine like ball point pens. Especially the scenery is like a painting. As expected from how fascinating the first season was. Refreshing none the least. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nWho knew that a simple scene about making ramune make me cry?\\n\r\nThe music captivates my heart and brings me to tears, just remembering the prequel through the reused sounds makes the scenes heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very nostalgic and they even kept the preview music from last season. That would have to be one of my favorite parts of the soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (10/10)\\n\r\nOur favorite boy, Kiriyama, is wonderful. I much more than just admire him, I relate to him in many ways. The way he grows at his own steady pace, how he is overcoming his loneliness, becoming stronger in his own special ways. Of course the spot light isn't all just this memorable main character, the Kawamoto sisters are very valuable to the plot just as much as Nikaidou and Shimada. Even side characters such as Sensei Takashi are a delight to the plot and to Kiriyama's development.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their flaws and their strengths, their own personalities and lives we look forward to getting to know. Not one character is without some part of Kiriyama's life. Even if it means antagonists who really force Kiriyama to rethink his actions and push him over the edge. Especially when side character's struggles are just as harsh as the main character's, it shows that they are simply human. It is beautiful and I won't ever forget the characters who taught, not only Kiriyama but me, lessons of life. As in every anime we look forward to watching, this one really hits home with the characters' developments and struggles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nI absolutely adore this series if you couldn't tell. I don't think I will ever stop admiring Kiriyama Rei. Since I did rewatch the first season I expect myself to rewatch this one. The purly subtle humor is always the best and creates a warm feeling of joy unlike most anime who force out jokes and represent comedy through inappropriate subjects. 3-gatsu no Lion does not disappoint with its mixture of emotional scenes and comedy relief moments.\\n\\n\r\nI am truly happy to see Kiriyama finally happy in this season, he is slowly coming to love himself and those around him. He is having fun in high school, slowly opening up from how he was. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is very memorable and I hope to see anime styles like this for future anime. Although, the original is always the best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt has not changed much from its prequel. Capturing my heart with each episode, 10/10, glad Kiriyama crossed the bridge again.",

            "content": "There is no anime that I am more confident in calling a masterpiece than 3-gatsu no Lion. What it is able to do is so powerful and I find it unparalleled by any other show that I have watched. Every single aspect of the show is masterful and is able to shine and enhance the show even more.\r\nWith 3-gatsu no Lion looks to be about Shogi, shogi is only one thing in a sea of ideas and themes that the show covers. depression as well is a main theme of the show, but I wouldn't say it's the only theme. Rather, I'd say the themeof the show is how everyone is struggling. The ways that the show is able to show this theme is absolutely magical.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has a story. Too often shows forget this. But 3-gatsu no Lion knows this so very well. Nuance is something sorely missing from many shows that 3-gatsu has in spades. Each character that comes up is fleshed out and even flaws as well as strengths/. There is no such thing as the hateable villain that is built up just to be hated. Every single character is shown the good and bad parts of them. Whether it be a bully or the opponent to a shogi match, each character is treated like someone real who has their own issues and things that they have to deal with. And while they may do things that aren't nice. and in any other show would get them labelled as an unlikeable villain, 3-gatsu is able to show that there are other aspects of their life that make them this way. Everyone is explored in this way and it makes the show feel so real. In the end, there is no such thing as a truly bad person, and 3gatsu gets it.\\n\\n\r\nWhats even more amazing is not just that it's able to flesh out these side characters, but the extent to which it's doing so. 3-gatsu has the powerful ability to make a character cast them in a negative light, but then show you their own story and change the audiences view so that they now want to root for them as well. It's magical how the show is continually able to showcase different situations and different issues that are relatable and lead one to want to support the one that they are watching. Even if they were the opponent just a few minutes ago, the depth and feeling that goes into exploring these characters brings me around to them, and makes it so it's hard to decide, who do I want to see win?\\n\\n\r\nAdded to this is 3-gatsu's powerful imagery. 3-gatsu uses images in the best way that I've seen in animation. While I'm fine with a more realistic approach and like what most anime do, there is something extremely powerful about 3-gatsu's art and animation. Metaphors and symbols are brought up. But they aren't just flashed onto the screen. They are explored and shown in the person that they are digging into. If someone feels tied up and forced into something, it's not just something that they say, it's something shown with multiple sashes building them in place and making it hard for them to move at all. Creative and powerful visuals are something that 3-gatsu does so well. Even in the lighthearted happy scenes 3-gatsu is able to make them feel so rich. Bright happy colors and smiles litter the scenes and make them so infectiously happy. They're sugary sweet and are even able to make those happy feelings feel so rich. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all that leads into another aspect of 3-gatsu's power. The duality of life. While the show may be focused on struggles and depression, the show also knows that there are happy parts of life. Life isn't just a series of unfortunate events. While many other shows would focus on the negative to show that 3-gatsu shows everything. It shows the dark and sad moments and the art and animation to go along with it. But it also shows the moments of family, fun, friends, and all of the things that they do that brings light into their world. 3-gatsu even gets to the point of having cats talk to showcase the happy atmosphere that they're going for. And these scenes are so powerful because they show what bonds can do even through struggles. While everyone is struggling and have their issues, they're still able to come together and have a fun time. To support each other. And those moments feel so rich with that in mind. 3-gatsu really gets life it's not just good or bad things. It's good and bad things. And no show comes close to detailing them both with as much power as 3-gatsu no Lion does.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what makes it so magical. It's not only able to make one feel strong feels, but it's also able to make one feel happy, to make one invested in a character they only just met, and make me at least feel this greater appreciation of the world around me. Nuance is the word that so many anime lack but 3-gatsu has. And in the end, every element of this show is masterfully done. The story is engaging and well written. The characters are filled with flaws and depth. The art is filled with rich symbolism and power, and the music to go with it fits very well and only increases the power of this show. Not only is this one of the best shows that I've ever watched, but I feel like it has something really important to say. Everyone is struggling. Everyone is good and bad. While one may be an enemy or someone seen unfavourably there is probably a reason they are that way and there is more to them than just that. And if the world was able to understand it I think it'd be much better off. This show isn't just masterful at all of its elements, it also gives a greater understanding of the world which I think would benefit everyone. If there was any show that I'd recommend to anyone it'd be this one. This is the best that animation has to offer, and I love it.",

            "content": "One year after 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s first season, the second one has arrived. And it manged to be even more outstanding. \r\nSeven months after the first season\u2019s ending, we get to see the continuation of Rei\u2019s journey; His journey to find happiness and a place where he belongs. Has he managed to overcome his emotional scars and find people he can call friends and family?\r\nThe second season starts in a truly heartwarming way that shows how much Rei has grown and how lucky he feels for finally finding friends he can have fun with at school, and a family in the Kawamoto household. When comparedto his former self, a boy with a reclusive personality and depression caused by his traumas and insecurities, Rei has grown as a person in an amazing way. While he is still a flawed being and is still searching, he has slowly overcome most of his personal issues, gained confidence, started trusting others and being more open to them while creating meaningful relationships with them. And most importantly, he is able to smile and laugh honestly, from the bottom of his heart. His pure laugh at the end of episode 16, even though it might sound like a simple thing, was one of the most powerful scenes of this season.\\n\r\nHis growth throughout the whole anime, whether it\u2019s done through his everyday life or the competitive shogi scene, is truly impressive and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Rei isn\u2019t the only character to get the spotlight and, even though he is the protagonist, there were quite a few episodes where he felt like he was a side character. But when it comes to 3-gatsu a situation like this is welcome. Umino Chica has the talent to create amazingly realistic and unique characters. It\u2019s never uninteresting to follow an episode or a whole arc focused on a side character, slowly see him being fleshed out, to learn his background, his personal thoughts, problems and worries. \\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters like this from the professional shogi scene, like Yanagihara and Souya, but even some that got less focus like the pigeon man (Yamazaki) and others. No matter how much focus they got, they were all memorable characters with interesting personalities and backgrounds.\\n\r\nOther characters that we know from the first season, like Nikaidou, Shimada and many others, keep appearing and receiving their fair share of focus and development.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kawamoto sisters are shown a lot in this season, mainly because of a certain arc: The arc about Hina becoming a victim of bullying.\\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest arcs of the story so far for many reasons. It depicts bullying, the reasons behind it, its consequences and the damage it can cause in a very realistic way, without exaggerating it. The main bully, Takagi, is a really mean girl, but through her meetings with the homeroom teacher we get to understand the reason and thoughts that led to her actions. This doesn\u2019t make what she did any better, but it\u2019s great to see that even a character like her is getting a realistic personality.\\n\r\nThe one who supported the Kawamoto family was Rei, even if he thought that he couldn\u2019t do anything for them. The Kawamoto sisters were the ones who gave him affection and treated him like family, and now he\u2019s the one helping them. It\u2019s nice to see how much Rei has developed and come to love the Kawamoto family through this.\\n\r\nOf course, the one who got the most focus and development in this arc was Hina and her relationship with Rei. Her emotions and thoughts were fleshed out incredibly through the whole arc. She showed how great a character and brave girl she is, and Rei even felt like he was saved by her words.\\n\r\nThe rest of the Kawamoto family, mainly Akari, got a bit of focus in this arc, as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is still done in a poetic way, with a slow pace that makes the viewer immersed into the story as it gradually progresses.\\n\r\nWhile the anime is dramatic for the most part, the lighthearted comedy is still here. The subtle comedy of 3-gatsu no Lion is pretty funny and it can bring a smile to the viewers\u2019 face or laughter. It doesn\u2019t feel forced and the balance between the dramatic and funny moments is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, too, shogi has an important role in the anime. The psychology during the matches is portrayed excellently. The great description of the characters\u2019 thoughts and emotions during the matches, helps the audience that can\u2019t understand shogi know what\u2019s going on the board. During the matches, the characters also find the chance to get fleshed out and developed, which leads to the story\u2019s progression.\\n\\n\r\nLike in the first season, studio Shaft has followed every single scene and line of the source material faithfully. They have only mixed up a few chapters at the end of the anime to make a more suitable ending episode, but this doesn't really pose a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and character sections of the review have gotten a bit mixed up already, but when it comes to a character-driven story like this one, it\u2019s hard to talk about the plot without mentioning the characters. But rather than a plot with a clear beginning and ending, 3-gatsu no Lion mostly consists of pieces of different characters\u2019 lives presented in a realistic and human way.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion does an exceptional work at presenting complex, deep, realistic characters and fleshing them out. Their personalities, backstories, flaws, thoughts, worries and emotions feel human and even relatable. The anime never forgets any of them, it keeps showing them to the audience and developing them, while they all have a part in Rei\u2019s life, even if it is as an obstacle.\\n\r\nThe relationships and interactions between the characters also feel very human and the chemistry between them is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on the art and animation, it\u2019s quite easy to notice that studio Shaft has put an even greater effort to the already awesome visuals of the first season. Umino Chica\u2019s artstyle combined with Shaft\u2019s powerful direction, fluid animation and unique touches is a delight to the eyes. The artwork seems experimental at times, but there is also a feel of realism in it.\\n\r\nThe color palette is really nice and the colors are used correctly according to what each scene wants to convey. Dark colors show up in the dramatic scenes and brighter ones for the more lighthearted ones. The shift of the colors really adds to the mood and atmosphere and makes the audience understand better how the characters feel at that moment, especially when it comes to the serious and dramatic scenes and the shogi matches.\\n\r\nThe use of metaphorical scenes with symbolism is truly masterful, and depicts the characters' thoughts and emotions in a very creative way.\\n\r\nThe character designs are still good and unique and the characters\u2019 expressions are drawn in a great way.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are beautifully drawn and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is truly captivating, the soundtrack has an active role in creating the appropriate mood for each scene and allows them to convey their feeling better.\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs, just like in the first season, are very good and memorable. It\u2019s also a nice detail that the songs keep getting a bit cheerier and have brighter art as Rei gradually grows and becomes happier by overcoming some of his troubles. They are all nicely directed with great animation and the use of watercolor-like colors in some of them is beautiful.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an awesome job once again and managed to convey the characters\u2019 feelings perfectly. \\n\r\nEven the animals\u2019 little dialogues in their cute voices are pretty funny.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are also used well.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is an anime with a unique take on the slice of life genre. It doesn\u2019t just follow everyday adventures of characters\u2019, but it also gives them a mature and human touch. The anime\u2019s storytelling is truly intriguing with its heavy characterization and greatly used psychology. Its life lessons regarding different issues one can come across in life and growth of the characters can even influence the viewers. It\u2019s a series that makes simple everyday things feel powerful and offers compelling drama. Along with the beautiful artwork and music, it can stir up the viewers\u2019 emotions and tug at their heartstrings through both the dramatic and lighthearted scenes. Watching 3-gatsu no Lion is a breathtaking experience, a true masterpiece that keeps surpassing the viewers' expectations and capturing their hearts.",

            "content": "If you thought that the Shogi in season 1 was boring but stuck it out anyway for the melodrama then you are in luck! \r\n     For many people season 1 was good and season 2 only gets better. And if you thought that the best part of the show was the MC's inner turmoil then by all means this second season won't let you down! As long as you weren't too attached to Kiriyama Rei that is. We kind of left him behind to pursue other crestfallen and overly dramatic heroes. If you think questions like\"show me the proof\" should be followed by 3 full minutes of internal dialogue as a black haze surrounds the horror-struck listener, then it doesn't get better than this!\\n\r\n     If you are only in it for the art, be not afraid. They didn't suddenly fire their art team and higher the guy who did Pingpong! \\n\r\n     As far as I am concerned, however, this show is a far cry from its predecessor. The plot is a rehashing of the MC's struggle in season 1 but in a MUCH less interesting setting with much less interesting characters. There are entire episodes in which Kiriyama does not appear, because he simply plays no significant role in the plot. The story of the young, struggling, prodigy shogi player stagnates and falls by the wayside. The story of a person battling their inner demons lives on, growing increasingly mawkish to the point that Season 2 is almost a parody of season 1. I had expectations that the story would have to change to move on with Kiriyama. I never imagined that instead the story could remain the same and it is Kiriyama who has been left behind.",

            "content": "For people new to 3-gatsu no lion, the main problem with this series is, It doesn't have any negative reviews and it feels as if fans are only watching it. So here I am writing a genuine review for you so that you might have a better understanding of the series you are about to watch.\r\nFor an anime to be worth 10 ratings for people reading your review, you have to get that nostalgic feel or be in that anime trance for a week or at least for a few days, it should be as if the scene were replaying over and over before youreyes. \\n\r\nBut guess what?, I forgot the feeling just after a few hours watching it.\\n\r\nAn anime can be praised for its Art, music, and character development, but at that end of the day what you need is to watch a story and be able to tell damn I felt connected and stay in that story for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nSo how did this anime get such high ratings and top reviews? Well 'March comes in like a lion' has 22 episodes and is a Slice of life (SOL), So most chances of people watching season 2 are due to the appreciation it received from season 1. i.e, mainly fans of this series watch it hence the final result is the rating you see and most of the 10 rated reviews are those which are written because of the last 4 episodes, damn they are too good, but that doesn't mean you have to sit for 16-18 episodes of normal everyday life to get that smiling conclusion. Well, I am not saying that it is overrated, I am just cautioning you to not get deceived by them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is actually too much into a \"Slice of life\" (SOL) that it wouldn't give you any lesson or knowledge which you might be expecting in a SOL or in an anime.To be honest this is just way perfect SOL, without much melodrama but more into daily life activity which might or might not be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTo all those who haven't watched the season 1, if you are a fan of SOL type of anime then this is the best thing for you or else if you are trying to adjust watching this due to its rating then I am sure you might be disappointed and left with regret. Just watch it like an another SOL, then it's better and you might even be a fan. \\n\\n\r\nI'll stop the commenting here about the overall series, I wrote all that to lower your hype levels, the following review is based on the idea that you have already watched season 1 : (If you need REVIEW ON SEASON 1 then I'm writing it under the heading \"FAQs\", look for it below)\\n\\n\r\nPLOT:\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues from where it stopped in season 1, i.e., from the formation of the Shogi science club and the normal everyday life of Rei begins, as usual, going to school, playing shogi etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is divided into 4 major Arcs: Bullying Arc, Souya Arc, 'Match b/w shimada and Sakutarou Yanagihara' Arc and finally, 'Hinata's future after middle school' Arc followed by the conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is made as if all the problem in the world come only to these people surrounding Rei...as you know shimada in season 1 with stomachaches, Nikaidou with anemia, Hinata with bullying, and then there is Souya and Sakutarou which I won't spoil. It makes you feel irritated at some point actually but somehow the writer tries to compensate the feeling in later episodes by either giving unexpected or a satisfying conclusion to the Arc.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the experience you might go through with the series so that reading this will help you get a better idea of what I meant from the sentences used at the beginning of the review: (I've put the arcs in such a way not to spoil you, as a matter of fact there is nothing to spoil in a SOL of this kind)\\n\\n\r\nComing to the 1st Arc:\\n\r\nIt was able to portray bullying in the best possible way unlike any other anime, which only show up to what child experiences but not what parents face. Its actually Hinata who is a victim of bullying, but the problem was, I was feeling most of the time,\" why isn't it over yet, dammit why is he dragging so long, I need to know what happens in the future\", the reason I felt is because of the pacing, it was too damn slow, watching Hinata in such situation was unbearable, I just wanted her to be out of it as soon as possible, the story neither was fully concentrating on bullying nor on shogi matches...it was felt half hearted as if the episodes were put just to show a script rather than creating an impact.(earlier episodes) but in later ones, the feeling is compensated a little like I said by giving a good conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n2nd Arc:\\n\r\nThis is my favorite Arc of all the Arcs, which really concentrated on Rei's Shogi skills and mainly creating that exciting environment before a match begins, It also gives you more information on the Walking devil or Shogi playing Machine, the lookalike of Rei:- Meijin Souya\\n\\n\r\n3rd Arc :\\n\r\nThis Arc is a match between Sakutarou and our beloved Shimada, Well Its another match between two people who aren't the main characters, between an old man defending his title and a promising new generation genius. This is also another dragging story, with repetitive flashback scenes which are kinda irritating.\\n\\n\r\nWell I know a little about the feeling of players of mind games since I am a chess player myself, to be honest the things shown here, like the thought process behind players especially in Sakutarou's case, it was meant to create emotional connection with the story...but the truth is, what really goes on in the mind is that you will be actually thinking about what the next moves are gonna be and mostly with a feeling that you shouldn't be losing... because the amount of mental strain is too much for you to think about what your \"friend said\". There is absolutely no chance for you to remember his words and reminisce because if you are losing a match, your brain would be really depressed cutting off such thoughts, it would try to either fight back or give up.\\n\\n\r\nand 4th Arc:\\n\r\nThis arc is another boring or routine story which you see almost in every Slice of life stories where it's the end of the school and time to move on... \\n\r\nand finally, there comes the perfect ending which is made with all the best soundtracks and colorful Art, they are able to hold both the fan-base, the haters back which resulted in 9 and 10 rated reviews.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yeah I almost forgot!!! The Jokes are the same usual lame dumb ones with 'squeal' and 'swish' character sounds, but you really need them because they are the ones which seem to relax our brains after such mindscrewing sad scenes. The jokes made in the 22nd episode were the only ones which made me laugh truly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nRei: He seems more mature and responsible and is helpful instead of being a crybaby. This series is not about him or his past, I can guarantee you that. \\n\\n\r\nHinata: Well she is a really cute and a good person, to be honest, I kinda like her attitude of helping others and sharing your problems with family rather than shutting yourself which is the best thing you can learn from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nRest all characters aren't focussed much or I don't feel the necessity to mention them, I wish there was more Shimada's or Nikaidou's character development, but unnecessary time was wasted on many parts like Yamazaki Junkei's lifestyle etc. \\n\r\nMany situations in the series are made such that we are out in a situation where it is the middle of a conversation and you don't know how they came to be in that situation. It was meant to cut short the time but it kinda seemed awkward to not get the full impact of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art is in its peak form, It is really way better than the season 1, the 3 sisters who take care of Rei are cute as ever and the scenarios are beautifully drawn, I fell in love with the city lights in background and moonlight which are better colored and drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThis time the soundtracks weren't that great, I mean most of the scenes were sad ones so yeah there were mostly normal melancholy guitar and violin with a mix of flute music. But in the last 4 episodes, we get to hear the beautiful soundtracks which are famous in season 1 to come back and give us the happy peaceful sound to the ear. The openings and endings songs aren't that good when compared to season 1, but were kinda normal to hear, only the 2nd ending song seemed good with the piano intro.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nYeah, it may be a Masterpiece of great Art and well-written psychology of people and their reactions to the situation, but for normal general audience like me, we can't get the true essence from one sitting, or don't have time to re-watch it either cos It has 22 episodes of content with lots of meaningless stuff in between. If you liked the season 1, then I would definitely recommend you to watch this season, but if you hate it then don't watch this series because even if it shows about bullying and has few good episodes like last 4, I would rather ask you to watch some other anime than this :)\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFAQs:\\n\\n\r\nSEASON 1 REVIEW:\\n\\n\r\nI am not a fan of Studio Shaft's Art or animation, I don't like anime similar to Monogatari series because of their Art, which feels weird, but 3-gatsu no lion's Art is different from those type of series, because even though, it looked black blue and whitish colours which represent sad theme, it also has colorful drawings with beautiful soundtracks representing the happy atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCutting everything short, its a Slice of life of a high school student and kinda orphan named Rei Kiriyama who is a professional Shogi player, who lives independently with the money he gets from the games, he is sometimes taken care by 3 Sisters(one of them is Hinata) who live in the neighborhood.(I Don't want to mention further as its already available in the plot of the series) \\n\\n\r\nWell many anime have the scenario as if the hero has a natural talent but due to financial problems, they wouldn't come up. But this one is different, our hero has talent, money and also has a family to help. But did you ever think that this talent would make you go away, live separately and lead a sad depressing life? This anime depicts some another level of reality which actually makes you relate to it and the only problem is there is no \"Moral of the Story\" at the end.\\n\\n\r\nlike I said earlier Art is good and soundtracks are best which were the ones that made me compelled to watch this show, they are also perfectly timed to give you correct emotions. Even the opening and ending are simply awesome which makes you listen to it at every episode without skipping.\\n\\n\r\nComing to Enjoyment, starting 2 episodes were boring, but it picks the pace and moves on to another level by keeping you engaged till the end. By the way, the jokes are dumb, please bear with them, you might get used to them in the longer run.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 Overall:\\n\r\nGo and watch season 1 without dropping in the first few episodes, it is good, But if you hated after completion, then skip season 2 because season 2 is similar to 1 and it might turn out to be 22 episode hell. :P (This season 1 review is dumb, please read other reviews in reviews section as I don't have time to write it properly)\\n\\n\\n\r\nComparison between both the Seasons:\\n\r\nSeason 1 is way better when it comes to story and narration, because there is suspense feel throughout the series and keeps you wanting to know what actually in Rei's past...but season 2 is more of the SOL of other characters( Mainly Hinata) and hence not much suspense is present, you just feel like watching it just for the sake of completion...\\n\r\nThere is also a perfect representation of the feelings of players during a match in season 1 as I personally know as a chess player which was shown very less in season 2\\n\r\nOnly the match between Souya was the coolest thing in this series because you get to know about the great Meijin.\\n\\n\\n\r\ndub? : Season 2 doesn't have a dub yet, but the dubbed version of season 1 is good and has good English.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why I couldn't like this show (season 2) that much, maybe it's because I was tired binge watching continuously without gap both seasons, it made me exhausted by the time I reached 16th episode in season 2. If you want me to re-watch it again to get a better understanding, its just way too much pain to sit through another 22 episodes and waste time, I would rather go watch some new anime to know a new story :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "All fart no shit.\r\nAfter finishing season 1 I was very excited to watch season 2 and after finishing it, I am more than a little disappointed. Writing one of the most negative reviews for this anime brings me no pleasure, but I really wanted to put into words why this left me feeling so disappointed. \r\nThe first season set up a lot of different interesting things that do not get pay off here. A big part of season 1 is Rei's foster sister Kyouko, who fell for a man the same age as her father because she felt that Rei replaced her, leaving her feelingsort of obsolete to her father. Also it is implied that Kyouko sexually assaulted Rei when they were younger. Nothing is done with this in season 2. Akari at 19 years old had watched her mother die, her dad leave, and she was then responsible for raising her younger sisters. Nothing is done with this in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nIt is incredibly frustrating to me how little development or new information there is in this season. I was really looking forward to seeing more of Rei and Kyouko's relationship, but it is as if she never even existed. If I was not supposed to care about her then why spend a few episodes in the first season making me care? I really do not understand this. I'm assuming this is addressed later in the manga, but Kyouko deserves more screen time. Ignoring her until she is maybe needed for some future episodes is not OK. Her story hasn't moved forward at all this season. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is what the show did with Akari. Nothing. A 19 year old who is forced to raise 2 kids is not worth exploring apparently. A third season could explore her character more, but currently with 44 episodes out there just isn't enough to her character. She is a single parent who cares deeply about her family and is also working to support them financially. She never complains and is completely selfless. Her character is not believable. I need to know how she got to where she is, and what sacrifices she has made in her life, simply hinting towards it isn't enough for me. If she has accepted that she is a single parent and needs to dedicate a large part of her life to that, show her making that decision. She must have gone through a lot, and I want to see it. We know hardly anything about her. Also it is impossible for a single parent with a job to cook the meals Akari cooks and not be incredibly stressed and/or tired. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were to add up all the scenes of characters cooking or eating with nothing important to the overall plot happening, it would probably be over an hour of footage. Most of what the sisters seem to do is cook and eat food. If you do not enjoy watching people eat food then this anime will be boring for a lot of its runtime. After really enjoying season 1 I was fast forwarding through some scenes in this, which made me feel sad. And does anyone really want to watch two old men argue about some shit that is unimportant to anything else happening in the series? Far too many scenes with old men being boring. \\n\\n\r\nRei seems happier in this season than the previous, but it doesn't feel logical. Previous plot points that would require Rei to change as a person to resolve are simply ignored so Rei can move forward. He mentions he doesn't have the confidence to phone his sister, and then it is never mentioned again. There is no substance to anything. His relationships with people need to be in a different place at the end of a season than to the start otherwise what was the point? The only character he connects with in any meaningful way is Hina. \\n\\n\r\nThe main plot of this season revolved around bullying. A serious topic and the anime does treat it as serious, showing how it affects children's lives. This is easily the strongest part of this season. Hina is bullied and it mirrors Rei's time in school when he was bullied and all alone. The difference this time though is that Hina is not alone, because she has Rei to help her. He wants to save her from what he had to go through. His motivation is clear and his actions (mostly) make sense. The resolution of the bullying would have happened if Rei was not even there and he himself knows this. However the support he offered to Hina helped her get through it and is reason for him to be proud. It was frustrating then when he felt like he did nothing; this could have been a turning point for Rei where he gains confidence and has reason to like himself more, but the anime hurries onto the next thing. On the topic of Rei and Hina, he is 18, and she is 13. Rei's teacher thinks he's in love with her and encourages him. He is 18. She is 13. Bad teacher! \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my thoughts on this season, I am quite upset to write that I disliked it. There were individual moments that were good, but the anime lacked focus. After the first season I was ready to recommend 3-gatsu to a friend, but now I am not going to (if a third season comes out and is as good as the first then this will change). I went through all the episodes in a short amount of time and honestly feel like it was a waste of time. It is possible that a third season could fix the problems I have with this show and focus more on interesting character development, and I really hope a third season does happen. A lot of people seem to love this series and me not enjoying it doesn't mean I want others to not enjoy it. I honestly tried to enjoy this, but I was left wanting a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.",

Though the anime does revolve around the main character as a professional shouji player, I found that even I, with as little understanding of this japanese board game, was able to immensely enjoy this anime.\r\n  What this anime truly revolves around are the individuals surrounding the main character, and the lessons he learns from helping them through the hardships and trials they encounter within their own lives.  In turn he applies what he learned from overcoming these hardshipsto his own life.  This anime to me exemplifies a journey of self discovery, a journey which as shown is this anime, is a cycle through suffering from uncertainty, and joy through the act of grabbing a hold of life.",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie, I liked the first season of this, but I felt it fell a bit flat in the second half with it's focus on shogi, and less focus on Rei and his development with the characters around him. This season solves that. Let's start with this, I need to bleach my brain. Not because it's so bad that I want to unsee it, but because it's so good, that I won't be able to look at anime again, my expectations have exploded through the roof and hit FUCKING JUPITER. Let's start with the review. And note, there will be spoilers, and theseries is so good, watch it before reading the review, because I want to spoil nothing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10. This arc focuses mostly on one thing, Hina, but does shift it's focus at times to look at other characters, including Nikaido and Rei's Shogi Science Club, but the main focus is Hina, or more specifically, Hina being bullied. This arc had some of the most realistic looks at bullying I've ever seen, with actually messages sent out in very well done ways. It doesn't over exaggerate it, and yet, it perfectly illustrates how damaging bullying can be, and what it means to speak up. And that's not even mentioning how well it fit into the characters and story. Speaking of...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. It would be a lie to say I didn't love the sisters, Hina especially, but this season, heck, one scene, made her into a character so likable and complex, she may be my favorite character in all of anime. And that's not to say Rei isn't interesting either. He feels like a human, he has flaws and fears, and anxiety. He is pessimistic, but the way we see him grow from those around him (Newcomer Finals) and the way he learns to be happy is so refreshing. He feels complex too, carrying that darkness, but learning to accept the happiness around him.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. The music is just good. I don't notice it during normal scenes, it's just kinda... there, but when the really serious scenes come on, it gets good, REALLY GOOD. The soundtrack is beautiful, adds to the emotions, to the point where you can cry for a pigeon or FRACKING RAMUNE CANDY. And the intro and outro really grew on me, so much so, I was sad to see it get a new one, but don't worry, the new one's good too. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Yeah, order's messed up, but whatever. The art man, where do I begin. First of all, it's nothing like you've seen before, looking like Your Lie in April met with Madoka Magica and Monogatari, with hatched eyes, long lips, beautiful usage of colors, and images and backgrounds so good looking, it gives 5 Centimeters per Second a run for its money. And then there's the changes in art. The art can go from it's normal, to cut out, to pencil, to these archaic sketches, and the odd part is, it looks good. It doesn't distract from the scene, in fact, it adds to it, giving it more power than if it were to stand alone. That's impressive, and this is possibly the best looking anime I've ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I can't even begin. Certain episodes, I was inches from the screen, holding my breath. Other episodes, I was practically cheering (not practically) when they were over. This anime has brought me to tears of both sadness and happiness, and there were episodes where for all 24 and a half minutes (I don't watch the previews), I was smiling like an absolute idiot. I have never enjoyed an anime quite this much, and that's really saying something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Honestly, this anime should define an entire generation. It sadly was pretty overlooked since it didn't fall into the categories of \"fantasy\", \"comedy\", \"romance\", \"sci-fi\" or \"shounen\", making it very underwatched despite it's high ratings, but it deserves to be. This anime was breathtaking, with scenes so emotional and powerful, I couldn't breath, all I could do was stare at the visuals and listen to the music. It's down to earth and relatable, and the character development, story telling, and beautiful music and artistic symbolism, all that makes this anime a true gem. Now, is this the best anime I've ever watched, very likely. I decided to let the season end before I decide, but so far, absolutely nothing can match the dramatic, heartwarming, beautiful masterpiece that is Sangatsu no Lion. If you hadn't seen it and watched the review anyways, go check it out, it's worth it.",

            "content": "This review will solely focus on the characters and offer a perspective which is not even acknowledged in 3-Gatsu no Lion's listed genres. This review will be about psychology.\r\n*This review contains spoilers, not so much regarding plot, but character behavior*\r\nMore than being an anime about life and its dramas, 3-Gatsu no Lion is a study on social psychology. What this means are the different \"us\" that we show to different people in different environments. For example, how differently we act in the company of strangers, friends, school/work buddies and among our own family. 3-Gatsu no Lion shows multidimensional aspect of all of its characters fromtheir personalities to their personal life. For this reason, it is comparable to such mindfuck tier anime series as Serial Experiments Lain and Texhnolyze. However, 3-Gatsu no Lion does not try to be deep nor complex, it does not try to confuse its viewers with obscure references and by adding details that are 2deep4anyone and everyone to get. Instead, it offers a perspective on life, perspetive that can only be called brutally honest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKiriyama Rei,\\n\\n\r\nIn the very beginning, we have a scene where Rei analyses an ongoing shogi game with the words \"From this point on, he was trapped. There was nowhere left for him to go.\" Upon saying this, there is a time, a fraction of a second when he does not move. Shinbou Akiyuki showed with the power of just couple of frames what Rei was thinking. \"This same sentence could have been used to describe my own life not too long ago.\" This can easily be tagged as an over-analysing, but after seeing both seasons twice and knowing with how much detail this series comes, it is clear that Shinbou managed to deliver Rei's thoughts. This time around, a cloud is not covering his face nor is he drowning, he simply is there and that was enough. More on Rei in Hina's part near the end of review. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKawamoto Akari,\\n\\n\r\n\"Is this truly the same Akari.\" Sentence said by Rei. When she works, she is not the motherly elder sister. When she is alone with Rei, she shows her weaknesses, the yearning she holds towards her mother, the unspoken betrayal of his father, how she worries over her sisters and the grandpa who won't always be there. She is not afraid to cry. When her sisters are present, when there is company over, fun night held and food being eaten, she is the heart of the house, the spirit that keeps everyone up and going. She loves to help those in need, be it Rei, her Sisters or the stray cats she adopted, or even that one owl, she nurtures. During the psychosomatic symptoms seen in Hina, she admits that she is taking care of all of these things, not for the sake of them, but for the sake of her herself. More on Akari in Hina's part near the end of review. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKouda Kyouko,\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting abandont by her father, and witnessing her family destroyed, she falls in love with the person she shouldn't, sexually assaults her own brother, and gets called \"the devil in woman's body\" constanty. The author put herself in a tight spot to say the least when it comes to Kyouko. Seeing her as the devil that she is often called will easily be the viewer's conclusion of her character as well. She is behind the thickest of shells. Wanting to believe in her own victimhood, but also to protect her father from her own personality, she runs away - not like a devil in woman's body, but as a child who is incapable of forgiving. The sexual assualt, which was hinted in total of 2 times during the series can be seen backfired. She regrets, and this is clearly confirmed in two different ways. First one being that she constantly worries about Rei. Despite this being seen as a bother and bullying in situation such as her trying to crush Rei's confidence in upcoming games, she is also making him a stronger person by doing this. The other reason is her love for Rei. She trusts she is forgiven, and acts like a sister seeking support, openly asking for help and crying in his presence. Akari says \"they do not act like sisters\" but this is a perfect example of how shelled person Kyouko is, and there is more sister-brother relationship there than anyone, including the siblings themselves, are ready to accept. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Gotou,\\n\\n\r\n\"What is right and what is wrong, are you the one who gets to decide that. Are you, perhaps, God?\" After hitting Rei and scolding him for his naivity, it is easy for the viewer to see Gotou as a villain. Ultimately, he is a teacher with great life-experience. What he did by becoming the villain was direct Rei towards opening his eyes to the real world. All of this he did with uncertainty. Not knowing what he himself should actually do with the love and support Kyouko is ready to offer for him, but at the same time being married to a woman who only lies down in the hospital bed waiting for death. Is it truly okay to move on already? That is a heavy question for him. The scene where he falls asleep next to Kyouko is a good example where we see what he wants. At the same time, he also defended Kyouko's own decisions of what she wants. He is aware of this contradictory. It show just how much weight his wife's fate weights his shoulders.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nKawamoto Hinata,\\n\\n\r\nFrom the epitome of 2pure4this world to the girl who goes near rivers to cry, Hina's personality thusfar is the most complex. Missing her mother even more than Akari, and completely silencing herself about the betrayal of the father, life is not about the pretty buttefly stuff for her. Hina is a mere child, yet the whole 2nd Season of 3-Gatsu no Lion focuses on making her life a living hell. Starting from the loss of best friend, followed by bullying, getting betrayed by yet another adult incapable of helping her when she most needs it, just to see it all come down to a point where she has to let go off her life long love. Being the eccentric ray of light in the lives of those dear to her, is no longer the reality of her. What follows are psychosomatic symtoms, loneliness and she losing herself. Who exactly am I? \\n\\n\r\nTo talk about Hina, is to talk about 7 other characters, Rei, Akari, grandpa, the friend, the bully, the female teacher and the male teacher. For the sake of chronology, I will present them in the order where they occured. Hina knows that helping Rei in the past only brought good things for both of them. When she tried to help her friend who is being bullied, she is being honest to the character who she is at home. Stopping the bullying is not an easy thing as turns out, Hina's friend quits school, moves away and becomes a shut-in. This makes Hina the target of bullying instead. The first one to know this is the female teacher who was unable to stop the bullying of the first girl too. Instead of helping the victim, she decides to go into victim blaming where Hina gets scolded quite literally for defending her own friend. This shows Hina the same unreliability she got from her father. The teacher actions are later explained by her knowing that the bullying is real, but she being scared and tired of seeing the never ending bullying happen year after year with different students. This is concluded with one of the most powerful scenes in the series where the teacher goes through a mental breakdwon in front of the whole class. Showing that even the side side charactes in this series are mere humans.\\n\\n\r\nIn between the teachers first and last reaction is Rei.\"Hina saved me.\" Is a sentence Rei says in total of 3 times in the series. Now it is his turn to help. The great thing about this is Hina's knowledge. She is aware that just by not doing much, she was able to help Rei. Getting help from him in the shogi city is one of the seven major impacts a third party casted on her during her hardships that lead her towards the resolve. It as well impacfed her final views on the lover where she was able to let go off him for knowing that people like Rei would not leave her. The next major part is Akari who is supposed to help Hina overcome the bullying by gowing to the school and solve the matter with the bully and her parents. This comes down to a debate where neither of them can prove anything. This is imporant part of both Akari's and Hina's character. For one, Akari comes to lose confidence in her being the \"mother\" to her little sister, and make her realize how much she relies on the grandpa. For another matter, this shows how much Akari means to Hina, she is almost accepting the loss just to make her sister worry less. During this meeting, the male teacher is now shown his value. This goes back into bringing Hina's trust into adults back as well offering another major step towards her gaining back her true character as well as the first step towards stopping the bulluying. The bully on the other hand comes off as what Rei could have become if he didn't have shogi in his life. Basically, the bully is another Kyouko in the making. It's important to note that Rei isn't aware of this. The only ones who get to realize this about her character are the viewers.  \\n\\n\r\nThe last part of Hina's impact are grandpa and the friend's resolution. \"You did well, Hina.\" Upon hearing that Hina has tried to help her friend, the grandpa casts these carefully picked words on her. Without these, perhaps she would have never be the same. The grandpa is the last abutment when all else fails. I won't go into details with grandpa's own character, but basically he knows his role better than anyone. Hina comes to realize this very well when the hardships resolve. This is yet followed by showing Hina that her friend is also working hard to get over her bullying. Perhaps Hina would have become exactly like her friend if she didn't have this network of people helping her to overcome the latest challenge in her life. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these are extremely important factors when trying to understand Hina. Simply because she is the opposite of Rei. She is interacting with and influenced by those around her there were Rei chose the other route at her age. And thus concludes this analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Please note that my reasons for thinking very highly about 3-Gatsu no Lion are not limited to these factors presented. I have merely touched the surface of this series by commenting on the complexity of its characters without much else. Not casting comments on the story. Or the overall execution which is equally great*\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have finished watching the second season of 3 Gatsu no Lion and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned!\r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name the second season of 3 Gatsu No Lion continues on with the work its previous season started on showing the life of its main character and his struggle to change himself as he continues to advance his career in shogi while also learning how to forge bonds with others and make connections as he navigates thepath that is called life.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for 3 Gatsu no Lion\u2019s second season continues the journey of 17-year Rei Kiriyama a high school student and pro shogi player as he starts a new school year and encounters new friends, new opponents and new challenges in both his professional career and in his personal life that he must overcome if he wants to continue breaking out of his shell to become a better person. Joining him along this journey is a number of both familiar and new characters that both directly change Rei\u2019s character or characters that are dear to him that causes Rei to change in an effort to help them. These include the kind-hearted Akari, the responsible and determined Hinata and the quiet but intense Souya. \\n\\n\r\nRei \\n\\n\r\nRei Kiriyama voiced by veteran voice actor Kengo Kawanishi of Naruto Shippuden and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 17-year-old high school student and a pro shogi player Rei from initial appearances is a quiet, calm and composed teenager that seems to be slowly getting used to dealing with people that he meets in society. As the new school year for Rei starts it can be seen that the Rei that we see in this season is very different to the Rei that we met back in the first season as a result of the many changes that we saw him experience then. Back in the first season, Rei was someone that was shown to be a quiet person that got nervous easily and had trouble in not just fitting in but also in making friends with people outside of his circle often putting up walls to protect himself against strangers. He was also noted to be someone that hid the majority of his personality and feelings inside him. In this season it can be seen that Rei is much more confident and calmer and is able to interact with people that had formally been outside of his circle of friends. While still nervous to a degree it can be seen that the Rei that we see in this season is now much more positive and cheerful and is able to enjoy himself more at school and in clubs and in doing so able to make many new friends. With this new-found confidence, Rei is shown to be also capable of explaining things to others slowly and breaking down more complex subjects like shogi and maths into ways that are understandable for those that don\u2019t know the subject a change that I thought was welcome for his character. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Rei encounters challenge after challenge it can be seen that Rei\u2019s personality starts to gradually change as a result of not just the challenges that he faced but also of the understanding that he had gained when interacting with others. While noted to be a quiet person in the beginning Rei was also someone noted to not show his true feelings about things seemingly preferring to instead hide it within himself. As a result of this Rei was someone that only showed limited emotions towards others as if he was scared that by showing more he might invite scorn from others. He was also noted to be someone that distanced himself from interactions with others. However, this feeling of his gradually disappears as the series goes on and Rei gradually begins to show more emotions and learns to be more considerate of others especially to the Kawamoto family and his fellow shogi players willing to help them when they need it. This is best shown during the summer festival when Rei decided to help them with their shop stand something that the old Rei would not have done. The character of Rei I felt was an interesting character that as a result of not just this season but also the previous season had a lot of good development that had the effect of improving his character\u2019s personality substantially which I felt made great use of the theme of changing yourself as you learn to experience life and bond with others. Seeing Rei gradually turn from a quiet and withdrawn person who had few friends to someone that was not just positive but also more assertive and willing to help his friends and allies I thought was one of the best things in this series. I thought that his voice actor Kengo Kawanishi did an excellent job at portraying the character of Rei. \\n\\n\r\nAkari \\n\\n\r\nAkari Kawamoto voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Anohana and Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the eldest of the Kawamoto sisters. A young woman in her early twenties Akari is a kind, caring and positive young woman that\u2019s also considerate and understanding towards others.  On the surface, Akari is a responsible and determined person that does all she can to support her family and in this can easily be mistaken to be a mother were one not to know that she has two younger sisters. While kind and caring Akari is also someone that is also perceptive and is easily able to tell if something is bothering someone but rather than confront them about it is someone that prefers to let the person take their time and tell her themselves when they are ready to do so showing how considerate Akari can be. While level headed and not one that will let her emotions get the best of her, for the most part, it is shown that Akari is someone that has quite the vivid imagination and able to come up with various ideas and scenarios that are not just off topic but also amusingly funny.  While calm and composed for the most part Akari can be surprisingly forceful if someone that she cares about doesn\u2019t listen to her advice a side of her that\u2019s pretty surprising.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on it can be seen that beneath her positive and caring surface personality Akari is also someone that has many struggles that she hides behind her surface facade. While its obvious that Akari cares deeply about her sisters, family and Rei it can be seen that Akari is someone that regrets deeply that there is a limit to what she can do to help them. While outwardly a very dependable and mentally strong person it can be seen that beneath this Akari is someone that also has a fragile side to her personality as well which comes from the heavy responsibility that was given to her after the passing of her mother. This fragile side to her of her that comes from her heavy responsibility can be seen to cause a great deal of worry for Akari when she has time to realise it. In line with this worry is one of Akari\u2019s greatest fear which is the fact that despite being the elder sister of the family she might not be able to represent her sisters well when they need her the most something that can be seen to scare her a great deal. This side of her personality I felt was an interesting one as it contrasted a great deal with the kind, calm and confident Akari that I have become accustomed to seeing. However, as the series goes on and Akari got to see the pain that Hinata went through as a result of the troubles that beset her the hesitation that bounded Akari were gradually released and Akari become braver and more determined to protect Hina as not just her sister but her guardian as well and in doing so confront the true culprit that caused her sisters pain. The character of Akari while an effective character back in the first season I thought become a much more effective character this season as a result of the revelation that even someone as perfect as her who seemed at first to have boundless confidence can also be hiding many issues and fears that show that she too is but a human being. The insight into Akari\u2019s backstory and the heavy responsibility that she had inherited from her mother I felt only served to enhance her character and was further reinforced by the fears and challenges that she had to overcome this season in order to protect those that are dear to her. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Akari. \\n\\n\r\nHinata \\n\\n\r\nHinata Kawamoto voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Psycho-Pass and the irregular at magic high school fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the second oldest of the Kawamoto sisters. A 15-year-old junior high school student Hinata is a positive, happy and energetic girl that while somewhat shy is also a brave and determined person by nature. While a happy and go lucky person by nature Hinata is also someone that is kind and understanding and shown to be both perceptive and understanding of the feelings of others. While a positive and happy person by nature Hinata is someone that can be seen to have a stubborn side to her as well and is someone that is noted to be determined to finish things that she already started no matter how hard that task proves to be something that is best shown in her arc when she tries to defend her friend. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and we get to see more of Hina\u2019s personality it can be seen that beneath her positive and happy attitude that she displays to others Hinata is someone that is emotionally fragile and as a result often hides her true feelings behind a wall that she even hides from her own family out of consideration from them. This facet of her personality is best seen in her specific arc in this season which detailed the struggle that Hinata experienced when in school. While emotionally fragile in the beginning a fact that was exploited by the bullies as a result of the interventions of not just Rei but also Akari and the head teacher of Hinata\u2019s school Hinata was as a result gradually able to overcome the many challenges and regrets that had tied her down and gradually gained both the confidence and determination that she needed to strike back at the bullies and oppose them by persisting in going to school an act that I felt was admirable of her. While managing to end this sad affair on a high note it can be seen that despite this Hinata also feels an immense sense of regret at her failure to protect her friend from them something that was only solved when they were able to meet again months later where she was able to make amends. While somewhat alleviating her sense of regret towards her this chance of being able to make amends also awakened within Hina a determination to help her friend regain her place within society and vowing to never again let fear stop her from helping a friend in need. The character of Hinata I thought was an interesting one that showed that while positive and happy on the outside the emotional pain that one has may not always be visible to others. Hinata\u2019s struggle against the bullies in her arc I thought was well done as it not only reflected the many struggles that students face in school but also that no matter how positive and determined you are emotional pain can still affect you to a degree. Hinata\u2019s gradual overcoming of her pain by opening up herself to her family and friends I thought was well done and matched well with the theme of friendship and family that this series symbolised. I thought that her seiyuu Kana Hanazawa did an excellent job of portraying the character of Hinata.  \\n\\n\r\nTouji Souya \\n\\n\r\nTouji Souya voiced by veteran voice actor Akira Ishida of Gundam Seed and Naruto Shippuden fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Rei\u2019s fellow shogi players being the current Meijin an important titleholder within the world of shogi. Though introduced back in season one the character of Touji Souya wasn\u2019t given much expansion as a character until this season. A young man in his early twenties Souya is a quiet, calm and composed person by nature that on initial appearance actually reminds me of a snow-capped mountain something that was both serene and impenetrable something that I felt matched his personality perfectly. While a very strong player on account of him being the current Mejjin which alongside the title of Ryuo is considered one of the most prestigious titles in shogi Souya was noted to be someone that was somewhat lonely. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Souya\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that Souya is exactly that. His skill with shogi as it is considered to be extremely powerful to the point that there are few opponents that he cannot beat in the game. While no doubt a good thing for those that don\u2019t wish for challengers to their titles it\u2019s noted that this is not something that Souya likes as this makes his career somewhat boring. As a result of this, it can be seen that Souya actually longs to face someone that\u2019s equal to him both in skill and in temperament that can act as his rival and allow him to both enjoy the game and improve his own skill. As a result of their similar personalities, circumstances, and playstyles it can be noted that Souya is very similar to Rei enough in that Souya actually see\u2019s Rei as his rival which in turn is acknowledged by Rei as well.  While a powerful player in Shogi what made Souya actually stand out to me was the fact that in a way Souya actually resembles the past version of Rei that we saw back in the first season when he had few friends and connections and had trouble expressing himself to others. The character of Souya while not a villain per se was an interesting character that showed to Rei and to us viewers that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best skills at shogi because without friends and allies that you have bonded with playing shogi just wouldn\u2019t be fun. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for 3 gatsu no lion has always been one of its many strong points due to both how clear and funky they are something that is once more seen in this season. This season notably featured a greater number of settings and scenery in the form of covering not just the actions that are happening in the present shogi matches but also whats happening within the mental realm of the players as they consider the motivations and foundations that serve as their strength. Unlike the previous season\u2019s arcs, this season\u2019s arcs focus was more on feelings and emotions that are felt by different characters and in this, I thought that the series did well in portraying this via the use of darker colours and gloomier animation to reflect this as shown in Hinata\u2019s arc. The music for the series I felt was strong with the opening and ending themes doing an especially great job in both welcoming you and in bidding you farewell from Rei\u2019s world. The series OST I thought did a great job of providing support to the series many emotional scenes with music that was appropriate for the feelings that the scene was supposed to invoke. In terms of voice acting, I thought that as a whole the voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In particular, I feel that Ai Kayano, Kana Hanazawa and Kengo Kawanishi deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Akari, Hinata and Rei respectively. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3 Gatsu no lion\u2019s second season was an anime that I really enjoyed and built upon the foundations that its first season worked so hard to create. The series strong points in my eyes was its premise, excellent story, strong character development, voice acting and its blending of multiple themes into one that we can all relate too. While the first season of the series focused on Rei breaking out of the shell that was created from his reluctance to make friends and connections with others this season allows us to see the fruits of his labour by giving us the opportunity to see the many changes that have been wrought on to Rei. Within the series this is best shown in Rei slowly becoming aware of the feelings and emotions that people around him experience which had the effect of making him more aware of the bonds that can be forged between people whether these people are friends, acquaintances or opponents in shogi bonds that can be positive ones like that of friendship, comradeship or hostile ones like rivalry.  This look into the emotions and feelings that others feel in the series is not restricted to Rei though as in this season the support characters of Akari and Hinata also get larger roles as part of the main plot that I thought allowed us to see one of the many dangers that school life can bring to the students as well as to the teachers, parents, and guardians of these children. This insight into a common problem of society and its linking into the developments of both Rei and the members of the Kawamoto family I thought was well done as it gave each a valuable experience that will be useful to them. In line with Rei becoming more familiar with these strong feelings and emotions is his development of what could be said to be his first main goal which is his determination to rise even higher in the world of shogi and use what he had learned from his newfound bonds to overcome the weakness and hesitation that had so long constrained his life and caused him to have a slump both in life and in shogi. Seeing him resolve to develop such a goal I thought was a good indication of the development that Rei has been through these past seasons and showed that as a result of the bonds that Rei has made with not just his fellow shogi players but also the Kawamoto family that he has finally found his true self in both life and in shogi. While Rei\u2019s journey to find a place where he can belong to that has people that appreciate the skills that he has continues I feel that the steps that Rei took as he matured as a human being were good ones that only served to make Rei\u2019s goal that much closer.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile Rei and the members of the Kawamoto family were the main characters in this series another aspect of this show that I liked about it was that it also allowed us to look at the struggles that Rei\u2019s fellow shogi players whether they are opponents, friends or acquaintances face as they play shogi. This insight I felt was interesting as these problems are not merely problems that they face during the shogi matches but also personal problems that were unique to the characters themselves as they can include a great variety of themes that serve as their motivations for wanting to play shogi. These include a desire to honour past friends, fulfil promises to thank their fans, wanting to win to prove your strength to your detractors and playing because shogi is your everything. This variety of motivations I thought did a great job of enhancing the large support cast that the series made use off.  Overall 3 gatsu no lion\u2019s second season was a great season that built on the strong foundations that the first season introduced while also continuing to expand and improve Rei\u2019s personality by allowing him to not just meet new people and situations but also allow him to learn about the various feelings and emotions that they may be battling with feelings that Rei himself lacks having never encountered them before. But more than anything seeing Rei gradually break out of his shell as a result of the strong bonds that he forges and seeing him be more assertive in helping others is without a doubt one of the core elements of this anime and one that I enjoyed seeing. Overall as a final score I believe a 10/10 would be one that it rightfully deserves as it brought to mind just how precious bonds between people are and how these bonds can help you overcome any challenge you face in life if you let it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS !!\r\nWhat an amazing experience was watching this 2 season, it improved every aspect of Season 1, plus it was much more shocking than the parts of first season.\r\n(Story = 10/10)\r\nEach part of the story of the characters was much more interesting than the first season and more developed, one of the best was the part of Hinata, knew how to explore the concept of bullyng in a sensational way that had never seen. The part of the championship of the beginners was incredible also, they took many consequences of the 1 season in that part, the Nikaidou was stillfurther exploited on his determination in the shogi by the disease, besides a new character that appeared in the tournament and was very well developed. One of the last parts for me was what surprised me even more. Starting with the Souya part that further humanized the character, in addition to showing a new perspective that shogi is cool, and showed the protagonist that he has a long journey to go through training and experience. Now the part that impressed me most, that was Yanagihara, it was incredible the way they put as is the true weight of carrying the burden of being the most experienced player of Shogi and the most recognized, and even more about a true defeat of a title.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters =  9,5/10)\\n\r\nAs always very well developed, and the new characters very well written, each character taking their moral lesson from the previous season. The conflicts of the new and old characters were much more shocking, thus causing the viewer to worry about them, be it in a shogi duel by title, or by family and school problems, I felt that they really got more alive around the time, besides Kiriyama that showed a great development of experience with the matches of Shogi, besides of handling with the characters around him.\\n\\n\r\n(Art, Animation =   10/10)\\n\r\nThe art of season 1 was already amazing, and season 2 improved even more. They have always represented warm colors like the Kawamoto's house, bringing that good feeling of comfort and happiness, but when the feeling is sad and angry, the colors are cooler, using gray and black very well as in school, or a match of shogi in which the sense of defeat is something inevitable. About the animation is very good and consistent but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Sound = 10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has remained very good in moments of comedy and other moments of peace and harmony as in the house of the Kawamoto when they are eating. But ost improved greatly in Shogi matches, with very well-done guitar and violin sounds that made the characters' dialogues more impactful in the scenes. And the sounds of pianos were more beautiful impacting the sad scenes more.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment = 8000/10)\\n\r\nOne of the problems of Season 1 is that it was not so shocking in certain parts of the conflict, and I found it a bit dull in some episodes. But in season 2 did not have these problems and improved all aspects like characters, history, art, animation and sound. When I finished the work, I cried a lot because I had just finished a great journey of adventure with these wonderful characters and their conflicts in which they made me reflect as never before, I feel as if I was in the situation with them.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall = 10/10)\\n\r\n3-gatsu in the lion 2nd season renewed my soul, I feel more confident to go on with my life, were many messages that I will take for the rest of my life as an example.",

            "content": "I'll be reviewing this in 2 languages. The first section will be in English and will focus on the 2nd season. The 2nd section will have a brief explanation in Bengali about why you should watch the show generalizing both seasons.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"How is she doing it? Does she write down her daily activities in a diary and take ideas from different moments in her life to use them in her characters? Is she taking notes from perhaps her favourite works of literature and combining everything she learned into one work? Did she read books on sociology before writing chapters?\" All these thoughts constantly popped up intomy head while I was watching Sangatsu no lion season 2. Because for a work to portray emotions of this much variety and to convey it in some of the easiest and most natural ways possible is truly something amazing. The writer understands what it's like to be a human. In some instances, some of the portrayals might be a little too over the top but I'll come back to that later. What is important is that Sangatsu no lion matters. It can impact people in a positive way. It can remind you of how you used to think in the past, it can deliver comments on how your current way of thinking is wrong and it can be a guideline for what you should do in the future. By all means, Sangatsu no lion, in my opinion, is one of the greatest animes ever made and something that'll stay in the top of my 'favourites list' for now. Since Sangatsu is a show about thought progression and human interaction, I can't talk about this show properly without talking about myself. So I hope you will pardon me for making this a little too much about myself if it is that way by the end of the review. \\n\\n\r\nChanges from Season 1:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching Sangatsu no lion season 1, I was quite mesmerized. Sangatsu no lion created one of the most awkward and relatable main characters ever in Rei Kiriyama. Through Rei's journey, we remembered what it was like to grow up to be what we are now and for a lot of people it may have been a guide to what they should do next.By no means is 3 gatsu no lion something most people would love to watch. By the time season 1 ended, there were people who loved the show and there were people who didn't like it at all. A lot of people didn't appreciate the transitions the show made from being depressing to being weirdly cheerful from time to time. Although some of that did bother me, the show overwhelmed me with its good sides. After finishing season 1 Rei's development hit a point where he couldn't be the same person he was in season 1. The theme's of depression sorrounding him and his search for an ideal idea inside his heart couldn't be dragged forward too much. This is why I was also worried that season 2 might not be as good as season 1. I was worried that if Sangatsu no lion lost its heartwarming depression (you realizing your themes of depression are understood by another person is often heartwarming) it would be just another show with nothing special going for it. The season takes a few episodes to get going. But ultimately season 2 proves me wrong and goes to a level that far exceeds my expectations. While Rei's development reached a solid point, this season gives time to most of the other characters who required development. Characters like Nikaidou, Hina and Akari get a lot more development as the author explores each of their individual problems/insecurities. While depression and the feeling of relatable content remained, the show added another dimension to its progress. To explain this I need to go back to a quote from another show. I remember my favourite quote in the Psycho-pass series came from the far inferior season 2. Coming from Nobuchika Ginoza it was something like,\\n\r\n\"The shortcut to growing up fast is accepting things the way they are.\" At that point, the line hit me like a truck. It didn't tell me anything new. But it suddenly expressed something I wanted to word for a long time. I finally understood why some of the adults can't understand when I'm trying to tell them about the various concepts I imagine. They grew up and hence forgot what it's like to dream a false hope of being in a different reality. That didn't mean I was okay with that sort of thinking. I do believe people should keep searching things inside of themselves without easily accepting what everyone else finds normal. In a way Sangatsu no lion season 1 was a reflection of my beliefs. Rei knew what the normal things to do and feel would be. Yet he kept searching for a solution that will finally give him the peace he is looking for. He never forced himself to adapt to things just because that's the normal thing to do. He craved for an imaginary sensation he didn't feel before. In a way, he was yet to understand how everything worked and how everyone felt. So he made mistakes along the way to learn things in what I believe to be 'the proper way'. After his development hits a certain point at the end of season 1 and he can accept himself for who he is, the show evolves alongside Rei. Most of the conflicts Rei had in season 1 was mostly the fruit of his own nature of overthinking things. It was a kind of psychological stress that came naturally with the circumstances he had to face while growing up. This applies to Kyoko's problems as well who just grew up to be strange because she didn't accept the direction her life took. This time around the problems revolve around the more apparent ones we have in our society. By the end of season 1, the show already had us accepting things to be the way they are by highlighting all the bright sides that might make living worth it. This time it added another dimension by exploring common social problems and criticizing common social beliefs. It also presented a story of fighting sickness that almost brought me to tears. In a way Sangatsu no lion season 2 advances on the social side of things and goes on to become more than just a story. It finds itself being much more of an inspirational show this time. \\n\r\nAs I pointed out before Rei understands his worth a lot more this season. His transition also adds to the show. Rei's narration is beautifully done. He is slowly developing into a protagonist who would be ideal in anyone's eyes. He still has a long way to go but that's just more reason why the show is beautiful. No matter how much progress you go through it never really is enough. There's always room for more improvement. Through Rei's own self critical self we are reminded of just that. Finding reasons to love doing what you do is important. This is something that gets a lot more light in this season. If you search strongly, you might find yours too. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf you think I gave away every theme there is about this show, you are largely mistaken. Sangatsu has at least one unique theme every episode. So the more you search for, the more you get out of this show. As for the main story, I will personally divide the story this season into 4 sections. One will deal with Hina's personal life problems that will last for almost the entirety of the season. One will deal with Nikaidou's sickness that was revealed during season 1. The duration of this might be small but the impact is probably the strongest out of everything the season delivers. The 3rd section is everything shogi related. The 4th section is about adapting with change. Something we get to see at the final few episodes of the season. Sangatsu is more about experiencing the story rather than simply watching or reading it. So without giving away too many spoilers, I will let you experience everything for yourself. \\n\r\nThe shogi in season 2 is as good as season 1 if not better. I'll say it again that the main appeal of Sangatsu no lion is understanding people and understanding yourself. The shogi plays a major role in doing so as well. Unlike most sports/game related shows Sangatsu gives a lot of focus to all the players playing shogi this season. Details of how they had to grow up. their habits, their thought process, their worries-all of these is presented beautifully which helps you understand and be one with the characters by finding similarities with yourself. \\n\r\nRandom quote from episode 2 to explain what I mean,\\n\r\n\u201cEveryone who\u2019s gotten their butts kicked in a title match will always lose their composure for a bit. That\u2019s just how it is. \u2018At this rate, I\u2019ll just lose.\u2019 That is what they realize in between matches of a series. They have to break themselves apart and reconstruct it again from the shattered pieces. They start over from square one.\u201d\\n\r\n This is a perfect example of the show exploring in-game psychology and being able to connect it with other everyday emotions, Portraying the difficulties of what it means to be a professional and what it takes to stay in the game throughout your life.  It's not only the shogi that's getting the focus, but also the human beings playing it.\\n\r\nLike most people, the only thing I didn't like in season 1 was the attempted comedy. I understood why they did it but it wasn't always easy to watch. The comedy in season 2 was a massive improvement. Whenever they made certain scenes a little too melodramatic and cringy they followed it up with heartwarming comedy. Some of these moments might not make you laugh but they do a great job changing the tempo and resetting things to the way we like it. For me, the only way to do comedy right is to keep the lines hidden and make it unpredictable. Sangatsu uses its awkwardness as a tool for comedy this season which makes it much funnier than it's previous season. There's also gimmick comedy that worked well in the form of Noguchi. What also helps is every episode has a perfect balance of comedy and darkness this time. So the series maintains its consistency throughout. This is why I was able to accept the comedy a lot more this time around. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nI think I praised what the source material offers quite a lot. The art is just as good as everything else. Characters are drawn beautifully and all of them are well detailed. The environment is used for storytelling and the scenes just take you to another place. But enough of that. Chika Umino did everything well. But portraying a concept such as Sangatsu's in animated form is not an easy thing to do. It can't be like just another show. It has to make the audience experience things the characters are experiencing. The anime wouldn't as good as it is if Studio Shaft didn't do such a remarkable job. The Visual imagery of Sangatsu no lion is just outstanding. The one word to describe it would be 'surreal'. It's like breaking down the real world and creating something that can be molded and painted into whatever you want. Every emotion is highlighted in their own unique ways. During important monologues, the screen shows the face of the character listening/talking/thinking in different angles portraying the shift of emotions as the monologue goes on.  That really draws you into whatever they are saying. Shaft also did a great job making a chapter by chapter adaption which is probably the only right way to adapt this show.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I'm a guy who is musically open to very few genres. But no matter what Sangatsu no lion does, I seem to like it. It was musical works such as 'Answer' and 'En fermant les yeux' that made me want to watch the show in the first place. I liked all 4 of the openings and endings this season. There's not much to say about the soundtrack. The soundtrack just fits so well with the overall atmosphere. If either one of these attributes were to go wrong it wouldn't be possible to achieve the connection Sangatsu no lion achieves with its audience. The show can make me draw emotions using its music. It can make me feel things with its music and at the end of the day this what music is supposed to do. It is supposed to soothe.It is supposed to connect with the listeners. Full marks to the production team. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nWith season 1 mostly focusing on Rei and Shimada, this season does justice to Akari, Hinata, Nikaidou, Mr. Yanagihara and many more characters. We also learn a little bit more about mysterious meijin Souya who influences Rei a lot this season.\\n\r\nAkari: After the death of her mother and grandmother, Akari had to play the role of a mother figure for Hina and Momo. Her insecurities and worries are portrayed quite well in this season making people empathize with her. She has room for development and judging by what I was given thus far, she will develop into a much stronger character if we get another season.\\n\r\nNikaidou: You understand everything Nikaidou stands for as the season progresses. He didn't get a whole lot of time dedicated to him. But they made the most out of what was.\\n\r\nMr. Yanagihara: Sangatsu produces another lovable character. The episodes dedicated to this old man are simply amazing. It wasn't just old man thought too. Most of us probably think what he thinks already. But this is where we truly understand his pain as he had to carry those thoughts of burden for a long amount of time and still find a reason to be happy everytime.\\n\r\nHinata: Before I talk about Hinata's development this season, I want to talk about something Sangatsu no lion made me realize in its previous season. In those episodes where Rei reveals his lonely school life and how people avoided him and vice versa, I really felt bad about myself. It was the feeling of regret. I also knew children like that who were avoided in class during my primary and middle school days. I somewhat knew I should talk to them but I didn't care quite enough. I was also afraid to be judged by others and thus decided to be a nothing for them just like everyone else. I regret not helping them during those times after watching Sanatsu. Sangatsu never directly told me how wrong I was back then. But Ms. Umino immediately picks up on it and has an arc dedicated to school problems. A that story not only shows us an example of how to fix things but it is also an example of how things can go wrong. Throughout this arc we see the development of Hina as she becomes a fine main female lead for the show. She takes on the role Rei played during last season and keeps everything we loved about season 1 alive at the same time. Rei's own development centers a lot around Hina. Her character keeps growing as you keep on watching the season. \\n\r\nRei: Rei is as lovable as always and it's nice to see him finally enjoy his life. The role he plays is quite different this season. But the guy cannot stop being relatable as always. Rei's voice actor does a phenomenal job once again as Rei's narration inside his head is one of the best things about this show. Rei grows some more this season and gets closer to becoming the person he wants to be in the story and we want to be in real life. \\n\r\nMomo: Momo is the greatest gift anime has given to mankind. \\n\r\nOverall, the characters were really great once again this season. They are what makes Sangatsu no lion so unique in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no lion has this strong descriptive style of writing. It's like even though now you should be able to solve {(12+4)*64-24}/10 in a matter of 10-15 seconds max, it wasn't always the same for you. You probably had to do each operation one at a time when you were a lot younger. Thoughts are a sum of smaller pieces of thoughts. We forget with time that these smaller thoughts will eventually lead to many more larger thoughts. Thus we often bury these insignificant thoughts thinking they won't matter. Sangatsu breaks down those thoughts to a much smaller level with its descriptive monologues. You may think most of it is unnecessary but if you think about it, you realize how significant they are when it comes to the characters feeling what they feel.It tells multiple stories that cohesively deliver strong themes. This is not something you write just to entertain the crowd. You can only write something like that when you are writing down a piece of you. So how enjoyable is Sangatsu no lion season 2? \"If we go by our usual answer of enjoyable = entertaining that it probably isn't the most enjoyable show. If we look beyond that, it is a very enjoyable show as you experience how thoughts can be conveyed and learn a few things about writing yourself alongside some very heartwarming in-story content.\" I said something like that during last season but this season actually had a fair amount of entertaining content. So it is very enjoyable both ways.\\n\\n\r\nFavourite Quote:\\n\r\n\u201cGaining and losing things are an unavoidable part of life for everybody. You feel joy, you feel disappointment and it repeats. And that\u2019s how you learn how to handle your feelings. Disappointment and loneliness are necessary emotions. Because of loneliness people muster courage and reach out to a new world. Doing that is like reaching out as a baby does, and expands it\u2019s small world.\u201d\\n\r\n-Eisaku Noguchi \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Sangatsu was written in 2007 and this is why a lot of the approaches are old. For example, I know people will complain about things like \"Why isn't that girl just talking to her friend over the phone.\" I have read complains like this already. But when you consider the time it was written I'm sure most of these things will make sense. There's not much more I can say about it. It might make you smile, it might make you cry and it will give you cooking lessons. I like everything about the show and I can make everything they did seem like a likable thing because this is exactly how it was to me. Hopefully, this will be exactly the same for a lot more people yet to watch this show. I'd be pretty proud of myself If I could apply everything I've learned/got reminded of by watching Sangatsu in real life. Therefore, I would strongly recommend everyone to give this show a shot and to see if you can get something out of it.  Thank you Chika Umino and Shaft for giving us a 'slice of life' in quite a literal form.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n3 Gatsu no

            "content": "Originally I was going to give this series a 9/10, but after glancing at MAL's classification of a 10 being \"Outstanding\", that is what perfectly fits my opinion on this show. I have never seen such a beautiful and deep story as unique as 3-gatsu no Lion.\r\n1: Story Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\r\nThe story of Rei Kiriyama's journey and past are presented with extreme care. And with Hina's arc in this season, it beautifully captivates the audience with an excellent flow of story progression and quality. No complaints here.\r\n2: Art Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\r\nOh man, how can I describe the art? It's jaw-dropping. It flows perfectlywith the various feelings our characters go through (anxiety, fear, joy, etc.) and handles it extremely well.\\n\\n\r\n3: Sound Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe OP/ED's are catchy, the various piano OST's used in the emotional scenes fit perfectly, as well as the other ones used during comedic scenes. I loved every bit of music down to even the accurate nature sound effects!\\n\\n\r\n4: Character Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nWith such a huge cast of characters, each of them feel unique and entertaining in their own way. The way they are portrayed demonstrates a high level of execution behalf on the writers part. I feel the writers really understood how to handle accurate thoughts of individuals feelings (fear, anxiety) which is rare of this quality.\\n\\n\r\n5: Enjoyment Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nEvery time I took the time to sit down and watch an episode of 3-gatsu no Lion, a smile was put on my face. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and everything it had to offer.\\n\\n\r\n|-_-_-_-> Final Score: 10/10 (OUTSTANDING) <-_-_-_-|\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series you MUST watch. I can guarantee you will enjoy it if you open yourself up and just give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nExtra Thoughts:\\n\r\n-> Is this the end of the show entirely? I hope not. Judging by the ending and how popular this show was, I can definitely see a third season on its way. I just wanna see both Hina and Rei going to school together ;-;\\n\\n\r\n-> There are so many lovable characters but one I adore a lot is the three sisters and Someji. I love how they support each other no matter what!\\n\\n\r\n-> I wish he had more Souya moments with Rei. We had those couple of episodes with them spending a bit of time together but I wish Souya had just a tad bit more screen time. Even if he's just a supporting character, he plays a big role as the current meijin!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! :D \\>.</",

            "content": "Wellcom to my blog \r\nhttps://topanimecharacters.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-20-most-intellectual-anime.html\r\nStory:10/10, for a slice-of-life show, this actually has a story, and surprisingly that story advances. in this season, we see more focus on the side characters and the misery of other characters that aren't rei, there is lots of drama, lots of emotions and bonds developing and most importantly, our main character isn't so gloomy anymore, characters developed and changed, and the story is slowly moving.\r\nCharacters:10/10,as if the characters from the first season weren't good enough, this season is even better. in the first season the focus was on Rei,Shimada and his circle of characters, but in this season we seeLots of developement for the side characters as i already mentioned, like Hina and her family, the teacher and by the end of their arc, i'm sure we'll be right back to shimada and the story. though in my opinion, this arc that focuses on the three sisters is the best arc in the series ( the first arc in season one was also fantastic. ) it has lots of emotions,lots of \"reality\" put into it which is why i loved it alot. i'll keep the \"Long\" review for when the show is finished but for now this is all i have to say about characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10, it's Shaft. amazing scenery, great camera angles, beautiful character designs and simply perfect art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10, YUKI sings the opening again and her voice is fantastic as always, it's a very memorable and great song, the ending is by a band that never sung in 3-gatsu no lion before that being Brian the sun, but i'm simply glad this band sung the ending, it's the best song out of the entire series in my opinion, or rather, it's in a draw with every other song as they're all just perfect. the background music is still fantastic, the voice actors have lots of emotions into their voices and are very competent, especially Kana hanazawa as Hina.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10, this show only gets better and better, the rating may change when i finish the show.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Sangatsu no Lion 2  Mini Review/Thoughts now that Ive finished it\r\nOne of the most real anime Ive seen. The themes of each arc in the anime,especially the second season is brilliant and sometimes too real. The characters are lovable, the production style is artistic and the voice acting is damn good.  The heartwarming parts of the anime are really heartwarming. Some of its episodes are really inspiring,especially the last episode. Sangatsu is not an anime about shogi, its an anime that has a MC whose job is a pro shogi player. Its not a sports anime but a realistic drama anime and areally good one. The three sisters together are some of the most hearwarming and lovable characters.\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall Rating :  9.3/10.0",

            "content": "A strong display of emotional resonance; the second season of 3-gatsu no Lion manages to go above and beyond expectations to provide something of overwhelming beauty.\r\nIt\u2019s a show of many acts; the first season\u2014while boasting many heavy themes\u2014is an elegant watch, which reels the viewer in with a soft mood, realistic characters and delightful interactions, but never hits you with strong emotions. The second season\u2014filled with melancholic tones, depressing themes and powerful messages\u2014gives the show raw emotional power to invest the viewer at full force.\r\nShifting from the focus of Rei\u2019s depression, this season brings more focus to the different mentalities of the supporting cast, bothin the real world and the back-drop of shogi. \\n\\n\r\nThe season starts off with a focus on Hinata, and the daunting problem of bullying. Bringing forth an insight into the mass hysteria it brings and the draining effects on the victims, and those caught up in the drama. This arc is nothing short of impactful, and although it\u2019s heavy, it never becomes painful to watch, something many other drama-oriented series fail to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this so powerful is down to the commonly relatable topic of bullying, the powerful visual presentation and the amazing characterisation found in the antagonist Megumi Takagi.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi\u2019s construct as a bully sets her apart from other archetypical antagonists\u2014in the sense that, there are reasons to her actions\u2014she clearly suffers problems in her mentality, leading her to torment others as a form of escapism, giving her somewhat an ability to be emphasised with for the wrong reason.  It\u2019s even easier to empathise with Hina, due to her characteristics, with her helping Rei with his struggles and inspiring him to escape his depression. Rei feels the same on the topic of helping her, creating a close bond between the two, something that plays importance throughout the rest of this season.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the first arc is definitely in the lime-light of this season, the series continues to impress in its focuses on different characters. The character study of Souya Touji is a breath-taking display of a mind disturbed solely by the life-style of shogi, with stunning direction to show his inability to hear those around him. The shogi match between Shimada and Yanagiharai uses profound visual imagery to show the determination of both characters and the weight Yanagihara carries. And the pleasant moments with Hina give the show a relaxing and charming escapism from the heavier themes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t consider the cast to be merely characters, they feel human. From Rei to Nikaidou to Yanagihara; each one has strong human characteristics that allow for relatability and empathy for these personalities as we see into their differing lives. \\n\r\nEven though Rei has less focus this season, his role as the lead character is as strong as ever as he seeks a way to help those around him. It\u2019s inspiring to watch, as Rei\u2019s empathy drives him to assist in fighting the varying problems that arise for everyone close to him. His outlook and narration provide a strong connection from the viewer as he continues to improve his life which was once locked in place by his haunting past. As the main character, his journey is an impeccable experience and he is character of relatability and complexity.\\n\\n\r\nThis season exposes elements of characters unbeknownst from the first season, such as the extent of Nikadou\u2019s illness, the pressure Akari feels being unable to help Hina and the different psychological and emotional effects each character experiences in accordance to their surroundings. Each revelation is equally as tense and creates stronger connection to the characters once their situations are understood. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStudio SHAFT empowers storytelling through visual motifs and stunning presentation, bringing everything to life with powerful imagery to reflect the mood each scene portrays. Every visual element is a sight to behold, with gorgeous backgrounds, varying styles and ability to speak many words through its delivery that bring out many emotions from the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nThis mood is only enhanced by the stunning soundtrack composition. Melancholic tracks reflecting the depressing yet elegant mood can easily bring you to tears, acting as peaceful additions to the stunning composition of visuals and story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a while now I\u2019ve been pondering over the topic of depression, this in turn has affected the way I view anime titles, and what I get out of said titles. While Cardcaptor Sakura healed me from having negative thoughts, End of Evangelion\u2019s existential elements blew my mind away so much that the thought of depression was no longer on my mind. But, I think the best form of escapism from a feeling like depression is facing it head on, and that\u2019s exactly what 3-gatsu gave me; giving me personal affection to its elements. \\n\\n\r\nTo me, 3-gatsu no Lion is the epitome of human emotion, an experience rivalled by none. A show that has brought me to tears almost every episode, and something I hope many others can appreciate in the same way.\\n",

            "content": "A shrill. As he stretches to fight the leftover sluggishness of a satisfying sleep, he decides to step out on the balcony. The warm wind of a mellow morning slowly brushes past his fragile frame as if greeting him friendly. The sunshine reflects from the river just beneath the railing; a lustrous shimmer signals the change of seasons. He leaves the apartment. A lot has changed over the past year: his listless demeanor is all but gone; he has made friends and acquaintances\u2014he isn\u2019t alone any more. His steps have become strong and determined. He has moved on.\r\nThis show is not about him. Just likeRei, it has moved on from the times of subdued, somber sadness; there is another storm brewing in the distance. Unannounced, but with utter and immediate intensity, the current changes as the happy-go-lucky Hinata gets home one evening: her face is pale, her expression pained; tears start a sinister stream. There is bullying going on in Hinata\u2019s class. After fighting for and protecting the previous victim Chiho who has since left the school, the bullies shifted targets towards her. She knows she did nothing wrong, that what she did was in fact right\u2014but it doesn\u2019t stop her stomach from aching nor her heart from breaking. During a crucial time in Hinata\u2019s life, she is left alone, being ignored by former friends and classmates, utterly isolated. With bullying, there is no easy way out; just one obstacle in the form of a weak-willed teacher is enough to create rips and ripples, all of which reflect, add, and cancel each other out\u2014resulting in complete chaos.\\n\\n\r\nIn face of a problem near impossible for an outsider to resolve, her family and Rei do their best to help: Rei tries to repay the debt of Hinata and her sisters saving his life from dreariness and depression in a misled attempt to rack up money; Akari on the other hand views Hinata\u2019s well-being as a responsibility relayed to her by her late mother\u2014a responsibility too big for her to carry. Both of them fail to accomplish their goals and experience what to them seems like an indisputable defeat. However, this assessment based on the self-centered and self-serving assumption that one can do anything if one tries couldn\u2019t be further off; their so-called failures led to them spending time with Hinata, listening to her. When she ran away, Rei ran after her; in times of sorrow, she found solace in a soothing and supportive home that let her smile again. Was it not for these small everyday gestures, for friends and family supporting her no matter how ferocious or frantic her feelings, she could not have persevered. They didn\u2019t fail. They did well.\\n\\n\r\nThe ripples may wane but they never vanish, Hinata and Chiho might never fully recover\u2014but in the end, these blemishes are part of what makes a human: they add another layer to their characters, dreams, ambitions and passions, to their relationship with family, friend and foe and add context to their everyday actions. As these values accumulate, they give form not to a character, but something greater. All of these people have their own stories to tell, some of which we may never hear of; their stories intermingle and paths cross, branching off and meeting up again\u2014sometimes. Some days, the torrents may grow harsh, but other times may bring with them a friendly flux; some of the tributaries may meet a dead end earlier than expected, others may follow along the river of life and flow until they are released into the deep, dark ocean.\\n\\n\r\nConsequentially, the further one coasts along, the more colleagues and communities one will lose to such bifurcations. For a person such as Kishou Yanagihara, there are no more people to lose: all of his former friends and rivals have thrown in the towel, and as they pass on what is left of their hope and passion for the sport, they also pass on from the world of shogi. Struggling against sickness and fatigue, this burden weighs down heavy on the eldest active shogi player\u2019s frame: their sashes seem suffocating, and like a farmer staring at the remnants of a burnt field, he has no one and nowhere left to turn to. However, just like the farmer he knows that this desolate and depressing wasteland will soon give rise to a new mellow-looking meadow, fertile and fruitful. He catches on fire: his burning passion paints the picture of a haunting human torch slowly burning to cinder and as his fiery fighting spirit overtakes his self-doubt, he finally comes to terms with the fact that life moves on\u2026 even if he won\u2019t let go just yet.\\n\\n\r\nThe show moves on, its natural flow harboring both healing and heartbreak; their paths continue to cross and their stories to intermingle. And as the pieces fall into place, they give rise to an unparalleled display of life and humanity, poignant and personal. March comes in like a Lion sets a new standard not just for Slice-of-Life as a genre, but for storytelling itself.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 100\\n",

            "content": "Outstanding, just as amazing as its first season.\r\nAfter watching the first few episodes, it feels like returning to a warm home on a chilly autumn day, being engulfed by the sweet scent of apple pie and hugging my cup of hot cocoa. \r\nStory: (10/10)\r\nEverything is told through such a beautiful way like a poem. Most of the emotions Kiriyama is feeling are presented to us through the art style, which plays a big part in how the story unfolds. It gives off subtle Your Lie in April vibes but without the extreme sadness.\r\nEach episode is composed simply and even without a lot of action withthe plot it still captures my attention. We follow our favorite protagonist from last season, Kiriyama Rei, as he embarks on a new journey. How his life has taken a turn and he now experiences new things he has never felt before.\\n\\n\r\nHe starts to feel welcome, realizes his worth, his character has made subtle changes from the beginning and it it heartwarming. Just seeing Kiriyama put thoughts into others and share his life with the sisters is such a wonderful sight. There are many more sights like this in the episodes to come, even if they are after boring shogi scenes you have to plow through them, promise.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: (10/10)\\n\r\nAs stated previously, the way the style is drawn out captures the plot and conveys every emotion through color. It shows us what is going on inside Kiriyama without him having to give a monologue for us to understand.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in itself is great, I admire how the producers created this masterpiece. Quality points I'd like to make, Kiriyama is stunning in the first few episodes so far, the colors are like watercolor and the lines are fine like ball point pens. Especially the scenery is like a painting. As expected from how fascinating the first season was. Refreshing none the least. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: (10/10)\\n\r\nWho knew that a simple scene about making ramune make me cry?\\n\r\nThe music captivates my heart and brings me to tears, just remembering the prequel through the reused sounds makes the scenes heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is very nostalgic and they even kept the preview music from last season. That would have to be one of my favorite parts of the soundtrack.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (10/10)\\n\r\nOur favorite boy, Kiriyama, is wonderful. I much more than just admire him, I relate to him in many ways. The way he grows at his own steady pace, how he is overcoming his loneliness, becoming stronger in his own special ways. Of course the spot light isn't all just this memorable main character, the Kawamoto sisters are very valuable to the plot just as much as Nikaidou and Shimada. Even side characters such as Sensei Takashi are a delight to the plot and to Kiriyama's development.\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their flaws and their strengths, their own personalities and lives we look forward to getting to know. Not one character is without some part of Kiriyama's life. Even if it means antagonists who really force Kiriyama to rethink his actions and push him over the edge. Especially when side character's struggles are just as harsh as the main character's, it shows that they are simply human. It is beautiful and I won't ever forget the characters who taught, not only Kiriyama but me, lessons of life. As in every anime we look forward to watching, this one really hits home with the characters' developments and struggles.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10/10)\\n\r\nI absolutely adore this series if you couldn't tell. I don't think I will ever stop admiring Kiriyama Rei. Since I did rewatch the first season I expect myself to rewatch this one. The purly subtle humor is always the best and creates a warm feeling of joy unlike most anime who force out jokes and represent comedy through inappropriate subjects. 3-gatsu no Lion does not disappoint with its mixture of emotional scenes and comedy relief moments.\\n\\n\r\nI am truly happy to see Kiriyama finally happy in this season, he is slowly coming to love himself and those around him. He is having fun in high school, slowly opening up from how he was. \\n\\n\r\nThis series is very memorable and I hope to see anime styles like this for future anime. Although, the original is always the best.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nIt has not changed much from its prequel. Capturing my heart with each episode, 10/10, glad Kiriyama crossed the bridge again.",

            "content": "There is no anime that I am more confident in calling a masterpiece than 3-gatsu no Lion. What it is able to do is so powerful and I find it unparalleled by any other show that I have watched. Every single aspect of the show is masterful and is able to shine and enhance the show even more.\r\nWith 3-gatsu no Lion looks to be about Shogi, shogi is only one thing in a sea of ideas and themes that the show covers. depression as well is a main theme of the show, but I wouldn't say it's the only theme. Rather, I'd say the themeof the show is how everyone is struggling. The ways that the show is able to show this theme is absolutely magical.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has a story. Too often shows forget this. But 3-gatsu no Lion knows this so very well. Nuance is something sorely missing from many shows that 3-gatsu has in spades. Each character that comes up is fleshed out and even flaws as well as strengths/. There is no such thing as the hateable villain that is built up just to be hated. Every single character is shown the good and bad parts of them. Whether it be a bully or the opponent to a shogi match, each character is treated like someone real who has their own issues and things that they have to deal with. And while they may do things that aren't nice. and in any other show would get them labelled as an unlikeable villain, 3-gatsu is able to show that there are other aspects of their life that make them this way. Everyone is explored in this way and it makes the show feel so real. In the end, there is no such thing as a truly bad person, and 3gatsu gets it.\\n\\n\r\nWhats even more amazing is not just that it's able to flesh out these side characters, but the extent to which it's doing so. 3-gatsu has the powerful ability to make a character cast them in a negative light, but then show you their own story and change the audiences view so that they now want to root for them as well. It's magical how the show is continually able to showcase different situations and different issues that are relatable and lead one to want to support the one that they are watching. Even if they were the opponent just a few minutes ago, the depth and feeling that goes into exploring these characters brings me around to them, and makes it so it's hard to decide, who do I want to see win?\\n\\n\r\nAdded to this is 3-gatsu's powerful imagery. 3-gatsu uses images in the best way that I've seen in animation. While I'm fine with a more realistic approach and like what most anime do, there is something extremely powerful about 3-gatsu's art and animation. Metaphors and symbols are brought up. But they aren't just flashed onto the screen. They are explored and shown in the person that they are digging into. If someone feels tied up and forced into something, it's not just something that they say, it's something shown with multiple sashes building them in place and making it hard for them to move at all. Creative and powerful visuals are something that 3-gatsu does so well. Even in the lighthearted happy scenes 3-gatsu is able to make them feel so rich. Bright happy colors and smiles litter the scenes and make them so infectiously happy. They're sugary sweet and are even able to make those happy feelings feel so rich. \\n\\n\r\nAfter all that leads into another aspect of 3-gatsu's power. The duality of life. While the show may be focused on struggles and depression, the show also knows that there are happy parts of life. Life isn't just a series of unfortunate events. While many other shows would focus on the negative to show that 3-gatsu shows everything. It shows the dark and sad moments and the art and animation to go along with it. But it also shows the moments of family, fun, friends, and all of the things that they do that brings light into their world. 3-gatsu even gets to the point of having cats talk to showcase the happy atmosphere that they're going for. And these scenes are so powerful because they show what bonds can do even through struggles. While everyone is struggling and have their issues, they're still able to come together and have a fun time. To support each other. And those moments feel so rich with that in mind. 3-gatsu really gets life it's not just good or bad things. It's good and bad things. And no show comes close to detailing them both with as much power as 3-gatsu no Lion does.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's what makes it so magical. It's not only able to make one feel strong feels, but it's also able to make one feel happy, to make one invested in a character they only just met, and make me at least feel this greater appreciation of the world around me. Nuance is the word that so many anime lack but 3-gatsu has. And in the end, every element of this show is masterfully done. The story is engaging and well written. The characters are filled with flaws and depth. The art is filled with rich symbolism and power, and the music to go with it fits very well and only increases the power of this show. Not only is this one of the best shows that I've ever watched, but I feel like it has something really important to say. Everyone is struggling. Everyone is good and bad. While one may be an enemy or someone seen unfavourably there is probably a reason they are that way and there is more to them than just that. And if the world was able to understand it I think it'd be much better off. This show isn't just masterful at all of its elements, it also gives a greater understanding of the world which I think would benefit everyone. If there was any show that I'd recommend to anyone it'd be this one. This is the best that animation has to offer, and I love it.",

            "content": "One year after 3-gatsu no Lion\u2019s first season, the second one has arrived. And it manged to be even more outstanding. \r\nSeven months after the first season\u2019s ending, we get to see the continuation of Rei\u2019s journey; His journey to find happiness and a place where he belongs. Has he managed to overcome his emotional scars and find people he can call friends and family?\r\nThe second season starts in a truly heartwarming way that shows how much Rei has grown and how lucky he feels for finally finding friends he can have fun with at school, and a family in the Kawamoto household. When comparedto his former self, a boy with a reclusive personality and depression caused by his traumas and insecurities, Rei has grown as a person in an amazing way. While he is still a flawed being and is still searching, he has slowly overcome most of his personal issues, gained confidence, started trusting others and being more open to them while creating meaningful relationships with them. And most importantly, he is able to smile and laugh honestly, from the bottom of his heart. His pure laugh at the end of episode 16, even though it might sound like a simple thing, was one of the most powerful scenes of this season.\\n\r\nHis growth throughout the whole anime, whether it\u2019s done through his everyday life or the competitive shogi scene, is truly impressive and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, Rei isn\u2019t the only character to get the spotlight and, even though he is the protagonist, there were quite a few episodes where he felt like he was a side character. But when it comes to 3-gatsu a situation like this is welcome. Umino Chica has the talent to create amazingly realistic and unique characters. It\u2019s never uninteresting to follow an episode or a whole arc focused on a side character, slowly see him being fleshed out, to learn his background, his personal thoughts, problems and worries. \\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters like this from the professional shogi scene, like Yanagihara and Souya, but even some that got less focus like the pigeon man (Yamazaki) and others. No matter how much focus they got, they were all memorable characters with interesting personalities and backgrounds.\\n\r\nOther characters that we know from the first season, like Nikaidou, Shimada and many others, keep appearing and receiving their fair share of focus and development.\\n\\n\r\nThe Kawamoto sisters are shown a lot in this season, mainly because of a certain arc: The arc about Hina becoming a victim of bullying.\\n\r\nThis is one of the greatest arcs of the story so far for many reasons. It depicts bullying, the reasons behind it, its consequences and the damage it can cause in a very realistic way, without exaggerating it. The main bully, Takagi, is a really mean girl, but through her meetings with the homeroom teacher we get to understand the reason and thoughts that led to her actions. This doesn\u2019t make what she did any better, but it\u2019s great to see that even a character like her is getting a realistic personality.\\n\r\nThe one who supported the Kawamoto family was Rei, even if he thought that he couldn\u2019t do anything for them. The Kawamoto sisters were the ones who gave him affection and treated him like family, and now he\u2019s the one helping them. It\u2019s nice to see how much Rei has developed and come to love the Kawamoto family through this.\\n\r\nOf course, the one who got the most focus and development in this arc was Hina and her relationship with Rei. Her emotions and thoughts were fleshed out incredibly through the whole arc. She showed how great a character and brave girl she is, and Rei even felt like he was saved by her words.\\n\r\nThe rest of the Kawamoto family, mainly Akari, got a bit of focus in this arc, as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe storytelling is still done in a poetic way, with a slow pace that makes the viewer immersed into the story as it gradually progresses.\\n\r\nWhile the anime is dramatic for the most part, the lighthearted comedy is still here. The subtle comedy of 3-gatsu no Lion is pretty funny and it can bring a smile to the viewers\u2019 face or laughter. It doesn\u2019t feel forced and the balance between the dramatic and funny moments is perfect.\\n\\n\r\nIn the second season, too, shogi has an important role in the anime. The psychology during the matches is portrayed excellently. The great description of the characters\u2019 thoughts and emotions during the matches, helps the audience that can\u2019t understand shogi know what\u2019s going on the board. During the matches, the characters also find the chance to get fleshed out and developed, which leads to the story\u2019s progression.\\n\\n\r\nLike in the first season, studio Shaft has followed every single scene and line of the source material faithfully. They have only mixed up a few chapters at the end of the anime to make a more suitable ending episode, but this doesn't really pose a problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and character sections of the review have gotten a bit mixed up already, but when it comes to a character-driven story like this one, it\u2019s hard to talk about the plot without mentioning the characters. But rather than a plot with a clear beginning and ending, 3-gatsu no Lion mostly consists of pieces of different characters\u2019 lives presented in a realistic and human way.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion does an exceptional work at presenting complex, deep, realistic characters and fleshing them out. Their personalities, backstories, flaws, thoughts, worries and emotions feel human and even relatable. The anime never forgets any of them, it keeps showing them to the audience and developing them, while they all have a part in Rei\u2019s life, even if it is as an obstacle.\\n\r\nThe relationships and interactions between the characters also feel very human and the chemistry between them is really nice.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on the art and animation, it\u2019s quite easy to notice that studio Shaft has put an even greater effort to the already awesome visuals of the first season. Umino Chica\u2019s artstyle combined with Shaft\u2019s powerful direction, fluid animation and unique touches is a delight to the eyes. The artwork seems experimental at times, but there is also a feel of realism in it.\\n\r\nThe color palette is really nice and the colors are used correctly according to what each scene wants to convey. Dark colors show up in the dramatic scenes and brighter ones for the more lighthearted ones. The shift of the colors really adds to the mood and atmosphere and makes the audience understand better how the characters feel at that moment, especially when it comes to the serious and dramatic scenes and the shogi matches.\\n\r\nThe use of metaphorical scenes with symbolism is truly masterful, and depicts the characters' thoughts and emotions in a very creative way.\\n\r\nThe character designs are still good and unique and the characters\u2019 expressions are drawn in a great way.\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are beautifully drawn and detailed.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the show is truly captivating, the soundtrack has an active role in creating the appropriate mood for each scene and allows them to convey their feeling better.\\n\r\nThe OPs and EDs, just like in the first season, are very good and memorable. It\u2019s also a nice detail that the songs keep getting a bit cheerier and have brighter art as Rei gradually grows and becomes happier by overcoming some of his troubles. They are all nicely directed with great animation and the use of watercolor-like colors in some of them is beautiful.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did an awesome job once again and managed to convey the characters\u2019 feelings perfectly. \\n\r\nEven the animals\u2019 little dialogues in their cute voices are pretty funny.\\n\r\nThe sound effects are also used well.\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is an anime with a unique take on the slice of life genre. It doesn\u2019t just follow everyday adventures of characters\u2019, but it also gives them a mature and human touch. The anime\u2019s storytelling is truly intriguing with its heavy characterization and greatly used psychology. Its life lessons regarding different issues one can come across in life and growth of the characters can even influence the viewers. It\u2019s a series that makes simple everyday things feel powerful and offers compelling drama. Along with the beautiful artwork and music, it can stir up the viewers\u2019 emotions and tug at their heartstrings through both the dramatic and lighthearted scenes. Watching 3-gatsu no Lion is a breathtaking experience, a true masterpiece that keeps surpassing the viewers' expectations and capturing their hearts.",

            "content": "If you thought that the Shogi in season 1 was boring but stuck it out anyway for the melodrama then you are in luck! \r\n     For many people season 1 was good and season 2 only gets better. And if you thought that the best part of the show was the MC's inner turmoil then by all means this second season won't let you down! As long as you weren't too attached to Kiriyama Rei that is. We kind of left him behind to pursue other crestfallen and overly dramatic heroes. If you think questions like\"show me the proof\" should be followed by 3 full minutes of internal dialogue as a black haze surrounds the horror-struck listener, then it doesn't get better than this!\\n\r\n     If you are only in it for the art, be not afraid. They didn't suddenly fire their art team and higher the guy who did Pingpong! \\n\r\n     As far as I am concerned, however, this show is a far cry from its predecessor. The plot is a rehashing of the MC's struggle in season 1 but in a MUCH less interesting setting with much less interesting characters. There are entire episodes in which Kiriyama does not appear, because he simply plays no significant role in the plot. The story of the young, struggling, prodigy shogi player stagnates and falls by the wayside. The story of a person battling their inner demons lives on, growing increasingly mawkish to the point that Season 2 is almost a parody of season 1. I had expectations that the story would have to change to move on with Kiriyama. I never imagined that instead the story could remain the same and it is Kiriyama who has been left behind.",

            "content": "3-gatsu no lion that aired in fall was already a masterpiece, a unique, mature show that had very interesting plot points and characters, it was surprising to see that such a show managed to get a sequel, but apparently it was very famous in japan, which is great. now, 3-gatsu no lion's second season is, in my opinion much better than the first season, don't get me wrong, both seasons are masterpieces, but seeing this one and all the characters advancing and changing, it's simply great to watch.\r\nTL:DR: amazing characters, Good, slice-of-life story, the best music and openings, and of course, SHAFT's art, also knownas a 10/10 without even looking at it.\\n\\n\r\nStory:10/10, for a slice-of-life show, this actually has a story, and surprisingly that story advances. in this season, we see more focus on the side characters and the misery of other characters that aren't rei, there is lots of drama, lots of emotions and bonds developing and most importantly, our main character isn't so gloomy anymore, characters developed and changed, and the story is slowly moving.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:10/10,as if the characters from the first season weren't good enough, this season is even better. in the first season the focus was on Rei,Shimada and his circle of characters, but in this season we see Lots of developement for the side characters as i already mentioned, like Hina and her family, the teacher and by the end of their arc, i'm sure we'll be right back to shimada and the story. though in my opinion, this arc that focuses on the three sisters is the best arc in the series ( the first arc in season one was also fantastic. ) it has lots of emotions,lots of \"reality\" put into it which is why i loved it alot. i'll keep the \"Long\" review for when the show is finished but for now this is all i have to say about characters and story.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10/10, it's Shaft. amazing scenery, great camera angles, beautiful character designs and simply perfect art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:10/10, YUKI sings the opening again and her voice is fantastic as always, it's a very memorable and great song, the ending is by a band that never sung in 3-gatsu no lion before that being Brian the sun, but i'm simply glad this band sung the ending, it's the best song out of the entire series in my opinion, or rather, it's in a draw with every other song as they're all just perfect. the background music is still fantastic, the voice actors have lots of emotions into their voices and are very competent, especially Kana hanazawa as Hina.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10/10, this show only gets better and better, the rating may change when i finish the show.",

            "content": "For people new to 3-gatsu no lion, the main problem with this series is, It doesn't have any negative reviews and it feels as if fans are only watching it. So here I am writing a genuine review for you so that you might have a better understanding of the series you are about to watch.\r\nFor an anime to be worth 10 ratings for people reading your review, you have to get that nostalgic feel or be in that anime trance for a week or at least for a few days, it should be as if the scene were replaying over and over before youreyes. \\n\r\nBut guess what?, I forgot the feeling just after a few hours watching it.\\n\r\nAn anime can be praised for its Art, music, and character development, but at that end of the day what you need is to watch a story and be able to tell damn I felt connected and stay in that story for a long time.\\n\\n\r\nSo how did this anime get such high ratings and top reviews? Well 'March comes in like a lion' has 22 episodes and is a Slice of life (SOL), So most chances of people watching season 2 are due to the appreciation it received from season 1. i.e, mainly fans of this series watch it hence the final result is the rating you see and most of the 10 rated reviews are those which are written because of the last 4 episodes, damn they are too good, but that doesn't mean you have to sit for 16-18 episodes of normal everyday life to get that smiling conclusion. Well, I am not saying that it is overrated, I am just cautioning you to not get deceived by them. \\n\\n\r\nThis is actually too much into a \"Slice of life\" (SOL) that it wouldn't give you any lesson or knowledge which you might be expecting in a SOL or in an anime.To be honest this is just way perfect SOL, without much melodrama but more into daily life activity which might or might not be interesting.\\n\\n\r\nTo all those who haven't watched the season 1, if you are a fan of SOL type of anime then this is the best thing for you or else if you are trying to adjust watching this due to its rating then I am sure you might be disappointed and left with regret. Just watch it like an another SOL, then it's better and you might even be a fan. \\n\\n\r\nI'll stop the commenting here about the overall series, I wrote all that to lower your hype levels, the following review is based on the idea that you have already watched season 1 : (If you need REVIEW ON SEASON 1 then I'm writing it under the heading \"FAQs\", look for it below)\\n\\n\r\nPLOT:\\n\\n\r\nThe story continues from where it stopped in season 1, i.e., from the formation of the Shogi science club and the normal everyday life of Rei begins, as usual, going to school, playing shogi etc.\\n\\n\r\nThis season is divided into 4 major Arcs: Bullying Arc, Souya Arc, 'Match b/w shimada and Sakutarou Yanagihara' Arc and finally, 'Hinata's future after middle school' Arc followed by the conclusive ending.\\n\\n\r\nThis story is made as if all the problem in the world come only to these people surrounding Rei...as you know shimada in season 1 with stomachaches, Nikaidou with anemia, Hinata with bullying, and then there is Souya and Sakutarou which I won't spoil. It makes you feel irritated at some point actually but somehow the writer tries to compensate the feeling in later episodes by either giving unexpected or a satisfying conclusion to the Arc.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be the experience you might go through with the series so that reading this will help you get a better idea of what I meant from the sentences used at the beginning of the review: (I've put the arcs in such a way not to spoil you, as a matter of fact there is nothing to spoil in a SOL of this kind)\\n\\n\r\nComing to the 1st Arc:\\n\r\nIt was able to portray bullying in the best possible way unlike any other anime, which only show up to what child experiences but not what parents face. Its actually Hinata who is a victim of bullying, but the problem was, I was feeling most of the time,\" why isn't it over yet, dammit why is he dragging so long, I need to know what happens in the future\", the reason I felt is because of the pacing, it was too damn slow, watching Hinata in such situation was unbearable, I just wanted her to be out of it as soon as possible, the story neither was fully concentrating on bullying nor on shogi matches...it was felt half hearted as if the episodes were put just to show a script rather than creating an impact.(earlier episodes) but in later ones, the feeling is compensated a little like I said by giving a good conclusion.\\n\\n\r\n2nd Arc:\\n\r\nThis is my favorite Arc of all the Arcs, which really concentrated on Rei's Shogi skills and mainly creating that exciting environment before a match begins, It also gives you more information on the Walking devil or Shogi playing Machine, the lookalike of Rei:- Meijin Souya\\n\\n\r\n3rd Arc :\\n\r\nThis Arc is a match between Sakutarou and our beloved Shimada, Well Its another match between two people who aren't the main characters, between an old man defending his title and a promising new generation genius. This is also another dragging story, with repetitive flashback scenes which are kinda irritating.\\n\\n\r\nWell I know a little about the feeling of players of mind games since I am a chess player myself, to be honest the things shown here, like the thought process behind players especially in Sakutarou's case, it was meant to create emotional connection with the story...but the truth is, what really goes on in the mind is that you will be actually thinking about what the next moves are gonna be and mostly with a feeling that you shouldn't be losing... because the amount of mental strain is too much for you to think about what your \"friend said\". There is absolutely no chance for you to remember his words and reminisce because if you are losing a match, your brain would be really depressed cutting off such thoughts, it would try to either fight back or give up.\\n\\n\r\nand 4th Arc:\\n\r\nThis arc is another boring or routine story which you see almost in every Slice of life stories where it's the end of the school and time to move on... \\n\r\nand finally, there comes the perfect ending which is made with all the best soundtracks and colorful Art, they are able to hold both the fan-base, the haters back which resulted in 9 and 10 rated reviews.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Yeah I almost forgot!!! The Jokes are the same usual lame dumb ones with 'squeal' and 'swish' character sounds, but you really need them because they are the ones which seem to relax our brains after such mindscrewing sad scenes. The jokes made in the 22nd episode were the only ones which made me laugh truly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nRei: He seems more mature and responsible and is helpful instead of being a crybaby. This series is not about him or his past, I can guarantee you that. \\n\\n\r\nHinata: Well she is a really cute and a good person, to be honest, I kinda like her attitude of helping others and sharing your problems with family rather than shutting yourself which is the best thing you can learn from this anime. \\n\\n\r\nRest all characters aren't focussed much or I don't feel the necessity to mention them, I wish there was more Shimada's or Nikaidou's character development, but unnecessary time was wasted on many parts like Yamazaki Junkei's lifestyle etc. \\n\r\nMany situations in the series are made such that we are out in a situation where it is the middle of a conversation and you don't know how they came to be in that situation. It was meant to cut short the time but it kinda seemed awkward to not get the full impact of the situation.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe Art is in its peak form, It is really way better than the season 1, the 3 sisters who take care of Rei are cute as ever and the scenarios are beautifully drawn, I fell in love with the city lights in background and moonlight which are better colored and drawn.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack:\\n\r\nThis time the soundtracks weren't that great, I mean most of the scenes were sad ones so yeah there were mostly normal melancholy guitar and violin with a mix of flute music. But in the last 4 episodes, we get to hear the beautiful soundtracks which are famous in season 1 to come back and give us the happy peaceful sound to the ear. The openings and endings songs aren't that good when compared to season 1, but were kinda normal to hear, only the 2nd ending song seemed good with the piano intro.\\n\\n\r\nOverall :\\n\r\nYeah, it may be a Masterpiece of great Art and well-written psychology of people and their reactions to the situation, but for normal general audience like me, we can't get the true essence from one sitting, or don't have time to re-watch it either cos It has 22 episodes of content with lots of meaningless stuff in between. If you liked the season 1, then I would definitely recommend you to watch this season, but if you hate it then don't watch this series because even if it shows about bullying and has few good episodes like last 4, I would rather ask you to watch some other anime than this :)\\n\\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nFAQs:\\n\\n\r\nSEASON 1 REVIEW:\\n\\n\r\nI am not a fan of Studio Shaft's Art or animation, I don't like anime similar to Monogatari series because of their Art, which feels weird, but 3-gatsu no lion's Art is different from those type of series, because even though, it looked black blue and whitish colours which represent sad theme, it also has colorful drawings with beautiful soundtracks representing the happy atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nCutting everything short, its a Slice of life of a high school student and kinda orphan named Rei Kiriyama who is a professional Shogi player, who lives independently with the money he gets from the games, he is sometimes taken care by 3 Sisters(one of them is Hinata) who live in the neighborhood.(I Don't want to mention further as its already available in the plot of the series) \\n\\n\r\nWell many anime have the scenario as if the hero has a natural talent but due to financial problems, they wouldn't come up. But this one is different, our hero has talent, money and also has a family to help. But did you ever think that this talent would make you go away, live separately and lead a sad depressing life? This anime depicts some another level of reality which actually makes you relate to it and the only problem is there is no \"Moral of the Story\" at the end.\\n\\n\r\nlike I said earlier Art is good and soundtracks are best which were the ones that made me compelled to watch this show, they are also perfectly timed to give you correct emotions. Even the opening and ending are simply awesome which makes you listen to it at every episode without skipping.\\n\\n\r\nComing to Enjoyment, starting 2 episodes were boring, but it picks the pace and moves on to another level by keeping you engaged till the end. By the way, the jokes are dumb, please bear with them, you might get used to them in the longer run.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 1 Overall:\\n\r\nGo and watch season 1 without dropping in the first few episodes, it is good, But if you hated after completion, then skip season 2 because season 2 is similar to 1 and it might turn out to be 22 episode hell. :P (This season 1 review is dumb, please read other reviews in reviews section as I don't have time to write it properly)\\n\\n\\n\r\nComparison between both the Seasons:\\n\r\nSeason 1 is way better when it comes to story and narration, because there is suspense feel throughout the series and keeps you wanting to know what actually in Rei's past...but season 2 is more of the SOL of other characters( Mainly Hinata) and hence not much suspense is present, you just feel like watching it just for the sake of completion...\\n\r\nThere is also a perfect representation of the feelings of players during a match in season 1 as I personally know as a chess player which was shown very less in season 2\\n\r\nOnly the match between Souya was the coolest thing in this series because you get to know about the great Meijin.\\n\\n\\n\r\ndub? : Season 2 doesn't have a dub yet, but the dubbed version of season 1 is good and has good English.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why I couldn't like this show (season 2) that much, maybe it's because I was tired binge watching continuously without gap both seasons, it made me exhausted by the time I reached 16th episode in season 2. If you want me to re-watch it again to get a better understanding, its just way too much pain to sit through another 22 episodes and waste time, I would rather go watch some new anime to know a new story :)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "All fart no shit.\r\nAfter finishing season 1 I was very excited to watch season 2 and after finishing it, I am more than a little disappointed. Writing one of the most negative reviews for this anime brings me no pleasure, but I really wanted to put into words why this left me feeling so disappointed. \r\nThe first season set up a lot of different interesting things that do not get pay off here. A big part of season 1 is Rei's foster sister Kyouko, who fell for a man the same age as her father because she felt that Rei replaced her, leaving her feelingsort of obsolete to her father. Also it is implied that Kyouko sexually assaulted Rei when they were younger. Nothing is done with this in season 2. Akari at 19 years old had watched her mother die, her dad leave, and she was then responsible for raising her younger sisters. Nothing is done with this in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nIt is incredibly frustrating to me how little development or new information there is in this season. I was really looking forward to seeing more of Rei and Kyouko's relationship, but it is as if she never even existed. If I was not supposed to care about her then why spend a few episodes in the first season making me care? I really do not understand this. I'm assuming this is addressed later in the manga, but Kyouko deserves more screen time. Ignoring her until she is maybe needed for some future episodes is not OK. Her story hasn't moved forward at all this season. \\n\\n\r\nThen there is what the show did with Akari. Nothing. A 19 year old who is forced to raise 2 kids is not worth exploring apparently. A third season could explore her character more, but currently with 44 episodes out there just isn't enough to her character. She is a single parent who cares deeply about her family and is also working to support them financially. She never complains and is completely selfless. Her character is not believable. I need to know how she got to where she is, and what sacrifices she has made in her life, simply hinting towards it isn't enough for me. If she has accepted that she is a single parent and needs to dedicate a large part of her life to that, show her making that decision. She must have gone through a lot, and I want to see it. We know hardly anything about her. Also it is impossible for a single parent with a job to cook the meals Akari cooks and not be incredibly stressed and/or tired. \\n\\n\r\nIf you were to add up all the scenes of characters cooking or eating with nothing important to the overall plot happening, it would probably be over an hour of footage. Most of what the sisters seem to do is cook and eat food. If you do not enjoy watching people eat food then this anime will be boring for a lot of its runtime. After really enjoying season 1 I was fast forwarding through some scenes in this, which made me feel sad. And does anyone really want to watch two old men argue about some shit that is unimportant to anything else happening in the series? Far too many scenes with old men being boring. \\n\\n\r\nRei seems happier in this season than the previous, but it doesn't feel logical. Previous plot points that would require Rei to change as a person to resolve are simply ignored so Rei can move forward. He mentions he doesn't have the confidence to phone his sister, and then it is never mentioned again. There is no substance to anything. His relationships with people need to be in a different place at the end of a season than to the start otherwise what was the point? The only character he connects with in any meaningful way is Hina. \\n\\n\r\nThe main plot of this season revolved around bullying. A serious topic and the anime does treat it as serious, showing how it affects children's lives. This is easily the strongest part of this season. Hina is bullied and it mirrors Rei's time in school when he was bullied and all alone. The difference this time though is that Hina is not alone, because she has Rei to help her. He wants to save her from what he had to go through. His motivation is clear and his actions (mostly) make sense. The resolution of the bullying would have happened if Rei was not even there and he himself knows this. However the support he offered to Hina helped her get through it and is reason for him to be proud. It was frustrating then when he felt like he did nothing; this could have been a turning point for Rei where he gains confidence and has reason to like himself more, but the anime hurries onto the next thing. On the topic of Rei and Hina, he is 18, and she is 13. Rei's teacher thinks he's in love with her and encourages him. He is 18. She is 13. Bad teacher! \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude my thoughts on this season, I am quite upset to write that I disliked it. There were individual moments that were good, but the anime lacked focus. After the first season I was ready to recommend 3-gatsu to a friend, but now I am not going to (if a third season comes out and is as good as the first then this will change). I went through all the episodes in a short amount of time and honestly feel like it was a waste of time. It is possible that a third season could fix the problems I have with this show and focus more on interesting character development, and I really hope a third season does happen. A lot of people seem to love this series and me not enjoying it doesn't mean I want others to not enjoy it. I honestly tried to enjoy this, but I was left wanting a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this review.",

Though the anime does revolve around the main character as a professional shouji player, I found that even I, with as little understanding of this japanese board game, was able to immensely enjoy this anime.\r\n  What this anime truly revolves around are the individuals surrounding the main character, and the lessons he learns from helping them through the hardships and trials they encounter within their own lives.  In turn he applies what he learned from overcoming these hardshipsto his own life.  This anime to me exemplifies a journey of self discovery, a journey which as shown is this anime, is a cycle through suffering from uncertainty, and joy through the act of grabbing a hold of life.",

            "content": "I'm not gonna lie, I liked the first season of this, but I felt it fell a bit flat in the second half with it's focus on shogi, and less focus on Rei and his development with the characters around him. This season solves that. Let's start with this, I need to bleach my brain. Not because it's so bad that I want to unsee it, but because it's so good, that I won't be able to look at anime again, my expectations have exploded through the roof and hit FUCKING JUPITER. Let's start with the review. And note, there will be spoilers, and theseries is so good, watch it before reading the review, because I want to spoil nothing.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10. This arc focuses mostly on one thing, Hina, but does shift it's focus at times to look at other characters, including Nikaido and Rei's Shogi Science Club, but the main focus is Hina, or more specifically, Hina being bullied. This arc had some of the most realistic looks at bullying I've ever seen, with actually messages sent out in very well done ways. It doesn't over exaggerate it, and yet, it perfectly illustrates how damaging bullying can be, and what it means to speak up. And that's not even mentioning how well it fit into the characters and story. Speaking of...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10. It would be a lie to say I didn't love the sisters, Hina especially, but this season, heck, one scene, made her into a character so likable and complex, she may be my favorite character in all of anime. And that's not to say Rei isn't interesting either. He feels like a human, he has flaws and fears, and anxiety. He is pessimistic, but the way we see him grow from those around him (Newcomer Finals) and the way he learns to be happy is so refreshing. He feels complex too, carrying that darkness, but learning to accept the happiness around him.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10. The music is just good. I don't notice it during normal scenes, it's just kinda... there, but when the really serious scenes come on, it gets good, REALLY GOOD. The soundtrack is beautiful, adds to the emotions, to the point where you can cry for a pigeon or FRACKING RAMUNE CANDY. And the intro and outro really grew on me, so much so, I was sad to see it get a new one, but don't worry, the new one's good too. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10. Yeah, order's messed up, but whatever. The art man, where do I begin. First of all, it's nothing like you've seen before, looking like Your Lie in April met with Madoka Magica and Monogatari, with hatched eyes, long lips, beautiful usage of colors, and images and backgrounds so good looking, it gives 5 Centimeters per Second a run for its money. And then there's the changes in art. The art can go from it's normal, to cut out, to pencil, to these archaic sketches, and the odd part is, it looks good. It doesn't distract from the scene, in fact, it adds to it, giving it more power than if it were to stand alone. That's impressive, and this is possibly the best looking anime I've ever watched. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. I can't even begin. Certain episodes, I was inches from the screen, holding my breath. Other episodes, I was practically cheering (not practically) when they were over. This anime has brought me to tears of both sadness and happiness, and there were episodes where for all 24 and a half minutes (I don't watch the previews), I was smiling like an absolute idiot. I have never enjoyed an anime quite this much, and that's really saying something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Honestly, this anime should define an entire generation. It sadly was pretty overlooked since it didn't fall into the categories of \"fantasy\", \"comedy\", \"romance\", \"sci-fi\" or \"shounen\", making it very underwatched despite it's high ratings, but it deserves to be. This anime was breathtaking, with scenes so emotional and powerful, I couldn't breath, all I could do was stare at the visuals and listen to the music. It's down to earth and relatable, and the character development, story telling, and beautiful music and artistic symbolism, all that makes this anime a true gem. Now, is this the best anime I've ever watched, very likely. I decided to let the season end before I decide, but so far, absolutely nothing can match the dramatic, heartwarming, beautiful masterpiece that is Sangatsu no Lion. If you hadn't seen it and watched the review anyways, go check it out, it's worth it.",

For example, how differently we act in the company of strangers, friends, school/work buddies and among our own family. 3-Gatsu no Lion shows multidimensional aspect of all of its characters fromtheir personalities to their personal life. For this reason, it is comparable to such mindfuck tier anime series as Serial Experiments Lain and Texhnolyze. However, 3-Gatsu no Lion does not try to be deep nor complex, it does not try to confuse its viewers with obscure references and by adding details that are 2deep4anyone and everyone to get. Instead, it offers a perspective on life, perspetive that can only be called brutally honest.\\n\\n\\n\r\nKiriyama Rei,\\n\\n\r\nIn the very beginning, we have a scene where Rei analyses an ongoing shogi game with the words \"From this point on, he was trapped. There was nowhere left for him to go.\" Upon saying this, there is a time, a fraction of a second when he does not move. Shinbou Akiyuki showed with the power of just couple of frames what Rei was thinking. \"This same sentence could have been used to describe my own life not too long ago.\" This can easily be tagged as an over-analysing, but after seeing both seasons twice and knowing with how much detail this series comes, it is clear that Shinbou managed to deliver Rei's thoughts. This time around, a cloud is not covering his face nor is he drowning, he simply is there and that was enough. More on Rei in Hina's part near the end of review. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKawamoto Akari,\\n\\n\r\n\"Is this truly the same Akari.\" Sentence said by Rei. When she works, she is not the motherly elder sister. When she is alone with Rei, she shows her weaknesses, the yearning she holds towards her mother, the unspoken betrayal of his father, how she worries over her sisters and the grandpa who won't always be there. She is not afraid to cry. When her sisters are present, when there is company over, fun night held and food being eaten, she is the heart of the house, the spirit that keeps everyone up and going. She loves to help those in need, be it Rei, her Sisters or the stray cats she adopted, or even that one owl, she nurtures. During the psychosomatic symptoms seen in Hina, she admits that she is taking care of all of these things, not for the sake of them, but for the sake of her herself. More on Akari in Hina's part near the end of review. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKouda Kyouko,\\n\\n\r\nAfter getting abandont by her father, and witnessing her family destroyed, she falls in love with the person she shouldn't, sexually assaults her own brother, and gets called \"the devil in woman's body\" constanty. The author put herself in a tight spot to say the least when it comes to Kyouko. Seeing her as the devil that she is often called will easily be the viewer's conclusion of her character as well. She is behind the thickest of shells. Wanting to believe in her own victimhood, but also to protect her father from her own personality, she runs away - not like a devil in woman's body, but as a child who is incapable of forgiving. The sexual assualt, which was hinted in total of 2 times during the series can be seen backfired. She regrets, and this is clearly confirmed in two different ways. First one being that she constantly worries about Rei. Despite this being seen as a bother and bullying in situation such as her trying to crush Rei's confidence in upcoming games, she is also making him a stronger person by doing this. The other reason is her love for Rei. She trusts she is forgiven, and acts like a sister seeking support, openly asking for help and crying in his presence. Akari says \"they do not act like sisters\" but this is a perfect example of how shelled person Kyouko is, and there is more sister-brother relationship there than anyone, including the siblings themselves, are ready to accept. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Gotou,\\n\\n\r\n\"What is right and what is wrong, are you the one who gets to decide that. Are you, perhaps, God?\" After hitting Rei and scolding him for his naivity, it is easy for the viewer to see Gotou as a villain. Ultimately, he is a teacher with great life-experience. What he did by becoming the villain was direct Rei towards opening his eyes to the real world. All of this he did with uncertainty. Not knowing what he himself should actually do with the love and support Kyouko is ready to offer for him, but at the same time being married to a woman who only lies down in the hospital bed waiting for death. Is it truly okay to move on already? That is a heavy question for him. The scene where he falls asleep next to Kyouko is a good example where we see what he wants. At the same time, he also defended Kyouko's own decisions of what she wants. He is aware of this contradictory. It show just how much weight his wife's fate weights his shoulders.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nKawamoto Hinata,\\n\\n\r\nFrom the epitome of 2pure4this world to the girl who goes near rivers to cry, Hina's personality thusfar is the most complex. Missing her mother even more than Akari, and completely silencing herself about the betrayal of the father, life is not about the pretty buttefly stuff for her. Hina is a mere child, yet the whole 2nd Season of 3-Gatsu no Lion focuses on making her life a living hell. Starting from the loss of best friend, followed by bullying, getting betrayed by yet another adult incapable of helping her when she most needs it, just to see it all come down to a point where she has to let go off her life long love. Being the eccentric ray of light in the lives of those dear to her, is no longer the reality of her. What follows are psychosomatic symtoms, loneliness and she losing herself. Who exactly am I? \\n\\n\r\nTo talk about Hina, is to talk about 7 other characters, Rei, Akari, grandpa, the friend, the bully, the female teacher and the male teacher. For the sake of chronology, I will present them in the order where they occured. Hina knows that helping Rei in the past only brought good things for both of them. When she tried to help her friend who is being bullied, she is being honest to the character who she is at home. Stopping the bullying is not an easy thing as turns out, Hina's friend quits school, moves away and becomes a shut-in. This makes Hina the target of bullying instead. The first one to know this is the female teacher who was unable to stop the bullying of the first girl too. Instead of helping the victim, she decides to go into victim blaming where Hina gets scolded quite literally for defending her own friend. This shows Hina the same unreliability she got from her father. The teacher actions are later explained by her knowing that the bullying is real, but she being scared and tired of seeing the never ending bullying happen year after year with different students. This is concluded with one of the most powerful scenes in the series where the teacher goes through a mental breakdwon in front of the whole class. Showing that even the side side charactes in this series are mere humans.\\n\\n\r\nIn between the teachers first and last reaction is Rei.\"Hina saved me.\" Is a sentence Rei says in total of 3 times in the series. Now it is his turn to help. The great thing about this is Hina's knowledge. She is aware that just by not doing much, she was able to help Rei. Getting help from him in the shogi city is one of the seven major impacts a third party casted on her during her hardships that lead her towards the resolve. It as well impacfed her final views on the lover where she was able to let go off him for knowing that people like Rei would not leave her. The next major part is Akari who is supposed to help Hina overcome the bullying by gowing to the school and solve the matter with the bully and her parents. This comes down to a debate where neither of them can prove anything. This is imporant part of both Akari's and Hina's character. For one, Akari comes to lose confidence in her being the \"mother\" to her little sister, and make her realize how much she relies on the grandpa. For another matter, this shows how much Akari means to Hina, she is almost accepting the loss just to make her sister worry less. During this meeting, the male teacher is now shown his value. This goes back into bringing Hina's trust into adults back as well offering another major step towards her gaining back her true character as well as the first step towards stopping the bulluying. The bully on the other hand comes off as what Rei could have become if he didn't have shogi in his life. Basically, the bully is another Kyouko in the making. It's important to note that Rei isn't aware of this. The only ones who get to realize this about her character are the viewers.  \\n\\n\r\nThe last part of Hina's impact are grandpa and the friend's resolution. \"You did well, Hina.\" Upon hearing that Hina has tried to help her friend, the grandpa casts these carefully picked words on her. Without these, perhaps she would have never be the same. The grandpa is the last abutment when all else fails. I won't go into details with grandpa's own character, but basically he knows his role better than anyone. Hina comes to realize this very well when the hardships resolve. This is yet followed by showing Hina that her friend is also working hard to get over her bullying. Perhaps Hina would have become exactly like her friend if she didn't have this network of people helping her to overcome the latest challenge in her life. \\n\\n\r\nAll of these are extremely important factors when trying to understand Hina. Simply because she is the opposite of Rei. She is interacting with and influenced by those around her there were Rei chose the other route at her age. And thus concludes this analysis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n*Please note that my reasons for thinking very highly about 3-Gatsu no Lion are not limited to these factors presented. I have merely touched the surface of this series by commenting on the complexity of its characters without much else. Not casting comments on the story. Or the overall execution which is equally great*\\n",

            "content": "Please note this review assumes that you have finished watching the second season of 3 Gatsu no Lion and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned!\r\nBased off a popular manga of the same name the second season of 3 Gatsu No Lion continues on with the work its previous season started on showing the life of its main character and his struggle to change himself as he continues to advance his career in shogi while also learning how to forge bonds with others and make connections as he navigates thepath that is called life.\\n\\n\r\nThe overall story for 3 Gatsu no Lion\u2019s second season continues the journey of 17-year Rei Kiriyama a high school student and pro shogi player as he starts a new school year and encounters new friends, new opponents and new challenges in both his professional career and in his personal life that he must overcome if he wants to continue breaking out of his shell to become a better person. Joining him along this journey is a number of both familiar and new characters that both directly change Rei\u2019s character or characters that are dear to him that causes Rei to change in an effort to help them. These include the kind-hearted Akari, the responsible and determined Hinata and the quiet but intense Souya. \\n\\n\r\nRei \\n\\n\r\nRei Kiriyama voiced by veteran voice actor Kengo Kawanishi of Naruto Shippuden and Aldnoah Zero fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A 17-year-old high school student and a pro shogi player Rei from initial appearances is a quiet, calm and composed teenager that seems to be slowly getting used to dealing with people that he meets in society. As the new school year for Rei starts it can be seen that the Rei that we see in this season is very different to the Rei that we met back in the first season as a result of the many changes that we saw him experience then. Back in the first season, Rei was someone that was shown to be a quiet person that got nervous easily and had trouble in not just fitting in but also in making friends with people outside of his circle often putting up walls to protect himself against strangers. He was also noted to be someone that hid the majority of his personality and feelings inside him. In this season it can be seen that Rei is much more confident and calmer and is able to interact with people that had formally been outside of his circle of friends. While still nervous to a degree it can be seen that the Rei that we see in this season is now much more positive and cheerful and is able to enjoy himself more at school and in clubs and in doing so able to make many new friends. With this new-found confidence, Rei is shown to be also capable of explaining things to others slowly and breaking down more complex subjects like shogi and maths into ways that are understandable for those that don\u2019t know the subject a change that I thought was welcome for his character. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Rei encounters challenge after challenge it can be seen that Rei\u2019s personality starts to gradually change as a result of not just the challenges that he faced but also of the understanding that he had gained when interacting with others. While noted to be a quiet person in the beginning Rei was also someone noted to not show his true feelings about things seemingly preferring to instead hide it within himself. As a result of this Rei was someone that only showed limited emotions towards others as if he was scared that by showing more he might invite scorn from others. He was also noted to be someone that distanced himself from interactions with others. However, this feeling of his gradually disappears as the series goes on and Rei gradually begins to show more emotions and learns to be more considerate of others especially to the Kawamoto family and his fellow shogi players willing to help them when they need it. This is best shown during the summer festival when Rei decided to help them with their shop stand something that the old Rei would not have done. The character of Rei I felt was an interesting character that as a result of not just this season but also the previous season had a lot of good development that had the effect of improving his character\u2019s personality substantially which I felt made great use of the theme of changing yourself as you learn to experience life and bond with others. Seeing Rei gradually turn from a quiet and withdrawn person who had few friends to someone that was not just positive but also more assertive and willing to help his friends and allies I thought was one of the best things in this series. I thought that his voice actor Kengo Kawanishi did an excellent job at portraying the character of Rei. \\n\\n\r\nAkari \\n\\n\r\nAkari Kawamoto voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kayano of Anohana and Guilty Crown fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the eldest of the Kawamoto sisters. A young woman in her early twenties Akari is a kind, caring and positive young woman that\u2019s also considerate and understanding towards others.  On the surface, Akari is a responsible and determined person that does all she can to support her family and in this can easily be mistaken to be a mother were one not to know that she has two younger sisters. While kind and caring Akari is also someone that is also perceptive and is easily able to tell if something is bothering someone but rather than confront them about it is someone that prefers to let the person take their time and tell her themselves when they are ready to do so showing how considerate Akari can be. While level headed and not one that will let her emotions get the best of her, for the most part, it is shown that Akari is someone that has quite the vivid imagination and able to come up with various ideas and scenarios that are not just off topic but also amusingly funny.  While calm and composed for the most part Akari can be surprisingly forceful if someone that she cares about doesn\u2019t listen to her advice a side of her that\u2019s pretty surprising.  \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on it can be seen that beneath her positive and caring surface personality Akari is also someone that has many struggles that she hides behind her surface facade. While its obvious that Akari cares deeply about her sisters, family and Rei it can be seen that Akari is someone that regrets deeply that there is a limit to what she can do to help them. While outwardly a very dependable and mentally strong person it can be seen that beneath this Akari is someone that also has a fragile side to her personality as well which comes from the heavy responsibility that was given to her after the passing of her mother. This fragile side to her of her that comes from her heavy responsibility can be seen to cause a great deal of worry for Akari when she has time to realise it. In line with this worry is one of Akari\u2019s greatest fear which is the fact that despite being the elder sister of the family she might not be able to represent her sisters well when they need her the most something that can be seen to scare her a great deal. This side of her personality I felt was an interesting one as it contrasted a great deal with the kind, calm and confident Akari that I have become accustomed to seeing. However, as the series goes on and Akari got to see the pain that Hinata went through as a result of the troubles that beset her the hesitation that bounded Akari were gradually released and Akari become braver and more determined to protect Hina as not just her sister but her guardian as well and in doing so confront the true culprit that caused her sisters pain. The character of Akari while an effective character back in the first season I thought become a much more effective character this season as a result of the revelation that even someone as perfect as her who seemed at first to have boundless confidence can also be hiding many issues and fears that show that she too is but a human being. The insight into Akari\u2019s backstory and the heavy responsibility that she had inherited from her mother I felt only served to enhance her character and was further reinforced by the fears and challenges that she had to overcome this season in order to protect those that are dear to her. I felt that her seiyuu Ai Kayano really did an excellent job at portraying the character of Akari. \\n\\n\r\nHinata \\n\\n\r\nHinata Kawamoto voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Kana Hanazawa of Psycho-Pass and the irregular at magic high school fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the second oldest of the Kawamoto sisters. A 15-year-old junior high school student Hinata is a positive, happy and energetic girl that while somewhat shy is also a brave and determined person by nature. While a happy and go lucky person by nature Hinata is also someone that is kind and understanding and shown to be both perceptive and understanding of the feelings of others. While a positive and happy person by nature Hinata is someone that can be seen to have a stubborn side to her as well and is someone that is noted to be determined to finish things that she already started no matter how hard that task proves to be something that is best shown in her arc when she tries to defend her friend. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and we get to see more of Hina\u2019s personality it can be seen that beneath her positive and happy attitude that she displays to others Hinata is someone that is emotionally fragile and as a result often hides her true feelings behind a wall that she even hides from her own family out of consideration from them. This facet of her personality is best seen in her specific arc in this season which detailed the struggle that Hinata experienced when in school. While emotionally fragile in the beginning a fact that was exploited by the bullies as a result of the interventions of not just Rei but also Akari and the head teacher of Hinata\u2019s school Hinata was as a result gradually able to overcome the many challenges and regrets that had tied her down and gradually gained both the confidence and determination that she needed to strike back at the bullies and oppose them by persisting in going to school an act that I felt was admirable of her. While managing to end this sad affair on a high note it can be seen that despite this Hinata also feels an immense sense of regret at her failure to protect her friend from them something that was only solved when they were able to meet again months later where she was able to make amends. While somewhat alleviating her sense of regret towards her this chance of being able to make amends also awakened within Hina a determination to help her friend regain her place within society and vowing to never again let fear stop her from helping a friend in need. The character of Hinata I thought was an interesting one that showed that while positive and happy on the outside the emotional pain that one has may not always be visible to others. Hinata\u2019s struggle against the bullies in her arc I thought was well done as it not only reflected the many struggles that students face in school but also that no matter how positive and determined you are emotional pain can still affect you to a degree. Hinata\u2019s gradual overcoming of her pain by opening up herself to her family and friends I thought was well done and matched well with the theme of friendship and family that this series symbolised. I thought that her seiyuu Kana Hanazawa did an excellent job of portraying the character of Hinata.  \\n\\n\r\nTouji Souya \\n\\n\r\nTouji Souya voiced by veteran voice actor Akira Ishida of Gundam Seed and Naruto Shippuden fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Rei\u2019s fellow shogi players being the current Meijin an important titleholder within the world of shogi. Though introduced back in season one the character of Touji Souya wasn\u2019t given much expansion as a character until this season. A young man in his early twenties Souya is a quiet, calm and composed person by nature that on initial appearance actually reminds me of a snow-capped mountain something that was both serene and impenetrable something that I felt matched his personality perfectly. While a very strong player on account of him being the current Mejjin which alongside the title of Ryuo is considered one of the most prestigious titles in shogi Souya was noted to be someone that was somewhat lonely. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and more of Souya\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that Souya is exactly that. His skill with shogi as it is considered to be extremely powerful to the point that there are few opponents that he cannot beat in the game. While no doubt a good thing for those that don\u2019t wish for challengers to their titles it\u2019s noted that this is not something that Souya likes as this makes his career somewhat boring. As a result of this, it can be seen that Souya actually longs to face someone that\u2019s equal to him both in skill and in temperament that can act as his rival and allow him to both enjoy the game and improve his own skill. As a result of their similar personalities, circumstances, and playstyles it can be noted that Souya is very similar to Rei enough in that Souya actually see\u2019s Rei as his rival which in turn is acknowledged by Rei as well.  While a powerful player in Shogi what made Souya actually stand out to me was the fact that in a way Souya actually resembles the past version of Rei that we saw back in the first season when he had few friends and connections and had trouble expressing himself to others. The character of Souya while not a villain per se was an interesting character that showed to Rei and to us viewers that it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best skills at shogi because without friends and allies that you have bonded with playing shogi just wouldn\u2019t be fun. \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nThe animation for 3 gatsu no lion has always been one of its many strong points due to both how clear and funky they are something that is once more seen in this season. This season notably featured a greater number of settings and scenery in the form of covering not just the actions that are happening in the present shogi matches but also whats happening within the mental realm of the players as they consider the motivations and foundations that serve as their strength. Unlike the previous season\u2019s arcs, this season\u2019s arcs focus was more on feelings and emotions that are felt by different characters and in this, I thought that the series did well in portraying this via the use of darker colours and gloomier animation to reflect this as shown in Hinata\u2019s arc. The music for the series I felt was strong with the opening and ending themes doing an especially great job in both welcoming you and in bidding you farewell from Rei\u2019s world. The series OST I thought did a great job of providing support to the series many emotional scenes with music that was appropriate for the feelings that the scene was supposed to invoke. In terms of voice acting, I thought that as a whole the voice cast did an excellent job of portraying their respective characters. In particular, I feel that Ai Kayano, Kana Hanazawa and Kengo Kawanishi deserve special praise as I felt that they did an excellent job of portraying the characters of Akari, Hinata and Rei respectively. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nOverall 3 Gatsu no lion\u2019s second season was an anime that I really enjoyed and built upon the foundations that its first season worked so hard to create. The series strong points in my eyes was its premise, excellent story, strong character development, voice acting and its blending of multiple themes into one that we can all relate too. While the first season of the series focused on Rei breaking out of the shell that was created from his reluctance to make friends and connections with others this season allows us to see the fruits of his labour by giving us the opportunity to see the many changes that have been wrought on to Rei. Within the series this is best shown in Rei slowly becoming aware of the feelings and emotions that people around him experience which had the effect of making him more aware of the bonds that can be forged between people whether these people are friends, acquaintances or opponents in shogi bonds that can be positive ones like that of friendship, comradeship or hostile ones like rivalry.  This look into the emotions and feelings that others feel in the series is not restricted to Rei though as in this season the support characters of Akari and Hinata also get larger roles as part of the main plot that I thought allowed us to see one of the many dangers that school life can bring to the students as well as to the teachers, parents, and guardians of these children. This insight into a common problem of society and its linking into the developments of both Rei and the members of the Kawamoto family I thought was well done as it gave each a valuable experience that will be useful to them. In line with Rei becoming more familiar with these strong feelings and emotions is his development of what could be said to be his first main goal which is his determination to rise even higher in the world of shogi and use what he had learned from his newfound bonds to overcome the weakness and hesitation that had so long constrained his life and caused him to have a slump both in life and in shogi. Seeing him resolve to develop such a goal I thought was a good indication of the development that Rei has been through these past seasons and showed that as a result of the bonds that Rei has made with not just his fellow shogi players but also the Kawamoto family that he has finally found his true self in both life and in shogi. While Rei\u2019s journey to find a place where he can belong to that has people that appreciate the skills that he has continues I feel that the steps that Rei took as he matured as a human being were good ones that only served to make Rei\u2019s goal that much closer.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile Rei and the members of the Kawamoto family were the main characters in this series another aspect of this show that I liked about it was that it also allowed us to look at the struggles that Rei\u2019s fellow shogi players whether they are opponents, friends or acquaintances face as they play shogi. This insight I felt was interesting as these problems are not merely problems that they face during the shogi matches but also personal problems that were unique to the characters themselves as they can include a great variety of themes that serve as their motivations for wanting to play shogi. These include a desire to honour past friends, fulfil promises to thank their fans, wanting to win to prove your strength to your detractors and playing because shogi is your everything. This variety of motivations I thought did a great job of enhancing the large support cast that the series made use off.  Overall 3 gatsu no lion\u2019s second season was a great season that built on the strong foundations that the first season introduced while also continuing to expand and improve Rei\u2019s personality by allowing him to not just meet new people and situations but also allow him to learn about the various feelings and emotions that they may be battling with feelings that Rei himself lacks having never encountered them before. But more than anything seeing Rei gradually break out of his shell as a result of the strong bonds that he forges and seeing him be more assertive in helping others is without a doubt one of the core elements of this anime and one that I enjoyed seeing. Overall as a final score I believe a 10/10 would be one that it rightfully deserves as it brought to mind just how precious bonds between people are and how these bonds can help you overcome any challenge you face in life if you let it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS !!\r\nWhat an amazing experience was watching this 2 season, it improved every aspect of Season 1, plus it was much more shocking than the parts of first season.\r\n(Story = 10/10)\r\nEach part of the story of the characters was much more interesting than the first season and more developed, one of the best was the part of Hinata, knew how to explore the concept of bullyng in a sensational way that had never seen. The part of the championship of the beginners was incredible also, they took many consequences of the 1 season in that part, the Nikaidou was stillfurther exploited on his determination in the shogi by the disease, besides a new character that appeared in the tournament and was very well developed. One of the last parts for me was what surprised me even more. Starting with the Souya part that further humanized the character, in addition to showing a new perspective that shogi is cool, and showed the protagonist that he has a long journey to go through training and experience. Now the part that impressed me most, that was Yanagihara, it was incredible the way they put as is the true weight of carrying the burden of being the most experienced player of Shogi and the most recognized, and even more about a true defeat of a title.\\n\\n\r\n(Characters =  9,5/10)\\n\r\nAs always very well developed, and the new characters very well written, each character taking their moral lesson from the previous season. The conflicts of the new and old characters were much more shocking, thus causing the viewer to worry about them, be it in a shogi duel by title, or by family and school problems, I felt that they really got more alive around the time, besides Kiriyama that showed a great development of experience with the matches of Shogi, besides of handling with the characters around him.\\n\\n\r\n(Art, Animation =   10/10)\\n\r\nThe art of season 1 was already amazing, and season 2 improved even more. They have always represented warm colors like the Kawamoto's house, bringing that good feeling of comfort and happiness, but when the feeling is sad and angry, the colors are cooler, using gray and black very well as in school, or a match of shogi in which the sense of defeat is something inevitable. About the animation is very good and consistent but nothing spectacular.\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Sound = 10/10)\\n\r\nThe soundtrack has remained very good in moments of comedy and other moments of peace and harmony as in the house of the Kawamoto when they are eating. But ost improved greatly in Shogi matches, with very well-done guitar and violin sounds that made the characters' dialogues more impactful in the scenes. And the sounds of pianos were more beautiful impacting the sad scenes more.\\n\\n\r\n(Enjoyment = 8000/10)\\n\r\nOne of the problems of Season 1 is that it was not so shocking in certain parts of the conflict, and I found it a bit dull in some episodes. But in season 2 did not have these problems and improved all aspects like characters, history, art, animation and sound. When I finished the work, I cried a lot because I had just finished a great journey of adventure with these wonderful characters and their conflicts in which they made me reflect as never before, I feel as if I was in the situation with them.\\n\\n\r\n(Overall = 10/10)\\n\r\n3-gatsu in the lion 2nd season renewed my soul, I feel more confident to go on with my life, were many messages that I will take for the rest of my life as an example.",

            "content": "I'll be reviewing this in 2 languages. The first section will be in English and will focus on the 2nd season. The 2nd section will have a brief explanation in Bengali about why you should watch the show generalizing both seasons.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\"How is she doing it? Does she write down her daily activities in a diary and take ideas from different moments in her life to use them in her characters? Is she taking notes from perhaps her favourite works of literature and combining everything she learned into one work? Did she read books on sociology before writing chapters?\" All these thoughts constantly popped up intomy head while I was watching Sangatsu no lion season 2. Because for a work to portray emotions of this much variety and to convey it in some of the easiest and most natural ways possible is truly something amazing. The writer understands what it's like to be a human. In some instances, some of the portrayals might be a little too over the top but I'll come back to that later. What is important is that Sangatsu no lion matters. It can impact people in a positive way. It can remind you of how you used to think in the past, it can deliver comments on how your current way of thinking is wrong and it can be a guideline for what you should do in the future. By all means, Sangatsu no lion, in my opinion, is one of the greatest animes ever made and something that'll stay in the top of my 'favourites list' for now. Since Sangatsu is a show about thought progression and human interaction, I can't talk about this show properly without talking about myself. So I hope you will pardon me for making this a little too much about myself if it is that way by the end of the review. \\n\\n\r\nChanges from Season 1:\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching Sangatsu no lion season 1, I was quite mesmerized. Sangatsu no lion created one of the most awkward and relatable main characters ever in Rei Kiriyama. Through Rei's journey, we remembered what it was like to grow up to be what we are now and for a lot of people it may have been a guide to what they should do next.By no means is 3 gatsu no lion something most people would love to watch. By the time season 1 ended, there were people who loved the show and there were people who didn't like it at all. A lot of people didn't appreciate the transitions the show made from being depressing to being weirdly cheerful from time to time. Although some of that did bother me, the show overwhelmed me with its good sides. After finishing season 1 Rei's development hit a point where he couldn't be the same person he was in season 1. The theme's of depression sorrounding him and his search for an ideal idea inside his heart couldn't be dragged forward too much. This is why I was also worried that season 2 might not be as good as season 1. I was worried that if Sangatsu no lion lost its heartwarming depression (you realizing your themes of depression are understood by another person is often heartwarming) it would be just another show with nothing special going for it. The season takes a few episodes to get going. But ultimately season 2 proves me wrong and goes to a level that far exceeds my expectations. While Rei's development reached a solid point, this season gives time to most of the other characters who required development. Characters like Nikaidou, Hina and Akari get a lot more development as the author explores each of their individual problems/insecurities. While depression and the feeling of relatable content remained, the show added another dimension to its progress. To explain this I need to go back to a quote from another show. I remember my favourite quote in the Psycho-pass series came from the far inferior season 2. Coming from Nobuchika Ginoza it was something like,\\n\r\n\"The shortcut to growing up fast is accepting things the way they are.\" At that point, the line hit me like a truck. It didn't tell me anything new. But it suddenly expressed something I wanted to word for a long time. I finally understood why some of the adults can't understand when I'm trying to tell them about the various concepts I imagine. They grew up and hence forgot what it's like to dream a false hope of being in a different reality. That didn't mean I was okay with that sort of thinking. I do believe people should keep searching things inside of themselves without easily accepting what everyone else finds normal. In a way Sangatsu no lion season 1 was a reflection of my beliefs. Rei knew what the normal things to do and feel would be. Yet he kept searching for a solution that will finally give him the peace he is looking for. He never forced himself to adapt to things just because that's the normal thing to do. He craved for an imaginary sensation he didn't feel before. In a way, he was yet to understand how everything worked and how everyone felt. So he made mistakes along the way to learn things in what I believe to be 'the proper way'. After his development hits a certain point at the end of season 1 and he can accept himself for who he is, the show evolves alongside Rei. Most of the conflicts Rei had in season 1 was mostly the fruit of his own nature of overthinking things. It was a kind of psychological stress that came naturally with the circumstances he had to face while growing up. This applies to Kyoko's problems as well who just grew up to be strange because she didn't accept the direction her life took. This time around the problems revolve around the more apparent ones we have in our society. By the end of season 1, the show already had us accepting things to be the way they are by highlighting all the bright sides that might make living worth it. This time it added another dimension by exploring common social problems and criticizing common social beliefs. It also presented a story of fighting sickness that almost brought me to tears. In a way Sangatsu no lion season 2 advances on the social side of things and goes on to become more than just a story. It finds itself being much more of an inspirational show this time. \\n\r\nAs I pointed out before Rei understands his worth a lot more this season. His transition also adds to the show. Rei's narration is beautifully done. He is slowly developing into a protagonist who would be ideal in anyone's eyes. He still has a long way to go but that's just more reason why the show is beautiful. No matter how much progress you go through it never really is enough. There's always room for more improvement. Through Rei's own self critical self we are reminded of just that. Finding reasons to love doing what you do is important. This is something that gets a lot more light in this season. If you search strongly, you might find yours too. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nIf you think I gave away every theme there is about this show, you are largely mistaken. Sangatsu has at least one unique theme every episode. So the more you search for, the more you get out of this show. As for the main story, I will personally divide the story this season into 4 sections. One will deal with Hina's personal life problems that will last for almost the entirety of the season. One will deal with Nikaidou's sickness that was revealed during season 1. The duration of this might be small but the impact is probably the strongest out of everything the season delivers. The 3rd section is everything shogi related. The 4th section is about adapting with change. Something we get to see at the final few episodes of the season. Sangatsu is more about experiencing the story rather than simply watching or reading it. So without giving away too many spoilers, I will let you experience everything for yourself. \\n\r\nThe shogi in season 2 is as good as season 1 if not better. I'll say it again that the main appeal of Sangatsu no lion is understanding people and understanding yourself. The shogi plays a major role in doing so as well. Unlike most sports/game related shows Sangatsu gives a lot of focus to all the players playing shogi this season. Details of how they had to grow up. their habits, their thought process, their worries-all of these is presented beautifully which helps you understand and be one with the characters by finding similarities with yourself. \\n\r\nRandom quote from episode 2 to explain what I mean,\\n\r\n\u201cEveryone who\u2019s gotten their butts kicked in a title match will always lose their composure for a bit. That\u2019s just how it is. \u2018At this rate, I\u2019ll just lose.\u2019 That is what they realize in between matches of a series. They have to break themselves apart and reconstruct it again from the shattered pieces. They start over from square one.\u201d\\n\r\n This is a perfect example of the show exploring in-game psychology and being able to connect it with other everyday emotions, Portraying the difficulties of what it means to be a professional and what it takes to stay in the game throughout your life.  It's not only the shogi that's getting the focus, but also the human beings playing it.\\n\r\nLike most people, the only thing I didn't like in season 1 was the attempted comedy. I understood why they did it but it wasn't always easy to watch. The comedy in season 2 was a massive improvement. Whenever they made certain scenes a little too melodramatic and cringy they followed it up with heartwarming comedy. Some of these moments might not make you laugh but they do a great job changing the tempo and resetting things to the way we like it. For me, the only way to do comedy right is to keep the lines hidden and make it unpredictable. Sangatsu uses its awkwardness as a tool for comedy this season which makes it much funnier than it's previous season. There's also gimmick comedy that worked well in the form of Noguchi. What also helps is every episode has a perfect balance of comedy and darkness this time. So the series maintains its consistency throughout. This is why I was able to accept the comedy a lot more this time around. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation:\\n\\n\r\nI think I praised what the source material offers quite a lot. The art is just as good as everything else. Characters are drawn beautifully and all of them are well detailed. The environment is used for storytelling and the scenes just take you to another place. But enough of that. Chika Umino did everything well. But portraying a concept such as Sangatsu's in animated form is not an easy thing to do. It can't be like just another show. It has to make the audience experience things the characters are experiencing. The anime wouldn't as good as it is if Studio Shaft didn't do such a remarkable job. The Visual imagery of Sangatsu no lion is just outstanding. The one word to describe it would be 'surreal'. It's like breaking down the real world and creating something that can be molded and painted into whatever you want. Every emotion is highlighted in their own unique ways. During important monologues, the screen shows the face of the character listening/talking/thinking in different angles portraying the shift of emotions as the monologue goes on.  That really draws you into whatever they are saying. Shaft also did a great job making a chapter by chapter adaption which is probably the only right way to adapt this show.\\n\\n\r\nSounds:\\n\\n\r\nNot gonna lie, I'm a guy who is musically open to very few genres. But no matter what Sangatsu no lion does, I seem to like it. It was musical works such as 'Answer' and 'En fermant les yeux' that made me want to watch the show in the first place. I liked all 4 of the openings and endings this season. There's not much to say about the soundtrack. The soundtrack just fits so well with the overall atmosphere. If either one of these attributes were to go wrong it wouldn't be possible to achieve the connection Sangatsu no lion achieves with its audience. The show can make me draw emotions using its music. It can make me feel things with its music and at the end of the day this what music is supposed to do. It is supposed to soothe.It is supposed to connect with the listeners. Full marks to the production team. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\\n\r\nWith season 1 mostly focusing on Rei and Shimada, this season does justice to Akari, Hinata, Nikaidou, Mr. Yanagihara and many more characters. We also learn a little bit more about mysterious meijin Souya who influences Rei a lot this season.\\n\r\nAkari: After the death of her mother and grandmother, Akari had to play the role of a mother figure for Hina and Momo. Her insecurities and worries are portrayed quite well in this season making people empathize with her. She has room for development and judging by what I was given thus far, she will develop into a much stronger character if we get another season.\\n\r\nNikaidou: You understand everything Nikaidou stands for as the season progresses. He didn't get a whole lot of time dedicated to him. But they made the most out of what was.\\n\r\nMr. Yanagihara: Sangatsu produces another lovable character. The episodes dedicated to this old man are simply amazing. It wasn't just old man thought too. Most of us probably think what he thinks already. But this is where we truly understand his pain as he had to carry those thoughts of burden for a long amount of time and still find a reason to be happy everytime.\\n\r\nHinata: Before I talk about Hinata's development this season, I want to talk about something Sangatsu no lion made me realize in its previous season. In those episodes where Rei reveals his lonely school life and how people avoided him and vice versa, I really felt bad about myself. It was the feeling of regret. I also knew children like that who were avoided in class during my primary and middle school days. I somewhat knew I should talk to them but I didn't care quite enough. I was also afraid to be judged by others and thus decided to be a nothing for them just like everyone else. I regret not helping them during those times after watching Sanatsu. Sangatsu never directly told me how wrong I was back then. But Ms. Umino immediately picks up on it and has an arc dedicated to school problems. A that story not only shows us an example of how to fix things but it is also an example of how things can go wrong. Throughout this arc we see the development of Hina as she becomes a fine main female lead for the show. She takes on the role Rei played during last season and keeps everything we loved about season 1 alive at the same time. Rei's own development centers a lot around Hina. Her character keeps growing as you keep on watching the season. \\n\r\nRei: Rei is as lovable as always and it's nice to see him finally enjoy his life. The role he plays is quite different this season. But the guy cannot stop being relatable as always. Rei's voice actor does a phenomenal job once again as Rei's narration inside his head is one of the best things about this show. Rei grows some more this season and gets closer to becoming the person he wants to be in the story and we want to be in real life. \\n\r\nMomo: Momo is the greatest gift anime has given to mankind. \\n\r\nOverall, the characters were really great once again this season. They are what makes Sangatsu no lion so unique in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no lion has this strong descriptive style of writing. It's like even though now you should be able to solve {(12+4)*64-24}/10 in a matter of 10-15 seconds max, it wasn't always the same for you. You probably had to do each operation one at a time when you were a lot younger. Thoughts are a sum of smaller pieces of thoughts. We forget with time that these smaller thoughts will eventually lead to many more larger thoughts. Thus we often bury these insignificant thoughts thinking they won't matter. Sangatsu breaks down those thoughts to a much smaller level with its descriptive monologues. You may think most of it is unnecessary but if you think about it, you realize how significant they are when it comes to the characters feeling what they feel.It tells multiple stories that cohesively deliver strong themes. This is not something you write just to entertain the crowd. You can only write something like that when you are writing down a piece of you. So how enjoyable is Sangatsu no lion season 2? \"If we go by our usual answer of enjoyable = entertaining that it probably isn't the most enjoyable show. If we look beyond that, it is a very enjoyable show as you experience how thoughts can be conveyed and learn a few things about writing yourself alongside some very heartwarming in-story content.\" I said something like that during last season but this season actually had a fair amount of entertaining content. So it is very enjoyable both ways.\\n\\n\r\nFavourite Quote:\\n\r\n\u201cGaining and losing things are an unavoidable part of life for everybody. You feel joy, you feel disappointment and it repeats. And that\u2019s how you learn how to handle your feelings. Disappointment and loneliness are necessary emotions. Because of loneliness people muster courage and reach out to a new world. Doing that is like reaching out as a baby does, and expands it\u2019s small world.\u201d\\n\r\n-Eisaku Noguchi \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Sangatsu was written in 2007 and this is why a lot of the approaches are old. For example, I know people will complain about things like \"Why isn't that girl just talking to her friend over the phone.\" I have read complains like this already. But when you consider the time it was written I'm sure most of these things will make sense. There's not much more I can say about it. It might make you smile, it might make you cry and it will give you cooking lessons. I like everything about the show and I can make everything they did seem like a likable thing because this is exactly how it was to me. Hopefully, this will be exactly the same for a lot more people yet to watch this show. I'd be pretty proud of myself If I could apply everything I've learned/got reminded of by watching Sangatsu in real life. Therefore, I would strongly recommend everyone to give this show a shot and to see if you can get something out of it.  Thank you Chika Umino and Shaft for giving us a 'slice of life' in quite a literal form.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n3 Gatsu no

I have never seen such a beautiful and deep story as unique as 3-gatsu no Lion.\r\n1: Story Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\r\nThe story of Rei Kiriyama's journey and past are presented with extreme care. And with Hina's arc in this season, it beautifully captivates the audience with an excellent flow of story progression and quality. No complaints here.\r\n2: Art Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\r\nOh man, how can I describe the art? It's jaw-dropping. It flows perfectlywith the various feelings our characters go through (anxiety, fear, joy, etc.) and handles it extremely well.\\n\\n\r\n3: Sound Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nThe OP/ED's are catchy, the various piano OST's used in the emotional scenes fit perfectly, as well as the other ones used during comedic scenes. I loved every bit of music down to even the accurate nature sound effects!\\n\\n\r\n4: Character Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nWith such a huge cast of characters, each of them feel unique and entertaining in their own way. The way they are portrayed demonstrates a high level of execution behalf on the writers part. I feel the writers really understood how to handle accurate thoughts of individuals feelings (fear, anxiety) which is rare of this quality.\\n\\n\r\n5: Enjoyment Score -> 10 (Outstanding)\\n\r\nEvery time I took the time to sit down and watch an episode of 3-gatsu no Lion, a smile was put on my face. I thoroughly enjoyed this show and everything it had to offer.\\n\\n\r\n|-_-_-_-> Final Score: 10/10 (OUTSTANDING) <-_-_-_-|\\n\\n\r\nThis is a series you MUST watch. I can guarantee you will enjoy it if you open yourself up and just give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nExtra Thoughts:\\n\r\n-> Is this the end of the show entirely? I hope not. Judging by the ending and how popular this show was, I can definitely see a third season on its way. I just wanna see both Hina and Rei going to school together ;-;\\n\\n\r\n-> There are so many lovable characters but one I adore a lot is the three sisters and Someji. I love how they support each other no matter what!\\n\\n\r\n-> I wish he had more Souya moments with Rei. We had those couple of episodes with them spending a bit of time together but I wish Souya had just a tad bit more screen time. Even if he's just a supporting character, he plays a big role as the current meijin!\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! :D \\>.</",

The themes of each arc in the anime,especially the second season is brilliant and sometimes too real. The characters are lovable, the production style is artistic and the voice acting is damn good.  The heartwarming parts of the anime are really heartwarming. Some of its episodes are really inspiring,especially the last episode. Sangatsu is not an anime about shogi, its an anime that has a MC whose job is a pro shogi player. Its not a sports anime but a realistic drama anime and areally good one. The three sisters together are some of the most hearwarming and lovable characters.\\n\\n\r\nMy Overall Rating :  9.3/10.0",

            "content": "There's something special to said about a show that gives you not only sympathy for the characters, but also a torrent of emotions and feelings when watching.\u00a0 Despite its cult-like status as a hidden gem that doesn't get talked about, Shaft was still managed to create a worthy sequel of the story of Rei Kiriyama.\u00a0 (Honestly, the analytics are kind of boring, so I'd suggest you just skip to the 'Personal Enjoyment' section.)\r\nStory:\r\nWe return back to March Town, following the story of Rei Kiriyama as his story comes to fruition after digging himself out of the hole he's found himself in for years, turning itsattention to how he's able to help, and give back to those that have given him the support he's wanted and needed for years.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest and most obvious part about this season is that the story is not centered around Rei, which is something I see as a detriment to the series.\u00a0 He's the main character, and the main character should have the brunt of the story or at least have a major hand in most of it.\u00a0 As a result of this change, Rei is relegated mostly to a\u00a0deuteragonist role, often times bouncing in and out of the story's focus where he's either on the main stage, or accompanies someone else who has the spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn't help that there're a number of characters that don't ever get their stories finished, and instead get loose ends or are stopped halfway without much development or time left to them.\u00a0 Kyouko is the biggest culprit of this, and it's honestly a shame considering how the previous season built her up to be an antagonistic and bittersweet character towards Rei, and that hardly got touched upon, which I find odd considering she had a story that existed prior to the series, so having that just vanish in thin air in place of a different character who before his time in the spotlight was just a side character is disappointing to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nBut rather than what could've been, what the series is is a show of raw human emotion that feels both genuine and impactful.\u00a0 The show explores into the various lives and struggles of various other characters, some closer to Rei, others not, providing a broad spectrum that tackles very real personal problems; bullying, expectations, sickness, depression.\u00a0 The portrayal of these themes through its characters is a gut-wrenching adventure that doesn't let up till its end, gripping the audience through Shinbou's visual storytelling that leaves the viewer with a mix of random feelings of emotions.\\n\\n\r\nBy the end of it, 3-gatsu is a whirlwind of emotions that tells the stories of the people of March Town, detailing their hardships and their willingness to break through their problems, fighting tooth and nail through tears and anger, sorrow and sickness, to find themselves in the world that they want to be a part of.\u00a0 It's a beautiful journey that despite not primarily featuring its main character, makes up in spades with amazing characterization for the parties involved.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ True, raw, human emotion\\n\r\n+ Compelling stories\\n\r\n-\u00a0 I honestly wish Rei was more involved\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nRei really only the tail end of everything.\u00a0 Much of his story is in Season 1, so much of his role this time is to be on the sidelines supporting or helping those close to him in need.\u00a0 Again, I wish he was more involved or the center for even a little bit tackling some other stories, but what we get from him is the culmination of everything he has been working towards.\u00a0 The changes are subtle among other things, but the noticeable change in his character brings him into another light that truly feels like he has found himself on the right path, an aspect of the show that seems to still be progressing even beyond his story has finished.\\n\\n\r\nBut apart from him, characters like Hina, the middle child of the Kawamoto sisters, and the meijin of the shogi world, Touji Souya, take the spotlight in their own sections of the series, telling their stories through the parts dedicated to them in fashion similar to how Rei's story unfolds.\u00a0 As per usual with how character driven stories go, there's a clear imbalance to how much weight each of these characters hold, with Hina especially getting a buildup before it hits you hard right in the middle of the show, punching you emotionally without letting up until you finish the episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+\u00a0 Great character-based stories\\n\r\n+/- Rei kinda gets sidelined\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Imbalance in story importance\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nShaft.\u00a0 Shaft, Shaft, Shaft.\u00a0 I've stated before that Shaft is the one production company that I have a problem with due to Akiyuki Shinbou's overwhelming presence in the company as its primary director causing me grief because his style of visual storytelling often leaves me scratching my head because I for the life of me cannot understand nor are willing to understand the kind of shit the guy pulls off, especially in the Monogatari series.\\n\\n\r\nBut honestly, this is the one show that I can say with certainty would be incomplete without his touch.\u00a0 The visual metaphors do nothing more but complete the experience.\u00a0 There are things about animation that you can't do anywhere else, and one of those is to convey a person's emotion in outlandish ways.\u00a0 Everything about the style from this show; its use of colors contrasting from dramatic black and white to bright and fluffy colors, the distortion of anatomy when someone is distressed, and the blankness of eyes from lack of empathy and emotion.\u00a0 These little details make the show, and I give Shinbou and his team all the respect I have for bringing this series to life the way that they did despite the flack I give him for some of his other projects.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Shaft just makes this show.\u00a0 No questions about it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I'm gonna say this outright, nothing can beat Bump of Chicken.\u00a0 The band wrote the songs used in as the OP and ED of the first season as homages to the series as fans.\u00a0 The power and emotion in their songs is something that personally I don't think can be outmatched.\\n\\n\r\nAs a result of this, both sets of OPs and EDs in season two really just aren't great in my opinion.\u00a0 For such an emotional show, having similar pieces that lead into something that sounds happy go lucky where in scene we physically see the struggles and despair of characters like Hina and Nikaido, I'm sorry, but it just doesn't do it for me.\u00a0 They're good on their own, but tacking them onto 3-gatsu is not really doing it for me.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n3-gatsu is definitely a show that places near the top of the list for me.\u00a0 To be honest, most of what I wrote above is rubbish; really just a formality to give the show the equal analytics I give every show I review.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is something you watch for the experience.\u00a0 You watch it for the characters, the stories, the emotion and gut-wrenching struggles of it all as the people in it give their all to achieve something meaningful in their lives.\u00a0 The show has very high highs and very low lows, a veritable rollercoaster of emotion as issues like bullying are shown with the painful truth.\u00a0 Episodes twelve and thirteen will forever stay as two of my favorite episodes of anime period.\u00a0 I was so enthralled watching it, struggling with my own emotions as I had my own emotions played with, eyes glued to the screen the whole time.\u00a0 Bar none some of the closest things to perfection in anime that I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nShows like these are things that I hate putting under the analytic scope.\u00a0 I find that it devalues them by telling others what the show could be rather than what the show actually is.\u00a0 And that by doing so, I sour my own experience by meticulously nitpicking at everything that's bad so I can separate it by saying what the show succeeds in doing and what it didn't do.\u00a0 It's for these reasons that the show get my recommendation to watch it.\u00a0 Just watch it.\u00a0 Season one, season two, all of it, start to finish.\u00a0 Rarely does a show portray life in the manner that 3-gatsu does, and even rarer does the show ever scream the word 'human', and all that it entails in trying to succeed in life and find a way to fulfill the gaps that we or others leave in our hearts.\u00a0 Cause really I just want more people to experience this show and give it the attention that it deserves.",

            "content": "10/10!\r\nI am going to sum up this anime in one simple, profound word: Masterpiece. \r\nI thought the first season was great, but the second season was absolutely phenomenal. As someone mentioned before, this anime seems to be about a Shogi player trying his best to become excellent at this game-but it's so, so, so much more than that. You see this young man trying to discover who he fundamentally is as a person and struggling with his past demons. Learning that it's okay to trust people and feel like he belongs somewhere. You see his friends and even \"frenemies\" around him face their own strugglesand learn to overcome them...and it's more than just the words they say, the animation shows itself in a beautiful, symbolic way....you can almost \"see\" what they are feeling and going through...and that with the monologues the characters have, and their interactions with one another...you feel what they are going through. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the many amazing topics the creator covered in extremely powerful way is bullying in school. This arc touched me more personally than almost any other arc in any other anime. I was bullied badly, especially in Middle School. This hit home...hard. And how they handled sharing this story was so accurate. \\n\\n\r\nI won't go any further, because I don't want to accidentally give away any spoilers. But please, give this wonderful show a try. I promise you won't be disappointed!",

It hit close to home the moment I realized that. I had also lost something last year, but slowly but surely I managed to recover and gain something even bigger. \r\nI suddenly felt like Rei, how he wanted to protect the thing he had gained and how he could lose it at any moment.\r\nI found myself crying in mostepisodes, which I didn't at all during the first season because I now felt every emotion that the show wanted to convey. Don't get me wrong, I adored the first season while it was airing, but I wasn't anxiously waiting for each episode to come out every week until it ended and watching it the same day it aired. I was hooked the moment the first episode of the second season aired, and by episode 4, I was forever in love.\\n\\n\r\nIn the more objective department: every single thing this show wants to convey, it completely succeeds on every level, from the masterful arc that starts this season to the one centered on one of the older characters. \\n\r\nIt's also a joy to look at and listen, the team behind did an amazing work in showing emotion with only animation and music. Every single character has something to them that makes them either hateable or loveable (mostly the latter) as well. Momo is also the cutest, and it's the main reason you should watch this (ok, no, but she's still the cutest)\\n\r\nAnd, when it finished airing, I suddenly didn't feel the void I usually do when something ends, it felt more like the void had been filled nicely and left me with a warm sensation in my chest. \\n\\n\r\nFrom how much I could feel everything this show wanted to convey to the amazing characters, every single thing March comes in like a lion manages is, in my opinion, masterfully done. \\n\\n\r\nNow, let's all wait until the third season is announced!

            "content": "A short review for those that are new to this anime. \r\nThe second season of the highly appreciated anime 3-gatsu no Lion does not continue its former legacy, instead starts a new quest where most of the things you may have enjoyed in the first season are left aside only for the story to advance to a more social feeling. \r\nWhile the first season brought us face to face with the protagonist inner demons and allowed us to see how he faced them while dealing with the problems of a pro shogi player, in the second season everything starts recycling itself through a side character,a character that is over and over again praised as some goddess while doing just a plain fucking thing. Still, we are forced to see how the protagonist sees this character as some sort of salvation to his wounded soul. \\n\r\nThe protagonist family is also ignored while in the first season the protagonist sister seemed to be the storm that always managed to make the audience stand on their tiptoes as she was the materialized form of his inner demons. \\n\r\nThere we some good parts too, of course, but they were fragmented and only slightly extrapolated in comparison with the way the protagonist enlarges his social network. \\n\r\nLastly, at the end we are left with a slightly more ambiguous problem, the romance that seems to have bud between two characters that I couldn't even see one fucking reason to be together if this season didn't force me over and over again to see and accept. \\n\r\nA humiliation for someone who expected to see the protagonist advance along his darkness while slowly dispelling it. A perfect story for anyone who didn't care about the connection between what was supposed to be and what it is.",

            "content": "Sangatsu no Lion needs a third season NOW!\r\nSangatsu no Lion concluded its second season with such force that from now on it makes me wish that a third season was confirmed. If at the end of the first season I said that it had not received enough credit, this time I support it, because Shaft is creating an essential work, an anime jewel.\r\nBased on the manga of Umino Chika, Sangatsu no Lion or 3-gatsu no Lion (March comes in like a Lion), is the story of Kiriyama Rei, a professional Shogi player of 18/19 years. In the first season, Rei was in a place ofdarkness and was taken from it by the sisters Akari, Hina and Momo Kawamoto.\\n\\n\r\nOrphans like him, although they have an aunt and their grandfather, the sisters became the home of the young man in a depression. Since then, Kiriyama not only acquired a new family, but he learned that he was never alone and that he has friends like Harunobu Nikaid\u014d and mentors like Kai Shimada and his ex-teacher Takashi Hayashida.\\n\\n\r\nAnd these are not the only characters who care about Rei, because even the Kouda, the family that adopted him on the death of their parents, appreciate him ... despite their tense relationship.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is a profoundly mundane story, except for the status of Rei of Shogi player. It is a story of daily life, which deals with the theme of depression and loneliness. Its first season was a journey of darkness to light for its protagonist, while this season who suffered the darkness were the Kawamoto sisters, especially Hina. Now it was Kiriyama Rei's turn to support them on their way back to the light and it could not be more inspiring.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAn anime that everyone should see\\n\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion may not be for you. If what you are used to is animes of action and adventure, you will not find any of that here. In the same way if what you appreciate of the anime are the series of science fiction, giant robots, of political subjects, fantasy or intrigue, you will not have what you are looking for either. It does not even work like a sports series, because the practice of sports science that is shogi has a secondary role.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not an anime of pretty girls doing cute things, not a harem. It is an authentic pure slice of life, in which there is both drama and comedy, with plenty of space for reflection. Precisely that was one of the points I criticized in the first season, which could abuse those reflective and contemplative moments, but that weakness becomes a strength when the story continues beyond its first 22 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, by continuing to see Sangatsu no Lion, who now has Kenjiro Okada at the direction with Akiyuki Shinbo, the weakness of having an open end is also overcome. The conclusion of this season does not represent a real close, but at least the story ends at a point that clearly ends a story arc.\\n\\n\r\nRei's life changed a lot during this second season, as did the sisters'. Rei finally learned to appreciate his shogi and not to throw his effort to the bottom. That led him to become the rookie champion (players with up to 5th Dan and under 26).\\n\\n\r\nThus, he was able to confront Touji Souya Meijin, his idol, in a friendly game that revealed that the \"God of Shogi\" is much more human than it appeared. For her part, Hina had to face that scourge of society that is bullying. In her case to defend a victim, ended up being subjected to the abuse of a group of classmates. Her attitude towards the problem made Rei not only decide to support her to the ultimate consequences, but he himself was saved by Hina's kindness and willpower.\\n\\n\r\nThe subject of bullying is being dealt with very often in anime lately, in films like \"A Silent Voice\". But in Sangatsu no Lion it does not show itself as severely as in that film. The bullying of the series is far less dangerous, although not less malignant. In this series, now of 44 cumulative episodes, the problem is solved quite easily, in large part thanks to the strength of Hina that despite suffering, does not let it overwhelm.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is an example in this topic and in others, because it has a masterful sensitivity to deal with the different problems it shows. From the health problems of Harunobu to the hard world of professional shogi. This season also followed a subplot about a possible romance for Akari, who met Shimada and Hayashida. It was inevitable, the two thirty year olds were taken by the eldest of the Kawamoto sisters.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, the series covered enough terrain of the manga but it left in the bedroom some of the most exciting arcs and one in particular, that if a third season is done, it will end up catapulting this series to my top 5 of all time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd its merits are not alone in its story, because its art, although perhaps less \"impressive\", has a subtle sensitivity and beauty, which makes it charming. Its animation is not impressive, and in reality it does not need to be, but it effectively uses its resources. Remember, here there is no action, only very human emotions. Its music also does a formidable job in creating and maintaining a very emotional atmosphere, even in moments of humor. It is not a series that makes you laugh out loud, but it does make you smile a lot and it warms your heart. In short, I need more Sangatsu no Lion. It's a real shame that the season is over and definitely, it's an inspiring anime that everyone should see.\\n\\n\r\nHave you not seen it? What the hell are you waiting for?\\n\\n\r\nAnd you guys at Shaft, why do not announce a third season for tomorrow?\\n\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion in its second season continues to build the foundation to be an anime masterpiece. It is already close to a 10 and if a third season comes, I would take it there for sure. It's an anime that you MUST see.\\n\\n\r\n9.5/10.\\n",

            "content": "An excellent follow up to season one of 3-gatsu, Season 2 further develops Rei's struggle to overcome depression by exploring the relationships that he has been developing in his new life. While I felt that the season started rather slow, the speed of the story paralleled (intentionally no doubt) the pace at which Rei is slowly changing his perspective on the world, and coming to grips with his feelings for the friends he has struggled to make. The beautiful music wonderfully highlights the emotional moments of the season, and helps to make the sentimental story-telling extremely poignant. \r\nOverall, the ending of March Comes in Likea Lion encompasses the day-to-day struggles of sadness that one must overcome in life, showing how perseverance can help one to pass through hard times, while also highlighting the lifelong struggle that those fighting against severe depression must go through in order to achieve happiness. Without trivializing either of these two, the show manages to showcase how we all have troubles and problems in life, and how the proper support of family and loved ones is vital to coming out a victor in the end.",

            "content": "Hi, my review is going to be in french because good lord.\r\nque dire! Quel coup de pied dans le ventre. \r\nLe Studio Shaft a vraiment un style d'animation que l'on pourrait qualifier d'exp\u00e9rimental. Parfois, ils ratent royalement leurs coup, mais honn\u00eatement, avec cette adaptation, ils ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9s toutes esp\u00e9rances. J'ai rarement vu un anime qui transcende et met en valeur un manga de mani\u00e8re aussi habile. D\u00e9j\u00e0, la musique est tout simplement g\u00e9niale, avec Bump Of Chicken qui d\u00e9livrent un premier opening/ending et vend du r\u00eave. Le second et troisi\u00e8me opening r\u00e9ussissent l'impensable et sont tout aussi g\u00e9niaux. (mention sp\u00e9ciale au deuxi\u00e8me ending aussi, quiest :x) \u00c9videment, l'animation est \u00e9galement magnifique, et si originale. Tant\u00f4t rappelant une peinture de Van Gogh, tant\u00f4t faisant r\u00e9miniscence au style artistique particulier des dessins du Petit Prince. Bref, un vrai petit bijou d'animation. Connaissant Shaft, j'attendais le moment ou \u00e7a devient too much, ou trop arrogant. Ce n'est jamais venu. Au contraire, cet anime est peut-\u00eatre l'oeuvre la plus humble de ce studio.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nUne des choses que j'ai le plus aim\u00e9 est que Sangatsu no Lion est une histoire tellement gentille, \u00e0 propos d'individus super attachants qui tentent de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ce qu'ils ont perdus longtemps avant le d\u00e9but du r\u00e9cit. Rei Kiriyama est vraiment un MC g\u00e9nial. Je l'ai trouv\u00e9 fascinant d\u00e8s sa premi\u00e8re sc\u00e8ne, ou il s'habillait lourdement, comme si des poids \u00e9taient attach\u00e9s \u00e0 ses membres. Il ne parlait pas, ne souriait pas. Son appartement \u00e9tait vide. Il \u00e9tait seul au monde. On aurait dit que chaque brise manquait de l'emporter. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLe truc, c'est que son personnage est tellement compr\u00e9hensible. On s'est tous un peu senti comme Rei dans nos pires journ\u00e9es. Sauf que pour lui, c'est 100 fois plus difficile. Jongler avec une d\u00e9pression clinique lorsque t'as 17 ans, que tu es tout seul, que tu dois travailler pour payer le loyer d'un appartement ainsi que tes d\u00e9penses personnelles, tout en \u00e9tant aux \u00e9tudes et essayant de g\u00e9rer le stress des comp\u00e9titions par dessus le march\u00e9. Le tout coupl\u00e9 d'une bonne dose de manque de confiance en soi et ce qui semble \u00eatre un sentiment constant que l'on est un poids et une nuisance dans toutes nos interactions sociales. Rajoutons le fait que Rei n'ai manifestement jamais vraiment fait son deuil par rapport \u00e0 la mort de sa famille, et on r\u00e9alise qu'il m\u00e9rite vraiment une m\u00e9daille olympique, ainsi un bon c\u00e2lin. Pauvre gamin. \\n\\n\r\nEt apr\u00e8s, il pense qu'il est nul. ^^ Honn\u00eatement, j'ai envie de le frapper parfois. Mais aussi, lui faire un c\u00e2lin.\\n\\n\r\nEn parlant de d\u00e9pression clinique, Rei semble avoir une panoplie de particularit\u00e9s psychologiques/psychiatriques manifestement non identifi\u00e9es par des professionnels. Plusieurs fois en le voyant d\u00e9crire ses difficult\u00e9s sociales, j'ai pens\u00e9 qu'il avait peut-\u00eatre le syndrome d'Asperger ou une autre forme de trouble autistique. Ce qui m'a titiller vers cette pens\u00e9e, c'est ses aptitudes sociales limit\u00e9s, son manque d\u2019expressions faciales (les enfants de ses souvenirs l'appelaient ''robot''), son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 bien comprendre les sentiments d'autrui, ses obsessions passag\u00e8res avec des sujets en particuliers, etc. Bien qu'a la suite de l'histoire, le personnage s'ouvre davantage, c'est seulement avec les individus auxquels il s'est r\u00e9ellement habitu\u00e9. \\n\\n\r\nEn parlant de Rei qui s'ouvre aux autres, j'ai absolument ador\u00e9 le d\u00e9veloppement du personnage au fil de l'histoire. Le voir lier des liens avec les gens alors qu'il a commenc\u00e9 sans amis, sans famille et sans personne dans sa vie \u00e9tait vraiment beau. Mes moments pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s sont probablement ceux o\u00f9 il d\u00eene ou passe du temps avec les Kawamoto. Momo-chan est tout simplement adorable. Akari est incroyablement gracieuse et admirable, et le courage et la force de caract\u00e8re de Hina me renversent. Toutes les trois sont vraiment attachantes. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, to summarize: \\n\\n\r\nThis show made me want to be kind, to become the best person I could be.\\n\\n\r\nIt made me want to help a stranger, to hug my mother and to forgive past hurts. \\n\\n\r\nKiriyama is such a kind character, I feel for him from the bottom of my heart. His pain is so understandable. \\n\\n\r\nI really really really hope for a third season, and if there isn't one I will never forget Kiriyama Rei and his friends.",

Due to this, he faces an enormous amount of pressure, both from the shogi community and his adoptive family. Seeking independence from his tense home life, hemoves into an apartment in Tokyo. As a 17-year-old living on his own, Rei tends to take poor care of himself, and his reclusive personality ostracizes him from his peers in school and at the shogi hall.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, not long after his arrival in Tokyo, Rei meets Akari, Hinata, and Momo Kawamoto, a trio of sisters living with their grandfather who owns a traditional wagashi shop. Akari, the oldest of the three girls, is determined to combat Rei's loneliness and poorly sustained lifestyle with motherly hospitality. The Kawamoto sisters, coping with past tragedies, also share with Rei a unique familial bond that he has lacked for most of his life. As he struggles to maintain himself physically and mentally through his shogi career, Rei must learn how to interact with others and understand his own complex emotions.\\n\\n\r\n*---------------------------------------------------------------*\\n\r\n*---------------------------------------------------------------*\\n\\n\r\nThere you go MAL with your word limit..",

The show's second season truly is an emotional roller coaster which had me changing from mad to happy, to sad and crying to happy again. Everything feels earned. This show's portrayal surrounding the issue of bullying was brilliant and is something I will recommend toanyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art is, of course, gorgeous, and the songs suite the tone of the show entirely.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I give something a ten, I wholeheartedly have to love the show enough that every time I see an anime fan, it's something I openly recommend as something they should watch with the difference of a ten and a nine being how cavalier I am about recommending it. and season two of Three Gatsu definitely earns that distinction",

            "content": "\"And I, to see what this girl, who despite crying and suffering, never let her will be broken; I swore again to myself... that I would be loyal.\"\r\n~~ENGLISH & ESPA\u00d1OL REVIEW~~ [9,5/10]\r\n3-Gatsu No Lion is together with Haibane Renmei of those unique works on their genre, the well-known 'Slice of Life'.\r\n'3-Gatsu No Lion 2nd Season' takes everything achieved in the first season to the next level, where it assumes a seriousness and enormous impact with all the objective that the message wants to achieve. Where this series could be called a dose of heartbreakingly positive reality may sound weird, but it does.\r\nWithout inquiring much, inthe beginning the series was focused on Rei, but this time we focused on Hina Kawamoto one of the 3 Kawamoto sisters who suffers a serious problem in her school, and doing it is extremely risky, because you risk to the melodrama, the escapism and a lot of possibilities that make it possible that everything will be ruined. But the series makes a huge difference from the beginning, both in the origin of the drama of this arc, in the way in which the protagonists face the problems, in how their actions without leaving the human logic it is very hard to see how hard it is for them face them but are consistent under their own moral, all these aspects could sound in a cold analysis for a subject as delicate as in which the series is focused, but it is extremely important to emphasize them because all this is what makes the characters are extremely human and therefore easy to empathize. All these aspects make the message so powerful and acquire a huge credibility, and all this is further intensified under the monologues of the protagonist, in which we see his evolution and how he finds a concrete goal in life, everything revolving around a game like the 'Shogi'.\\n\\n\r\nWithin the 'Shogi' the theme is curious, because the shogi plays an important role in this series, but in turn deconstructs it in an interesting way, since, far from being a series of confrontations to determine a winner, the series around this game of strategy similar to Chess, it gives importance to more than 20 characters in 22 episodes, a very hard task, but that nevertheless is well achieved, in which it is impossible not to become attached and interested in the stories of these professionals of shogi, and therefore in the protagonist, and therefore, worth the redundancy, in the Kawamoto sisters and the entire close circle of Rei Kiriyama.\\n\\n\r\nIt could be said that in this series several arcs occur at the same time, but the reality is that everything is an arch that leads to multiple character arcs in which they develop in an impeccable manner where each of the characters intensifies their three-dimensionality and they become very human. In addition to this, the subplots derived from the central story have an enormous weight.\\n\\n\r\nSaid the above, 3-Gatsu No Lion 2nd Season is a series with a dark theme, but at no time uses much pale colors or seeks to create a dark environment, as it would not be consistent with the message, and the series knows it to perfection, having artistic moments that could even generate hope in an extremely dramatic moment.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Akiyuki Shinbou or Shaft in general, the technical and artistic section is spectacular as well as being original, where in one scene they occupy almost 5 different techniques to express with greater intensity what happens in said scene. The art in 3-Gatsu No Lion is titanic, it's probably the best art work I've seen in animation in my life without exaggerating, the mix of techniques, the methodical of drawing and painting, as well as the soundtrack that knows how to mix perfectly in each moment, all these things are not superficial at any time and add to a brilliant execution of plot and drama, within the warmth of the daily life of the Slice of Life genre.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\n3-Gatsu No Lion 2nd Season would define it as a reflection of life, that does not remain only in that aspect and extends in the search of the objectives, in the search of ties and face the problems to be a better person, all these things make 3-GNL 2nd Season one of the best anime slice of life events, and that's why I give it a deserved 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.6/10\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nSound/OST: 9.3/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.5/10 = 9/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\n\u00abY yo, al ver a esa chica, que pese a llorar y sufrir, nunca dej\u00f3 que doblegaran su voluntad; jur\u00e9 de nuevo para mi interior... que le ser\u00eda leal.\u00bb\\n\\n\r\n3-Gatsu No Lion es junto a Haibane Renmei de esas obras \u00fanicas en su g\u00e9nero, el conocid\u00edsimo 'Slice of Life'.\\n\\n\r\n'3-Gatsu No Lion 2nd Season' lleva todo lo logrado en la primera temporada al siguiente nivel, donde asume una seriedad e impacto enorme con todo el objetivo que su mensaje quiere lograr. Donde podr\u00eda llamarse a esta serie como una dosis de realidad desgarradoramente positiva, podr\u00e1 sonar raro, pero as\u00ed es. \\n\\n\r\nSin indagar mucho, en un inicio la serie se centr\u00f3 en Rei, pero en esta ocasi\u00f3n nos centramos en Hina Kawamoto una de las 3 hermanas Kawamoto que sufre un serio problema en su escuela, y hacerlo es sumamente arriesgado porque te arriesgas al melodrama, el escapismo y un mont\u00f3n de posibilidades que hacen que posiblemente todo se vaya al traste. Pero la serie marca una enorme diferencia desde el inicio, tanto en el origen del drama de este arco, en la forma en como afrontan los problemas los protagonistas, en como sus acciones sin dejar la l\u00f3gica humana se nota much\u00edsimo lo duro que es para ellos afrontarlos pero son consecuentes bajo su propia moral, todos estos aspectos podr\u00edan sonar en un an\u00e1lisis fr\u00edo para un tema tan delicado como en el cual la serie se afronta, pero es sumamente importante recalcarlos porque todo esto es lo que hace que los personajes sean sumamente humanos y por ende f\u00e1ciles de empatizar. Todos estos aspectos hace que el mensaje sea tan potente y adquiera una credibilidad enorme, y todo esto se intensifica a\u00fan mas bajo los mon\u00f3logos del protagonista, en el cual vemos su evoluci\u00f3n y como encuentra un objetivo concreto en la vida, todo girando en torno a un juego como el 'Shogi'.\\n\\n\r\nDentro del 'Shogi' el tema es curioso, porque el shogi juega un rol importante en esta serie, pero a su vez lo deconstruye de una forma interesante, ya que, lejos de ser una serie de enfrentamientos para determinar a un ganador, la serie en torno a este juego de estrategia similar al Ajedrez, le da importancia a mas de 20 personajes en 22 episodios, una tarea sumamente dura, pero que sin embargo est\u00e1 bien lograda, en el cual es imposible no encari\u00f1arse e interesarse en las historias de estos profesionales de shogi, y por ende en el protagonista, y por ende, valga la redundancia, en las hermanas Kawamoto y todo el c\u00edrculo cercano de Rei Kiriyama.\\n\\n\r\nSe podr\u00eda decir que en esta serie ocurren varios arcos argumentales al mismo tiempo, pero la realidad es que todo es un arco que desemboca en m\u00faltiples arcos de personaje en el cual se desarrollan de una forma impecable donde cada uno de los personajes intensifica su tridimensionalidad y llegan a ser muy humanos. Adem\u00e1s de esto, las subtramas derivadas de la historia central tienen un peso enorme.\\n\\n\r\nDicho lo anterior, 3-Gatsu No Lion 2nd Season es una serie con una tem\u00e1tica oscura, pero en ning\u00fan momento utiliza mucho colores apagados, p\u00e1lidos ni busca crear un entorno oscuro, ya que no ser\u00eda coherente con el mensaje, y la serie lo sabe a la perfecci\u00f3n, teniendo momentos art\u00edsticos que podr\u00edan incluso generar esperanza dentro de un momento sumamente dram\u00e1tico.\\n\\n\r\nComo es de esperar de Akiyuki Shinbou o Shaft en general, el apartado t\u00e9cnico y art\u00edstico es espectacular adem\u00e1s de ser original, donde en una escena ocupan casi 5 t\u00e9cnicas diferentes para expresar con mayor intensidad lo que pasa en dicha escena. El arte en 3-Gatsu No Lion es tit\u00e1nico, es probablemente el mejor trabajo de arte que he visto en la animaci\u00f3n en mi vida sin exagerar, la mezcla de t\u00e9cnicas, lo met\u00f3dico del dibujo y pintado, tanto como la banda sonora que sabe como mezclarse perfectamente en cada momento, todas estas cosas no son superficiales en ning\u00fan momento y se suman a una brillante ejecuci\u00f3n de trama y el drama, dentro de la calidez de la cotidianidad del g\u00e9nero Slice of Life.\\n\\n\r\nConclusi\u00f3n:\\n\\n\r\n3-Gatsu No Lion 2nd Season lo definir\u00eda como una reflexi\u00f3n de la vida, que no se queda solo en dicho aspecto y se extienda en la busqueda de los objetivos, en la busqueda de lazos y afrontar los problemas para ser una mejor persona, todo estas cosas hacen que 3-GNL 2nd Season sea uno de los mejores anime slice of life hechos, y por eso le doy un merecid\u00edsimo 9,5/10.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 9,6/10\\n\r\nArte: 10/10\\n\r\nSonido/OST: 9,3/10\\n\r\nPersonajes: 9,5/10\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 9,5/10 = 9/10",

            "content": "Summary: as perfect in execution as the previous season, 3-Gatsu no Lion is a wonder of the modern slice-of-life anime. A true tour de force.\r\nI am shocked that, despite 44 episodes under its belt, 3-Gatsu no Lion continues to deliver an anime on a different level to the overwhelming majority of shows that have aired in the past few years. There is so much to praise that it's hard to even know where to begin...so I'll go with the tried and tested method.\r\nStory: The source material (I am anime only) must be 100% pure gold to managed to deliver the quality that is this anime.Rei's story, as he comes to terms with his new status within the shogi sphere, as well as his ever increasing involvement with Kawamoto family, is delivered with such finesse and depth of emotion that it sometimes overwhelming.The story winds successfully through several majority story Arcs with themes as diverse as aging, the burden of responsibility and expectations, sickness, bullying, fallen idols. love etc, yet each is handled with such skill that they are all interwoven and highly impactful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The usual cast returns (with very few minor additions) so if you appreciated what you saw in the first season you will not be disappointed. In fact the studio/mangaka takes such great pains to develop on the existing characters that all seem deeper and more realistic than before (with the possible exception of Harunobu).\\n\\n\r\nArt & animation: Somewhat simplistic at times, but nonetheless, delivered in a trade mark style (or I should say,a whole plethora of styles) that works perfectly to highlight the circumstances of whichever scene is then being acted out. I could watch this anime with the sound/subs off and still get a clear sense of the emotions in each scene simply by sight alone.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: Possibly one on the best scored anime of all time. The music is pitch perfect throughout, adding a yet deeper layer of emotion to each scene without ever swamping it. I have a collection of each and every OP & ED for this anime, they are all wonderful.\\n\\n\r\nWatch it......Why aren't you watching it yet!",

            "content": "An absolutely beautiful anime.\r\n(Bear in mind as I write this i am considering both seasons)\r\nWhen I first heard about this anime, I was pretty sceptical to watch it, as I knew nothing about shogi, but after finally finishing it, all I can say is how wrong I was. Everything about this anime is beautifully crafted. I very rarely give shows a 10, because, in my humble opinion, hardly any shows have no notable flaws, but in my honest opinion, this is one of those few. \r\nStory:\r\nWhilst the story of March Comes in Like a Lion is simple, it marvels in this simplicity. I find manyanimes these days need some form of a gimmick to make a story seem fresh, as so many things have been done, but this show needed none of that. Shogi is merely a canvas for this story to be told on, and a great one at that. My one criticism of this story would be that its pacing was a bit slow to start with, hence a score less than 10, but other than pacing the story was directed fantastically. The story was mostly broken into arcs, focusing on different characters and illustrating how they and Kiriyama develop together. I do think the story really improves in the second season, filling each arc with loads of heartfelt emotions, and an actual impact on me.  Another thing to mention is that even though the whole manga hasn't been adapted (if it's even finished), the ending to the second season was honestly very satisfying, something I rarely see from anime based on ongoing manga. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is where March Comes in Like a Lion really shines, throwing a huge rug over any little concerns about the story. Each and every character feels fresh and unique and is given time to develop. Whilst Kiriyama isn't necessarily the most entertaining character to ever be created, he feels entirely genuine and extremely relatable. Kiriyama's emotions are complex and evolving, making him feel like a real person, something I very rarely see in anime. His backstory is elegantly handled in a way that really fits into the current story. Being a child with no real family isn't exactly rare for anime protagonists, but what is rare is how delicately this matter is addressed in the anime. Unlike most anime where the protagonist has no family, either simply to enable them to get up to things no family would ever allow, or as a reason for them to be constantly edgy. Whereas in March Comes in Like a Lion, the way Kiriyama responds to his dark past is nuanced, emotional, and realistic.\\n\\n\r\nEnough about Kiriyama, what about the side characters? Well, they are all handled wonderfully, in my honest opinion. Whilst Nikaido is supposed to be Kiriyam's rival, you still end up rooting for both of them. His enthusiasm is heartwarming, and their chemistry is very entertaining. At first, I thought Nikaido was just going to be that annoying guy who insists they will beat you, but over time he really works his way into your heart, not out of pity but out of admiration. The three sisters are just a wonderful combination of wholesomeness, which is a great refreshment in a show that can get pretty heavy. That said they have their depth too, especially Hina who develops brilliantly in her character arc, as she learns to raise her head high and look forward, thanks to Kiriyama. I do wish Akari got some more time to herself, but obviously, with such a vibrant cast, you cannot possibly give everyone the spotlight. Though even with a little spotlight to her, she still warms your heart, as she tries her best to be essentially Hina and Momo's mother, and in part Kiriyama's too.\\n\\n\r\nNot to forget the fellow shogi players, especially Yanagihara and Shimada, who finish the second season off with a beautifully directed title match. Yanagihara's emotions could be felt with each chip, as he struggles amongst the burden of all his friends who had to quit. I was shocked by how deeply his emotions hit me, like a limp bull charging on. \\n\\n\r\nOverall the characters and how they are developed are what really make this anime shine.\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation:\\n\r\nWhat can I say other than the art and animation for this anime were stunning. Shaft really pulled out all the stops for this production, as it seemed every frame was handled with the utmost care. The art style was simple yet very unique, and even more expressive. Almost every frame felt like it could be a wallpaper, with a vivid but almost oil painting like colour pallet. I've never seen such a simple art style convey so much emotion and in such nuanced ways. And when the face was not enough, these absolutely breathtaking visuals would display them in what could only be described as pieces of art in their own right. One of my favourite ones was the use of the white cloth wrapping around Yanagihara as he steps into the fire, symbolising the weight of his retired friends as he still pushes forward alone. I mean honestly, those frames would deserve their own place in an art gallery. And it ain't just the art that is breathtaking, the actual animation is wonderfully fluid, and smooth. Even simple shots are done with extra finesse, yet still, you could tell how much time and money went those extra special scenes. Honestly, just scenes of Kiriyama sitting in the wind are as beautiful and fluid as the highest budget sakuga scenes in an average production anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI love the soundtrack to this show as well, and whilst it still fits with the theme of simplicity present in most aspects of the show, it is still beautiful and worth listening to. on its own. I probably wouldn't say it is the most unique score I have ever heard, but to say it does its job is an understatement. I am not much of a musical expert, but it definitely fits perfectly at the very least, and really stands out during the key moments.  and The sound effects, voice acting and everything are all stellar as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the hell out of this show, and was frequently amazed by it; thus I give it a perfect 10. Every single aspect of it was handled with such love and care, and delivered so beautifully, that I feel it would be robbing it to give it anything less. I would highly recommend this show, as it not only a wonderful ride of emotions but one that will actually leave a mark on you. This is anime at its best, and probably the best anime I have seen since it aired.  \\n",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews this long. Ever. Well actually, that\u2019s a lie. I write reviews this long all the time since I typically have a lot to say, but usually in a more sporadic, visceral kind of way that lets me burn off all the emotion I\u2019m feeling after finishing a great show. I guess I should say I don\u2019t normally write reviews this organized. In fact, this is my first legit review on this website, but that doesn't mean I'm unfamiliar with proper formatting or editing in general. I just find it more gratifying to pour what I\u2019m feeling on the page regardlessof how messy it might turn out. However, this show motivated me to change that. It\u2019s the only show which has ever hit me so hard in my five years of anime-watching to have finally compelled me share my thoughts online in a delicate, considered form instead of just in sputtered, impassioned deep dives with my friends. Because those thoughts are nearly endless, and not enough people have seen this show for me to share that sensation with. So despite how full of raw, unfettered, possessive emotion talking about this show makes me, I promise I\u2019ll try to convey those feelings while still writing something people can actually read (without spoiling anything). But if you are reading this, be prepared for the perhaps the most fervid and possibly most densely worded review you will ever see, because I can barely even contain myself.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is a perfect show. I say that unironically and without even considering that it could be a subjective idea. It is objective fact. Well, to me anyway. Personal taste aside, this show is a masterpiece to be heralded as one of the greatest works of art of all time in every regard. And I don\u2019t use the term \u201cmasterpiece\u201d lightly here. From it\u2019s story, to it\u2019s characters, animation, directing, and sound, everything about it is perfect. It has perfect visual presentation, perfect production quality, perfect thematic setup, perfect narrative execution, perfect character writing, a perfect conclusive ending, and a perfect sense of originality with not a single cliched slip-up to be seen. It is a peak example of modern animation and storytelling, and quite honestly, Sangatsu no Lion in all of it\u2019s splendor doesn\u2019t deserve to even be compared to the rest of anime in terms of the sheer amount of passion and talent that has gone into its creation. Don't get me wrong, I fucking love anime and consume it almost daily, but compared to the base standard most fans of the medium consider good, great, or even excellent, Sangatsu no Lion is leagues above it, on par with some of the greatest animated works in history. It is on a higher level of artistry. Do I sound pretentious enough yet? Good. Because this show made a cynical hyper-critic like me cry more times from pure cinematic resonance than the critically acclaimed, infinitely nostalgic and universally beloved Avatar: The Last Airbender did, a record that went unbroken for over twelve years of my life. It was that powerful. And to me, that makes this show a big fucking deal.\\n\\n\r\nSangatsu no Lion is truly the whole package like nothing else has been before. With it, Studio Shaft have outdone themselves ten times over, and nearly everyone else in the market. And this is all compounded on top of author Chika Umino\u2019s already phenomenal writing and splendid artwork from the critically celebrated manga. You can intimately feel the pure essence of the hard work that the staff behind the adaptation poured into every ounce of every episode, and the show just oozes with creativity and meaningful intent. It has quite literally the most gorgeously detailed and fluid animation I've ever seen, seemingly unrivaled in all respects and all eras, and some of the most effective and evocative direction ever put to the screen; direction that works with great purpose to give the show its deeply pensive and introspective atmosphere only to then contrast it with equally captivating brighter moments. This combined with an incredibly subtle, yet elaborately moving soundtrack that brims with powerfully cathartic composition allows the show to capture the mood of a scene effortlessly, and rouse even the coldest of hearts to a lingering sense of tender warmth. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, all of this wouldn\u2019t be possible without the previously mentioned efforts of Chika Umino in authoring the most intimately personal tale I think I\u2019ve ever felt, providing every character with such relatable and poignantly portrayed struggles so as to routinely see myself in their shoes regardless of their specific disposition or circumstances. With its keen understanding of our shared human condition, Sangatsu no Lion weaves a heavily compassionate storyline complete with a stirring, lovable, endlessly endearing and dynamic cast of characters each fitted with their own layered personalities and backgrounds. And it is through these characters and their interactions with one another that the show manages to achieve such a striking abundance of touching and dramatic narrative weight. As the characters all battle with issues of identity, purpose, isolation, and belonging and cling to each other for life, they undergo so much intensive and beautiful growth that it tugs at the very nature of my being. This show is empathy in motion. Watching it constantly filled me with such an immense feeling of love and sadness, yet at the same time, imbued me with a tremendous, indescribable joy, like a happiness I'd never known before. It was like my sense of pathos was being continually reshaped and reaffirmed. It took me over a year to completely finish both seasons of Sangatsu no Lion, the reason being that I never wanted that feeling to end, and feared that I may never find it in another show again once it was over.\\n\\n\r\nEverything about Sangatsu no Lion, from the beginning until the end, thematically and visually, is a roller-coaster of strife, solitude, change, growth, comfort, and triumph, and made for legitimately one of the most engaging and enriching stories I have ever had the pleasure to experience. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I ached. I was brought low and I was raised high, paralyzed with dreadful sorrow, lifted with joyous cheer and heartened with tender compassion. And at the end of it all, watching the subtle, quiet, gleeful yet bittersweet resolution to all that had happened to these characters I'd come to cherish and identify with so strongly gave me such elation and contentment as to be impossible to convey with mere words alone. As a person who struggles, loves, wants to be loved, yearns for acceptance and strives for the strength to support those who have supported me, seeing these characters undergo all of those same feelings so acutely and with such clear nuance was entrancing. I got to witness them start out as such damaged and fractured people, endure so many harrowing personal challenges, wrestle and try to reconcile with those challenges, find solace and comfort in one another, come to new understandings of themselves and those they hold dear, and ultimately emerge stronger and brighter people, and it left me completely floored. It was stunning (both thematically and visually), and I was transfixed and utterly speechless the whole time. Bear in mind, it definitely was not an easy journey for me or the characters, but even with all the trials, difficulties and somber moments along the way, we came out the other side with all of our scars, still smiling and pushing forward. And I hope you can too.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I've ever known a work of art quite like Sangatsu no Lion which has so deeply touched my heart, moved me to such profound times of introspection, and found a place within the very soul of my existence. Watching it was a resoundingly poignant and affecting experience for me, one that I will never forget and am sure to carry with me all my life. In this modern era of cheap entertainment, I applaud Studio Shaft and Chika Umino for crafting such an immeasurably heartfelt and evidently passionate work which will forever stand out to me as one of the most breathtaking, impactful and spectacular pieces of artistic media ever made, as well as one of the most uplifting and innately human stories ever told. If you haven't already seen or aren't already watching this show, you aren't just doing yourself a disservice, you're actively missing out on one of the most optically enchanting and emotionally fulfilling experiences you'll ever get the chance to have.",

            "content": "What a truly amazing series. Beautiful is the only way I can describe it. The first season didn't have enough recognition and thus it took me quite some time to notice it. However, I'm really glad this series has finally received the glory it truly deserves.\r\nStory\r\nYou're probably familiar with the story if you've already watched the first season. It continues to follow Rei; a pro Shogi player with a rad haircut and timid personality. \r\nRei is still having his own share of obstacles through his shogi career such as strong opponents or his anxiety during matches with the most being the latter. Unlike the firstseason though, which focused on the challenges Rei faced before starting with Shogi and how his life is in general, this season focuses more on the interaction between Rei and the rest of the cast. Thus, this season has considerably more character development than the first one. Also, the three girls now aren't like the rest of the supporting cast, but are having their own arcs with just as much depth especially Hina. \\n\r\nI loved the first season and I loved this one as well. The story is well presented and, so far, my only complaint about it is the lack of a third season.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI'm glad the art style didn't change since it's more or less the trademark of the series. It's just as beautiful with the colorful, fluffy atmosphere it exudes. It still has warmth, depth and emotional situations. I continued being impressed with Hina's arc and the amount of effort and detail that went through it. Not only the story, the art style somehow felt intended to be used this season with Hina's arc more so than the regular story-line. Those scenic moments with Rei and Hina and the vigorous spirit Hina has made me think the whole series was named after her because she certainly exuded the aura of a lion. You may think of this as an exaggeration, but you'll probably know what I mean once you see it for yourself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development\\n\r\nI've said it once and I'll say it again. This season was a huge up-scale in terms of character development. They've basically given plenty of depth to most characters while significantly reducing Rei's. We're already very familiar with Rei's personality inside out so that doesn't affect his standing as the protagonist in the series. Plus, it's not like he doesn't get enough screen time. It's just that this season he's more of an onlooker. If there's a third season in progress, I hope they continue with this and add more depth to the rest of the characters just like Hina.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nIn simple terms, I enjoyed it. I like the way this series tends to present the story with Rei reading it like a novel. The characters showing multiple sides of their personality. New characters being introduced and really likable ones at that. And not to mention the usual comedy that just slips in-between throughout the whole season. Though there have been many subtle implications about possible ships, I don't know if such a thing would actually happen. I mean, I can't imagine how any of those ships would look like within the style of this anime and I'm afraid it would drop its quality so I guess its just fine with them implicitly mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: If you liked season one even if just a little, then you're probably going to like this season just as much or even more. This anime is really warm and soothing you could use it as a heater, but it's quite slow paced which is to be expected from a chess-like game so that's something to look out for. It's a relaxing piece that feels like literature and I surely recommend it if you're a slice of life fan who's bored of the high school clich\u00e9 setting.",

The problem for me with the first season was the long shogi parts and the rushed end but I th\u00ednk all this reasons are just really subjective.

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion's second season manages to top its outstanding first season through convincing characters and a beautiful narrative combined with the stunning use of music and visuals. \r\nThe show decisively moves from the utter and unimpeded focus on Rei, our main character, and onto the supporting cast that helped lift Rei from his melancholy and self-destructive lifestyle. \r\nCharacters that could have been left as poorly developed tropes are instead given their own arcs, from Souya to Shimada and even Saku was fleshed out and made this show extremely realistic and enjoyable to watch. To put it simply, each character felt as if they couldstep out of the screen and exist in the real world, they all have their own faults and regrets that make them human but at their core are great people that helped Rei become a better person\\n\\n\r\nStudio SHAFT wastes no time in displaying their full technical prowess in their refined character art style conveying complex emotions to simple comedic bits and detailed, stylistic backgrounds. The music is fantastic, tracks played at perfect moments to amplify emotion and the OP/ED are great to listen to as well.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the focus may be off of Rei, the show manages to subtly push his development along with the rest of the cast. The scene where Rei is laughing with his schoolmates and teacher struck me as a major indicator of his shift in character, and his assistance with Hina's problem highlights that he has matured enough that he is now helping people. This heavily differs from the start of the show in the first season where he had to be taken care of by the Kawamoto family because he had even failed to take care of himself. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, 3-gatsu no Lion's second season is a marvel to behold, a joy to watch, and a masterpiece to be regarded for the ages",

            "content": "This review was written after completing season 2 of the show but also covers season 1.\r\nFirst of all, I would like to clarify that this review might be strongly biased. I was going through tough times myself when the show was airing, and the show dealt with some of the problems I was going through and in some ways, helped me overcome them.\r\nIf you're just reading reviews, because you're unsure whether or not you should watch this show, watch it now. You can thank me later.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst and foremost, this show is about one thing; love.\r\nNot only the romantic kind of love but familial love. Thekind of love that can change the person the most, the kind of love that motivates you, because you don't feel like you deserve it, the kind of love that gives you hope for the future, and also the kind of love that frightens you. What would become of you, if that love suddenly, disappeared?\\n\r\nWithout getting too much into spoiler territory, the show deals with a vast array of problems, with a focus on mental health. The show shows a realistic representation of how people actually act in difficult situations, and how depression and other mental health issues can be different from person to person. Noone suffers in the same way, and that's an important lesson we could all learn from.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in this show is beautiful. With shocking realism at times, and other times very stylised. The show uses its art to convey the emotions of the story. If the story takes a dark turn, so does the art, and if the story lightens up, so does the art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nMuch like the art of the show, the music is also extremely well made and fits always perfectly with the situation happening on screen. The music itself sometimes had me in tears.\\n\r\nThe acting was also some of the best I have ever experienced. Especially Rei Kiriyama and Hinata Kawamoto (played by Kengo Kawanishi and Kana Hanazawa respectively), connected with me in ways few characters have ever done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI love every character in this show. Everyone was given reasoning for their actions and all of them seemed like people. Even the ones who seemed evil at first were shown to have insecurities of their own. This show did a fantastic job of showing why people act the way they do, why people sometimes do terrible things because they are feeling trapped or unloved. There is always reasoning behind a person's actions even if their actions go against whats commonly deemed acceptable, whether or not that justifies their actions, I don't know. It just makes them more human and makes you feel empathy for them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhile watching this show, it was not uncommon for me to reach for a pack of tissues. Emotionally this show connected with me in so many ways, and it often brought me to tears. Seeing the final episode of season 2 was heartbreaking, and I pray more of it will come.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI think this show is a must-watch for everyone who loves anime. Especially if you're going through tough times.",

            "content": "Season two of Sangatsu no Lion manages to maintain the brilliant art, sound, and characters of season one while taking the story to a whole new level. From bullying, school life, retirement, and loneliness, no show I have seen is more realistic and down to earth than the second season of Sangastu, which is why it has quickly become my favorite show ever. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe bullying arc that takes up the majority of the second season is a true masterpiece. It shows every aspect of bullying and the impact it has not just on the person being bullied but those around them. It depicts aCatch-22 in trying to stop bullying. Either you be a \"bystander\" and allow terrible things to occur, or you stand up for the person and risk being bullied yourself. This is the most realistic bullying story in my opinion that puts the viewer in an emotional roller coaster of hate, anger, love, and ultimately tears. \\n\\n\r\nThe arcs that follow are also extremely well done, as we learn about loneliness and isolation that occurs when one reaches the pinnacle of a certain world. We also experience the struggles of retirement and trying to desperately cling to the life you have left. Even if you can't relate to these stories, the story is so well written that you come to understand and feel for the characters undergoing these experiences. \\n\\n\r\nThe most impressive aspect of the story is that despite the genre being \"game\" it almost feels like you are watching a shonen anime in terms of the character development of the protagonist, Kiriyama Rei. We see him grow as a character through his many interactions, and in turn become a better shogi player (Japanese Chess), similar to how a character in an action anime will become physically stronger in fights. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art direction in season one was fantastic, and season two does not disappoint. The attention to detail, never being lazy, and the beautiful changes in animation from the normal style to funny cartoon like drawings or wallpaper worthy shots make the show very visually pleasing. Never taking a shot lightly, whether it's a pick up shot or a scene with a side character is something that we can all appreciate. And once again, similar to an action anime, the shogi matches are actually interesting to watch even without understanding anything about shogi. The animation in a shogi match is just as visually jaw-dropping as a fight scene from Mob Psycho 100, Naruto, or Hunter x Hunter. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe openings in season one called \"Answer\" and \"Sayonara Bystander\" are both in my top 10 favorite openings. While the openings in season two are not in my opinion quite as good, they still set the tone for the show very well and are great songs in their own right. The OST's (original soundtracks) are still amazing and are even more memorable because of some of the heartwarming or heartbreaking scenes in this season. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of both Hina and Rei is some of the best character development I have ever seen. Rei goes from a character I have always liked to my favorite protagonist in anime, and Hina goes from just one of the sisters to a great primary character. While Rei goes from a child to an independent, Hina goes from a little girl to someone who truly cares about others. \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also bring the story to life. Rei's teacher, club friends, the Kawamoto sisters Grandpa, and Rei's shogi friends all become more and more lovable characters. The hate you feel for certain characters in the bully arc make you love many characters who try to help out and make a difference even more and shows how much courage it takes to not be a bystander. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the story get better in season two, but the character development and comedy enhances the amazing soundtrack and animation even more, making the viewer enjoy every aspect of the show. This is thanks to Shaft paying great attention to every character in the show, every scene, every visual, and every sound. The time and effort put into Sangatsu no Lion is apparent, and now with season two being paired with a great story, it made it my favorite season of any show. Now all that's left to do is wait for season three.",

            "content": "*^* Light spoilers ahead *^*\r\nThe 2nd season of Sangatsu no Lion continues its painfully real portrayal of anxiety with wonderful imagery. Despite tackling a multitude of new subjects, the show doesn't lose much of its lifelike nature. I'm 16 and this show could make me experience anxiety over old age! Many scenes were very dramatic, but not cliche or over the top. I think the narrative strikes an extremely difficult balance to make the scenes feel real while remaining powerful. You really empathize with the characters - actually I find it weird to call them characters at this point - the people! The show alreadyhad a great cast to begin with but they reached new heights with Rei often taking the backseat this season. \\n\\n\r\nNot much is introduced in terms of audiovisuals on top of the first season, which I didn't mind. It was great to begin with and continued to be creative with abstraction. One thing that bothered me was that they didn't pursue some incomplete storylines. The Kawamoto family's past and Rei's relationship with Kyouko largely remain a mystery. I assume there will be a season 3, otherwise I'd be really upset with the ending.\\n\\n\r\nAnother negative was the flow of the show. Whereas the first season's flow was very natural as a whole, this season felt clearly divided into seperate parts with less cohesion. Each 'arc' was powerful but somewhat disconnected. Finally, the 'manga' and 'food' humour continues to be hit-and-miss for me, I wish they'd tone it down sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I thought it was a good follow-up to season 1. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "the second season ...\r\nThe first season - while boasting many heavy themes - brings back to the viewer real emotions, characters and happy interactions, and may shock you with strong emotions. Here is the anime full of black colors, melancholy themes and strong messages - the great emotional ability to take out and build characters and the structure of the story is made to invest the viewer with full force.\r\nIn this season, the focus is more on philosophical, psychological and social issues, and they are studied in a very dark and melancholy mold. Here we are witnessing a deep and heavy experience of excellent art\r\n\u00a0\r\nThestory has an excellent story depth and the structure of the story here depends on three main axes and two sub-sections and two supporting story scenario\\n\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the main axis or track is Karima and his life and his attempt to get rid of the past and try to move forward in the experience of human dramatic deep track the second main is Karima and Shoghi, which is one of the main pillars in the Scenario, which used very well where the logger interact dramatically and humanly in support The structure of the story and the personality of Karima through simulating feelings in directing the excellent third track and the most important is the human dimension, psychological, emotional, dramatic, social and academic in the context of supporting the feelings and dimensions of personal Karima after the trauma in childhood, where he tries hard to move forward, Chasing him in a complex Doanh a series of court drama.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the two sub-tracks, namely Karima and the three sisters, are often dismissed and marginalized from the personal affairs of Krayama and were returned in the first rows when it comes to a radical turning point such as winning a competition or an important event in the life of Karima. This path is used to open psychological themes Philosophical or important issues. At the same time, it serves a person who is generous in tackling the subject of the past, starting an excellent life and increasing the complexities of generous relationships. The second track is a generous relationship with Nikaido Dramya and the Sinnario to further deepen their character\\n\\n\r\nThird, the supporting tracks The story: The first two is a generous relationship with the teacher in the school where the role of the professor here is to reverse the negative feelings in Karima to positive so we can consider the professor is a station that began between the pressures of life and Karima and sometimes the character is used in the comedy really good. The second path of supporting the story is Karima and the main characters, which are partially subdivided into secondary characters after the ark he talks about, such as Shimada and Hada. The track supports psychologically and develops his ability to absorb and give his personality a depth also\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe whole structure of the story in this great anime has been likened to the series of Breknik Badr in terms of the story structure of Gerda focuses on all things main, secondary and secondary and supporting the story and the scenario are all in the service of the hero of the story because in the end is anime is a personal study Karima and about the psychological problem and try to skip it and live For a better way I think each track of the tracks can actually bear an entire anime with deep characters and an excellent script for quality mastery\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe scenario depends on three important elements of each of the weight accepted can not be bombed without it is a secret mastery of the structure of the story here because the pregnancy often on the script and characters and the author took comfort in the structure of the story and extended to multiple paths really important.\\n\\n\r\nThe first element is the Shoghi, which is built on the personality of Karima and the nature of his life after the death of his parents is a very well done snout where this element bore the depth of the story of a clear and dignified life in the form of flash buck The second element of the three sisters Yes Although they consider a minor track, The three sisters are an important pillar in the scenario. The files of a personal study are opened generously in the sisters' house in the approach of this element. The third element is the teacher in the school because he is a motivator and a supportive engine for the story and he is present in many episodes especially before and after the important events.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are excellent, especially Karima, Shimada, and Nikaido. The focus is focused on the rest of the characters, while keeping the quality of the main structures in them. We also wanted to create a dignified personality. It is full of credibility in dialogues, personality, movement, poetry, shape and features, and studying personality dramatically, emotionally and emotionally. And his personality is the depth of my story excellent and great because the story and all tracks and the entire scenario is in the context of weaving personal study Karima is indeed excellent and less excellence whenever we moved to the characters more side, but each character has its shortcomings and strengths and personalities and lives and We look forward to crave knowledge. It is not a single, down-to-earth personality of Kiriyama's life. Even if that means opponents who are really forcing Kiriyama to rethink his actions and push him to think about the right decisions. Especially when personal side conflicts are as harsh as the main character, they appear to be simply human. It is beautiful and I will never forget the characters who studied, not only Kiriyama, but the lessons of life with the developments of personalities and conflicts and in each episode simply composed. We follow our favorite hero of, Kiriyama Rai, while starting a new journey. How his life took a turn and is now facing new things he has never felt before.\\n\r\nHe began to feel welcome, aware of his value, and his character had made minor changes from the beginning. Just seeing Kiriyama putting ideas in others and sharing his life with the sisters is a wonderful sight. There are many scenes like these in the next episodes, even if they are after boring Shoji scenes you have to interact with them at least\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe output is excellent in reversing feelings and supporting characters dramatically to create deep images that dig in memory and sound engineering is also very good. \\n\\n\r\nOver all 9.7",

            "content": "[Opinion | No spoilers]\r\n3-gatsu no Lion is a masterpiece on how animation should be done. Its hard to be unique and create something that hasn't yet been done, simply because of the vast amount of anime that exists. This anime just knows how to present itself in the most beautiful way.\r\nFollowing on from the first season it manages to pull you in and grab your attention, in many ways, through despair or through sheer happiness.\r\nStory:\r\nWhats great about 3-gatsu no Lion is that it doesn't always just focus on the MC. The anime focuses on actual issues within society, and offers a fresh realistic approach toresolve these issues. \\n\\n\r\nUsually many shy away from these issues, or have no answers as they are very sensitive topics. So its refreshing to see how the characters tackle certain issues without being overly dramatic or unrealistic at any point.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound:\\n\\n\r\nThe art just like season one is very unique and beautiful. Dark scenes are expressed very vividly, and happy scenes feel like a bowl of sugar and honey, giving you instant diabetes. Paired along side with the music it creates a filling atmosphere that instantly takes all your attention.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters just like last season feature the cute Kawamoto family, as well as some new characters to keep the anime interesting. The anime does a great job developing characters, and does not slack with visual effects to express what the characters are feeling, which helps you relate to the characters more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis is an excellent series, even the Shogi Association in Japan acknowledges this anime and has posters of it within its HQ. \\n\\n\r\nIt teaches many life lessons. All the people involved within the production of this series should give themselves a pat on the back. I can only sincerely thank them for offering such a great anime within a market that is plagued with rehashed rubbish.",

Each episode makes you wonder what happens next for Rei-chan and the Kawamoto family, wishing the best for all of them. \r\nInitially I didn\u2019t have high hopes for March comes in like a lion, but that was simply because I underestimated the beauty and complications that laid behind the shogi storyline.\r\nThe character development is well done, and you can see how much time passes in the series which by the end of it makes you feel like you've gone over their hurdles with them. Despite all the difficulties,the plot ensures that you become so carried away in their emotions but still manages to hold you tightly to the true meaning of the episode. It has given me faith in some things in life oddly enough.\\n\\n\r\nIt made me see how a simple story about a high-schooler shogi player can bring so much life to a family and how much they\u2019ve helped him too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the series has warmed my heart and will not be forgotten. Thank you March Comes In Like A Lion! <3 \ud83d\ude0a\\n",

            "content": "A beautiful work that pierce through our very heart and emotion. Many other anime titles tried to become a lion king, with a considerable force, impact and spirit. But this anime, unexpectedly (at least, for me), become one with its heart-warming, gentle and deep nature.\r\nWhy this anime is so beautiful? There are many answers for that, but this anime achieved a very high point for the technical qualities as an anime and beyond that, the essence of 3gatsu no Lion title that hits directly in the emotion of people.\r\nSpeaking of technical qualities, it\u2019s pretty good from all aspects \u2013 graphic/art, animation, characterization, storyboard, sounds andmusic, etc. All of them fit this anime pretty well. But there is one thing that i want to emphasize, one thing that came at me unexpectedly \u2013 the style. \\n\\n\r\nUndoubtedly we can feel Shaft\u2019s style in this anime. And i dislike that style in general, similar to my disliking of orange and strawberry. It is not my taste, just that. But in this anime, that style works brilliantly amplifying the nuance of drama, emotion and everything. This style makes this anime\u2019s little detailed things like gesture, expression and emotion able to be emphasized.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s essences, inner-values which 3gatsu no Lion has in a considerable amounts. Each people will say different things about what 3gatsu no Lion talks about. I think all of their reasons are right. This is just a little proof that 3gatsu no Lion is a very deep title and successfully touched many people\u2019s heart with its richness of emotional contents. For me, personally, there\u2019s one thing in this inner-values that i want to emphasize. That is about relatability.\\n\\n\r\nFor some people, if not many, this anime has a very high relatability. This anime presents to us how reality works, in a very natural way. Thus, it\u2019s pretty relatable. \\n\r\nThis anime is not about what we want, instead it\u2019s about what we need. And reality gives us just that in a very mysterious yet precise manner. \\n\r\nWe want our loved ones to stay by our side forever and we take their existence as naturally for granted, but at one point of our life, reality separates us. \\n\r\nWe want to be the best of one thing, of one profession, but reality won\u2019t give us that title unless we spend our day trying and trying, despite our sweat and blood already dried out. It\u2019s reasonable because it\u2019s something that is achieved. We want that title, but we need a strength that equal to the weight of that title.\\n\r\nWe are being kind, polite to other people, facing the world and our life directly, but then people seems to hate us. It\u2019s because seeing us, people are reminded of their own weakness and decide to oppose us instead of their ownselves. Being kind needs to be strong. This, at least for me, really depicts the way reality works.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime definitely came unexpectedly right to our heart, like a lion.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever since Honey and Clover (HachiKuro), I've become addicted to Chica Umino's work. Not only does she create fantastic characters and stories, her sense of humor is \"side-splitting\" class and her art style is full of warmth and dynamism. Every volume of March Comes In Like a Lion that came out made me think, \"If this isn't made into an anime, this publisher is insane.\"\r\nWell, I was cheering when the anime adaptation announcement came out with volume... 10? It's been a while.\r\nAnd Shaft is doing the animation. If it were 10 or 15 years ago I would've had mixed feelings because while Shaft's productions were(and are today) fantastic, in the past they've had problems finishing the animation. Notoriously, they had frozen frames in early broadcasts of Monogatari and Hidamari Sketch, and the aired opening animation of Negima!? was incomplete (the complexity of the finished version made me realize why). Thankfully, Shaft has grown significantly since then, and I would probably have to comb through each frame individually to find even a simple error. Nowadays, I'm completely delighted that Shaft is adapting Umino-sensei's latest saga.\\n\\n\r\nIf season 1 is setting the stage for Rei and the Kawamoto sisters (the overture and opening acts if you would), this is act 2, where some serious drama really starts. This is the first turning point for Rei, and this is when we really start to see him shine as a character.\\n\\n\r\nReading Hina's arc in the manga regularly brought me to tears, and Shaft delivered the anime version masterfully and faithfully. In fact, I struggle to find fault with any element of the production. The visuals are stunning as in season 1 (my mom commented that the backgrounds looked like photographs), the soundtrack is rich with emotion, the acting is superbly directed and performed, every character is detailed and interesting (even the bad guys), and the gags are hilarious. Every moment in both series 1 and 2 is rich with story, even when the audio is silent or has no dialogue-- I've long suspected that there are ex-Gainax staff (or huge fans) working at Shaft, because both studios are/were adept at the use of just audio or just visuals to convey the maximum effect.\\n\\n\r\nIn doing so, the entire production demonstrates that even in excruciating circumstances, indeed, circumstances that regularly drive teenagers to take their own lives, there is light and warmth in the world, and maybe, just maybe, the key to addressing the big problems is to give everyone a place of warmth to call home. And \"Home\" doesn't need to be \"where my biological or adoptive family lives\", but \"someplace where I can always have refuge, where people love me, where they'll face my troubles with me.\" I've learned in HachiKuro never to underestimate Chica Umino's storytelling, because it is always the complete package: Setting, characters, plot, theme. All elements and the artwork are painstakingly and lovingly made.\\n\\n\r\nUp until season 2 I really wasn't that into the theme songs. Bump of Chicken's performances were great, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't until the very last credit roll of season 1 with Umino-sensei's hand-drawn frames that the lyrics finally hit home. And Yuki's 2 openers are good as in Hachikuro, but her singing style isn't really my cup of tea. But series 2 OP2... now we're talking. Unison Square Garden hit that one out of the park. I can play Haru ga Kite Bokura on repeat all day long.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, if they don't do a 3rd series, NHK/Shaft and the manga publisher are insane. The next dramatic arc for Rei and the Kawamoto sisters will be a doozy, and I cannot wait to see it animated.",

            "content": "3-gatsu no Lion 2nd Season\r\n(temporary review; it may contain some spoilers or subjectivity)\r\nIn this season, Kiriyama Rei continued his struggles towards Shogi and personal life and he is starting to open-up on the positive-side of the reality. Based on the prequel, he has this miserable life because he lost his parents and was adopted by another family. Throughout his life, he has bad relationships with his step-siblings because of their inferiority complex towards him because their own biological father preferred Kiriyama more than them, so on and so forth...\r\nWhat I like about this anime, specifically on this season, is that the story revolves more onhis interpersonal relationship that made him more developed and became a stronger person to face the reality. Because of his effort to cherish people around him, he made a lot of friends, created a good relationship, and unknowingly discovered \"intimacy\". Also, one of the good aspect of this anime is that they covered a lot of realistic issues, like bullying: how it happens and how to deal with it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I might dislike about this anime is that the developers ended it with a cliffhanger. Also, some people might not like heavy dialogues or dramatic slife-of-life genre or some side stories that are not related to Shogi, so... \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is proven to be one of the best drama anime out there. It might be underrated or not popular but I'm hoping for another season...\\n\\n\r\n================================\\n\\n\r\nTechnical Score: 9\\n\r\nBias/Personal Score: 10\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9.5 \u2248 10\\n\\n\r\n================================",

            "content": "The best quality this show has to offer to a watcher is how well its able to juxtapose the narrative into what is happening on screen. A large chunk of time of this show is spent trying to convey precisely how a character is feeling which is pivotal in how the story is conveyed with no single idea being completely black and white. The struggle with that is being able to convey a subjective idea that isn't binary but 3-gatsu does it masterfully. The second season picks up from where the first left of and while it feels the same, there's also a noticeablechange in focus from season 1's focus on the main protagonists isolation and depression to season 2's focus on the characters on the sidelines. The show radiates this idea and portrays Rei as getting over his depression by doing this which i find masterful. There are three main arcs with the first being the main draw but the other two carry their weight as well. Each one deals with different themes that are still as relatable as the first seasons morals while showing how Rei has changed since. Each character feels fully fleshed out and are believable enough that they don't give of a feeling of only existing in this story and have lives outside the narrative, which is helped by this being a slice of life show but even then, these characters are much better written then some run of the mill show. The greatest loss that this show suffered was subsequently caused by the same aspect I was praising it for in the beginning. While I found the switch of focus off of Rei to be brilliant, a lot of the first seasons story telling was through the actual game of shogi. Whenever I watch a show that features a sport, I always look to see how the writers use it as a medium for characterization or development of themes. That is what shaft accomplished with the first season. However with the shift away from Rei, it was only logical for the creators to shift away from using Shogi as well which was dissapointing to say the least. It was only featured a bit and not exactly used like it was in the first season. The only other thing that I wanted to make note of was that the soundtrack was solid overall but never had anything that really blew me off my feet. With all that I'm going to give this series a strong 9!",

Moreover, the characters development is really good; both major and minor characters. It is not like season 1 where it really focus more on Rei; it is  more balance with the Kawamoto family, a little of backstory of minor characters and Rei. I find this is more enjoyable compare to season 1. Dogive it a try. At least I loved it!",
