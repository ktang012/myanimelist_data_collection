            "content": "Monster girls to ecchi are like strong characters to shounen. Just like how a shounen anime would feel strange without a cast of muscular fighters and hotheaded heroes, an anime about monster girls would feel insufficient when lacking the presence of slender harpies and buxom centaurs. \r\nBut is it possible for monster girls in anime to be presented as something else other than fetish fuel? What if they possess charm, cuteness, and character worth sympathizing for?\r\nEnter Winter 2017, and Demi-chan wa Kataritai arrives to answer my call.\r\nAt first glance, Demi-chan wa Kataritai seems to be a harmless slice of life with a dash of supernaturalelements. Cute girls? Check. Pleasing visuals? Check. No solid plot whatsoever? Check. All these common tropes are present, so some might simply pass it off as another moe-fest destined for the backlog. But don\u2019t be fooled! Beneath an otherwise generic sounding premise lies an anime consisting of likable characters, great social commentary, and the right dosage of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSince it lacks a distinct plot, Demi-chan wa Kataritai primarily markets itself using an all-lovable cast. In this feat, it really succeeds. You\u2019ll be expecting a trio of BFF schoolgirls, a teacher with hilarious romantic issues, and a biology instructor who looks like Okabe Rintarou twenty years after Steins;Gate ended. The catch? Except for our eccentric teacher protagonist, all the main characters are monster girls\u2014or demi-humans, as the show calls it\u2014of various species.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes these characters entertaining, however, aren\u2019t their abnormalities, but rather their struggles in coping with them to adapt to human society. Hikari is an upbeat vampire girl who quarrels with her sister often because of issues such as placing her blood packs in random places. Machi is a dullahan who feels that her headless presence would forever create tension between her and everyone else. Yuki the snow woman is worried that becoming too close to others would cause them to meet a cold demise. Sakie is a succubus teacher who dresses conservatively from fear of seducing males in her vicinity. Rather than merely being demi-humans for the sake of vanity, the characters of Demi-chan wa Kataritai learn to deal with problems that stem from their irregularities. It\u2019s an interesting formula that always provides each new episode with a fresh perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, how can we forget the protagonist himself? Tetsuo might be the only male and human of the group, but such normalcy only makes him even more intriguing. As both a mentor and father figure to the girls, Tetsuo tasks himself with the mission to discover more about demi-humans by conducting casual interviews with them during recess hours. Some interviews will make you laugh, others will educate you more about the girl\u2019s species, and in few instances, these interviews can bring you warm feelings. Whatever the case, Tetsuo's dynamic conversations with the girls represent the soul of Demi-chan wa Kataritai. \\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the show can sometimes veer dangerously into harem territory whenever the girls show borderline lust for Tetsuo due to the intimacy of the interviews. But since Tetsuo is their sole source of help to cope with human society, how can we blame the poor guy for inviting unwanted attention? Thankfully, this point isn\u2019t major enough to turn the show into a full-blown harem like Monster Musume.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai also surprises its viewers with a good deal of social commentary. Think back to the girls struggling to adapt to school life because of their differences; doesn\u2019t that sound a lot like contemporary issues regarding prejudice? Though Demi-chan wa Kataritai appears to be fluffy on the surface, it\u2019s certainly not afraid to tackle serious matters during certain points. In one episode, a visiting detective named Ugaki discusses with Tetsuo about the state of demi-humans in Japan. Despite being regarded as perpetrators of crimes in the past, says Ugaki, demi-humans have now come so far as to become respected members of the national police force. Another episode involves Tetsuo realizing the struggles of Hikari\u2019s family to make their vampire daughter feel welcome at home\u2014a responsibility that doesn\u2019t burden them even one bit due to their overwhelming love for their daughter. These problems might only be a fleeting extra for most people, but attentive viewers would be quick to draw parallels between these subtle messages and real-life contemporary issues. Small tidbits like this make Demi-chan wa Kataritai an engaging show to just about anyone.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the darker stuff is out of the way, what about the humor? In a time where most slice of life rely too much on their moe factor to produce chuckles from the audience, Demi-chan wa Kataritai thankfully carries a brand of comedy that feels surprisingly genuine. Loudmouthed Hikari is obviously the main perpetrator of laughs, but I also had fun watching Sakie struggle with romantic concepts and Machi being oblivious to non-academic pursuits.  During the second half, however, the show feels somewhat less funny, but that may be due to the story trying to wrap things up for the finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs in Demi-chan wa Kataritai are nothing groundbreaking, but the show\u2019s bright color palette creates a good match with the uplifting nature of the story. The hair color for the girls and the scenery of the backdrops give me the impression of a city version of Non Non Biyori, another slice of slice series which ironically bears many resemblances to Demi-chan wa Kataritai. The OP and ED themes are catchy enough, but what\u2019s most interesting about them are their visuals. For a small treat, pay careful attention to them as you progress through the show.\\n\\n\r\nProving that anime with monster girls can be something different, Demi-chan wa Kataritai marks itself as an endearing slice of life that plays with the not-so-similar elements of cuteness and social issues. Despite being buried underneath this season\u2019s big hitters like KonoSuba S2 and Masamune\u2019s Revenge, Demi-chan wa Kataritai won\u2019t fail to surprise viewers with its interesting take on an otherwise unremarkable premise. \\n\\n\r\nMy only wish now is that I can find a real-life figure like Tetsuo to be my life coach.",

            "content": "Fucking another underrated show of this season that's actually cute, funny, and pretty damn enjoyable to watch. Not a single bit of this anime bores me with its cute and childish ascription on these demi girls action and their way of voice inflection or the way they talk basically. I mean the premise here might resemble to that of monster musume, but the way the story have been going so far is entirely different. And yes, this is a slice to life anime, well im sure you could tell from seeing the cover of this anime. However, another reason that this anime is just greatwould be due to the way the story goes, despite being a slice to life. This anime explores different kinds of trivial and issues that these demi girls may have, while coexisting with humans and how their ability or natural phenomenon of being around humans affects them psychologically, or physically  . Physically as in the arousal of libido drive, or psychologically like fear or being treated differently from the majority, which the majority here would be the humans, and the minority would be the demi. \\n\\n\r\nI personally finds these kind of story intriguing and riveting to see, given that they actually go deeper in human's interaction and the de minimis (wtf is this word lmao) they that carries around. Some of these traits, features, or qualities would then resulted in isolation, avoidance of contact with humans, or awkwardness in a group conversation when the demi tries to get involve which has been shown in the anime. And the way they work those kind of motif to represent the themes of possibly discrimination, isolation due to their identity, and so forth is pretty enthralling to see. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the dialogue at times is pretty deep as well. The anime explores both human's rational behind their bad behavior, or the intention of doing something to harm other out of their inferiority complex and mental weaknesses in confronting them. Or how public appearances are kept a certain way in a specific environment or occupation to act like a person who are in that social position, and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nAnd surprising the animation is pretty good as well. Aside from the pretty lame ass, and generic looking MC of both personality and their character designs (i mean his face kinda reminds me of the MC from gates, the fantasy army vs military one). Even so, you would prolly fall in love with most of the character within this show, despite the MC looking pretty humdrum and bland. Well you will like him too in the long run. \\n\\n\r\nWell but to keep it short, the theme had me digging, the cuteness and the funny kawai desu ne through childish and random cute sounds to weird sounds and its interesting interaction is what make me like this anime, while keep watching for more of its content. But seriously, this anime is so underrated man. I didn't know that this anime was good (I just pick this anime out randomly from the seasonal releases)  until I actually watched it and enjoy it all the way.",

            "content": "\u201cThe warm and fuzzy feelings are strong with this one\u201d - Darth Vader\r\nThis series truly deserves its popularity, because it was so much more than just another generic \u201ccute\u201d anime. I watch a lot of anime regularly and often dislike most moeblob anime, so it\u2019s pretty unusual that I truly enjoyed this series enough to be smiling in excitement when each new episode aired. This is a review without any plot spoilers beyond the first episode. \r\nTLDR/Summary at the end\r\nWhat if rare and terrifying monsters were actually cute teenage girls that attended school ordinarily like humans? At first glance, this anime may seem like justanother ordinary fun \u201ccute girl\u201d series, but there is something special---something much more unique about this series that sets it apart from the others. This anime distinguishes itself by beautifully conveying some of the different social consequences of being a monster or \u201cdemi-human\u201d trying to assimilate into human society, while the series also injects you with a profound dosage of \u201ccuteness\u201d in the process. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nTetsuo Takahashi or \"Takahashi-sensei\" is a male biology teacher who has been fascinated by the biological nature of demi-human for a while. He\u2019s well-respected throughout the school for his warmhearted approach to students, but he\u2019s never actually encountered a demi-human before since they are extremely rare beings. By a huge stroke of plot---I mean luck, four demi-human girls end up in the same school as him. The story begins from there while primarily following Takahashi as he works to understand and help the four of them with their demi-human characteristics in this show\u2019s ordinary school setting. The story shows the struggles of the four demis and their biological characteristics as they live their daily school lives. Afterall, how does a Dullahan, Vampire, Yuki Onna, and Succubus actually even function in ordinary society? Find out by watching the show :)\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the core elements of this story, the story itself was absolutely beautiful thanks to its primary focus being different from just \u201ccute girl\u201d eye candy, unlike many other similar anime. There\u2019s a certain degree of realism to the storyline since the characters develop as you would expect a real person to. This makes the characters more interesting and relatable than anime with generic characters. I appreciated the fact that there was very little fanservice in this anime because I feel that it would take away from the genuine fuzzy warmth of this series. However, I also feel that any fanservice in this series was timed appropriately to fit the anime\u2019s settings. The pacing was pretty good; I didn't feel that this anime was too slow or moved too fast. Also, the light-humor in the series was timed perfectly and hit hard, which made even it more entertaining to watch. While everything in this series was really enjoyable, there weren't really any moments that made me \u201cthink\u201d or \u201cfeel\u201d strongly about something. That quality is what I feel separates a really good series from a great one, so the story can only get a max score of eight from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty damn simple in general. The color scheme is basic, but they used a lot of light and vibrant colors to give a pretty light-hearted mood. There is nothing particularly unique about the art style, but this show did do \u201ccute\u201d really well and, let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s all it really needs anyways. I like the fact that the characters aren\u2019t just \u201ccute\u201d in the sense that they just look like moeblobs with faces. Instead, the characters\u2019 cuteness comes from various hairstyles and facial expression ranges, that were thoroughly expressed through the artstyle. The background art is nothing spectacular and is pretty average, but the 3DCG blended nicely into the backgrounds. The camera angles weren\u2019t really THAT good because of the plentiful amount of stagnant angles, where only the character moves. The animation\u2019s frame-rate is pretty normal for a series like this. Overall, the art is nothing special. However, they did do \u201ccute\u201d rather well, so it deserves a seven to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\r\nThe opening is really good and perfectly sets the mood for the anime. The ending\u2019s pretty generic, but still fits. The background music in this anime is pretty damn unnoticeable except for a few pieces that really stand out. There\u2019s really only one OST from this anime (that I recall) that I would actually enjoy listening to on my spare time. The voice actors/actresses voiced their roles very well, there wasn\u2019t any particularly unique or powerful about their voices but their voices were all pretty mellow and nice to listen to. Overall, the Sound is only slightly better than average, but the perfect opening accounts for the .5 additional I gave it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nI feel that the characters were the strongest point of this series. Takahashi-sensei comes across as a mature older adult who is a genuine person when it comes to helping the \u201cdemis\u201d. He\u2019s a buff science-minded adult who\u2019s kind of like a father-figure to the demi students. The demi girls each have their own unique personality that I truly came to love and appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nYuki comes across as a shy, misunderstood, kind of awkward girl, but she becomes more confident and we see various other fun sides to her personality as the series progresses. She's often the one laughing at jokes in secret and she turned out to be my favorite character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMachi is a very intelligent girl who loves to study and is very humble. She's relatively shy as well but is great when it comes to spoken academic subjects like speeches, unlike Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-Sensei is a pretty awkward 24-year old succubus who's shy mainly because she often strongly attracts people of the opposite gender because of her nature. Her awkwardness is often the source of the comedy relating to her. \\n\\n\r\nHikari is basically an honest, lovable, and lively extroverted girl. She's not smart and not studious. Her personality is very necessary for this story, but I didn\u2019t really see her as anything \"new\" or \"special\" per se. Overall, this series has some really lovable characters; watching them overcome their nature, seeing them grow closer together, and witnessing their group dynamic are probably the most fulfilling aspects of this series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10 \\n\r\nAs I mentioned numerous times throughout this review, I truly enjoyed the entirety of this series this series and actually re-watched some scenes several times!\\n\\n\r\nTLDR (Summary)\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nThis series was an unexpectedly entertaining watch as it followed the biology teacher, Takahashi-sensei, as he helps four girl with their demi-human characteristics. The series surprisingly goes pretty deep into the scientific logic of \"demi-humans\". The art was nothing spectacular, but the vibrancy of the colors helped to set a light-hearted mood for the viewers. The VAs and music were only slightly above average, but the opening set the tone perfectly for the series. The characters were the strongest point of the series because of their diverse, non-archetype personalities also because of the group dynamic that the characters create together. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: would I recommend this to you?\\n\r\nIf you like light-hearted, school, cute girls, and/or fantasy anime, then yes this is a great series to check out.\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a nice non-dramatic story, then sure. \\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for romance, fanservice, super powers, or action, then no. It doesn\u2019t focus on any of those. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision! Let me know if you agree or disagree~",

            "content": "Imagine being a vampire not allowed to sink its fangs into humans, a dullahan that has to carry its head everywhere it goes or a succubus who's occupation forbids sexual temptation. Interviews with monster girls is a social commentary on how difficult - and often scary - it can be to ingratiate oneself into a foreign society. Four Demi-humans have to overcome their own biology for the sake of living in harmony, and it proves to be a difficult adjustment for them to make.\r\nSatou Sakie is convinced she will never have a genuine relationship when every man she touches is reduced to a puddle oflust. The 24 year old succubus lives in total isolation, takes the first and last trains each day, never applies makeup and wears a jumpsuit all to limit the chances of influencing her students and innocent bystanders with her aphrodisiac effect, often to no avail.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kisakabe also struggles with controlling her powers, preemptively isolating herself from others in fear of accidentally freezing them to death. Underneath her cold facade is a personality no different than your usual perverted high school kid, but she's too insecure in her own self control to trust anyone around her. \"\"If I weren't a Demi...I wouldn't feel like this\" whimpered a tearful yuki, who broke down in the hallway after overhearing a mean spirited conversation about her. \\n\\n\r\nMachi Kyouko's head is detached from her own body. She is in CONSTANT need of attention from others around her, much more so than any other Demi, to help assist in basic movement but is painfully shy about asking others to help her. She finds it difficult socializing with those who don't have the same struggles she does. \\n\\n\r\nThe only Demi unconcerned with her nature is the energetic vampire Hikari who is always the center of attention and serves as the source of most comedic moments in the anime. She is often finding herself in mischief and proudly states \"I am, and always have been, just that negligent!\" - much to the chagrin of her younger sister. Despite these flaws, Hikari is a sincerely kind person and sticks up for her friends in times of need. A particularly awesome moment is when she defends Yuki from bullies that were gossiping in the bathroom. I felt like playing a DMX track in the background when she stepped to those girls and exclaimed \"If you want to hang around and badmouth people, you'd better do it where I can't find you\". Hikari also has a subversion to her mythical trope - she loves to eat garlic and can see herself in mirrors just fine.\\n\\n\r\nIt would've been easy to make these characters a carbon copy of their supernatural legends. Instead they're the opposite attempting to live in spite of their oddities. These girls are as lovable can be, but also very sympathetic figures who you're made to root for throughout the anime as you quickly forget that they're monsters, and every bit as normal as the kind hearted teacher who tries his best to help them succeed.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi sensei brings the cast all together. While the biology teacher may look unremarkable, he sincerely cares about helping the Demi's live comfortable lives and stops at nothing to come up with creative solutions to their complex problems. The way that we become excited about a favorite anime getting greenlit for a second season, he does about learning more about the Demi's biology and adding notes to his research.\\n\\n\r\nMachi is infatuated with Takahashi sensei's kindness and gentle approach to helping her adjust to life in a human school. This is sweet, but also uncomfortable when they're decades apart and in a teacher/student relationship. I'm all for a well portrayed forbidden love story (i.e Koi Kaze, segments of Revolutionary Girl Utena) but Interviews With Monster Girls does not establish the proper platform to even tease that development. Sakie on the other hand is a perfect ship for Takahashi. I'm actively rooting for the two to wind up together.\\n\\n\r\nI would've liked to have seen more monster girls. There are so many different legends that can explored in this setting. Imagine a werewolf that has problems with controlling transformations or a siren who refrains from speaking because the dangers of her voice. It also would be cool to see some monster guys. That would be the best avenue to introduce romantic partners for the girls rather than using Takahashi sensei as a harem ringmaster.  It's doubtful this anime will get a second season anytime soon with the manga already being fully adapted, but hopefully the sales from this season encourage the production committee to make a continuation when there's enough material.\\n\\n\r\nAI pictures has taken a lot grief over the past few years for being too formulaic, but Monster Girls is a welcomed addition to a genre that needs more variation than just Moe blob. Cute monster girls doing cute monster girl things is literally all I thought this anime would amount to. Was pleasantly surprised to find a fascinating social commentary using supernatural characters to frame real life issues that all human beings can relate to. \"No two people are the same, are they?\"\\n",

Diving into thefirst episode, I was happy to find the character designs had not been completely butchered and their personalities showed through in the anime much like in the manga.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Story and Characters ~~\\n\r\nAs the title suggests, the main focus on the story revolves around the main character, Takahashi Tetsuo, talking and interacting with the \"'Demis'\" (demi humans), who are beings of folklore, including vampires, dullahans, succubi and yukki onnas. These are the four \"'Demis'\" present in the show, and they serve as the main cast and focus of each episode, exploring their experiences and thoughts living as a \"'Demi'\" in modern society. The episodic nature of the show works to it's favor, allowing it to centre each episode around one of the characters and develop them, however, the series as a whole does not have an overall goal or conclusion it is trying to reach, leaving the show to be more like a slice of life series. The characters are charming and each unique in their own way, their various personalities showcasing how each individual perseveres through their various struggles as a \"'Demi'\". \\n\r\nOverall, a simple structure in terms of story, likeable and charming characters and character growth.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Audio Visuals ~~\\n\r\nThe character designs are faithful to the manga, keeping the cute simplistic designs, carrying over the character charm from the manga. The art is bright and colourful, but the animation is just average. The voice casting was done very well, matching the personalities of the characters. The op and ed are fine, but easily forgetable. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Overall ~~\\n\r\nAn enjoyable fun watch, charming characters, simple art and design. This series does not sexualise the characters, but leaves some small hints of romance and mild comedic ecchi scenes here and there.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Have you ever wanted to meet a vampire? A dullahan? Perhaps a succubus? Biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi did! These beings, several species in a class known as \u201cajin\u201d or \u201cdemi-humans\u201d, shortened to \u201cdemis\u201d, are scarcely seen in society, though four come to attend the same school as Tetsuo! Interviews with Monster Girls is a cute, heartfelt, surprisingly deep comedy that will certainly impress with its lively cast.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy  Interviews with Monster Girls if you\u2026\r\n-- enjoy light-hearted series with a heavy character focus\r\n-- find yourself intrigued by contemporary interpretations of the supernatural\r\n-- seek a \u201cfeel-good\u201d sort of experience\r\nYou may not enjoyInterviews with Monster Girls if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- generally stray from character-centric series wherein the focus are school girls\\n\r\n-- expect the series to be anything similar to Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nInterviews with Monster Girls adapts the ongoing eponymous manga series authored by Japanese mangaka Petos, published under the Kodanasha brand.\\n\\n\r\nTetsuo Takahashi, hereafter referred to as \u201cTakahashi-sensei\u201d or simply \u201cTetsuo\u201d, is a biology teacher who retains an inquisitive fascination for demi-humans, beings very similar to humans yet expressing inhuman and otherwise supernatural characteristics. Historically, they have been viewed with distrust by their mortal counterparts, though contemporary movements and cultural shifts have allowed them to integrate well into society. Even so,  they are exceedingly rare, and few ever have the opportunity to meet such intriguing individuals.\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally enough, three demis come to be students at his Shizaki High School: Hikari Takanashi (a vampire), Kyouko Machi (a dullahan), and Yuki Kusakabe (an ice woman). A fourth demi Sakie Satou (a succubus) is hired to be the newest math teacher. As the series progresses, Tetsuo becomes friends with each of the demis, seeking not only to learn more about them but make their lives and integration into human society more comfortable through a greater understanding of what makes them unique.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a certain range of depth Interviews with Monster Girls explores that truly sets it apart from series within its genre. Heavy topics such as discrimination, adaptation, and fitting-in are discussed thoroughly as Tetsuo\u2019s studies of the demis develop. We come to understand how these otherwise normal girls face issues just by existing in, what is to them, a very foreign world, both in physiological and social terms. While, mostly unfortunately, our world is not populated by these fascinating creatures, there are humans that have suffered from the same issues the demis do, allowing for such a real world application to greatly enrich the merit of the story.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nAs the title suggests, the existence of \u201cmonster girls\u201d or \u201cdemi-humans\u201d indicates the presence of supernatural characteristics, though in small amounts as per the rarity of such beings and their willingness to assimilate human characteristics. While at first glance you may be unsure how beings such as vampires can life safely among their supposed prey in humans, the writers impress well in their justification. Mutations in reproduction are offered as a source of the demis in lieu of otherwise mythological origins, and the supernatural characteristics are explained in creative and believable ways. For instance, the intoxicating effect that succubi have on males is attributed to the production of pheromones or aphrodisiacs. Quantum physics was touched up to describe how a dullahan can exist with his or her head \u201cvisibly\u201d separated from their body. Much of the series concerns itself with Tetsuo\u2019s revelation of \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d demis work, turning it into, at times, somewhat of a pseudo-educational series.\\n\\n\r\nExpanding upon a point made earlier, something important to realize about this series is that it is not, as some may initially assume, Monster Musume-lite. While the two series share many similarities, most notably in the \u201cmonster girls\u201d aspect, Interviews with Monster Girls is not a harem, nor does it engage in a sexual focus you\u2019d come to expect from an ecchi like Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. While topics of sexual origin are occasionally discussed, they are brought up as a result of Tetsuo\u2019s wish to understand the demis physiological nature, not through personal interest of the girls (yes, even Sakie). A certain demi does develop somewhat of a crush on Takahashi-sensei, though it\u2019s understood that such feeling is one-sided, and more as a hormonal reaction to his dedication to make the lives of demis like herself easier.\\n\\n\r\nSince no series is perfect, I want to expand upon something that really holds it back in that, at times, the thematic exposition can often come across to the viewer as either preachy or staged, greatly affecting the otherwise genuine feel of the series. No viewer ever wants to feel as if they\u2019re being lectured to, and unfortunately some scenes give off that vibe. I recall a specific event in an early episode where one of the demis confronts a gossiping duo about their actions, and while the message is important and was received, there could have been better ways to execute the dialogue without having the scene seem like a public service announcement. The best way for a series to convey a thematic message is by not shoving it in your face, as masterful writing indicates an ability to teach without teaching. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the series does not function like the aforementioned, but I can\u2019t deny that there were times where I felt my experience diminish as a result.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few studios out there that are known for always producing consistently quality animation, and A-1 Pictures, much like Kyoto Animation (though subjectively perhaps not to the same extent) is one of them. Interviews with Monster Girls proves no different. The animation is fairly simple, but it\u2019s executed well, and at times there are moments of genuine beauty. I thought that each of the characters were well designed, often accompanied by bright color palettes that not only helped them stand out but greatly underscored their personalities (such as Hikari with the bright yellow and Sakie with the contrasting red-and-purple).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThough the soundtracks of such series rarely offer much impact, you\u2019d be surprised with this one. Interviews with Monster Girls presents itself as a light, cozy anime, and the soundtrack does well to mimic this in the wide usage of soft string instruments. It\u2019s a lot like background noise or elevator music yet without the negative connotations, rather quite the opposite in how it exists behind the scenes yet gracefully adds to the overall engagement.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors across the board performed their respective characters flawlessly, as a seiyuu is as good as they can become their character. Much like their animated forms, how they speak should generally represent their personality in some way, and each character does that fully well. Takahashi-sensei boasts a smooth, deep voice, exemplifying his position as the trustworthy, stable man that he is.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the opening and ending pieces, both are utterly fantastic in their respective roles of initiating and concluding an episode. The opening is particularly creative, introducing each of the demis in a sort of pop-up book style that exudes charm. Over the course of the series, the sequence actually does receive slight changes, making the dynamic nature a nice touch. As for the ending, you receive a very light, introspective progression, with fantastic aesthetics that mimic instances of coloring (or vivifying a blank world, much like the demis do themselves).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThere are five main characters in Interviews with Monster Girls, involving two teachers (Tetsuo and Sakie) and three students (Hikari, Kyouko, and Yuki). Some supporting characters appear and become relevant from time to time, all human, though the focus of the show remains largely on the four demis and our inquisitive main character.\\n\\n\r\nMain character Tetsuo Takahashi, full-time biology teacher, part-time demi-whisperer, is perhaps one of the most likable anime characters in the genre. He\u2019s a big guy, much to the credit of his name, but also has an equally big heart.\\n\\n\r\nHikari Takanashi, not to be confused with Takahashi-sensei, is more or less the primary demi of the series. A vampire that loves garlic, drinks tomato juice, and swelters in the heat, she personifies the hyper, energetic, and friendly schoolgirl image, while also proving extremely altruistic towards her friends. Personally, she was my favorite of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko Machi is one of the four dullahans known to be alive, and the only one that lives in Japan. Polite, intelligent, and shy, Machi, as she as most commonly referred to, is the most reliable yet also most insecure demi of the group. As mentioned before, she also develops a strong attachment to Tetsuo, which itself serves as a cute subplot.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kusakabe is the singular Japanese demi in her nature as a yuki-onna or \u201csnow woman\u201d. She was often accused of being anti-social, though it was more so because of her inability to control her innate abilities in the presence of others. Much like Machi, Yuki is quite both intelligent and shy, though quite loyal to her friends.\\n\\n\r\nSakie Satou, objectively best girl, is the only adult demi present in the series. Though she\u2019s a succubus, and a damn attractive one at that, Sakie goes out of her way to conceal her body, as merely touching her bare skin can activate her aphrodisiac effect. Ironically, Sakie is a hopeless romantic, and seeks nothing more than a genuine relationship with a companion, a struggle seemingly impossible until the arrival of Tetsuo. Though wary of him at first, Sakie grows to develop a crush on our brawny biological buff, as he is the only man that appreciates her for who she is, rather than the effect she has. If you ship relationships at all, you will hardcore root for these two.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, what truly sells the show are the characters. These individuals don\u2019t exist as caricatures of their respective demi identities, rather they grow and develop just as you\u2019d expect a real person to do so, and this trait serves as an immense boon to any series. Each personality is so unique and rich in substance they stand well on their own, and the various interrelationships present help develop a variety of paths to explore.  It\u2019s also worth noting that each character, including Tetsuo, receives a balanced amount of attention, so if you have a favorite (or simply like them all), you\u2019ll be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit disappointing how Interviews with Monster Girls was likely the most slept-on series of Winter 2017, as if it weren\u2019t for the short duration and sparse instances of artificial moralistic dialogue, this series would have been a strong contender for best of season. Combining excellent exposition with an interesting concept and five great main characters, this anime knows how to tug at your heartstrings in all the right ways. Few anime succeed as well at being an uplifting series that will leave you feeling so fantastic and fulfilled following the conclusion, that is, after you recover from it ending. It\u2019s gonna bite, but don\u2019t lose your head over it.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look at things in only one way. You should look from both angles.\u201d\\n\r\n-Tetsuo Takahashi\\n\\n",

            "content": "At one time, I wondered if there are extraterritorial beings out there or something that lives among our society that isn\u2019t entirely human. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all wondered that thought sometimes in our lives right? Needless to say, curiosity can really be a funny thing. In a series like Demi-chan wa Kataritai, there are demi-humans living among society. A male high school biology teacher named Tetsuo Takahashi is fascinated by them and so begins his story in this peculiar yet entertaining tale of monster girls.\r\nBased off of the manga, I\u2019d dare say that the anime adaptation captures the magic and feel of the original. Foranime original viewers, monster isn\u2019t exactly a term that stands by its definition. Ask yourself, what do you think of the word \u201cmonster\u201d when you craft an imagination? A hideous being born to kill? In monster generic monster movies, you\u2019d probably be right. However, it\u2019s quite different in this series. One might even suggest the title to be misleading with the words \u201cmonster girls\u201d. Either way, demi humans aren\u2019t actually monsters but more like humans born with characteristics that are unique and found those in fantasy stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes establishes the basic premise pretty well. Tetsuo meets our main characters \u2013 Hikari (a vampire), Kusakabe (a yuki-onna), Machi (a dullahan), and Sakie (a succubus). Anyone who has are familiar with literature or have seen fantasy stories may have heard of one these species before. In essence, they are the \u201cdemis\u201d in this show and Tetsuo ends up teaching them in hopes of understanding them better. Despite lacking a complex story, the show succeeds at character relationships. Tetsuo is a normal human so he isn\u2019t different from any of us. However, the demi-humans possesses characteristics that aren\u2019t normal. Take for instance, Hikari is a vampire but avoids biting people. Instead, she drinks blood packs and drinks tomato juice. Her behavior is much more of the antithesis of a vampire as she is highly energetic and often hopes to catch the attention of others, in particular Tetsuo. The character chemistry between him and Hikari is one of the most noticeable ones in the show. Both of them share a friendly relationship and often tries to help each other. This extends to her friends as well as Hikari forms meaningful relationships with demi-humans such as Machi and Kusakabe. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike Hikari, Machi is more of the shy type. I mean, if you walk around without a head, there\u2019s probably going to be eyes looking at you 24/7. Even more so, Machi has a strong desire to stay contact with others because of her condition. Tetsuo serve as both a guardian and guide for her throughout the show as they connect and become close friends. Hell, Machi even develops a crush on the guy. Finally on a more serious note, there\u2019s Kusakabe, the snow girl. While Tetsuo is the kind gentleman towards his students, not everyone in this show is so accepting. In one particular episode, a group of girls gossips about Kusakabe that leaves her wonder if she can live in a world with humans. The show does a well job at expressing emotion as Kusakabe feels isolated and even afraid if she will hurt someone. As the show is much heavier on characterization, we get to learn how demi-humans feel about themselves when interacting with humans. This also extends to Sakie, the succubus math teacher. As you can imagine, being a succubus around the male population isn\u2019t easy so she limits herself by purposely dressing in ways that makes her unappealing. Her relationship with the other demi-humans is also explored throughout the show and with Tetsuo as well. In retrospect, the way this show characterizes its cast is very engaging. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series isn\u2019t heavy in storytelling, some episodes does feature one of the main cast more than others. There are specific episodes that explores the lifestyle of demi-humans such as with Sakie. Furthermore, there also episodes that expands beyond the school setting. One particular episode includes a visit to Hikari\u2019s home that opens up more possibilities to understand her better. It even introduces Hikari\u2019s sister to show how demi-humans interact with human siblings. As such, expect the show\u2019s attempt at making the viewers understand about the characters to be a recurring theme. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, the show is one of those popcorn entertainment anime that\u2019s hard not to laugh at. I mean that in a good sense though because the humor is done fairly well. Instead of relying on cheap fanservice or shock value, the series has a natural feel of selling comedy. Every character in this series has a personality that will likely make you feel invested about them. Furthermore, the show cleverly times its comedic moments as they aren\u2019t random. The only part that occasionally throws me off is the lack of development overall in terms of the character relationships. While the show maintains a good balance of relationships, nothing really resolves in the end as Tetsuo tries to understand the demi-humans. Also as a manga reader, the adaptation is incomplete so expect some areas to be left out in the dark.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by A-1 Pictures, the series is bright and colorful in the sense that it captures the mood right at mostly all times. Character designs may feel a bit generic but that\u2019s just the way it is. In the meantime, most of the demi-humans all look like normal humans (with the exception of Machi). I believe the purpose of the show is trying to convey that they can live in our society as well no matter how different they seem to be. Tetsuo also has the modern look of a teacher and someone that accurately fits for his age. Between the OP and ED theme songs, the show also has some clever choreography referencing to folklore and pop culture. \\n\\n\r\nAh for a show like this, you can imagine that portraying some of these characters aren\u2019t so easy. It\u2019s never easy to step into the shoes of a non-human character yet the cast does a wonderful job doing so. I have to admit that Hikari\u2019s VA brings the most personality into this series. With her role, the show is like an energetic light bulb. In the meantime, the soundtrack and overall music delivery is well delivered to present itself.\\n\\n\r\nHow do I feel after watching this show? Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019ve enjoyed this more than I had expected. A show like this really looks generic on paper and some viewers may even question the overall purpose. However, behind those cute character designs lies a much more depth of what you\u2019ll expect out of those demi-humans. Interviews may be boring and stressful but I can assure that this show is the opposite like that. By the time I was finished watching Demi-chan wa Kataritari, I almost wish I was in Tetsuo\u2019 shoes too.\\n",

            "content": "A lot of people consider Demi-chan one of the underrated gems of the current season.  They might be right, if you don't mind a borderline harem set in a high school with minimal to no real plot, and about as much conflict as you'd expect for that scenario.  Predictable and, in my opinion, uninspiring, this slice of life meanders through the demis' daily school lives.  Nothing stands out.  It's the essential fluff series that you'll forget about as soon as you're done watching it.\r\nThe highlight of this show is that they borrowed from multiple cultures for their demihumans.  The Dullahancomes from Ireland, if I'm not mistaken.  The vampire is ubiquitous to many cultures; almost every culture in the world has something along these lines (Japan is one of the few that doesn't have an equivalent).  Succubi trace back to the Lilin-demons of Mesopotamian culture, though the term we use only dates back to the fourteenth century.  The yuki-onna is classic Japanese.  I like the diversity included here, which is rare for an anime--but that's about where my enjoyment stopped.\\n\\n\r\nThis premise has plenty of promise--if they would dig into the lore or if the characters were more compelling.  Instead, they focus on minor points and standard high-school-aged anxieties that happen to tie into the demi nature.  I doubt they'll go further than that.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei is a bland filler character whom I have no attachment to, and the other characters are little better.  The only thing that sets these girls and their succubus teacher apart is their deminess--and with a few exceptions (like the dullahan's detached head), they have no more impact than any other personality quirk.  These are ordinary girls who are supposed to be interesting because of their differences, but they aren't enough to set them apart.  With a different execution they could have been enough to carry the story, but as it is, I'm just bored.\\n\\n\r\nOne other aspect that annoyed me about this anime is the genericness of certain aspects of Takahashi's interactions with the demi girls and his fellow teacher.  I get that his interest in the girls is entirely innocent, as are their crushes on him--but does every anime of this stripe have to go this route?  I doubt he's the only one to show an interest in them, academic or not.  It's a poor excuse for a relationship of any kind.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy slice of life and normal interactions between characters, with a little bit of discussion/debunking of standard lore mixed in, you might enjoy this series.  If you want a series with a compelling plot, something more than archetypal characters or, heck, just something besides high school nonsense happening once in a while, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",

            "content": "Within the last couple of years slice of life anime have completely taken over the market and form the largest percentage of shows that are delivered to anime fans per season. It is fair to say; they are the bread and butter of modern anime and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. What is rather disappointing is the amount of uninspired and generic slice of life anime that are churned out by studios who want to stay in a shell and only make back their money by the skin of their teeth. Given the limitations of the slice of life genre tryingto mix things up to make an anime more unique isn\u2019t an easy task. And that is where Demi-chan wa Kataritai enters the mix to deliver arguably one of the most peculiar concepts in a slice of life anime. Its concept would be far more plausible in a fantasy anime. Yet it somehow implements this in a very relaxed fashion and in a way that feels rather natural while at the same time delivers all the traits of a modern slice of life title such as cute girls, a calm atmosphere and a comedic tone for the most part. Slice of life featuring cute monster girls isn\u2019t completely original, since a few of them have been finding popularity with some recent ones being Monster Musume. But Demi-chan is potentially the first to use the idea in a way that can serve as more than just otaku pandering bait.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs bizarre as the idea behind the anime is, the premise is quite simple. It seamlessly involves a world where ajin also known as demi-humans have been accepted into human society and a biology high school teacher takes an interest into three demi-humans whom he teaches. Demi-chan attempts to explore how this supernatural phenomenon interrelates with the daily life of the ajins. The themes range from bullying, discrimination, being different and accepting ones image in society. All of these themes are depicted through the most mundane tasks in a high school setting. Its portrayal of the treatment of different people isn\u2019t anything noteworthy but it does a fine job at showing a plausible enough representation of the subject. What was however quite disappointing was the lack of depth in exploring these themes. Demi-chan sets up basic dramatic conflicts between its characters to show the audience its themes. But the execution is too basic to have any long lasting impact and it has no interest in broadening its scope to demonstrate how ajin\u2019s are treated on a grander scale which is quite disappointing. While that is not inherently a flaw it takes away from the show\u2019s potential and instead traps it into the confines of the slice of life genre, ultimately condemning it to just CGDCT show for the most part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very plain and the only thing that sets them apart from the typical archetypes seen in slice of life anime was their whacky appearances.  It takes a decent amount of time fleshing them out and their relationships so at the very least the audience will care a little for them during the more dramatic moments. Demi-chan never tells you to take its characters all too seriously though, and while this might sound conflicting with what the show attempts to execute it is handled appropriately.  Their antics feel a part of the story rather than in the way of it. It never felt it was trying to juggle too many balls at once, usually narrowing each specific plot thread down and focusing solely on it. With the comedy sprinkled in between. Its light hearted comedic segments where it was showing the cast doing nothing but talking and exchanging witty banter was quite enjoyable to see. While the characters were mildly entertaining, they don\u2019t have enough depth to them. It also doesn\u2019t help when the main character has an extremely bland personality and looks disinterested in everything most of time which really puts the whole mood of the show down. Its other main characters don\u2019t have enough complexity to make up for their archetypal personalities and any potential in them was squandered with too much meandering. I don\u2019t have much of a problem with comedy or light- hearted fluff. But demi-chan really did lose its steam by the half way point both with its comedy and concept.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs far as demi-chan\u2019s visual presence is concerned, it is non-existent and leaves no lasting impression on the eyes. Aside from some bright colours both the art and animation are very average. The art style itself is nothing to write home about and can be found wherever you look in a similar show. The OST is quite soothing but is also forgettable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan suffers from more than just one or two small drawbacks. While the comedy can be enjoyable sporadically; the novelty of the anime wears off rather fast and by its second half it diminishes to the by the book CGDCT show. Its limited scope in the subjects it tries to explore also plays a hand in reducing the freshness of the anime\u2019s premise as the episode count goes by. I wasn\u2019t expecting the anime to portray its ideas on a global scale, but even taking just one step beyond the confines of its genre would have been enough to maintain my interest. Only then could I have truly held this on a higher pedestal. It becomes a victim to some occasional cheesy execution while also displaying infrequent moments of otaku pandering which came off as cringe worthy and immersion breaking. All in all, Demi-chan\u2019s biggest weakness is its inability to break free of the confines of the genre it is in. As it was leaning more towards style rather than substance, the show did display some glimpses of using its potential, but didn\u2019t do much with them and it wasn\u2019t handled with much finesse.\\n\\n\r\nI somewhat enjoyed Demi-chan despite my criticisms and the monotonous manner in which it handled its themes. Its character interactions and the cast themselves were mildly endearing. And for what it was going for it did far from a bad job. However not aiming for higher ground confined it to an ordinary show. Nonetheless it still remains one of the better non-sequel titles in the season it aired in. It is forgettable and I would only recommend it to those who are looking for an anime to wind down to after a long day of work. It is not inherently bad per say, it certainly does use some of its potential to show how these deficiencies would affect people on a small scale, but it just didn\u2019t do enough to really separate itself from the oversaturated subgenre of CGDCT. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Demi-chan, or interview with monster girls. a series i was initially hooked onto due to it's premise. The first few episodes were actually quite good if i'm gonna be honest, but as it started to continue, it got more mediocre and as a result i also got bored. \r\nFirstly, let's talk about the premise and how the show handled it. The story takes place in an age where \"Ajin\" (demi-human), more casually known as \"Demi,\" have slowly started to become accepted into human society. Tetsuo Takahashi is a biology teacher who ends up teaching three such Demi, hoping to understand more about them while alsomanaging to catch their attention. \\n\\n\r\nNow from here, the show could have went 1 out of 2 way, it could have been a cute girl doing cute things type of show, where the premise is just a backdrop and most of the show is the girls having fun in school doing cute things for comedy. The other way it could have went was the serious dramatic route, where the Demis would have their own issues and they would realize that their not alone and then they'll break out of their shells. The show opted to take the latter initially with the first 4 episodes, but after that the show starts to diverge and become a regular cute girl show, which would have been fine, but it just went nowhere. Like every episode would have an actual plot point, and most of the episode would just be cute girl stuff until near the end when it realized oh yea we had a plot thing to solve. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, why are all the Demis in this show female? If your show had something to stand on, it wouldn't need to rely on cute girls as one of it's main selling point. I see no other reason to have made all of it's main cast besides the teacher female. It's only for \\n\r\n1. selling the cute girl doing cute thing like i mentioned earlier.\\n\r\n2.so they can have a cute crush on sensei. \\n\r\nFor the first few episodes it was okay as there was ore focus on the drama of their kind and their problems, but after all of that initial stuff, their defined by nothing more than their species and 1 quirk. The show doesn't even try to expand it's cast with interesting side characters, the vice principal would have honestly been a great obstacle for takahashi sensei being too bias and realize the Demis dont really need to rely on takahashi as much as they need to, it could have been a heartwarming moment, but it wasn't it was mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the show doesn't even have a good appeal to back up it's circular no where plot and empty characters.The soundtracks are average and nothing to back on, the art is nothing special, the girls don't even look remotely waifu material enough to bank on the whole waifu war fandom. Their cute, but their faces dont look all that different, and only machi looks the most varied out of the 3. There's also sato sensei who is the least sexy succubus i have ever seen, who's plot also went nowhere, she doesn't change enough to warrant that much attention to her arc, and neither did a lot of the girls to be honest, the most drastic change was yuki, who's serious arc was kinda a big contrast to the other arcs.\\n\\n\r\nLast point, the show doesn't know what it want to do. It tries to be a cute girl show, yet has a lot of moments that wouldn't really fit in one, like the yuki arc. It tries to be serious, but has alot of generic school comedy moment, like the test arc or the pool arc.As the show went on and on, i didn't know where the show was headed, and i guess neither did the show. Their lives were made slightly better sure, the whole wanting to learn more about Demi aspect of sensei wasn't even remembered by the show, as they stopped caring about it and the girls aren't even that cute, which means that after 2 episode, i stopped caring about them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show loses it's appeal very fast, it doesn't actually know what direction to go, it doesn't take advantage of it's unique setting to do more serious stuff, the characters are boring, and overall i lost interest in it after 4-5 episodes.",

            "content": "\"You know my nature inconveniences me in multiple ways, don't you?\"\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai is a series that really shouldn't work. It takes tropes that became popular in porn VNs and doujinshi, and removes the porn. It won't even walk the line between the comedic and the erotic, like Monster Musume, and decides instead to use its premise to talk about disabilities, acceptance, and the  feeling of community that comes around people when they recognize how their impairment affects their lives. If I had known about this premise before watching the series, to be honest, I wouldn't have. What are the chances of this beingtasteful?\\n\\n\r\nTurns out it can be done. The main characters in the series are removed enough from real world disabilities that the comedic parts of their lives don't feel wrong, but not so much that I can't see that they are struggling in some ways - I can laugh about the relationship between Takahashi, the stoic biology teacher whose interest in demihumans kickstarts the series, and Satou, who happens to have been born a succubus and affects people around herself accordingly. But I can also see how not being connected with her sexuality affects Satou, bringing her to isolate herself and beware human connections, much like a real life sex addict would have to.  It's fun and fine to laugh at a dullahan girl's misadventures with her head, where she gets nauseated when carried around too carelessly, but the series also calmly shows you how her physical limitations mean that she needs reasonable authority figures who empathize with her and adjust the rules of the school to her condition and for her safety.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this is never done with a sledgehammer, with flowing tears and melodrama followed by a 4Koma like sketch. The writers know that just a brief remark or acknowledgment suffice to make us aware of how, for instance, she needed to train herself to write without seeing the paper she is writing on, since she can't move her head between the blackboard and the paper like a normal person would. These notes do wonders in showing us characters that feel like real people, while letting the laughs flow. \\n\\n\r\nThis tension between the comedic and the dramatic works because of the character work, and it's really tastefully done. I don't feel like saying things like 'the vampire girl is about showing you how a highly visible distinction and disability can affect family life' because, even if the show does showcast it (when they point out that her father and sister dye their hair to make her stand out less, for instance), she isn't just about that. She has also many traits that could work with any other anime girl in high school story, and that helps her not be a one-dimensional lesson to be taught, but part of a fun narrative that, while maybe not epic in scope, beautifully animated, or dramatically superbly constructed, I am having great fun following along this season.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nAnother day, another anecdote that I must repeat (to some extent) because it just fits too well to pass up.\r\nOne of my favorite film quotes of all time also happens to be said by my favorite Pok\u00e9mon of all time, Mewtwo. In Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie, Mewtwo delivers the following line.\r\n\u201cI see now that the circumstances of one\u2019s birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s a relevant quote and a relevant series given Demi-chan wa Kataritai. An anime that channels both \u201cmonsters\u201d and self-worthin wonderful fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s structure is like that of most other slice-of-life anime. Lighthearted comedy, down-to-earth setting, cute girls. The works. However, it goes even further, delivering a worthwhile experience that the viewer can take to heart and apply in their own lives.\\n\\n\r\nTo get there, the anime creates a strong foundation. The main premise itself \u2013 the interviews \u2013 is a format that works very well. Takahashi-sensei sits down with Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, and Yuki one-on-one, asking them questions about themselves and, more importantly, about the origins of their demi traits. It\u2019s exposition that feels natural because not only does the audience learn something new but also Takahashi-sensei himself also learns right along with them.\\n\\n\r\nTheir traits mostly derive from known legends in the real world. Vampires bite. Succubi seduce others. Dullahans carry their heads around. Snow women aren\u2019t too fond of hot weather.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai doesn\u2019t only explain away their traits with known ideas; it also takes some creative liberty to make them that much more interesting. Vampires use blood bags supplied by the government to satiate their hunger. Succubi inadvertently attract those around them due to an aphrodisiac effect. Dullahans\u2019 head-to-body connection may represent a worm hole which allows for the transference of food and vocals. Snow women produce ice when under physical or emotional duress.\\n\\n\r\nIn bringing up these topics, the anime gets at the core of its content. More specifically, a mature brand of comedy comes through with ease. Hikari\u2019s suggestive description of Takahashi-sensei\u2019s arm during her \u201cArm I Want to Bite Championship\u201d is hilarious, and his reaction to Satou-sensei\u2019s accidental sexiness when zipping up her jacket strikes that funny bone hard.\\n\\n\r\nThese jokes and many others in the show are often sharp in timing and quick in wit, leading to a consistently funny anime. To be fair, this comedy is nothing next-level, but its simplistic yet varied nature provides a lot of laughs. Laughs that don\u2019t make fun of their traits but instead demonstrate that they are nothing to be ashamed or afraid of.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this comedic direction gets at Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s most important message.\\n\\n\r\nLife should be filled with laughs and smiles. To put it differently, everyone deserves a shot at happiness. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t always happen. Life can sometimes throw around its meanness.\\n\\n\r\nIn Demi-chan wa Kataritai, Hikari and the other girls are portrayed either as people with special circumstances, handicaps, or otherwise noticeable differences. I.e., they are demis. For them, they are the outsiders. The ones who are not the same as most other people.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime depicts, their differences cause life\u2019s meanness. Machi can\u2019t make friends very easily due to her uniqueness. A couple of gossiping girls bully Yuki. Satou-sensei must meticulously form her life around her inadvertent effect. Essentially, they undergo societal hardships that prevent them from being happy.\\n\\n\r\nThese scenes are sad but meaningful. Meaningful because they reflect situations in real life. The audience has most likely encountered people at work, at school, or at a restaurant who have their own differences. Differences that have them being treated unfairly or in a way that isn\u2019t right. By extension, it keeps them from obtaining the happiness that they deserve just as much as everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Demi-chan wa Kataritai argues for such happiness. It\u2019s in Hikari sticking up for Yuki by giving her two cents to those bullies. It\u2019s in Takahashi-sensei taking the time to sit down with the girls and seriously listening to them. It\u2019s in the support they receive from their family, friends, mentors, and each other.\\n\\n\r\nTheir demi status is fundamentally a part of them, but that doesn\u2019t make them anything less. In fact, it makes them who they are. Takahashi-sensei puts it best in episode four: \u201cIt isn\u2019t how you\u2019re born that makes you \u2018like\u2019 something. It\u2019s how you live with what you are.\u201d Even better, he goes on to explain that that doesn\u2019t mean one should \u201cneglect\u201d those differences, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t look at things in only one way. You should look from both angles.\u201d Otherwise, one will \u201cmiss their individuality\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t understand their troubles.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the person as a whole matters most. And again, the anime demonstrates this mindset \u2013 both with the demis and the non-demis. Himari, the younger of the two twins, looks out for her older sister Hikari however she can. Yuki and Satou-sensei connect over a bunch of silly manga. Takahashi-sensei\u2019s professor friend inspires Machi to pursue her studies so she can further understand herself. And all the girls deliver a heartfelt video message to their sincere teacher to cheer him up as best they can.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone involved proves that a person isn\u2019t defined by words like \u201cvampire\u201d or \u201csuccubus.\u201d That what makes people who they are isn\u2019t about where they come from or their genetic foundation or the culture in which they were influenced. Rather, it\u2019s about their moral fiber. Their strength of character. Their goodness of heart.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s message: No matter if different or demi or somewhere in-between, people deserve to be happy in their own skin.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, Demi-chan wa Kataritai shouldn\u2019t be classified as deep or profound. It doesn\u2019t have top-tier writing since it doesn\u2019t explore all sides to the same degree, sticking mostly with a cheerful, optimistic tone and cutting back on the realism it strives for. In turn, its different instances of drama can feel somewhat stilted. It punctuates the drama with tears, but that tone and the surrounding comedy are around often enough to keep the show from landing its lows.\\n\\n\r\nThese issues don\u2019t take anything away from the show\u2019s beautiful message. The only issue that really does is the semi-harem approach. There\u2019s no ecchi, what\u2019s shown is nowhere near distasteful, and it can actually setup more laughs and extra opportunities to understand the girls and their feelings. However, the anime wants to be semi-serious, and, realistically, only one girl has a shot at romance with Takahashi-sensei (i.e., Satou-sensei). So, this approach of keeping his relationships with the girls on a kind of status quo comes off as slightly unnecessary in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the climax of the anime\u2019s drama happens in the second-to-last episode, leaving the final episode open for the show to deliver one last side story. It\u2019s a wise decision because it ends the season not on an emotional level but rather on something simply happy and fun. A state that the show wants its audience to feel \u2013 regardless of creed or upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai supports its story with an expert set of visuals to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more interesting choices in the show are the characters\u2019 designs. For Hikari, Machi, and Yuki, the anime uses a clever technique. By having the girls wear white blouses and brown skirts, these very plain outfits accentuate the main features of each girl. Hikari\u2019s yellow \u201chorn\u201d hairstyle and sharp fang. Machi\u2019s shining flame and orange-haired (disembodied) head. Yuki\u2019s teal-cool hair and glazed eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThese color choices are smart, too, aligning with the characters and their personalities. Yellow for joyful, orange for warmth, and teal for pleasantness.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-sensei and Takahashi-sensei earn praise here as well. Satou-sensei\u2019s red tracksuit, low, long ponytail, and glasses are an \u201cunattractive\u201d look designed to conceal her aphrodisiac effect, giving her a design that instantly characterizes her whole person.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Takahashi-sensei, his lab coat immediately signifies his teacher role, and his red undershirt complements the white of said coat and his black, spiky hair. But his look also does something similar: hiding his absolutely ripped bod. A bod kept hidden until the final episode so as to include even more comedy in the anime (thanks to Satou-sensei\u2019s uncontained reaction).\\n\\n\r\nMost interesting of all, though, is Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s visual storytelling. For many of its scenes, the anime will take full advantage of the medium, presenting ideas and developments through the art itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, in episode four, Satou-sensei runs into Takahashi-sensei in the cafeteria. As they talk, she apologizes for her assumptions about him after she realizes how hard he has been trying to understand the demi girls. Through dialogue, she insists on helping Takahashi-sensei. Visually, the foreground concrete pillar separates them both while her side contains red chairs and he sits among green ones. So, when she crosses over to his side of the screen, she both breaks the barrier between them and starts their newfound relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOr take episode ten. Following Machi and Takahashi-sensei\u2019s conversation with his professor-friend Souma, she sits down on the grass outside, thinking about what her future holds. Again, her words describe how she has a new path to take in life before her: researching her Dullahan nature. Visually, as she stares up at the sky, two airplanes fly overhead, their contrails crossing one another. A metaphor for that fork in the road, the diverging paths she has before her now as she moves into the future (and takes the one less travelled by, as Robert Frost would write).\\n\\n\r\nThese couple of examples only scratch the surface of Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s thoughtful artistry. On a more general level, the visuals perform just as swell. Camera angles shift away from common perceptions, and transitions between some scenes are dynamic rather than sudden. It\u2019s a thoughtful, down-to-earth anime, but it does what it can to keep its visuals both varied and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the designs and the attention to artistry, the anime provides even more to look at. Tons of reactions for extra comedy (and Hikari gets most of the thanks here). Fluid animation appears frequently. And the soft art style in general continues with the show\u2019s lighthearted vibe.\\n\\n\r\nYes, quite the expert display from the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai hosts a cast of five main characters: Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, Yuki, and Takahashi-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nEach girl has their quirky traits of course. Yuki loves gag comedy, silliness, and jokes of an uncouth manner. Machi likes to be coddled. Satou-sensei speaks the truth internally to herself. Takahashi-sensei gets lost in thought when seriously thinking about demis. Only the romantic, sexual connection to Hikari\u2019s biting habits flusters her. While not extravagant, these quirks flesh out the girls\u2019 personalities that much more.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, they carry the show\u2019s strong sense of comedy and its worthwhile message with nothing but ease. However, their most important contribution comes from another meaningful idea: overcoming loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nYuki goes through loneliness as a snow woman. Her body temperature is lower than most others, and she can even produce ice depending on the situation. This last point causes her a great deal of stress. She feels that she can\u2019t be near people for fear of harming them with her cold abilities. Combined with her new environment after moving away from home, she closes herself off from everyone around her.\\n\\n\r\nMachi goes through loneliness as a Dullahan. With a body and a head separated at all times, she must make special arrangements for herself, like a harness for studying or eating and a small doggy house where her head sleeps at night. Sadly, her appearance sometimes makes people uncomfortable. Both because they have never seen someone like her before (she\u2019s actually only one of the three of her kind in the world) and because they don\u2019t want to touch on what they believe to be a sensitive topic of hers.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-sensei goes through loneliness as a succubus. As if by magic, she exudes an aura of extreme sexuality that unwillingly makes people around her hormonal. Thus, she goes to large lengths to suppress her aphrodisiac effect. She gets up super early and leaves school super late to avoid as many subway passengers as possible. She wears an unassuming outfit. She makes doubly sure to keep her distance from everyone around her to prevent any accidental contact.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Takahashi-sensei is there to support every single one of them.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei investigates the legends surrounding Yuki\u2019s snow-woman status. Many of the stories harbor harsh feelings and unfortunate ends often derived from longing. In short, they involve negative emotions of some kind.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads him to conclude that Yuki\u2019s ice isn\u2019t something to be feared but rather a byproduct of the stress she has been feeling as of late. His insightful words ease her mind, allowing her to finally feel a sense of relief and granting her friends in Hikari, Machi, and even the male classmate whom she initially turned away.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei also investigates Dullahans. Of Irish origin, fairy tales often depict them in a more grueling manner. How they were harbingers of death that terrorized man both on and off the battlefield. It makes sense, then, why people would fear her.\\n\\n\r\nAfter speaking with her, too, she becomes a lot more comfortable with herself. She takes part in an \u201cexperiment\u201d with Takahashi-sensei. She thinks seriously about her condition and what she can do to contribute towards its research. She goes underwater for the first time ever. She\u2019s never hated being a Dullahan, but she realizes now that life has a ton of exciting opportunities out there just for her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, as expected, Takahashi-sensei works to get to know Satou-sensei more as well. His differing opinions on her nature give her the chance to express her own thoughts, and his careful, subdued reactions to her oft overwhelming effect help to build her confidence.\\n\\n\r\nThrough his actions, she believes more in her romantic future. That she still has the chance to find a life partner (read: Takahashi-sensei) despite her peculiar circumstances. She may overestimate Takahashi-sensei\u2019s power to fight back against her effect, but he no doubt has given her the confidence to be bolder in the nuanced ways of love.\\n\\n\r\nOther people besides Takahashi-sensei do help the girls overcome loneliness. Satou-sensei\u2019s police officer, father-figure friend watches over her. Satou-sensei herself befriends Yuki. And Himari\u2019s dad even carries Machi\u2019s head once. But they are most influenced and aided by Takahashi-sensei. His sincere passion for both wanting them to succeed as students and understanding their personal dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei\u2019s influence leaves one important question: Who looks out for him?\\n\\n\r\nThis situation is where Hikari comes in.\\n\\n\r\nHikari is bubbly, rambunctious, and outgoing. She is what most people would describe as \u201cthe life of the party.\u201d She\u2019s also a vampire. That means she burns easily under the sun, and she gets the urge to munch on the arms of those around her from time to time. That also means that Takahashi-sensei takes the time to learn more about her, too. Just as he does with the other girls.\\n\\n\r\nMore so than the other girls, though, Hikari goes out of her way to make their lives a happy one. She makes this trait of hers apparent right from her official introduction. She enlists the help of Takahashi-sensei to transport Machi\u2019s body to the nurse\u2019s office since she noticed the sickened state of the Dullahan.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Hikari is this thoughtful all the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor Yuki, Hikari keeps her distance out of consideration for Yuki\u2019s feelings when she notices that clinging to her was making her somewhat upset. And she stands up to Yuki\u2019s bullies, declaring how she doesn\u2019t want to do anything she\u2019ll regret even if people say mean things behind her back.\\n\\n\r\nFor Machi, she\u2019s the first to ask her about how tough it must be to always carry around her head. She also secretly suggests to Takahashi-sensei that Machi use a backpack rather than a duffle bag since it\u2019s easier for Machi to handle. And she later allows those two to make up after they both messed up (giving a \u201cheh heh\u201d laugh and a few winks to boot).\\n\\n\r\nFor Satou-sensei, she doesn\u2019t do anything directly as she does with Machi and Yuki. Instead, a lot of her actions lead to indirect benefits for the succubus teacher. Hikari\u2019s trust in Takanashi-sensei leads to Satou-sensei\u2019s own rethinking of the man she now loves. Hikari kissing him on the cheek makes Satou-sensei envious and urges her to pursue him a bit more with her aphrodisiac effect. And her pool idea gives Takahashi-sensei the thought of inviting Satou-sensei along which in turn gives her more chances to form the romance she wants so badly.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei is the rock that supports these girls, but Hikari is their pillow. A fluffy, soft, and easygoing person who doesn\u2019t view them as a snow woman, Dullahan, or a succubus. Rather, she simply sees them as people precious to her.\\n\\n\r\nShe confirms this pillow analogy when Takahashi-sensei finds himself facing the same feeling of loneliness. The vice principal of the school doesn\u2019t approve of how much Takahashi-sensei has been helping the demis. Both because he is neglecting the other students and coddling the girls too much. These thoughts put Takahashi-sensei down, himself believing that maybe he has been trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nHikari has none of that. She notices his saddened state, so she rounds up all the girls to say a few words about how he has been such a positive influence in their lives. It\u2019s a touching moment that Hikari caps off with a personalized message she delivers herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe tells him, \u201cYou can never take \u2018trying\u2019 too far.\u201d Her words put into perspective exactly what the other girls have gone through. That, like Takahashi-sensei, Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei have themselves been trying hard to not only live with their conditions but also overcome the loneliness that seemed to plague them.\\n\\n\r\nAs she shouts out her heartfelt thanks for Takahashi-sensei over the ocean, it becomes undoubtedly clear that Hikari embodies the spirit of Demi-chan wa Kataritai. She\u2019s an oddball and a vampire, but she understands that life is about overcoming loneliness and trying way too hard. Because only then can one be truly happy.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nA fantastic set of voice-acting performances back up the awesome cast. Junichi Suwabe as Takahashi-sensei has the manly yet understanding voice down pat, and he can get quite \u201csultry\u201d with his voice when he wants to. Yoko Hikasa as Satou-sensei deserves a shout out, too. Another veteran in the field, her calmness, mumbles, and internal thoughts demonstrate the range of her characters\u2019 emotions.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s Kaede Hondo as Hikari who (once again) takes the top spot. Her contagious happiness and outgoing, peppy speech elevate the character\u2019s likability tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the music within Demi-chan wa Kataritai also earns high marks. From emotional, orchestral ensembles to relaxing acoustic strings to lackadaisical, upbeat tunes, the show incorporates a lot of thoughtful tracks that support the anime almost as well as Takahashi-sensei supports the girls. They may not be as memorable as the story\u2019s message or the characters\u2019 quirks, but they hold strength all the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track, \u201cOriginal.,\u201d combines piano keys, a backing beat, and a lot of chimes, bells, and other dainty instruments to give the track a welcoming tone. It\u2019s not afraid to warp its sound, and the vocals provided with the piece are pleasant to listen to. Especially when they harmonize in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, \u201cFairy Tale,\u201d is another happy little tune. Moderately paced, more piano and chimes create a foundation that\u2019s both light and charming. Soft vocals and a catchy composition round out the track as it starts off quiet, picks up in the middle, and finishes with a lot more passion. Leading it to a quiet end that mirrors the start.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhat a wonderful anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s always an awesome feeling when I\u2019m watching a show, I immediately love it, and I continue to throughout the rest of its run. That\u2019s rare nowadays, so it makes the occasion that much more special.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, what really sold the anime were the characters. I like them all a ton. Machi was too cute with her stares and her body going bonkers whenever she took a daring chance. Yuki\u2019s \u201cCurse you!\u201d acting and her stifled chortles had me smiling wide. And Takahashi-sensei teasing the girls and doing his best to help them made him into a pretty cool dude.\\n\\n\r\nMy two favorites, though, are undoubtedly Hikari and Satou-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-sensei was amazing. As the romance aficionado that I am, her attempts at a romantic relationship with Takahashi-sensei made me oh so happy. She would get jealous of the other girls\u2019 moments with him, she would get embarrassed at herself for going all out, and she would get extremely excited about her potential future or overly defensive should her father-figure try to say anything even remotely negative about her man.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Hikari, she is just way too much fun. Her happy-go-lucky attitude. Her silly actions. Her hilarious faces. She was such a treat to watch as she livened up whatever room she happened to enter. Best of all, she represents the show itself, making her my favorite of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nEven without the characters, this show presents something truly kind. There\u2019s drama, sure. But the positivity it maintains \u2013 about the girls\u2019 situations, the outlook on life, the care of everyone involved \u2013 means a lot to me.\\n\\n\r\nMany anime aim for a similar sense of kindness. But they don\u2019t always get there for a variety of reasons: trying to be too cute, the premise isn\u2019t grounded enough. In other words, the whole package feels artificial in its kindness.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, it\u2019s not artificial whatsoever. It nails that kindness and then some. It\u2019s a good show that feels good and is good of heart. And I\u2019m supremely glad to have had the chance to watch something so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai delivers a superb experience in anime form. A thoughtful narrative, thematically consistent characters, and a kindhearted presentation are supported by expert visual direction and a set of fantastic voice-acting performances. Looks like Mewtwo was right all along.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, a strong slice-of-life narrative investigates the topic of societal differences with so-called demis, providing mature comedy and a sincere message on deserved happiness in one\u2019s own skin, brought down slightly by not enough realistic exploration and a semi-harem approach\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Great, simplistic designs accentuate the characters\u2019 traits, visual storytelling engages the audience, and small flourishes amplify its overall artistic merit\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Takahashi-sensei supports Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei, Hikari embodies the tenets of this tale, and heartfelt themes about overcoming loneliness and trying hard persist across the whole cast\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Great, fantastic VA performances and a large range of simplistic yet charming tracks from the OST fill the air, and both the OP and the ED keep the happy vibes going\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, a wonderfully comedic, positively heartwarming experience the whole way through\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review, pls send feedback if you have any\r\nA curious biology teacher, Tetsuo Takahashi, suddenly discovers himself in the presence of four unique individuals in the delightful anime that is Interviews With Monster Girls. Sorting through fact and fiction of what we believe about the supernatural, we watch as Takahashi slowly gets to know more about each Demi's everyday life while helping them with whatever problems they may face with their birth-given attributes.\r\nStorywise, it's quite similar to how harems/reverse harems direct episodes. (Note: this is not a harem, it just shares a few similarities. Teacher x Student would be incredibly inappropriate) The first fewepisodes are an introduction to each character and a brief description of their \"species\", and the rest of the episodes each focus on one of the already established characters and continues to explore their characteristics and their effect on their surroundings. Mixed in with the calm and peaceful school life, it provides us with an entertaining yet informative experience about the world of Interviews With Monster Girls. There is a little drama scattered around the series, but luckily it's done well enough so that it doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to make the show more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere is quite a lot of information dumps on each Demi-human, so the dialogue is an important part of this show. Although it can seem forced and unrealistic at times, such as a few conversations the Demis have with their classmates, most of the time their interactions with others come out quite naturally and allow us to learn about each Monster Girl without it feeling like a lecture. There are many times where serious issues are brought up, such as bullying and disabilities, giving the show a sense of deeper meaning mixed in with it's cute and happy theme. Often they'll also throw in a bit of comedy to prevent the sense of boredom, and they do it quite well so it doesn't negatively impact on the topic being discussed.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure you've all seen the usual MC that plagues this kind of anime. A group of girls show up in a guy's life, but our poor boy is usually too socially awkward around the opposite sex or too dense when it comes to females. Not Takahashi. An adult with responsibilities, he doesn't have time for that bullshit. No more blushing and nose bleeds, Takahashi is able to interact with everyone around him without looking like a complete idiot. Although still a little dense at times, his kind-hearted and level-headed nature allows him to properly perform his job as a teacher and a second guardian.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing down our list of characters, a group of four Demis are the real focus of the story. These consist of an energetic vampire (Hikari Takanashi), a shy dullahan (Kyouko Machi), a troubled snow-woman (Yuki Kusakabe) and a succubus math teacher. (Sakie Satou) Each one is born with features that separate them from the norm, forced to accommodate these differences into their lives. Throughout the show, we watch as each one learns a little bit about themselves due to their bonds with Takahashi and each other, using their new found knowledge to grow as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe background characters aren't really elaborated on much until the second half of the anime. They're mostly there to bring up topics about Demi-humans, so they don't really get much character development. This is a huge shame as many of them have interesting views and personalities that would have allowed the show to feel more like an actual school instead of a setting created only to have the main characters move around in. Instead of only becoming relevant in the later eps, some of the focus on the main characters should have been used to explore more interactions between normal students and Demis.\\n\\n\r\nSo you're probably all wondering right? Monster Girl Anime without an Ecchi tag? Does this show still have fanservice? Well yeah, but they only come from two characters, Takahashi and Satou. One has an incredibly set of toned muscle, (like holy shit embrace me Tetsuo!) and the other has a beautiful and admittedly erotic body. (I wanna overdose on Sakie's aphrodisiac effect!) We don't see their (AMAZING) bodies much as Sakie usually wears clothes that fully cover her so that she doesn't accidentally sexually stun any men around her, and a biology teacher doesn't get many chances to show off his ripped build in a school setting. What we do things is done well enough so that it doesn't feel like a cheap way of getting more viewers.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the animation needs to be brought up. There is nothing really breathtaking about this anime, but it's not the type to rely on heavy sakuga to appeal to its viewers. Like the show, it's quite colourful and cheerful, but is still able to properly express any feelings the current scene requires, may it be happy or sad. There are a few times where the animation quality dips a little or looks slightly out of place, but other than that the show is pretty consistent across episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe wonderfully charming show that is Interviews With Monster Girls is a fresh take on the usual School and Supernatural Girls tropes. Well worth the watch if you enjoy Slice of Life animes that are different from the usual \"cute girls doing cute things\" we see often.",

            "content": "This show was fun as hell. That's not the only part that kept me going, however, I can't really understate how heartwarming and fun this whole series was from beginning to end. The characters are endearing, the struggles can be both relatable some days and foreign the next, and the animations aren't too shabby either.\r\nWhat drives the story is the character development of different demi-humans, or \"demis\" as they call themselves. The MC is a teacher who wants to learn more about them for his thesis paper at college, but he also learns to truly empathize with the struggles that demis face on a dailybasis. Sometimes their issues can be boiled down to typical high school drama, while other days their demi status can be causing a real problem in their daily interactions. I found the whole experience heartwarming and wholesome at a level that I don't see often today. Plenty of shows are heartwarming, but then they like to aim more at children. On the flip side, some shows think that to be \"real\" they need a bunch of sex and violence to get their point across. Demi-chan wa Kataritai finds the happy medium here, with Sensei treating the demis like adults (when asking about the nature of a lot of their abilities or cultures surrounding them) and expecting adult reactions. There are adult problems that are understood about each of these demis, yet the show goes out of its way to explain if it's still a problem. Better yet, if it's not a societal problem anymore, the show often explains how they've gotten around it. Blood from blood banks for vampires, divisions of police for succubi, etc. All of it feels like the world has adapted to allow demis to live comfortably, and the show tries to take us on the journey of making it over that last step to a normal life.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is worth your time, and I rated much higher than I thought I would. It could be that I was just in the mood for some heartwarming episodes about some endearing monsters, but I still stand by this review.",

            "content": "Discrimination\u2014prejudicial treatment of different categories of people\u2014 is not limited to race, age or sex. There can also be a form discrimination against others based on their hobbies (gaming and watching anime),  disability, social classes or other aspects. If we spot somebody being discriminated against, it would probably leave a negative impression on us. In fact, the term \u2018Discrimination\u2019 has a negative connotation. That is why a show named \u2018Demi-chan wa kataritai\u2019\u2014Interviews with Monster Girls\u2014made an indelible impression on me, when it made me consider a new way of viewing discrimination.\r\nFirstly, the story plot goes somewhat like this:\r\n\u201cThis story begins in the age where\u2018demi-humans\u2019 which is humans with some sort of special power have been accepted into modern civilization. Tetsuo Takahashi who is a biology teacher wants to study demi-humans and his luck smiles at him and ends up in the same school as 4 of these demi-humans. The story follows as he tries to \u2018interview\u2019 these demi-humans and learn more about them but with a lot of failure on his end and comedy at its finest on the other end.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs the summary stated, there are 4 demi-humans: Takanashi Hikari (a cheerful blonde vampire), Machi Kyouko (a kind dullahan), Kusakabe Yuki (a cute yuki-onna) and Satou Sakie (a succubus teacher\u2026yes). Although this show might initially come across as just a cute show with cute girls doing cute things, it actually brings more to the table than that.\\n\\n\r\nEvery demi-character has her own struggle, which stems from her demi-human characteristics. All of their individual arcs are engrossing. Especially the yuki-onna Kusakabe\u2019s. We see her get bullied by her peers due to an unfortunate misunderstanding and watch her gradually develop self-contempt. The way her problem was resolved made me tear up a bit; I usually don\u2019t feel so emotionally emphatic towards a fictional character, but the resolution scene felt so sincere, heartwarming and realistic that I could not help it. No spoiler, you guys can check it out. Overall, the demi-girls\u2019 predicaments reinforced the negative connotation associated with discrimination and I thought it was done splendidly well.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler*\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why episode 11 really caught me and, I think, other viewers off guard. It introduced a conflict between perspectives, which later on led to a rather thoughtful discussion of discrimination.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, we enjoy seeing relationship development between the male teacher Takahashi and his demi students. But the students basically depend on no other human teacher than Takahashi. This episode portrays Takashi\u2019s relationships in a new light: they depend on him too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe vice principle of the school suggests that it would have been better for Takahashi to leave the demi girls on their own, as doing so could have given them opportunities to foster independence and overcome their challenges themselves, while bonding with their peers. And as much as this opinion unnerves the audience, who has witnessed how much the demi girls had to go through, vice principle\u2019s statement has an element of truth.\\n\\n\r\nI really found it clever how the show then\u2014for the first time\u2014 shifted its main focus to four \u2018normal\u2019 human students. They begin to talk about the clash of views between Takahashi and the vice principle. What came next was a conversation that I find to be one of the many memorable conversations from this show.\\n\r\n*spoiler ends*\\n\\n\r\n *non spoiler part continues*\\n\r\nTo be acknowledged and accepted as who we truly are; not just liked for our looks, wealth, skills, connections or other superficial elements. This desire likely resonates with numerous people. However, because we are all unique and differ from each other, we tend to avoid confronting the difference between us and others, especially during our adolescence, to avoid hurting our peers. As a result, we can become unable to see our friends as who they really are; all we are left with is merely a shallow inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIn Demi chan wa kataritai, human students assume that demis want to be treated as humans and believe that treating them as demis is, no doubt, a despicable form of discrimination. While their reasoning makes sense, it is ironically the opposite for the demis; they just want to be treated as who they really are\u2014demis. The conversation between the human boys and girls explains how their treatment towards the demi-girls as human girls reject their demi qualities and would be the true discrimination. The show conveys we should learn to face the discrepancy between us and others, rather than compromising and dismissing the difference between us and others. Refusing to recognize the way a certain individual/group differs from us is possibly a more subtle form of discrimination. Only by learning how to acknowledge the difference, we will be able to form genuine friendship, in which we can be accepted as who we are.\\n\\n\r\nIt is indisputable that discrimination has harmed countless lives in the past. It still does now, and it will likely to continue doing so in the future as well. However, this does not make it fine to simply treat everyone as the same, while portraying discrimination as the evil. Doing so would equal dismissing our individualistic charms and flaws, which are pivotal to defining our identities. Discrimination is not necessarily harmful; it merely depends on the extent of discrimination. It is inevitable that there will be conflicts when coming to terms with the dichotomy between people. However, they are prerequisites to be see others as who they are and also be seen as who we are. What do you guys/girls think?\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is irrelevant to the topic of discrimination. Another reason why this show resonated with me was because of the students\u2019 relationships with the teacher Takahashi. In our rigorous education system (at least for me. I guess it depends on your location and its culture), it is difficult to develop such personal student-teacher relationships. It is possible, but nevertheless. The relationships Takahashi shares with his students are just beautiful. I am glad that there is no usual student-teacher romance stuff\u2026if excluding the dullahan girl. I am glad the show didn\u2019t put too much focus on that element, as it would likely have killed the heartwarming feeling\\n\\n\r\nhttps://somebodymonologue.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/what-if-discrimination-is-inevitable/\\n\r\n^some gifs included to make the review better.

            "content": "Demi-chan wa Kataritai (or Demi-chan as I will be calling it from now on) is at its core a pleasure. Ranging from interesting characters to funny comedy, Demi-chan delivers for the most part an interesting take on the comedy genre. While Demi-chan does not have a lot of profound meaning or underlying plot, what it does offer is a delightful 12-episode fun ride sprinkled with some deeper moments here and there.\r\nDemi-chan revolves around three half-human, half-monster \u201cdemis\u201d, Kyouko Machi, Hikari Takanashi, Yuki Kusakabe, and their high school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi. Along the way, a fourth demi by the name Sakie Satou appears. Although thismay just seem like another moe/comedy in the sea of other shows in this genre, I can assure you that it is more than just that.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with our main male protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi, or Takahashi-sensei as the demis refer to him as, is a biology teacher who takes an interest in demi-humans. Seeing as he had never encountered one before, he is very eager to meet them.\\n\r\nOur main female protagonist Hikari Takanashi is a very cheerful and energetic vampire. She loves to cling to others, especially Yuki since she finds her skin nice and cool. Even though she is a vampire, she does not bite other people\u2019s necks for blood like vampires in movies do, rather she drinks blood packs sent by the government and blood substitutes like tomato juice to quench her need for blood.\\n\r\nIn contrast to Hikari\u2019s energetic personality, Yuki Kusakabe is a relatively shy and closed-off girl.  She is a \u201cYuki-onna\u201d, meaning snow woman. Due to her personality, people around her often mistake her for being cold or apathetic, while in reality she just has a hard time expressing herself properly.\\n\r\nRounding up the pack of three is the dullahan Kyouko Machi. Kyouko is in my opinion the most interesting and fleshed out character of the show. At the beginning, she appears nice, but you can tell that she feels a bit out of place. For instance, in the first episode she is talking to some of her classmates and they ask her if it isn\u2019t a long way to school for her, since she said she walks instead of taking the bus. She replies saying that she is used to carrying her head around due to being a dullahan, which makes the two classmates nervous and they shift the subject. Later on Hikari confronts Kyouko about her being a dullahan, which surprises Kyouko but also makes her happy. The classmates from earlier see this, and come over to talk with her again, but this time without being nervous about mentioning Kyouko being a dullahan.\\n\r\nFinally, we have the succubus teacher Sakie Satou, or as Hikari calls her, \u201cSakki\u201d. Being a succubus, she often distances herself from men due to her innate ability to seduce them if they come in contact with her. When she first meets Takahashi-sensei, she backs off like usual, but later on she comes in contact with him by accident. He acts as if her seductive ability does not work on him, which makes her open up to him.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan has a nice and colourful art style, which sets the mood for the show. Although it is nothing special or groundbreaking, I believe the series would suffer if the art style were different.\\n\\n\r\nAny anime with comedy is immediately going to split people into two groups, the first being those who find it funny and the second being those who do not. Regardless of whether you found the comedy in Demi-chan funny or not, we can agree on one thing; the comedy presents itself in a way that not only expands on the characters, but also reflects on some of the problems these girls have to face. Hikari is usually the front of the jokes, since her energetic personality makes them flow smoother. There was occasionally a joke or two that did not make me laugh or chuckle, and this was more apparent near the end as the series was trying to wrap everything up, but overall the comedy was on-point.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, Demi-chan does touch upon some deeper elements from time to time. Even though these moments are not the focus of the show, they do add a layer of depth which otherwise would not be there. For instance, in one of the later episodes a person named Ugaki comes to visit Takahashi-sensei to discuss demi-humans. He explains that while demi-humans have been accepted into society, there are still some that cause trouble. He expresses that if the demis that Takahashi-sensei is teaching start causing trouble, the police have to take them away.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that I enjoyed Demi-chan would an understatement. Be it the interactions between the characters, the funny comedic parts or just simply the refreshing take on the genre, Demi-chan never ceased to keep me entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Demi-chan takes an oversaturated genre and freshens it up by adding interesting concepts and charming characters. What it lacks in depth is overshadowed by the great characters and execution, and is highly recommended for anyone interested in the genre.\\n",

            "content": "As it's 4am (UK time) I'm going to write a quick review. I'm currently on episode 9 and what I've seen so far, I would say the score of an 8 is perfect right now. This review should be SPOILER FREE, however I have noted main characters and my general impression of them.\r\nStory: 8\r\nA slice-of-life where we go through the lives of a vampire, a dullahan, a snow woman, a succubus and a high school teacher. There are some good comedic moments and each episode leaves you wanting more. There is little to no drama and is very light hearted, so if you're currently watchingor you've just finished an emotionally draining anime, this is the anime to watch to calm any nerves.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNothing spectacular, the OP and ending music are average and nothing to rave about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nAgain, no special effects needed, however, if and when they are used, it is fine. The voice actors do a great job with the characters and they really portray what the characters are expressing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis is where the characters shine, they all have their own quirks and it feels refreshing seeing these characters develop. There's a vampire who is easy going and fun, a snow woman who is apprehensive of those around her, a dullahan (headless person) who wants to be normal, a succubus who does not want to use her powers in capturing men and a teacher who wants to understand more about these demis.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIt's an excellent anime to watch when you've got nothing else to do. The comedic timing and overall feel of the anime is great, with nothing major occurring with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI give this an 7.5-8 as I would say the winter animes sucking quite a bit. I mainly look for a good slice of life or romance anime, and with neither of these catching my eye this season, this would be the best out of a bad bunch. \\n\\n\r\nI will update this if I can be bothered to when the anime finishes.",

Well, that's basically the train of thought that this show left me with. Demi-chan wa Kitaritai is a short series I just finished watching about a biology teacher named Takahashi who's really interested in learning more about demi-humans, like vampires and snowmen. Throughout the show you get to see alongside Takahashi-sensi the many strange things which make these girls unique, as well as the many faultsand insecurities which make them human. The entire show is packed with comedy and wrapped with a bow of cuteness leaving you wanting more. For me it was a fun ride and if cute girls doing cute things floats your boat then I highly recommend it. Also there's a lot of sex jokes. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the 1 through 10 scale used on this website most shows will usually either receive a 6, 7 or 8. Personally I like to give show definitive good or bad scores based on enjoyability. So here I decided to give Demi-chan wa Kitaritai a strong 10.",

            "content": "Relationships are beautiful, especially when it can be with people who are half human, half demi. \r\nInterviews with Monster Girls take into account Slice of Life and Deep topics at the same time;and if A-1 can do something right, it\u2019s this.\r\nThe story mostly happens at school where the events unfold. Our main character, Takahashi sensei, has a slight curiosity to those named demi\u2019s. It\u2019s known to them later on that Demi\u2019s exist in their school, the first one known I believe was Satou sensei, a succubus who tries to avoid crowds for the sake of her, and for the sake of them. \r\nSuccubus do notlive a normal life, even though we usually just see them as some sort of sexual character. I mean, it\u2019s not wrong, but after the way Satou lives, I see Succubus as something else, one of the most difficult things to live as. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad to live as a Succubus, since it may be hard to love someone when you have everyone attracted to you sexually. It then begins to take a difficult turn on your life and it affects you in a way that you become isolated from everyone and avoid people. \\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s why we have our main character.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi has to deal with many demi\u2019s. \\n\r\nThe Fun Vampire Hikari\\n\r\nThe Loving Machi\\n\r\nThe Lonely but not so lonely after a while Yuki\\n\r\nThe beautiful Satou\\n\\n\r\nWith Takahashi, developing a relationship with them could prove challenging, but totally worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't hard to befriend Hikari due to her fun and outgoing personality. After that, it connects to Machi and then to Yuki and so on. It becomes a chain.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi wanted to help any problems they may have, so he researched quite often on each Demi one at a time. To see what they like, don't like, and so on. Once the demi\u2019s see this in him, trust begins to be build in such a way where there\u2019s almost an unbreakable trust.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, I notice that some may view their relationship as odd, and I see where they\u2019re coming from. It can be viewed as weird or uncommon. But when someone truly shows that they care about someone when they aren't usually wanted (because of their characteristics), then of course a strong bond will be created. In this case, Takahashi and his students. He shows genuine love and cares about their well-being and will do anything in his power to make sure they live a happy life where they can live without any worries. With that in mind, I can overlook the relationship that they have.\\n\\n\r\nI do seem to enjoy series where humans coexist with those that aren't too fully human. But seeing how the demi\u2019s are enjoying the human life very greatly, we can basically they're living a human life. But of course in Machi\u2019s case, it can be hard XD.\\n\\n\r\nBut Slice of Life isn't all there, the interactions with the characters can be in a way deep and explores further into the problems and they work together to figure it out.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, it can represent modern day discrimination;where certain groups of people are treated unfairly because of who they are.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nBefore she became a bright girl, she seemed to be unsocial and someone who avoids people. The reason for this may be because of the power she wields. But of course, Hikari breaks through that barrier like nobody\u2019s business. She loves Yuki and therefore goes after her.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Takahashi was able to become friends with the demi\u2019s, the world becomes more colourful with a beautiful and stable relationship. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of colours, the schemes used in the anime give it more shine.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing how broken some of the characters are, it\u2019s really amazing what Takahashi sensei can do as a teacher, and a father figure.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey they had together was splendid and the way they care for each other and supports one another, it\u2019s a relationship that we don't see everyday.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are amazing with its catchy song and the way the happiness within the demi\u2019s are represented and portrayed to the viewers is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIt brings me full joy and I always had a smile each episode and a ton of laughs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyment was phenomenal. The feelings, the relationships, and the characters. All are good points and it\u2019s definitely one of my favourite of Winter.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough underrated, it\u2019s a 10/10 in my book.\\n",

            "content": "Monster girls to ecchi are like strong characters to shounen. Just like how a shounen anime would feel strange without a cast of muscular fighters and hotheaded heroes, an anime about monster girls would feel insufficient when lacking the presence of slender harpies and buxom centaurs. \r\nBut is it possible for monster girls in anime to be presented as something else other than fetish fuel? What if they possess charm, cuteness, and character worth sympathizing for?\r\nEnter Winter 2017, and Demi-chan wa Kataritai arrives to answer my call.\r\nAt first glance, Demi-chan wa Kataritai seems to be a harmless slice of life with a dash of supernaturalelements. Cute girls? Check. Pleasing visuals? Check. No solid plot whatsoever? Check. All these common tropes are present, so some might simply pass it off as another moe-fest destined for the backlog. But don\u2019t be fooled! Beneath an otherwise generic sounding premise lies an anime consisting of likable characters, great social commentary, and the right dosage of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nSince it lacks a distinct plot, Demi-chan wa Kataritai primarily markets itself using an all-lovable cast. In this feat, it really succeeds. You\u2019ll be expecting a trio of BFF schoolgirls, a teacher with hilarious romantic issues, and a biology instructor who looks like Okabe Rintarou twenty years after Steins;Gate ended. The catch? Except for our eccentric teacher protagonist, all the main characters are monster girls\u2014or demi-humans, as the show calls it\u2014of various species.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat makes these characters entertaining, however, aren\u2019t their abnormalities, but rather their struggles in coping with them to adapt to human society. Hikari is an upbeat vampire girl who quarrels with her sister often because of issues such as placing her blood packs in random places. Machi is a dullahan who feels that her headless presence would forever create tension between her and everyone else. Yuki the snow woman is worried that becoming too close to others would cause them to meet a cold demise. Sakie is a succubus teacher who dresses conservatively from fear of seducing males in her vicinity. Rather than merely being demi-humans for the sake of vanity, the characters of Demi-chan wa Kataritai learn to deal with problems that stem from their irregularities. It\u2019s an interesting formula that always provides each new episode with a fresh perspective.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, how can we forget the protagonist himself? Tetsuo might be the only male and human of the group, but such normalcy only makes him even more intriguing. As both a mentor and father figure to the girls, Tetsuo tasks himself with the mission to discover more about demi-humans by conducting casual interviews with them during recess hours. Some interviews will make you laugh, others will educate you more about the girl\u2019s species, and in few instances, these interviews can bring you warm feelings. Whatever the case, Tetsuo's dynamic conversations with the girls represent the soul of Demi-chan wa Kataritai. \\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the show can sometimes veer dangerously into harem territory whenever the girls show borderline lust for Tetsuo due to the intimacy of the interviews. But since Tetsuo is their sole source of help to cope with human society, how can we blame the poor guy for inviting unwanted attention? Thankfully, this point isn\u2019t major enough to turn the show into a full-blown harem like Monster Musume.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai also surprises its viewers with a good deal of social commentary. Think back to the girls struggling to adapt to school life because of their differences; doesn\u2019t that sound a lot like contemporary issues regarding prejudice? Though Demi-chan wa Kataritai appears to be fluffy on the surface, it\u2019s certainly not afraid to tackle serious matters during certain points. In one episode, a visiting detective named Ugaki discusses with Tetsuo about the state of demi-humans in Japan. Despite being regarded as perpetrators of crimes in the past, says Ugaki, demi-humans have now come so far as to become respected members of the national police force. Another episode involves Tetsuo realizing the struggles of Hikari\u2019s family to make their vampire daughter feel welcome at home\u2014a responsibility that doesn\u2019t burden them even one bit due to their overwhelming love for their daughter. These problems might only be a fleeting extra for most people, but attentive viewers would be quick to draw parallels between these subtle messages and real-life contemporary issues. Small tidbits like this make Demi-chan wa Kataritai an engaging show to just about anyone.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the darker stuff is out of the way, what about the humor? In a time where most slice of life rely too much on their moe factor to produce chuckles from the audience, Demi-chan wa Kataritai thankfully carries a brand of comedy that feels surprisingly genuine. Loudmouthed Hikari is obviously the main perpetrator of laughs, but I also had fun watching Sakie struggle with romantic concepts and Machi being oblivious to non-academic pursuits.  During the second half, however, the show feels somewhat less funny, but that may be due to the story trying to wrap things up for the finale.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs in Demi-chan wa Kataritai are nothing groundbreaking, but the show\u2019s bright color palette creates a good match with the uplifting nature of the story. The hair color for the girls and the scenery of the backdrops give me the impression of a city version of Non Non Biyori, another slice of slice series which ironically bears many resemblances to Demi-chan wa Kataritai. The OP and ED themes are catchy enough, but what\u2019s most interesting about them are their visuals. For a small treat, pay careful attention to them as you progress through the show.\\n\\n\r\nProving that anime with monster girls can be something different, Demi-chan wa Kataritai marks itself as an endearing slice of life that plays with the not-so-similar elements of cuteness and social issues. Despite being buried underneath this season\u2019s big hitters like KonoSuba S2 and Masamune\u2019s Revenge, Demi-chan wa Kataritai won\u2019t fail to surprise viewers with its interesting take on an otherwise unremarkable premise. \\n\\n\r\nMy only wish now is that I can find a real-life figure like Tetsuo to be my life coach.",

            "content": "Fucking another underrated show of this season that's actually cute, funny, and pretty damn enjoyable to watch. Not a single bit of this anime bores me with its cute and childish ascription on these demi girls action and their way of voice inflection or the way they talk basically. I mean the premise here might resemble to that of monster musume, but the way the story have been going so far is entirely different. And yes, this is a slice to life anime, well im sure you could tell from seeing the cover of this anime. However, another reason that this anime is just greatwould be due to the way the story goes, despite being a slice to life. This anime explores different kinds of trivial and issues that these demi girls may have, while coexisting with humans and how their ability or natural phenomenon of being around humans affects them psychologically, or physically  . Physically as in the arousal of libido drive, or psychologically like fear or being treated differently from the majority, which the majority here would be the humans, and the minority would be the demi. \\n\\n\r\nI personally finds these kind of story intriguing and riveting to see, given that they actually go deeper in human's interaction and the de minimis (wtf is this word lmao) they that carries around. Some of these traits, features, or qualities would then resulted in isolation, avoidance of contact with humans, or awkwardness in a group conversation when the demi tries to get involve which has been shown in the anime. And the way they work those kind of motif to represent the themes of possibly discrimination, isolation due to their identity, and so forth is pretty enthralling to see. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the dialogue at times is pretty deep as well. The anime explores both human's rational behind their bad behavior, or the intention of doing something to harm other out of their inferiority complex and mental weaknesses in confronting them. Or how public appearances are kept a certain way in a specific environment or occupation to act like a person who are in that social position, and so forth. \\n\\n\r\nAnd surprising the animation is pretty good as well. Aside from the pretty lame ass, and generic looking MC of both personality and their character designs (i mean his face kinda reminds me of the MC from gates, the fantasy army vs military one). Even so, you would prolly fall in love with most of the character within this show, despite the MC looking pretty humdrum and bland. Well you will like him too in the long run. \\n\\n\r\nWell but to keep it short, the theme had me digging, the cuteness and the funny kawai desu ne through childish and random cute sounds to weird sounds and its interesting interaction is what make me like this anime, while keep watching for more of its content. But seriously, this anime is so underrated man. I didn't know that this anime was good (I just pick this anime out randomly from the seasonal releases)  until I actually watched it and enjoy it all the way.",

            "content": "\u201cThe warm and fuzzy feelings are strong with this one\u201d - Darth Vader\r\nThis series truly deserves its popularity, because it was so much more than just another generic \u201ccute\u201d anime. I watch a lot of anime regularly and often dislike most moeblob anime, so it\u2019s pretty unusual that I truly enjoyed this series enough to be smiling in excitement when each new episode aired. This is a review without any plot spoilers beyond the first episode. \r\nTLDR/Summary at the end\r\nWhat if rare and terrifying monsters were actually cute teenage girls that attended school ordinarily like humans? At first glance, this anime may seem like justanother ordinary fun \u201ccute girl\u201d series, but there is something special---something much more unique about this series that sets it apart from the others. This anime distinguishes itself by beautifully conveying some of the different social consequences of being a monster or \u201cdemi-human\u201d trying to assimilate into human society, while the series also injects you with a profound dosage of \u201ccuteness\u201d in the process. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nTetsuo Takahashi or \"Takahashi-sensei\" is a male biology teacher who has been fascinated by the biological nature of demi-human for a while. He\u2019s well-respected throughout the school for his warmhearted approach to students, but he\u2019s never actually encountered a demi-human before since they are extremely rare beings. By a huge stroke of plot---I mean luck, four demi-human girls end up in the same school as him. The story begins from there while primarily following Takahashi as he works to understand and help the four of them with their demi-human characteristics in this show\u2019s ordinary school setting. The story shows the struggles of the four demis and their biological characteristics as they live their daily school lives. Afterall, how does a Dullahan, Vampire, Yuki Onna, and Succubus actually even function in ordinary society? Find out by watching the show :)\\n\\n\r\nConsidering the core elements of this story, the story itself was absolutely beautiful thanks to its primary focus being different from just \u201ccute girl\u201d eye candy, unlike many other similar anime. There\u2019s a certain degree of realism to the storyline since the characters develop as you would expect a real person to. This makes the characters more interesting and relatable than anime with generic characters. I appreciated the fact that there was very little fanservice in this anime because I feel that it would take away from the genuine fuzzy warmth of this series. However, I also feel that any fanservice in this series was timed appropriately to fit the anime\u2019s settings. The pacing was pretty good; I didn't feel that this anime was too slow or moved too fast. Also, the light-humor in the series was timed perfectly and hit hard, which made even it more entertaining to watch. While everything in this series was really enjoyable, there weren't really any moments that made me \u201cthink\u201d or \u201cfeel\u201d strongly about something. That quality is what I feel separates a really good series from a great one, so the story can only get a max score of eight from me.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art is pretty damn simple in general. The color scheme is basic, but they used a lot of light and vibrant colors to give a pretty light-hearted mood. There is nothing particularly unique about the art style, but this show did do \u201ccute\u201d really well and, let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s all it really needs anyways. I like the fact that the characters aren\u2019t just \u201ccute\u201d in the sense that they just look like moeblobs with faces. Instead, the characters\u2019 cuteness comes from various hairstyles and facial expression ranges, that were thoroughly expressed through the artstyle. The background art is nothing spectacular and is pretty average, but the 3DCG blended nicely into the backgrounds. The camera angles weren\u2019t really THAT good because of the plentiful amount of stagnant angles, where only the character moves. The animation\u2019s frame-rate is pretty normal for a series like this. Overall, the art is nothing special. However, they did do \u201ccute\u201d rather well, so it deserves a seven to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6.5/10\\n\r\nThe opening is really good and perfectly sets the mood for the anime. The ending\u2019s pretty generic, but still fits. The background music in this anime is pretty damn unnoticeable except for a few pieces that really stand out. There\u2019s really only one OST from this anime (that I recall) that I would actually enjoy listening to on my spare time. The voice actors/actresses voiced their roles very well, there wasn\u2019t any particularly unique or powerful about their voices but their voices were all pretty mellow and nice to listen to. Overall, the Sound is only slightly better than average, but the perfect opening accounts for the .5 additional I gave it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:9/10\\n\r\nI feel that the characters were the strongest point of this series. Takahashi-sensei comes across as a mature older adult who is a genuine person when it comes to helping the \u201cdemis\u201d. He\u2019s a buff science-minded adult who\u2019s kind of like a father-figure to the demi students. The demi girls each have their own unique personality that I truly came to love and appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nYuki comes across as a shy, misunderstood, kind of awkward girl, but she becomes more confident and we see various other fun sides to her personality as the series progresses. She's often the one laughing at jokes in secret and she turned out to be my favorite character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nMachi is a very intelligent girl who loves to study and is very humble. She's relatively shy as well but is great when it comes to spoken academic subjects like speeches, unlike Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-Sensei is a pretty awkward 24-year old succubus who's shy mainly because she often strongly attracts people of the opposite gender because of her nature. Her awkwardness is often the source of the comedy relating to her. \\n\\n\r\nHikari is basically an honest, lovable, and lively extroverted girl. She's not smart and not studious. Her personality is very necessary for this story, but I didn\u2019t really see her as anything \"new\" or \"special\" per se. Overall, this series has some really lovable characters; watching them overcome their nature, seeing them grow closer together, and witnessing their group dynamic are probably the most fulfilling aspects of this series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:9/10 \\n\r\nAs I mentioned numerous times throughout this review, I truly enjoyed the entirety of this series this series and actually re-watched some scenes several times!\\n\\n\r\nTLDR (Summary)\\n\r\nOverall:8/10\\n\r\nThis series was an unexpectedly entertaining watch as it followed the biology teacher, Takahashi-sensei, as he helps four girl with their demi-human characteristics. The series surprisingly goes pretty deep into the scientific logic of \"demi-humans\". The art was nothing spectacular, but the vibrancy of the colors helped to set a light-hearted mood for the viewers. The VAs and music were only slightly above average, but the opening set the tone perfectly for the series. The characters were the strongest point of the series because of their diverse, non-archetype personalities also because of the group dynamic that the characters create together. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line: would I recommend this to you?\\n\r\nIf you like light-hearted, school, cute girls, and/or fantasy anime, then yes this is a great series to check out.\\n\r\nIf you enjoy a nice non-dramatic story, then sure. \\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for romance, fanservice, super powers, or action, then no. It doesn\u2019t focus on any of those. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you make your decision! Let me know if you agree or disagree~",

            "content": "Imagine being a vampire not allowed to sink its fangs into humans, a dullahan that has to carry its head everywhere it goes or a succubus who's occupation forbids sexual temptation. Interviews with monster girls is a social commentary on how difficult - and often scary - it can be to ingratiate oneself into a foreign society. Four Demi-humans have to overcome their own biology for the sake of living in harmony, and it proves to be a difficult adjustment for them to make.\r\nSatou Sakie is convinced she will never have a genuine relationship when every man she touches is reduced to a puddle oflust. The 24 year old succubus lives in total isolation, takes the first and last trains each day, never applies makeup and wears a jumpsuit all to limit the chances of influencing her students and innocent bystanders with her aphrodisiac effect, often to no avail.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kisakabe also struggles with controlling her powers, preemptively isolating herself from others in fear of accidentally freezing them to death. Underneath her cold facade is a personality no different than your usual perverted high school kid, but she's too insecure in her own self control to trust anyone around her. \"\"If I weren't a Demi...I wouldn't feel like this\" whimpered a tearful yuki, who broke down in the hallway after overhearing a mean spirited conversation about her. \\n\\n\r\nMachi Kyouko's head is detached from her own body. She is in CONSTANT need of attention from others around her, much more so than any other Demi, to help assist in basic movement but is painfully shy about asking others to help her. She finds it difficult socializing with those who don't have the same struggles she does. \\n\\n\r\nThe only Demi unconcerned with her nature is the energetic vampire Hikari who is always the center of attention and serves as the source of most comedic moments in the anime. She is often finding herself in mischief and proudly states \"I am, and always have been, just that negligent!\" - much to the chagrin of her younger sister. Despite these flaws, Hikari is a sincerely kind person and sticks up for her friends in times of need. A particularly awesome moment is when she defends Yuki from bullies that were gossiping in the bathroom. I felt like playing a DMX track in the background when she stepped to those girls and exclaimed \"If you want to hang around and badmouth people, you'd better do it where I can't find you\". Hikari also has a subversion to her mythical trope - she loves to eat garlic and can see herself in mirrors just fine.\\n\\n\r\nIt would've been easy to make these characters a carbon copy of their supernatural legends. Instead they're the opposite attempting to live in spite of their oddities. These girls are as lovable can be, but also very sympathetic figures who you're made to root for throughout the anime as you quickly forget that they're monsters, and every bit as normal as the kind hearted teacher who tries his best to help them succeed.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi sensei brings the cast all together. While the biology teacher may look unremarkable, he sincerely cares about helping the Demi's live comfortable lives and stops at nothing to come up with creative solutions to their complex problems. The way that we become excited about a favorite anime getting greenlit for a second season, he does about learning more about the Demi's biology and adding notes to his research.\\n\\n\r\nMachi is infatuated with Takahashi sensei's kindness and gentle approach to helping her adjust to life in a human school. This is sweet, but also uncomfortable when they're decades apart and in a teacher/student relationship. I'm all for a well portrayed forbidden love story (i.e Koi Kaze, segments of Revolutionary Girl Utena) but Interviews With Monster Girls does not establish the proper platform to even tease that development. Sakie on the other hand is a perfect ship for Takahashi. I'm actively rooting for the two to wind up together.\\n\\n\r\nI would've liked to have seen more monster girls. There are so many different legends that can explored in this setting. Imagine a werewolf that has problems with controlling transformations or a siren who refrains from speaking because the dangers of her voice. It also would be cool to see some monster guys. That would be the best avenue to introduce romantic partners for the girls rather than using Takahashi sensei as a harem ringmaster.  It's doubtful this anime will get a second season anytime soon with the manga already being fully adapted, but hopefully the sales from this season encourage the production committee to make a continuation when there's enough material.\\n\\n\r\nAI pictures has taken a lot grief over the past few years for being too formulaic, but Monster Girls is a welcomed addition to a genre that needs more variation than just Moe blob. Cute monster girls doing cute monster girl things is literally all I thought this anime would amount to. Was pleasantly surprised to find a fascinating social commentary using supernatural characters to frame real life issues that all human beings can relate to. \"No two people are the same, are they?\"\\n",

Diving into thefirst episode, I was happy to find the character designs had not been completely butchered and their personalities showed through in the anime much like in the manga.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Story and Characters ~~\\n\r\nAs the title suggests, the main focus on the story revolves around the main character, Takahashi Tetsuo, talking and interacting with the \"'Demis'\" (demi humans), who are beings of folklore, including vampires, dullahans, succubi and yukki onnas. These are the four \"'Demis'\" present in the show, and they serve as the main cast and focus of each episode, exploring their experiences and thoughts living as a \"'Demi'\" in modern society. The episodic nature of the show works to it's favor, allowing it to centre each episode around one of the characters and develop them, however, the series as a whole does not have an overall goal or conclusion it is trying to reach, leaving the show to be more like a slice of life series. The characters are charming and each unique in their own way, their various personalities showcasing how each individual perseveres through their various struggles as a \"'Demi'\". \\n\r\nOverall, a simple structure in terms of story, likeable and charming characters and character growth.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Audio Visuals ~~\\n\r\nThe character designs are faithful to the manga, keeping the cute simplistic designs, carrying over the character charm from the manga. The art is bright and colourful, but the animation is just average. The voice casting was done very well, matching the personalities of the characters. The op and ed are fine, but easily forgetable. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Overall ~~\\n\r\nAn enjoyable fun watch, charming characters, simple art and design. This series does not sexualise the characters, but leaves some small hints of romance and mild comedic ecchi scenes here and there.\\n\\n",

Interviews with Monster Girls is a cute, heartfelt, surprisingly deep comedy that will certainly impress with its lively cast.\r\nWill you like it?\r\nYou may enjoy  Interviews with Monster Girls if you\u2026\r\n-- enjoy light-hearted series with a heavy character focus\r\n-- find yourself intrigued by contemporary interpretations of the supernatural\r\n-- seek a \u201cfeel-good\u201d sort of experience\r\nYou may not enjoyInterviews with Monster Girls if you\u2026\\n\r\n-- generally stray from character-centric series wherein the focus are school girls\\n\r\n-- expect the series to be anything similar to Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nInterviews with Monster Girls adapts the ongoing eponymous manga series authored by Japanese mangaka Petos, published under the Kodanasha brand.\\n\\n\r\nTetsuo Takahashi, hereafter referred to as \u201cTakahashi-sensei\u201d or simply \u201cTetsuo\u201d, is a biology teacher who retains an inquisitive fascination for demi-humans, beings very similar to humans yet expressing inhuman and otherwise supernatural characteristics. Historically, they have been viewed with distrust by their mortal counterparts, though contemporary movements and cultural shifts have allowed them to integrate well into society. Even so,  they are exceedingly rare, and few ever have the opportunity to meet such intriguing individuals.\\n\\n\r\nCoincidentally enough, three demis come to be students at his Shizaki High School: Hikari Takanashi (a vampire), Kyouko Machi (a dullahan), and Yuki Kusakabe (an ice woman). A fourth demi Sakie Satou (a succubus) is hired to be the newest math teacher. As the series progresses, Tetsuo becomes friends with each of the demis, seeking not only to learn more about them but make their lives and integration into human society more comfortable through a greater understanding of what makes them unique.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s a certain range of depth Interviews with Monster Girls explores that truly sets it apart from series within its genre. Heavy topics such as discrimination, adaptation, and fitting-in are discussed thoroughly as Tetsuo\u2019s studies of the demis develop. We come to understand how these otherwise normal girls face issues just by existing in, what is to them, a very foreign world, both in physiological and social terms. While, mostly unfortunately, our world is not populated by these fascinating creatures, there are humans that have suffered from the same issues the demis do, allowing for such a real world application to greatly enrich the merit of the story.\\n\\n\r\nGenre & Characteristics\\n\\n\r\nAs the title suggests, the existence of \u201cmonster girls\u201d or \u201cdemi-humans\u201d indicates the presence of supernatural characteristics, though in small amounts as per the rarity of such beings and their willingness to assimilate human characteristics. While at first glance you may be unsure how beings such as vampires can life safely among their supposed prey in humans, the writers impress well in their justification. Mutations in reproduction are offered as a source of the demis in lieu of otherwise mythological origins, and the supernatural characteristics are explained in creative and believable ways. For instance, the intoxicating effect that succubi have on males is attributed to the production of pheromones or aphrodisiacs. Quantum physics was touched up to describe how a dullahan can exist with his or her head \u201cvisibly\u201d separated from their body. Much of the series concerns itself with Tetsuo\u2019s revelation of \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d demis work, turning it into, at times, somewhat of a pseudo-educational series.\\n\\n\r\nExpanding upon a point made earlier, something important to realize about this series is that it is not, as some may initially assume, Monster Musume-lite. While the two series share many similarities, most notably in the \u201cmonster girls\u201d aspect, Interviews with Monster Girls is not a harem, nor does it engage in a sexual focus you\u2019d come to expect from an ecchi like Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. While topics of sexual origin are occasionally discussed, they are brought up as a result of Tetsuo\u2019s wish to understand the demis physiological nature, not through personal interest of the girls (yes, even Sakie). A certain demi does develop somewhat of a crush on Takahashi-sensei, though it\u2019s understood that such feeling is one-sided, and more as a hormonal reaction to his dedication to make the lives of demis like herself easier.\\n\\n\r\nSince no series is perfect, I want to expand upon something that really holds it back in that, at times, the thematic exposition can often come across to the viewer as either preachy or staged, greatly affecting the otherwise genuine feel of the series. No viewer ever wants to feel as if they\u2019re being lectured to, and unfortunately some scenes give off that vibe. I recall a specific event in an early episode where one of the demis confronts a gossiping duo about their actions, and while the message is important and was received, there could have been better ways to execute the dialogue without having the scene seem like a public service announcement. The best way for a series to convey a thematic message is by not shoving it in your face, as masterful writing indicates an ability to teach without teaching. Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of the series does not function like the aforementioned, but I can\u2019t deny that there were times where I felt my experience diminish as a result.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few studios out there that are known for always producing consistently quality animation, and A-1 Pictures, much like Kyoto Animation (though subjectively perhaps not to the same extent) is one of them. Interviews with Monster Girls proves no different. The animation is fairly simple, but it\u2019s executed well, and at times there are moments of genuine beauty. I thought that each of the characters were well designed, often accompanied by bright color palettes that not only helped them stand out but greatly underscored their personalities (such as Hikari with the bright yellow and Sakie with the contrasting red-and-purple).\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nThough the soundtracks of such series rarely offer much impact, you\u2019d be surprised with this one. Interviews with Monster Girls presents itself as a light, cozy anime, and the soundtrack does well to mimic this in the wide usage of soft string instruments. It\u2019s a lot like background noise or elevator music yet without the negative connotations, rather quite the opposite in how it exists behind the scenes yet gracefully adds to the overall engagement.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors across the board performed their respective characters flawlessly, as a seiyuu is as good as they can become their character. Much like their animated forms, how they speak should generally represent their personality in some way, and each character does that fully well. Takahashi-sensei boasts a smooth, deep voice, exemplifying his position as the trustworthy, stable man that he is.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to the opening and ending pieces, both are utterly fantastic in their respective roles of initiating and concluding an episode. The opening is particularly creative, introducing each of the demis in a sort of pop-up book style that exudes charm. Over the course of the series, the sequence actually does receive slight changes, making the dynamic nature a nice touch. As for the ending, you receive a very light, introspective progression, with fantastic aesthetics that mimic instances of coloring (or vivifying a blank world, much like the demis do themselves).\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThere are five main characters in Interviews with Monster Girls, involving two teachers (Tetsuo and Sakie) and three students (Hikari, Kyouko, and Yuki). Some supporting characters appear and become relevant from time to time, all human, though the focus of the show remains largely on the four demis and our inquisitive main character.\\n\\n\r\nMain character Tetsuo Takahashi, full-time biology teacher, part-time demi-whisperer, is perhaps one of the most likable anime characters in the genre. He\u2019s a big guy, much to the credit of his name, but also has an equally big heart.\\n\\n\r\nHikari Takanashi, not to be confused with Takahashi-sensei, is more or less the primary demi of the series. A vampire that loves garlic, drinks tomato juice, and swelters in the heat, she personifies the hyper, energetic, and friendly schoolgirl image, while also proving extremely altruistic towards her friends. Personally, she was my favorite of the girls.\\n\\n\r\nKyouko Machi is one of the four dullahans known to be alive, and the only one that lives in Japan. Polite, intelligent, and shy, Machi, as she as most commonly referred to, is the most reliable yet also most insecure demi of the group. As mentioned before, she also develops a strong attachment to Tetsuo, which itself serves as a cute subplot.\\n\\n\r\nYuki Kusakabe is the singular Japanese demi in her nature as a yuki-onna or \u201csnow woman\u201d. She was often accused of being anti-social, though it was more so because of her inability to control her innate abilities in the presence of others. Much like Machi, Yuki is quite both intelligent and shy, though quite loyal to her friends.\\n\\n\r\nSakie Satou, objectively best girl, is the only adult demi present in the series. Though she\u2019s a succubus, and a damn attractive one at that, Sakie goes out of her way to conceal her body, as merely touching her bare skin can activate her aphrodisiac effect. Ironically, Sakie is a hopeless romantic, and seeks nothing more than a genuine relationship with a companion, a struggle seemingly impossible until the arrival of Tetsuo. Though wary of him at first, Sakie grows to develop a crush on our brawny biological buff, as he is the only man that appreciates her for who she is, rather than the effect she has. If you ship relationships at all, you will hardcore root for these two.\\n\\n\r\nIn retrospect, what truly sells the show are the characters. These individuals don\u2019t exist as caricatures of their respective demi identities, rather they grow and develop just as you\u2019d expect a real person to do so, and this trait serves as an immense boon to any series. Each personality is so unique and rich in substance they stand well on their own, and the various interrelationships present help develop a variety of paths to explore.  It\u2019s also worth noting that each character, including Tetsuo, receives a balanced amount of attention, so if you have a favorite (or simply like them all), you\u2019ll be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a bit disappointing how Interviews with Monster Girls was likely the most slept-on series of Winter 2017, as if it weren\u2019t for the short duration and sparse instances of artificial moralistic dialogue, this series would have been a strong contender for best of season. Combining excellent exposition with an interesting concept and five great main characters, this anime knows how to tug at your heartstrings in all the right ways. Few anime succeed as well at being an uplifting series that will leave you feeling so fantastic and fulfilled following the conclusion, that is, after you recover from it ending. It\u2019s gonna bite, but don\u2019t lose your head over it.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t look at things in only one way. You should look from both angles.\u201d\\n\r\n-Tetsuo Takahashi\\n\\n",

            "content": "At one time, I wondered if there are extraterritorial beings out there or something that lives among our society that isn\u2019t entirely human. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all wondered that thought sometimes in our lives right? Needless to say, curiosity can really be a funny thing. In a series like Demi-chan wa Kataritai, there are demi-humans living among society. A male high school biology teacher named Tetsuo Takahashi is fascinated by them and so begins his story in this peculiar yet entertaining tale of monster girls.\r\nBased off of the manga, I\u2019d dare say that the anime adaptation captures the magic and feel of the original. Foranime original viewers, monster isn\u2019t exactly a term that stands by its definition. Ask yourself, what do you think of the word \u201cmonster\u201d when you craft an imagination? A hideous being born to kill? In monster generic monster movies, you\u2019d probably be right. However, it\u2019s quite different in this series. One might even suggest the title to be misleading with the words \u201cmonster girls\u201d. Either way, demi humans aren\u2019t actually monsters but more like humans born with characteristics that are unique and found those in fantasy stories. \\n\\n\r\nThe first few episodes establishes the basic premise pretty well. Tetsuo meets our main characters \u2013 Hikari (a vampire), Kusakabe (a yuki-onna), Machi (a dullahan), and Sakie (a succubus). Anyone who has are familiar with literature or have seen fantasy stories may have heard of one these species before. In essence, they are the \u201cdemis\u201d in this show and Tetsuo ends up teaching them in hopes of understanding them better. Despite lacking a complex story, the show succeeds at character relationships. Tetsuo is a normal human so he isn\u2019t different from any of us. However, the demi-humans possesses characteristics that aren\u2019t normal. Take for instance, Hikari is a vampire but avoids biting people. Instead, she drinks blood packs and drinks tomato juice. Her behavior is much more of the antithesis of a vampire as she is highly energetic and often hopes to catch the attention of others, in particular Tetsuo. The character chemistry between him and Hikari is one of the most noticeable ones in the show. Both of them share a friendly relationship and often tries to help each other. This extends to her friends as well as Hikari forms meaningful relationships with demi-humans such as Machi and Kusakabe. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike Hikari, Machi is more of the shy type. I mean, if you walk around without a head, there\u2019s probably going to be eyes looking at you 24/7. Even more so, Machi has a strong desire to stay contact with others because of her condition. Tetsuo serve as both a guardian and guide for her throughout the show as they connect and become close friends. Hell, Machi even develops a crush on the guy. Finally on a more serious note, there\u2019s Kusakabe, the snow girl. While Tetsuo is the kind gentleman towards his students, not everyone in this show is so accepting. In one particular episode, a group of girls gossips about Kusakabe that leaves her wonder if she can live in a world with humans. The show does a well job at expressing emotion as Kusakabe feels isolated and even afraid if she will hurt someone. As the show is much heavier on characterization, we get to learn how demi-humans feel about themselves when interacting with humans. This also extends to Sakie, the succubus math teacher. As you can imagine, being a succubus around the male population isn\u2019t easy so she limits herself by purposely dressing in ways that makes her unappealing. Her relationship with the other demi-humans is also explored throughout the show and with Tetsuo as well. In retrospect, the way this show characterizes its cast is very engaging. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the series isn\u2019t heavy in storytelling, some episodes does feature one of the main cast more than others. There are specific episodes that explores the lifestyle of demi-humans such as with Sakie. Furthermore, there also episodes that expands beyond the school setting. One particular episode includes a visit to Hikari\u2019s home that opens up more possibilities to understand her better. It even introduces Hikari\u2019s sister to show how demi-humans interact with human siblings. As such, expect the show\u2019s attempt at making the viewers understand about the characters to be a recurring theme. \\n\\n\r\nI have to admit, the show is one of those popcorn entertainment anime that\u2019s hard not to laugh at. I mean that in a good sense though because the humor is done fairly well. Instead of relying on cheap fanservice or shock value, the series has a natural feel of selling comedy. Every character in this series has a personality that will likely make you feel invested about them. Furthermore, the show cleverly times its comedic moments as they aren\u2019t random. The only part that occasionally throws me off is the lack of development overall in terms of the character relationships. While the show maintains a good balance of relationships, nothing really resolves in the end as Tetsuo tries to understand the demi-humans. Also as a manga reader, the adaptation is incomplete so expect some areas to be left out in the dark.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted by A-1 Pictures, the series is bright and colorful in the sense that it captures the mood right at mostly all times. Character designs may feel a bit generic but that\u2019s just the way it is. In the meantime, most of the demi-humans all look like normal humans (with the exception of Machi). I believe the purpose of the show is trying to convey that they can live in our society as well no matter how different they seem to be. Tetsuo also has the modern look of a teacher and someone that accurately fits for his age. Between the OP and ED theme songs, the show also has some clever choreography referencing to folklore and pop culture. \\n\\n\r\nAh for a show like this, you can imagine that portraying some of these characters aren\u2019t so easy. It\u2019s never easy to step into the shoes of a non-human character yet the cast does a wonderful job doing so. I have to admit that Hikari\u2019s VA brings the most personality into this series. With her role, the show is like an energetic light bulb. In the meantime, the soundtrack and overall music delivery is well delivered to present itself.\\n\\n\r\nHow do I feel after watching this show? Let\u2019s just say that I\u2019ve enjoyed this more than I had expected. A show like this really looks generic on paper and some viewers may even question the overall purpose. However, behind those cute character designs lies a much more depth of what you\u2019ll expect out of those demi-humans. Interviews may be boring and stressful but I can assure that this show is the opposite like that. By the time I was finished watching Demi-chan wa Kataritari, I almost wish I was in Tetsuo\u2019 shoes too.\\n",

            "content": "A lot of people consider Demi-chan one of the underrated gems of the current season.  They might be right, if you don't mind a borderline harem set in a high school with minimal to no real plot, and about as much conflict as you'd expect for that scenario.  Predictable and, in my opinion, uninspiring, this slice of life meanders through the demis' daily school lives.  Nothing stands out.  It's the essential fluff series that you'll forget about as soon as you're done watching it.\r\nThe highlight of this show is that they borrowed from multiple cultures for their demihumans.  The Dullahancomes from Ireland, if I'm not mistaken.  The vampire is ubiquitous to many cultures; almost every culture in the world has something along these lines (Japan is one of the few that doesn't have an equivalent).  Succubi trace back to the Lilin-demons of Mesopotamian culture, though the term we use only dates back to the fourteenth century.  The yuki-onna is classic Japanese.  I like the diversity included here, which is rare for an anime--but that's about where my enjoyment stopped.\\n\\n\r\nThis premise has plenty of promise--if they would dig into the lore or if the characters were more compelling.  Instead, they focus on minor points and standard high-school-aged anxieties that happen to tie into the demi nature.  I doubt they'll go further than that.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei is a bland filler character whom I have no attachment to, and the other characters are little better.  The only thing that sets these girls and their succubus teacher apart is their deminess--and with a few exceptions (like the dullahan's detached head), they have no more impact than any other personality quirk.  These are ordinary girls who are supposed to be interesting because of their differences, but they aren't enough to set them apart.  With a different execution they could have been enough to carry the story, but as it is, I'm just bored.\\n\\n\r\nOne other aspect that annoyed me about this anime is the genericness of certain aspects of Takahashi's interactions with the demi girls and his fellow teacher.  I get that his interest in the girls is entirely innocent, as are their crushes on him--but does every anime of this stripe have to go this route?  I doubt he's the only one to show an interest in them, academic or not.  It's a poor excuse for a relationship of any kind.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy slice of life and normal interactions between characters, with a little bit of discussion/debunking of standard lore mixed in, you might enjoy this series.  If you want a series with a compelling plot, something more than archetypal characters or, heck, just something besides high school nonsense happening once in a while, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",

            "content": "Within the last couple of years slice of life anime have completely taken over the market and form the largest percentage of shows that are delivered to anime fans per season. It is fair to say; they are the bread and butter of modern anime and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. What is rather disappointing is the amount of uninspired and generic slice of life anime that are churned out by studios who want to stay in a shell and only make back their money by the skin of their teeth. Given the limitations of the slice of life genre tryingto mix things up to make an anime more unique isn\u2019t an easy task. And that is where Demi-chan wa Kataritai enters the mix to deliver arguably one of the most peculiar concepts in a slice of life anime. Its concept would be far more plausible in a fantasy anime. Yet it somehow implements this in a very relaxed fashion and in a way that feels rather natural while at the same time delivers all the traits of a modern slice of life title such as cute girls, a calm atmosphere and a comedic tone for the most part. Slice of life featuring cute monster girls isn\u2019t completely original, since a few of them have been finding popularity with some recent ones being Monster Musume. But Demi-chan is potentially the first to use the idea in a way that can serve as more than just otaku pandering bait.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs bizarre as the idea behind the anime is, the premise is quite simple. It seamlessly involves a world where ajin also known as demi-humans have been accepted into human society and a biology high school teacher takes an interest into three demi-humans whom he teaches. Demi-chan attempts to explore how this supernatural phenomenon interrelates with the daily life of the ajins. The themes range from bullying, discrimination, being different and accepting ones image in society. All of these themes are depicted through the most mundane tasks in a high school setting. Its portrayal of the treatment of different people isn\u2019t anything noteworthy but it does a fine job at showing a plausible enough representation of the subject. What was however quite disappointing was the lack of depth in exploring these themes. Demi-chan sets up basic dramatic conflicts between its characters to show the audience its themes. But the execution is too basic to have any long lasting impact and it has no interest in broadening its scope to demonstrate how ajin\u2019s are treated on a grander scale which is quite disappointing. While that is not inherently a flaw it takes away from the show\u2019s potential and instead traps it into the confines of the slice of life genre, ultimately condemning it to just CGDCT show for the most part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very plain and the only thing that sets them apart from the typical archetypes seen in slice of life anime was their whacky appearances.  It takes a decent amount of time fleshing them out and their relationships so at the very least the audience will care a little for them during the more dramatic moments. Demi-chan never tells you to take its characters all too seriously though, and while this might sound conflicting with what the show attempts to execute it is handled appropriately.  Their antics feel a part of the story rather than in the way of it. It never felt it was trying to juggle too many balls at once, usually narrowing each specific plot thread down and focusing solely on it. With the comedy sprinkled in between. Its light hearted comedic segments where it was showing the cast doing nothing but talking and exchanging witty banter was quite enjoyable to see. While the characters were mildly entertaining, they don\u2019t have enough depth to them. It also doesn\u2019t help when the main character has an extremely bland personality and looks disinterested in everything most of time which really puts the whole mood of the show down. Its other main characters don\u2019t have enough complexity to make up for their archetypal personalities and any potential in them was squandered with too much meandering. I don\u2019t have much of a problem with comedy or light- hearted fluff. But demi-chan really did lose its steam by the half way point both with its comedy and concept.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs far as demi-chan\u2019s visual presence is concerned, it is non-existent and leaves no lasting impression on the eyes. Aside from some bright colours both the art and animation are very average. The art style itself is nothing to write home about and can be found wherever you look in a similar show. The OST is quite soothing but is also forgettable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan suffers from more than just one or two small drawbacks. While the comedy can be enjoyable sporadically; the novelty of the anime wears off rather fast and by its second half it diminishes to the by the book CGDCT show. Its limited scope in the subjects it tries to explore also plays a hand in reducing the freshness of the anime\u2019s premise as the episode count goes by. I wasn\u2019t expecting the anime to portray its ideas on a global scale, but even taking just one step beyond the confines of its genre would have been enough to maintain my interest. Only then could I have truly held this on a higher pedestal. It becomes a victim to some occasional cheesy execution while also displaying infrequent moments of otaku pandering which came off as cringe worthy and immersion breaking. All in all, Demi-chan\u2019s biggest weakness is its inability to break free of the confines of the genre it is in. As it was leaning more towards style rather than substance, the show did display some glimpses of using its potential, but didn\u2019t do much with them and it wasn\u2019t handled with much finesse.\\n\\n\r\nI somewhat enjoyed Demi-chan despite my criticisms and the monotonous manner in which it handled its themes. Its character interactions and the cast themselves were mildly endearing. And for what it was going for it did far from a bad job. However not aiming for higher ground confined it to an ordinary show. Nonetheless it still remains one of the better non-sequel titles in the season it aired in. It is forgettable and I would only recommend it to those who are looking for an anime to wind down to after a long day of work. It is not inherently bad per say, it certainly does use some of its potential to show how these deficiencies would affect people on a small scale, but it just didn\u2019t do enough to really separate itself from the oversaturated subgenre of CGDCT. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Demi-chan, or interview with monster girls. a series i was initially hooked onto due to it's premise. The first few episodes were actually quite good if i'm gonna be honest, but as it started to continue, it got more mediocre and as a result i also got bored. \r\nFirstly, let's talk about the premise and how the show handled it. The story takes place in an age where \"Ajin\" (demi-human), more casually known as \"Demi,\" have slowly started to become accepted into human society. Tetsuo Takahashi is a biology teacher who ends up teaching three such Demi, hoping to understand more about them while alsomanaging to catch their attention. \\n\\n\r\nNow from here, the show could have went 1 out of 2 way, it could have been a cute girl doing cute things type of show, where the premise is just a backdrop and most of the show is the girls having fun in school doing cute things for comedy. The other way it could have went was the serious dramatic route, where the Demis would have their own issues and they would realize that their not alone and then they'll break out of their shells. The show opted to take the latter initially with the first 4 episodes, but after that the show starts to diverge and become a regular cute girl show, which would have been fine, but it just went nowhere. Like every episode would have an actual plot point, and most of the episode would just be cute girl stuff until near the end when it realized oh yea we had a plot thing to solve. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, why are all the Demis in this show female? If your show had something to stand on, it wouldn't need to rely on cute girls as one of it's main selling point. I see no other reason to have made all of it's main cast besides the teacher female. It's only for \\n\r\n1. selling the cute girl doing cute thing like i mentioned earlier.\\n\r\n2.so they can have a cute crush on sensei. \\n\r\nFor the first few episodes it was okay as there was ore focus on the drama of their kind and their problems, but after all of that initial stuff, their defined by nothing more than their species and 1 quirk. The show doesn't even try to expand it's cast with interesting side characters, the vice principal would have honestly been a great obstacle for takahashi sensei being too bias and realize the Demis dont really need to rely on takahashi as much as they need to, it could have been a heartwarming moment, but it wasn't it was mediocre. \\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the show doesn't even have a good appeal to back up it's circular no where plot and empty characters.The soundtracks are average and nothing to back on, the art is nothing special, the girls don't even look remotely waifu material enough to bank on the whole waifu war fandom. Their cute, but their faces dont look all that different, and only machi looks the most varied out of the 3. There's also sato sensei who is the least sexy succubus i have ever seen, who's plot also went nowhere, she doesn't change enough to warrant that much attention to her arc, and neither did a lot of the girls to be honest, the most drastic change was yuki, who's serious arc was kinda a big contrast to the other arcs.\\n\\n\r\nLast point, the show doesn't know what it want to do. It tries to be a cute girl show, yet has a lot of moments that wouldn't really fit in one, like the yuki arc. It tries to be serious, but has alot of generic school comedy moment, like the test arc or the pool arc.As the show went on and on, i didn't know where the show was headed, and i guess neither did the show. Their lives were made slightly better sure, the whole wanting to learn more about Demi aspect of sensei wasn't even remembered by the show, as they stopped caring about it and the girls aren't even that cute, which means that after 2 episode, i stopped caring about them. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the show loses it's appeal very fast, it doesn't actually know what direction to go, it doesn't take advantage of it's unique setting to do more serious stuff, the characters are boring, and overall i lost interest in it after 4-5 episodes.",

            "content": "\"You know my nature inconveniences me in multiple ways, don't you?\"\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai is a series that really shouldn't work. It takes tropes that became popular in porn VNs and doujinshi, and removes the porn. It won't even walk the line between the comedic and the erotic, like Monster Musume, and decides instead to use its premise to talk about disabilities, acceptance, and the  feeling of community that comes around people when they recognize how their impairment affects their lives. If I had known about this premise before watching the series, to be honest, I wouldn't have. What are the chances of this beingtasteful?\\n\\n\r\nTurns out it can be done. The main characters in the series are removed enough from real world disabilities that the comedic parts of their lives don't feel wrong, but not so much that I can't see that they are struggling in some ways - I can laugh about the relationship between Takahashi, the stoic biology teacher whose interest in demihumans kickstarts the series, and Satou, who happens to have been born a succubus and affects people around herself accordingly. But I can also see how not being connected with her sexuality affects Satou, bringing her to isolate herself and beware human connections, much like a real life sex addict would have to.  It's fun and fine to laugh at a dullahan girl's misadventures with her head, where she gets nauseated when carried around too carelessly, but the series also calmly shows you how her physical limitations mean that she needs reasonable authority figures who empathize with her and adjust the rules of the school to her condition and for her safety.\\n\\n\r\nMoreover, this is never done with a sledgehammer, with flowing tears and melodrama followed by a 4Koma like sketch. The writers know that just a brief remark or acknowledgment suffice to make us aware of how, for instance, she needed to train herself to write without seeing the paper she is writing on, since she can't move her head between the blackboard and the paper like a normal person would. These notes do wonders in showing us characters that feel like real people, while letting the laughs flow. \\n\\n\r\nThis tension between the comedic and the dramatic works because of the character work, and it's really tastefully done. I don't feel like saying things like 'the vampire girl is about showing you how a highly visible distinction and disability can affect family life' because, even if the show does showcast it (when they point out that her father and sister dye their hair to make her stand out less, for instance), she isn't just about that. She has also many traits that could work with any other anime girl in high school story, and that helps her not be a one-dimensional lesson to be taught, but part of a fun narrative that, while maybe not epic in scope, beautifully animated, or dramatically superbly constructed, I am having great fun following along this season.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nAnother day, another anecdote that I must repeat (to some extent) because it just fits too well to pass up.\r\nOne of my favorite film quotes of all time also happens to be said by my favorite Pok\u00e9mon of all time, Mewtwo. In Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie, Mewtwo delivers the following line.\r\n\u201cI see now that the circumstances of one\u2019s birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.\u201d\r\nIt\u2019s a relevant quote and a relevant series given Demi-chan wa Kataritai. An anime that channels both \u201cmonsters\u201d and self-worthin wonderful fashion.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s structure is like that of most other slice-of-life anime. Lighthearted comedy, down-to-earth setting, cute girls. The works. However, it goes even further, delivering a worthwhile experience that the viewer can take to heart and apply in their own lives.\\n\\n\r\nTo get there, the anime creates a strong foundation. The main premise itself \u2013 the interviews \u2013 is a format that works very well. Takahashi-sensei sits down with Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, and Yuki one-on-one, asking them questions about themselves and, more importantly, about the origins of their demi traits. It\u2019s exposition that feels natural because not only does the audience learn something new but also Takahashi-sensei himself also learns right along with them.\\n\\n\r\nTheir traits mostly derive from known legends in the real world. Vampires bite. Succubi seduce others. Dullahans carry their heads around. Snow women aren\u2019t too fond of hot weather.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai doesn\u2019t only explain away their traits with known ideas; it also takes some creative liberty to make them that much more interesting. Vampires use blood bags supplied by the government to satiate their hunger. Succubi inadvertently attract those around them due to an aphrodisiac effect. Dullahans\u2019 head-to-body connection may represent a worm hole which allows for the transference of food and vocals. Snow women produce ice when under physical or emotional duress.\\n\\n\r\nIn bringing up these topics, the anime gets at the core of its content. More specifically, a mature brand of comedy comes through with ease. Hikari\u2019s suggestive description of Takahashi-sensei\u2019s arm during her \u201cArm I Want to Bite Championship\u201d is hilarious, and his reaction to Satou-sensei\u2019s accidental sexiness when zipping up her jacket strikes that funny bone hard.\\n\\n\r\nThese jokes and many others in the show are often sharp in timing and quick in wit, leading to a consistently funny anime. To be fair, this comedy is nothing next-level, but its simplistic yet varied nature provides a lot of laughs. Laughs that don\u2019t make fun of their traits but instead demonstrate that they are nothing to be ashamed or afraid of.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, this comedic direction gets at Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s most important message.\\n\\n\r\nLife should be filled with laughs and smiles. To put it differently, everyone deserves a shot at happiness. Unfortunately, that doesn\u2019t always happen. Life can sometimes throw around its meanness.\\n\\n\r\nIn Demi-chan wa Kataritai, Hikari and the other girls are portrayed either as people with special circumstances, handicaps, or otherwise noticeable differences. I.e., they are demis. For them, they are the outsiders. The ones who are not the same as most other people.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime depicts, their differences cause life\u2019s meanness. Machi can\u2019t make friends very easily due to her uniqueness. A couple of gossiping girls bully Yuki. Satou-sensei must meticulously form her life around her inadvertent effect. Essentially, they undergo societal hardships that prevent them from being happy.\\n\\n\r\nThese scenes are sad but meaningful. Meaningful because they reflect situations in real life. The audience has most likely encountered people at work, at school, or at a restaurant who have their own differences. Differences that have them being treated unfairly or in a way that isn\u2019t right. By extension, it keeps them from obtaining the happiness that they deserve just as much as everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Demi-chan wa Kataritai argues for such happiness. It\u2019s in Hikari sticking up for Yuki by giving her two cents to those bullies. It\u2019s in Takahashi-sensei taking the time to sit down with the girls and seriously listening to them. It\u2019s in the support they receive from their family, friends, mentors, and each other.\\n\\n\r\nTheir demi status is fundamentally a part of them, but that doesn\u2019t make them anything less. In fact, it makes them who they are. Takahashi-sensei puts it best in episode four: \u201cIt isn\u2019t how you\u2019re born that makes you \u2018like\u2019 something. It\u2019s how you live with what you are.\u201d Even better, he goes on to explain that that doesn\u2019t mean one should \u201cneglect\u201d those differences, saying, \u201cYou can\u2019t look at things in only one way. You should look from both angles.\u201d Otherwise, one will \u201cmiss their individuality\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t understand their troubles.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, the person as a whole matters most. And again, the anime demonstrates this mindset \u2013 both with the demis and the non-demis. Himari, the younger of the two twins, looks out for her older sister Hikari however she can. Yuki and Satou-sensei connect over a bunch of silly manga. Takahashi-sensei\u2019s professor friend inspires Machi to pursue her studies so she can further understand herself. And all the girls deliver a heartfelt video message to their sincere teacher to cheer him up as best they can.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone involved proves that a person isn\u2019t defined by words like \u201cvampire\u201d or \u201csuccubus.\u201d That what makes people who they are isn\u2019t about where they come from or their genetic foundation or the culture in which they were influenced. Rather, it\u2019s about their moral fiber. Their strength of character. Their goodness of heart.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s message: No matter if different or demi or somewhere in-between, people deserve to be happy in their own skin.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, Demi-chan wa Kataritai shouldn\u2019t be classified as deep or profound. It doesn\u2019t have top-tier writing since it doesn\u2019t explore all sides to the same degree, sticking mostly with a cheerful, optimistic tone and cutting back on the realism it strives for. In turn, its different instances of drama can feel somewhat stilted. It punctuates the drama with tears, but that tone and the surrounding comedy are around often enough to keep the show from landing its lows.\\n\\n\r\nThese issues don\u2019t take anything away from the show\u2019s beautiful message. The only issue that really does is the semi-harem approach. There\u2019s no ecchi, what\u2019s shown is nowhere near distasteful, and it can actually setup more laughs and extra opportunities to understand the girls and their feelings. However, the anime wants to be semi-serious, and, realistically, only one girl has a shot at romance with Takahashi-sensei (i.e., Satou-sensei). So, this approach of keeping his relationships with the girls on a kind of status quo comes off as slightly unnecessary in the long run.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, the climax of the anime\u2019s drama happens in the second-to-last episode, leaving the final episode open for the show to deliver one last side story. It\u2019s a wise decision because it ends the season not on an emotional level but rather on something simply happy and fun. A state that the show wants its audience to feel \u2013 regardless of creed or upbringing.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai supports its story with an expert set of visuals to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the more interesting choices in the show are the characters\u2019 designs. For Hikari, Machi, and Yuki, the anime uses a clever technique. By having the girls wear white blouses and brown skirts, these very plain outfits accentuate the main features of each girl. Hikari\u2019s yellow \u201chorn\u201d hairstyle and sharp fang. Machi\u2019s shining flame and orange-haired (disembodied) head. Yuki\u2019s teal-cool hair and glazed eyes.\\n\\n\r\nThese color choices are smart, too, aligning with the characters and their personalities. Yellow for joyful, orange for warmth, and teal for pleasantness.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-sensei and Takahashi-sensei earn praise here as well. Satou-sensei\u2019s red tracksuit, low, long ponytail, and glasses are an \u201cunattractive\u201d look designed to conceal her aphrodisiac effect, giving her a design that instantly characterizes her whole person.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Takahashi-sensei, his lab coat immediately signifies his teacher role, and his red undershirt complements the white of said coat and his black, spiky hair. But his look also does something similar: hiding his absolutely ripped bod. A bod kept hidden until the final episode so as to include even more comedy in the anime (thanks to Satou-sensei\u2019s uncontained reaction).\\n\\n\r\nMost interesting of all, though, is Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s visual storytelling. For many of its scenes, the anime will take full advantage of the medium, presenting ideas and developments through the art itself.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, in episode four, Satou-sensei runs into Takahashi-sensei in the cafeteria. As they talk, she apologizes for her assumptions about him after she realizes how hard he has been trying to understand the demi girls. Through dialogue, she insists on helping Takahashi-sensei. Visually, the foreground concrete pillar separates them both while her side contains red chairs and he sits among green ones. So, when she crosses over to his side of the screen, she both breaks the barrier between them and starts their newfound relationship.\\n\\n\r\nOr take episode ten. Following Machi and Takahashi-sensei\u2019s conversation with his professor-friend Souma, she sits down on the grass outside, thinking about what her future holds. Again, her words describe how she has a new path to take in life before her: researching her Dullahan nature. Visually, as she stares up at the sky, two airplanes fly overhead, their contrails crossing one another. A metaphor for that fork in the road, the diverging paths she has before her now as she moves into the future (and takes the one less travelled by, as Robert Frost would write).\\n\\n\r\nThese couple of examples only scratch the surface of Demi-chan wa Kataritai\u2019s thoughtful artistry. On a more general level, the visuals perform just as swell. Camera angles shift away from common perceptions, and transitions between some scenes are dynamic rather than sudden. It\u2019s a thoughtful, down-to-earth anime, but it does what it can to keep its visuals both varied and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the designs and the attention to artistry, the anime provides even more to look at. Tons of reactions for extra comedy (and Hikari gets most of the thanks here). Fluid animation appears frequently. And the soft art style in general continues with the show\u2019s lighthearted vibe.\\n\\n\r\nYes, quite the expert display from the show.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai hosts a cast of five main characters: Hikari, Satou-sensei, Machi, Yuki, and Takahashi-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nEach girl has their quirky traits of course. Yuki loves gag comedy, silliness, and jokes of an uncouth manner. Machi likes to be coddled. Satou-sensei speaks the truth internally to herself. Takahashi-sensei gets lost in thought when seriously thinking about demis. Only the romantic, sexual connection to Hikari\u2019s biting habits flusters her. While not extravagant, these quirks flesh out the girls\u2019 personalities that much more.\\n\\n\r\nTogether, they carry the show\u2019s strong sense of comedy and its worthwhile message with nothing but ease. However, their most important contribution comes from another meaningful idea: overcoming loneliness.\\n\\n\r\nYuki goes through loneliness as a snow woman. Her body temperature is lower than most others, and she can even produce ice depending on the situation. This last point causes her a great deal of stress. She feels that she can\u2019t be near people for fear of harming them with her cold abilities. Combined with her new environment after moving away from home, she closes herself off from everyone around her.\\n\\n\r\nMachi goes through loneliness as a Dullahan. With a body and a head separated at all times, she must make special arrangements for herself, like a harness for studying or eating and a small doggy house where her head sleeps at night. Sadly, her appearance sometimes makes people uncomfortable. Both because they have never seen someone like her before (she\u2019s actually only one of the three of her kind in the world) and because they don\u2019t want to touch on what they believe to be a sensitive topic of hers.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-sensei goes through loneliness as a succubus. As if by magic, she exudes an aura of extreme sexuality that unwillingly makes people around her hormonal. Thus, she goes to large lengths to suppress her aphrodisiac effect. She gets up super early and leaves school super late to avoid as many subway passengers as possible. She wears an unassuming outfit. She makes doubly sure to keep her distance from everyone around her to prevent any accidental contact.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Takahashi-sensei is there to support every single one of them.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei investigates the legends surrounding Yuki\u2019s snow-woman status. Many of the stories harbor harsh feelings and unfortunate ends often derived from longing. In short, they involve negative emotions of some kind.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads him to conclude that Yuki\u2019s ice isn\u2019t something to be feared but rather a byproduct of the stress she has been feeling as of late. His insightful words ease her mind, allowing her to finally feel a sense of relief and granting her friends in Hikari, Machi, and even the male classmate whom she initially turned away.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei also investigates Dullahans. Of Irish origin, fairy tales often depict them in a more grueling manner. How they were harbingers of death that terrorized man both on and off the battlefield. It makes sense, then, why people would fear her.\\n\\n\r\nAfter speaking with her, too, she becomes a lot more comfortable with herself. She takes part in an \u201cexperiment\u201d with Takahashi-sensei. She thinks seriously about her condition and what she can do to contribute towards its research. She goes underwater for the first time ever. She\u2019s never hated being a Dullahan, but she realizes now that life has a ton of exciting opportunities out there just for her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, as expected, Takahashi-sensei works to get to know Satou-sensei more as well. His differing opinions on her nature give her the chance to express her own thoughts, and his careful, subdued reactions to her oft overwhelming effect help to build her confidence.\\n\\n\r\nThrough his actions, she believes more in her romantic future. That she still has the chance to find a life partner (read: Takahashi-sensei) despite her peculiar circumstances. She may overestimate Takahashi-sensei\u2019s power to fight back against her effect, but he no doubt has given her the confidence to be bolder in the nuanced ways of love.\\n\\n\r\nOther people besides Takahashi-sensei do help the girls overcome loneliness. Satou-sensei\u2019s police officer, father-figure friend watches over her. Satou-sensei herself befriends Yuki. And Himari\u2019s dad even carries Machi\u2019s head once. But they are most influenced and aided by Takahashi-sensei. His sincere passion for both wanting them to succeed as students and understanding their personal dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei\u2019s influence leaves one important question: Who looks out for him?\\n\\n\r\nThis situation is where Hikari comes in.\\n\\n\r\nHikari is bubbly, rambunctious, and outgoing. She is what most people would describe as \u201cthe life of the party.\u201d She\u2019s also a vampire. That means she burns easily under the sun, and she gets the urge to munch on the arms of those around her from time to time. That also means that Takahashi-sensei takes the time to learn more about her, too. Just as he does with the other girls.\\n\\n\r\nMore so than the other girls, though, Hikari goes out of her way to make their lives a happy one. She makes this trait of hers apparent right from her official introduction. She enlists the help of Takahashi-sensei to transport Machi\u2019s body to the nurse\u2019s office since she noticed the sickened state of the Dullahan.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, Hikari is this thoughtful all the time.\\n\\n\r\nFor Yuki, Hikari keeps her distance out of consideration for Yuki\u2019s feelings when she notices that clinging to her was making her somewhat upset. And she stands up to Yuki\u2019s bullies, declaring how she doesn\u2019t want to do anything she\u2019ll regret even if people say mean things behind her back.\\n\\n\r\nFor Machi, she\u2019s the first to ask her about how tough it must be to always carry around her head. She also secretly suggests to Takahashi-sensei that Machi use a backpack rather than a duffle bag since it\u2019s easier for Machi to handle. And she later allows those two to make up after they both messed up (giving a \u201cheh heh\u201d laugh and a few winks to boot).\\n\\n\r\nFor Satou-sensei, she doesn\u2019t do anything directly as she does with Machi and Yuki. Instead, a lot of her actions lead to indirect benefits for the succubus teacher. Hikari\u2019s trust in Takanashi-sensei leads to Satou-sensei\u2019s own rethinking of the man she now loves. Hikari kissing him on the cheek makes Satou-sensei envious and urges her to pursue him a bit more with her aphrodisiac effect. And her pool idea gives Takahashi-sensei the thought of inviting Satou-sensei along which in turn gives her more chances to form the romance she wants so badly.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi-sensei is the rock that supports these girls, but Hikari is their pillow. A fluffy, soft, and easygoing person who doesn\u2019t view them as a snow woman, Dullahan, or a succubus. Rather, she simply sees them as people precious to her.\\n\\n\r\nShe confirms this pillow analogy when Takahashi-sensei finds himself facing the same feeling of loneliness. The vice principal of the school doesn\u2019t approve of how much Takahashi-sensei has been helping the demis. Both because he is neglecting the other students and coddling the girls too much. These thoughts put Takahashi-sensei down, himself believing that maybe he has been trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nHikari has none of that. She notices his saddened state, so she rounds up all the girls to say a few words about how he has been such a positive influence in their lives. It\u2019s a touching moment that Hikari caps off with a personalized message she delivers herself.\\n\\n\r\nShe tells him, \u201cYou can never take \u2018trying\u2019 too far.\u201d Her words put into perspective exactly what the other girls have gone through. That, like Takahashi-sensei, Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei have themselves been trying hard to not only live with their conditions but also overcome the loneliness that seemed to plague them.\\n\\n\r\nAs she shouts out her heartfelt thanks for Takahashi-sensei over the ocean, it becomes undoubtedly clear that Hikari embodies the spirit of Demi-chan wa Kataritai. She\u2019s an oddball and a vampire, but she understands that life is about overcoming loneliness and trying way too hard. Because only then can one be truly happy.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nA fantastic set of voice-acting performances back up the awesome cast. Junichi Suwabe as Takahashi-sensei has the manly yet understanding voice down pat, and he can get quite \u201csultry\u201d with his voice when he wants to. Yoko Hikasa as Satou-sensei deserves a shout out, too. Another veteran in the field, her calmness, mumbles, and internal thoughts demonstrate the range of her characters\u2019 emotions.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s Kaede Hondo as Hikari who (once again) takes the top spot. Her contagious happiness and outgoing, peppy speech elevate the character\u2019s likability tenfold.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the music within Demi-chan wa Kataritai also earns high marks. From emotional, orchestral ensembles to relaxing acoustic strings to lackadaisical, upbeat tunes, the show incorporates a lot of thoughtful tracks that support the anime almost as well as Takahashi-sensei supports the girls. They may not be as memorable as the story\u2019s message or the characters\u2019 quirks, but they hold strength all the same.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track, \u201cOriginal.,\u201d combines piano keys, a backing beat, and a lot of chimes, bells, and other dainty instruments to give the track a welcoming tone. It\u2019s not afraid to warp its sound, and the vocals provided with the piece are pleasant to listen to. Especially when they harmonize in the background.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track, \u201cFairy Tale,\u201d is another happy little tune. Moderately paced, more piano and chimes create a foundation that\u2019s both light and charming. Soft vocals and a catchy composition round out the track as it starts off quiet, picks up in the middle, and finishes with a lot more passion. Leading it to a quiet end that mirrors the start.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhat a wonderful anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s always an awesome feeling when I\u2019m watching a show, I immediately love it, and I continue to throughout the rest of its run. That\u2019s rare nowadays, so it makes the occasion that much more special.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, what really sold the anime were the characters. I like them all a ton. Machi was too cute with her stares and her body going bonkers whenever she took a daring chance. Yuki\u2019s \u201cCurse you!\u201d acting and her stifled chortles had me smiling wide. And Takahashi-sensei teasing the girls and doing his best to help them made him into a pretty cool dude.\\n\\n\r\nMy two favorites, though, are undoubtedly Hikari and Satou-sensei.\\n\\n\r\nSatou-sensei was amazing. As the romance aficionado that I am, her attempts at a romantic relationship with Takahashi-sensei made me oh so happy. She would get jealous of the other girls\u2019 moments with him, she would get embarrassed at herself for going all out, and she would get extremely excited about her potential future or overly defensive should her father-figure try to say anything even remotely negative about her man.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Hikari, she is just way too much fun. Her happy-go-lucky attitude. Her silly actions. Her hilarious faces. She was such a treat to watch as she livened up whatever room she happened to enter. Best of all, she represents the show itself, making her my favorite of the bunch.\\n\\n\r\nEven without the characters, this show presents something truly kind. There\u2019s drama, sure. But the positivity it maintains \u2013 about the girls\u2019 situations, the outlook on life, the care of everyone involved \u2013 means a lot to me.\\n\\n\r\nMany anime aim for a similar sense of kindness. But they don\u2019t always get there for a variety of reasons: trying to be too cute, the premise isn\u2019t grounded enough. In other words, the whole package feels artificial in its kindness.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, it\u2019s not artificial whatsoever. It nails that kindness and then some. It\u2019s a good show that feels good and is good of heart. And I\u2019m supremely glad to have had the chance to watch something so awesome.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai delivers a superb experience in anime form. A thoughtful narrative, thematically consistent characters, and a kindhearted presentation are supported by expert visual direction and a set of fantastic voice-acting performances. Looks like Mewtwo was right all along.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, a strong slice-of-life narrative investigates the topic of societal differences with so-called demis, providing mature comedy and a sincere message on deserved happiness in one\u2019s own skin, brought down slightly by not enough realistic exploration and a semi-harem approach\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Great, simplistic designs accentuate the characters\u2019 traits, visual storytelling engages the audience, and small flourishes amplify its overall artistic merit\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Great, Takahashi-sensei supports Yuki, Machi, and Satou-sensei, Hikari embodies the tenets of this tale, and heartfelt themes about overcoming loneliness and trying hard persist across the whole cast\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Great, fantastic VA performances and a large range of simplistic yet charming tracks from the OST fill the air, and both the OP and the ED keep the happy vibes going\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, a wonderfully comedic, positively heartwarming experience the whole way through\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Spoiler Free Review, pls send feedback if you have any\r\nA curious biology teacher, Tetsuo Takahashi, suddenly discovers himself in the presence of four unique individuals in the delightful anime that is Interviews With Monster Girls. Sorting through fact and fiction of what we believe about the supernatural, we watch as Takahashi slowly gets to know more about each Demi's everyday life while helping them with whatever problems they may face with their birth-given attributes.\r\nStorywise, it's quite similar to how harems/reverse harems direct episodes. (Note: this is not a harem, it just shares a few similarities. Teacher x Student would be incredibly inappropriate) The first fewepisodes are an introduction to each character and a brief description of their \"species\", and the rest of the episodes each focus on one of the already established characters and continues to explore their characteristics and their effect on their surroundings. Mixed in with the calm and peaceful school life, it provides us with an entertaining yet informative experience about the world of Interviews With Monster Girls. There is a little drama scattered around the series, but luckily it's done well enough so that it doesn't feel like it's trying too hard to make the show more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThere is quite a lot of information dumps on each Demi-human, so the dialogue is an important part of this show. Although it can seem forced and unrealistic at times, such as a few conversations the Demis have with their classmates, most of the time their interactions with others come out quite naturally and allow us to learn about each Monster Girl without it feeling like a lecture. There are many times where serious issues are brought up, such as bullying and disabilities, giving the show a sense of deeper meaning mixed in with it's cute and happy theme. Often they'll also throw in a bit of comedy to prevent the sense of boredom, and they do it quite well so it doesn't negatively impact on the topic being discussed.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure you've all seen the usual MC that plagues this kind of anime. A group of girls show up in a guy's life, but our poor boy is usually too socially awkward around the opposite sex or too dense when it comes to females. Not Takahashi. An adult with responsibilities, he doesn't have time for that bullshit. No more blushing and nose bleeds, Takahashi is able to interact with everyone around him without looking like a complete idiot. Although still a little dense at times, his kind-hearted and level-headed nature allows him to properly perform his job as a teacher and a second guardian.\\n\\n\r\nContinuing down our list of characters, a group of four Demis are the real focus of the story. These consist of an energetic vampire (Hikari Takanashi), a shy dullahan (Kyouko Machi), a troubled snow-woman (Yuki Kusakabe) and a succubus math teacher. (Sakie Satou) Each one is born with features that separate them from the norm, forced to accommodate these differences into their lives. Throughout the show, we watch as each one learns a little bit about themselves due to their bonds with Takahashi and each other, using their new found knowledge to grow as individuals.\\n\\n\r\nThe background characters aren't really elaborated on much until the second half of the anime. They're mostly there to bring up topics about Demi-humans, so they don't really get much character development. This is a huge shame as many of them have interesting views and personalities that would have allowed the show to feel more like an actual school instead of a setting created only to have the main characters move around in. Instead of only becoming relevant in the later eps, some of the focus on the main characters should have been used to explore more interactions between normal students and Demis.\\n\\n\r\nSo you're probably all wondering right? Monster Girl Anime without an Ecchi tag? Does this show still have fanservice? Well yeah, but they only come from two characters, Takahashi and Satou. One has an incredibly set of toned muscle, (like holy shit embrace me Tetsuo!) and the other has a beautiful and admittedly erotic body. (I wanna overdose on Sakie's aphrodisiac effect!) We don't see their (AMAZING) bodies much as Sakie usually wears clothes that fully cover her so that she doesn't accidentally sexually stun any men around her, and a biology teacher doesn't get many chances to show off his ripped build in a school setting. What we do things is done well enough so that it doesn't feel like a cheap way of getting more viewers.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the animation needs to be brought up. There is nothing really breathtaking about this anime, but it's not the type to rely on heavy sakuga to appeal to its viewers. Like the show, it's quite colourful and cheerful, but is still able to properly express any feelings the current scene requires, may it be happy or sad. There are a few times where the animation quality dips a little or looks slightly out of place, but other than that the show is pretty consistent across episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe wonderfully charming show that is Interviews With Monster Girls is a fresh take on the usual School and Supernatural Girls tropes. Well worth the watch if you enjoy Slice of Life animes that are different from the usual \"cute girls doing cute things\" we see often.",

            "content": "This show was fun as hell. That's not the only part that kept me going, however, I can't really understate how heartwarming and fun this whole series was from beginning to end. The characters are endearing, the struggles can be both relatable some days and foreign the next, and the animations aren't too shabby either.\r\nWhat drives the story is the character development of different demi-humans, or \"demis\" as they call themselves. The MC is a teacher who wants to learn more about them for his thesis paper at college, but he also learns to truly empathize with the struggles that demis face on a dailybasis. Sometimes their issues can be boiled down to typical high school drama, while other days their demi status can be causing a real problem in their daily interactions. I found the whole experience heartwarming and wholesome at a level that I don't see often today. Plenty of shows are heartwarming, but then they like to aim more at children. On the flip side, some shows think that to be \"real\" they need a bunch of sex and violence to get their point across. Demi-chan wa Kataritai finds the happy medium here, with Sensei treating the demis like adults (when asking about the nature of a lot of their abilities or cultures surrounding them) and expecting adult reactions. There are adult problems that are understood about each of these demis, yet the show goes out of its way to explain if it's still a problem. Better yet, if it's not a societal problem anymore, the show often explains how they've gotten around it. Blood from blood banks for vampires, divisions of police for succubi, etc. All of it feels like the world has adapted to allow demis to live comfortably, and the show tries to take us on the journey of making it over that last step to a normal life.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is worth your time, and I rated much higher than I thought I would. It could be that I was just in the mood for some heartwarming episodes about some endearing monsters, but I still stand by this review.",

            "content": "Discrimination\u2014prejudicial treatment of different categories of people\u2014 is not limited to race, age or sex. There can also be a form discrimination against others based on their hobbies (gaming and watching anime),  disability, social classes or other aspects. If we spot somebody being discriminated against, it would probably leave a negative impression on us. In fact, the term \u2018Discrimination\u2019 has a negative connotation. That is why a show named \u2018Demi-chan wa kataritai\u2019\u2014Interviews with Monster Girls\u2014made an indelible impression on me, when it made me consider a new way of viewing discrimination.\r\nFirstly, the story plot goes somewhat like this:\r\n\u201cThis story begins in the age where\u2018demi-humans\u2019 which is humans with some sort of special power have been accepted into modern civilization. Tetsuo Takahashi who is a biology teacher wants to study demi-humans and his luck smiles at him and ends up in the same school as 4 of these demi-humans. The story follows as he tries to \u2018interview\u2019 these demi-humans and learn more about them but with a lot of failure on his end and comedy at its finest on the other end.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAs the summary stated, there are 4 demi-humans: Takanashi Hikari (a cheerful blonde vampire), Machi Kyouko (a kind dullahan), Kusakabe Yuki (a cute yuki-onna) and Satou Sakie (a succubus teacher\u2026yes). Although this show might initially come across as just a cute show with cute girls doing cute things, it actually brings more to the table than that.\\n\\n\r\nEvery demi-character has her own struggle, which stems from her demi-human characteristics. All of their individual arcs are engrossing. Especially the yuki-onna Kusakabe\u2019s. We see her get bullied by her peers due to an unfortunate misunderstanding and watch her gradually develop self-contempt. The way her problem was resolved made me tear up a bit; I usually don\u2019t feel so emotionally emphatic towards a fictional character, but the resolution scene felt so sincere, heartwarming and realistic that I could not help it. No spoiler, you guys can check it out. Overall, the demi-girls\u2019 predicaments reinforced the negative connotation associated with discrimination and I thought it was done splendidly well.\\n\\n\r\n*spoiler*\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why episode 11 really caught me and, I think, other viewers off guard. It introduced a conflict between perspectives, which later on led to a rather thoughtful discussion of discrimination.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series, we enjoy seeing relationship development between the male teacher Takahashi and his demi students. But the students basically depend on no other human teacher than Takahashi. This episode portrays Takashi\u2019s relationships in a new light: they depend on him too much.\\n\\n\r\nThe vice principle of the school suggests that it would have been better for Takahashi to leave the demi girls on their own, as doing so could have given them opportunities to foster independence and overcome their challenges themselves, while bonding with their peers. And as much as this opinion unnerves the audience, who has witnessed how much the demi girls had to go through, vice principle\u2019s statement has an element of truth.\\n\\n\r\nI really found it clever how the show then\u2014for the first time\u2014 shifted its main focus to four \u2018normal\u2019 human students. They begin to talk about the clash of views between Takahashi and the vice principle. What came next was a conversation that I find to be one of the many memorable conversations from this show.\\n\r\n*spoiler ends*\\n\\n\r\n *non spoiler part continues*\\n\r\nTo be acknowledged and accepted as who we truly are; not just liked for our looks, wealth, skills, connections or other superficial elements. This desire likely resonates with numerous people. However, because we are all unique and differ from each other, we tend to avoid confronting the difference between us and others, especially during our adolescence, to avoid hurting our peers. As a result, we can become unable to see our friends as who they really are; all we are left with is merely a shallow inclusion.\\n\\n\r\nIn Demi chan wa kataritai, human students assume that demis want to be treated as humans and believe that treating them as demis is, no doubt, a despicable form of discrimination. While their reasoning makes sense, it is ironically the opposite for the demis; they just want to be treated as who they really are\u2014demis. The conversation between the human boys and girls explains how their treatment towards the demi-girls as human girls reject their demi qualities and would be the true discrimination. The show conveys we should learn to face the discrepancy between us and others, rather than compromising and dismissing the difference between us and others. Refusing to recognize the way a certain individual/group differs from us is possibly a more subtle form of discrimination. Only by learning how to acknowledge the difference, we will be able to form genuine friendship, in which we can be accepted as who we are.\\n\\n\r\nIt is indisputable that discrimination has harmed countless lives in the past. It still does now, and it will likely to continue doing so in the future as well. However, this does not make it fine to simply treat everyone as the same, while portraying discrimination as the evil. Doing so would equal dismissing our individualistic charms and flaws, which are pivotal to defining our identities. Discrimination is not necessarily harmful; it merely depends on the extent of discrimination. It is inevitable that there will be conflicts when coming to terms with the dichotomy between people. However, they are prerequisites to be see others as who they are and also be seen as who we are. What do you guys/girls think?\\n\\n\r\nP.S. This is irrelevant to the topic of discrimination. Another reason why this show resonated with me was because of the students\u2019 relationships with the teacher Takahashi. In our rigorous education system (at least for me. I guess it depends on your location and its culture), it is difficult to develop such personal student-teacher relationships. It is possible, but nevertheless. The relationships Takahashi shares with his students are just beautiful. I am glad that there is no usual student-teacher romance stuff\u2026if excluding the dullahan girl. I am glad the show didn\u2019t put too much focus on that element, as it would likely have killed the heartwarming feeling\\n\\n\r\nhttps://somebodymonologue.wordpress.com/2017/05/15/what-if-discrimination-is-inevitable/\\n\r\n^some gifs included to make the review better.

            "content": "Demi-chan wa Kataritai (or Demi-chan as I will be calling it from now on) is at its core a pleasure. Ranging from interesting characters to funny comedy, Demi-chan delivers for the most part an interesting take on the comedy genre. While Demi-chan does not have a lot of profound meaning or underlying plot, what it does offer is a delightful 12-episode fun ride sprinkled with some deeper moments here and there.\r\nDemi-chan revolves around three half-human, half-monster \u201cdemis\u201d, Kyouko Machi, Hikari Takanashi, Yuki Kusakabe, and their high school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi. Along the way, a fourth demi by the name Sakie Satou appears. Although thismay just seem like another moe/comedy in the sea of other shows in this genre, I can assure you that it is more than just that.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with our main male protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi, or Takahashi-sensei as the demis refer to him as, is a biology teacher who takes an interest in demi-humans. Seeing as he had never encountered one before, he is very eager to meet them.\\n\r\nOur main female protagonist Hikari Takanashi is a very cheerful and energetic vampire. She loves to cling to others, especially Yuki since she finds her skin nice and cool. Even though she is a vampire, she does not bite other people\u2019s necks for blood like vampires in movies do, rather she drinks blood packs sent by the government and blood substitutes like tomato juice to quench her need for blood.\\n\r\nIn contrast to Hikari\u2019s energetic personality, Yuki Kusakabe is a relatively shy and closed-off girl.  She is a \u201cYuki-onna\u201d, meaning snow woman. Due to her personality, people around her often mistake her for being cold or apathetic, while in reality she just has a hard time expressing herself properly.\\n\r\nRounding up the pack of three is the dullahan Kyouko Machi. Kyouko is in my opinion the most interesting and fleshed out character of the show. At the beginning, she appears nice, but you can tell that she feels a bit out of place. For instance, in the first episode she is talking to some of her classmates and they ask her if it isn\u2019t a long way to school for her, since she said she walks instead of taking the bus. She replies saying that she is used to carrying her head around due to being a dullahan, which makes the two classmates nervous and they shift the subject. Later on Hikari confronts Kyouko about her being a dullahan, which surprises Kyouko but also makes her happy. The classmates from earlier see this, and come over to talk with her again, but this time without being nervous about mentioning Kyouko being a dullahan.\\n\r\nFinally, we have the succubus teacher Sakie Satou, or as Hikari calls her, \u201cSakki\u201d. Being a succubus, she often distances herself from men due to her innate ability to seduce them if they come in contact with her. When she first meets Takahashi-sensei, she backs off like usual, but later on she comes in contact with him by accident. He acts as if her seductive ability does not work on him, which makes her open up to him.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan has a nice and colourful art style, which sets the mood for the show. Although it is nothing special or groundbreaking, I believe the series would suffer if the art style were different.\\n\\n\r\nAny anime with comedy is immediately going to split people into two groups, the first being those who find it funny and the second being those who do not. Regardless of whether you found the comedy in Demi-chan funny or not, we can agree on one thing; the comedy presents itself in a way that not only expands on the characters, but also reflects on some of the problems these girls have to face. Hikari is usually the front of the jokes, since her energetic personality makes them flow smoother. There was occasionally a joke or two that did not make me laugh or chuckle, and this was more apparent near the end as the series was trying to wrap everything up, but overall the comedy was on-point.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said earlier, Demi-chan does touch upon some deeper elements from time to time. Even though these moments are not the focus of the show, they do add a layer of depth which otherwise would not be there. For instance, in one of the later episodes a person named Ugaki comes to visit Takahashi-sensei to discuss demi-humans. He explains that while demi-humans have been accepted into society, there are still some that cause trouble. He expresses that if the demis that Takahashi-sensei is teaching start causing trouble, the police have to take them away.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that I enjoyed Demi-chan would an understatement. Be it the interactions between the characters, the funny comedic parts or just simply the refreshing take on the genre, Demi-chan never ceased to keep me entertained.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Demi-chan takes an oversaturated genre and freshens it up by adding interesting concepts and charming characters. What it lacks in depth is overshadowed by the great characters and execution, and is highly recommended for anyone interested in the genre.\\n",

This review should be SPOILER FREE, however I have noted main characters and my general impression of them.\r\nStory: 8\r\nA slice-of-life where we go through the lives of a vampire, a dullahan, a snow woman, a succubus and a high school teacher. There are some good comedic moments and each episode leaves you wanting more. There is little to no drama and is very light hearted, so if you're currently watchingor you've just finished an emotionally draining anime, this is the anime to watch to calm any nerves.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNothing spectacular, the OP and ending music are average and nothing to rave about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nAgain, no special effects needed, however, if and when they are used, it is fine. The voice actors do a great job with the characters and they really portray what the characters are expressing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThis is where the characters shine, they all have their own quirks and it feels refreshing seeing these characters develop. There's a vampire who is easy going and fun, a snow woman who is apprehensive of those around her, a dullahan (headless person) who wants to be normal, a succubus who does not want to use her powers in capturing men and a teacher who wants to understand more about these demis.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIt's an excellent anime to watch when you've got nothing else to do. The comedic timing and overall feel of the anime is great, with nothing major occurring with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI give this an 7.5-8 as I would say the winter animes sucking quite a bit. I mainly look for a good slice of life or romance anime, and with neither of these catching my eye this season, this would be the best out of a bad bunch. \\n\\n\r\nI will update this if I can be bothered to when the anime finishes.",

Well, that's basically the train of thought that this show left me with. Demi-chan wa Kitaritai is a short series I just finished watching about a biology teacher named Takahashi who's really interested in learning more about demi-humans, like vampires and snowmen. Throughout the show you get to see alongside Takahashi-sensi the many strange things which make these girls unique, as well as the many faultsand insecurities which make them human. The entire show is packed with comedy and wrapped with a bow of cuteness leaving you wanting more. For me it was a fun ride and if cute girls doing cute things floats your boat then I highly recommend it. Also there's a lot of sex jokes. \\n\\n\r\nDue to the 1 through 10 scale used on this website most shows will usually either receive a 6, 7 or 8. Personally I like to give show definitive good or bad scores based on enjoyability. So here I decided to give Demi-chan wa Kitaritai a strong 10.",

            "content": "Relationships are beautiful, especially when it can be with people who are half human, half demi. \r\nInterviews with Monster Girls take into account Slice of Life and Deep topics at the same time;and if A-1 can do something right, it\u2019s this.\r\nThe story mostly happens at school where the events unfold. Our main character, Takahashi sensei, has a slight curiosity to those named demi\u2019s. It\u2019s known to them later on that Demi\u2019s exist in their school, the first one known I believe was Satou sensei, a succubus who tries to avoid crowds for the sake of her, and for the sake of them. \r\nSuccubus do notlive a normal life, even though we usually just see them as some sort of sexual character. I mean, it\u2019s not wrong, but after the way Satou lives, I see Succubus as something else, one of the most difficult things to live as. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s sad to live as a Succubus, since it may be hard to love someone when you have everyone attracted to you sexually. It then begins to take a difficult turn on your life and it affects you in a way that you become isolated from everyone and avoid people. \\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s why we have our main character.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi has to deal with many demi\u2019s. \\n\r\nThe Fun Vampire Hikari\\n\r\nThe Loving Machi\\n\r\nThe Lonely but not so lonely after a while Yuki\\n\r\nThe beautiful Satou\\n\\n\r\nWith Takahashi, developing a relationship with them could prove challenging, but totally worth it in the end.\\n\\n\r\nIt wasn't hard to befriend Hikari due to her fun and outgoing personality. After that, it connects to Machi and then to Yuki and so on. It becomes a chain.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi wanted to help any problems they may have, so he researched quite often on each Demi one at a time. To see what they like, don't like, and so on. Once the demi\u2019s see this in him, trust begins to be build in such a way where there\u2019s almost an unbreakable trust.\\n\\n\r\nYou see, I notice that some may view their relationship as odd, and I see where they\u2019re coming from. It can be viewed as weird or uncommon. But when someone truly shows that they care about someone when they aren't usually wanted (because of their characteristics), then of course a strong bond will be created. In this case, Takahashi and his students. He shows genuine love and cares about their well-being and will do anything in his power to make sure they live a happy life where they can live without any worries. With that in mind, I can overlook the relationship that they have.\\n\\n\r\nI do seem to enjoy series where humans coexist with those that aren't too fully human. But seeing how the demi\u2019s are enjoying the human life very greatly, we can basically they're living a human life. But of course in Machi\u2019s case, it can be hard XD.\\n\\n\r\nBut Slice of Life isn't all there, the interactions with the characters can be in a way deep and explores further into the problems and they work together to figure it out.\\n\\n\r\nIn a way, it can represent modern day discrimination;where certain groups of people are treated unfairly because of who they are.\\n\\n\r\nIn this case, Yuki.\\n\\n\r\nBefore she became a bright girl, she seemed to be unsocial and someone who avoids people. The reason for this may be because of the power she wields. But of course, Hikari breaks through that barrier like nobody\u2019s business. She loves Yuki and therefore goes after her.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Takahashi was able to become friends with the demi\u2019s, the world becomes more colourful with a beautiful and stable relationship. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of colours, the schemes used in the anime give it more shine.\\n\\n\r\nSeeing how broken some of the characters are, it\u2019s really amazing what Takahashi sensei can do as a teacher, and a father figure.\\n\\n\r\nThe journey they had together was splendid and the way they care for each other and supports one another, it\u2019s a relationship that we don't see everyday.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are amazing with its catchy song and the way the happiness within the demi\u2019s are represented and portrayed to the viewers is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIt brings me full joy and I always had a smile each episode and a ton of laughs.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the enjoyment was phenomenal. The feelings, the relationships, and the characters. All are good points and it\u2019s definitely one of my favourite of Winter.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough underrated, it\u2019s a 10/10 in my book.\\n",

But as it turns out.... this anime is..... very funny xD I love it! Probably one of the top anime in terms of comedic value I've watched!\r\n*SPOILER ALERT*\r\nStory: So the story revolves around 4 girls(although 1 is a teacher) who are Demi's, or people who have certain mutations and are different from normal humans, and a teacher Tetsuo Takahashi who is interested in Demi-humans to the point where he ends up befriending the4 girls(Hikari, Yuki, Machi and Satou-sensei) to find out more about Demi-humans and how he can help them in their difficulties. Sounds serious but.... turns out to be more of a comedy gag show with Hikari being the funniest out of everyone. Demi-chan just gets everything right when it comes to comedy although some of the comedy requires a little bit of intellect to understand. Overall, a light-hearted story full of laughs\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: I quite like the animation, because the producers actually put in effort to detail out the facial expressions of every character when they're happy, laughing, angry or sad. And that adds to the comedic value of the anime, to a certain extent\\n\r\nRating: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: Can't say anything about the opening and ending cuz I just skept them to go right into the anime(yes that's how funny the anime is). The background noise of the anime is... the ost blends well with the anime and the sound effects are good.\\n\r\nRating: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I shan't go into details of the characters cos that'll take like 2 pages of the review. My favorite character of the show is.... vampire Hikari(some biaseness cos she's voiced by my fav CV) because she's the most funny and laid back character in the series. She always makes the mood so cheerful and fun in part due to her personality which is.... doesn't really give a damm about anything :v. Then there's Machi(a Dullahan) who's a bit more serious and talks about serious stuff and is a very friendly, polite and caring friend in the series. That immediately makes her likable to everyone. Next is Yuki(snow woman) who is.... the introverted and quiet kind of person, though once she opens up she can be quite fun to hang out with. I find her to be one of the more interesting characters in the series cos her sense of humor is peculiar. Then there's Satou-sensei(a Succubus) who well.... i don't exactly like her even though she can be quite funny. Mainly cos well.... she's lame :v. You know that feeling when you like someone but daren't confess to the person cos of reasons and end up doing stupid things in front of that person.... yea, that's one reason I don't like her. Last but not least, Takahashi sensei who's a bit like Machi. Caring, friendly, polite, easy to talk with. That's why he is surrounded by a harem :v\\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Thoroughly enjoyed watching this show it's an anime that'll make you laugh in tears throughout! And it's an anime where you'll like all the characters regardless of their personality.  \\n\r\nRating: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan is an interesting anime bcos I don't exactly watch the fantasy genre. But it certainly makes fantasy look appealing, mostly bcos it's so funny and the fantasy involved is actually interesting and quite relatable. If I could describe this anime, I'd call this anime a hidden gem in the SoL/Fantasy genre bcos even though it has quite a huge following, i think more people should watch it to unwind, relax and just have a boatload of laughs. Definitely an anime I'd recommend\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

Basically its about school girls with special abilities like Vampire, Dullahans, etc. etc. They are faced with problems which they overcome with by the help of one of the teachers Takahashi-Sensei, who is oddly fascinated with them (as such demis). \r\nThe show is a 7 because the artwork was very typical of a high school anime. The story was great but could have been brought out in different ways. I have to admit I enjoyed this series quite a lot. \r\nI would recommend this too anyone who wants a series that is supernatural but, isnt too overthe border. Like how Highschool DxD is very involved, this one is mostly centered around the setting and the development of the characters. This is also where the topic of high school anime comes in. It is basically a highschool harem but instead of the \"high school boy\" its a teacher.\\n",

The main cast (of girls) are monsters(at least they try to make it look like that). Under the pretext of \"studying\" these so called monsters a nice albeit kind of perverted story develops between a shy succubi teacher (because that's obviously the nature of succubi), the monster girls and their male biology teacher. \r\nTo sum it up they all fall for the male biology teacher and he helps them overcome their shy take on life.\r\nI would say it deserves a goif you're up for a laid back show about teen \"monster\" girls who fall in love ever so easily for their teacher. It offers a good break for its easy story, so don't expect some complex and challenging adventures.",

They made one of the finest art and many of their anime are good to watch.\r\nBut this anime is walking in a thin line between disgusting and great. \r\nWhen i first saw the sypnosis of this anime \"a bunch of cutegirls interviewed by an middle aged teacher\" the first thought that comes to my mind is either this is a hentai or harem ecchi anime where the girls ends up being fcked by their pervert shady teacher(i hate these kind of crap) and that is still considered normal in japan society... But then A-1 picture managed to prove that an middle aged sensei can have a normal student teacher relationship without the girls end up getting fucked or kidnapped and they even managed to make the anime interesting and funny to watch! I thought that its strange at first watching sensei and his student getting along well just like how sensei and student should behave... But i like comedy and the comedy in this show is quite good,the art is great and the slice of life was OK. But still sometimes i still feel disgusted when i saw the way that sensei interview the girls.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah for you guys who likes comedy you wont regret watching this...",

And one day at school he met 3 different monsters. And a teacher who is also a monster. There is alot of problems and the teacher tried to help them. But not everybody accepts it.\r\nStory 9: Great story and easy to follow. Its not that the story withcliffhangers.Just a chill story with funny moments in the life of the teacher and students.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8: Just normal anime style art. But why een 8? The art of one student is really great. How the flame is made is just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: Standard opening and ending music. Only the opening clip was really fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9: Ok there are 5 main characters. 1 *cough* normal teacher. And 4 monsters calls themselve Demi. The teacher is just a awesome dude. Very friendly and shows alot of respect to the demi's. Then a vampire child. Great hyper personality and one of my favorites in this serie. The yeah...call it just a headless horseman girl.

            "content": "What seems to be a Slice of Life harem show is in actuality a kind of Special Needs PSA using monster girls as a vehicle to explore these themes. Personally, I don't feel it took the premise far enough - given that there is a lot of deeper cultural baggage & mythologies to explore (and a lot of opportunities for higher poesy if the premise were placed in the hands of a person with a higher vision) rather than just treating the monster girls like mutants. The best episodes comes from when it combines Folklore Study with the scientific mindset of Takahashi in order tochart out the possible ways that the myth could have come about from the biological deviations that the mutations grant (the Yuki-Onna episode). The Dullahan-Quantum Physics episode was also very interesting, although from what I know they probably got it wrong (I remember reading somewhere that 'observation' in a quantum sense doesn't necessarily refer to human observation). What matters is that they went there - which makes it more adventurous than other shows of its type.\\n\\n\r\nPretty comfy show, but needs more of a Monogatari Series or Moryou no Hako touch. Themes are normal self-help stuff about finding identity - but its interesting in that it makes a statement about the classmates needing to accept the differences of the Monster Girls rather than trying to 'make them human'.\\n\\n\r\nI guess this would put it on somewhat the same wavelength as something like Zootopia. Tries to go deeper than the novelty of the premise, but requires a true reach into the unknown, subtle, and nuanced in order to escape from its current level.",

It isn't really that original considering that there are many demi-human highschool or adulthood anime out there like Monster Musume, but this is more cleaner (less innuendos) than the previous mentioned anime.\r\nAlso, I really found the episode where Kyouko goes to university to learn about herself interesting to watch. I could relate to that other intuitive supporting character.\r\nThe art and design is great. I especially like how Kyouko's flames look (not sure if it's because of the colour or the flame itself, but I think it's cool). \r\nThe music used in the intro and the endis fine, and probably would be better if a piano version was made. The voices sync with the characters as well as their expressions. \\n\\n\r\nIt was pretty nice to watch. I didn't like waiting too long to watch another episode after I finished one. However, even if I do like highschool/Demi-human genres, I don't think this would be my preferred anime to watch (I prefer sci-fi, mecha, magic and fantasy).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a great anime.

            "content": "\u201cDon\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\u201d\r\nDid you know that popular quotes? Actually, this word is very valid for this anime. The first time I saw the cover, I\u2019ve really liked this anime. But, for you guys maybe some. For this anime, I really like the casual anime like Slice of Life. This anime really satisfies me. Not too overrated by the factors that make this anime look very interesting to watch.\r\nThe main character in this anime is very interesting for me. Hikari who has a very cheerful nature, Kyouko who looks calm, soft, and not easily offended because of his uniqueness, Yuki is verygloomy at the beginning turned into someone who is friendly, and Satou-sensei is very trying to fight his nature as Succubus. And of course, Takahashi-sensei who has a very academic figure doesn\u2019t assume that he is a hero, and isn\u2019t proud of what he gets. Although initially he was only interested by the Demi just out of personal curiosity. In the end, he turned into sincerity to help the four of them.\\n\\n\r\nThe theme is really interesting and satisfying. Describes the individual Demi and blends curiosity about the nature of the sake and is told in great detail and isn\u2019t over-imposed. In addition to nature for the Demi, in fact, they are influential for the normal human nature. Like Kyouko who has a physical form in his daily activities, Yuki keeps him away from many people, Satou-sensei who has a very rosy relationship about idealism and romance. While Hikari too reveals the human side. And the most important of this anime all the parts that I like, this anime isn\u2019t lead to the element of sexualization.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this anime to the end, the anime has a lot of symbolism about \u201cthose who are less fortunate in some aspects.\u201d For examples like Hikari who has a mental disorder, Kyouko who looks like physically disable, Yuki who has psychological disorders, and Satou-sensei who have abnormalities Sexual. Here, I would not like to offend but apologize if it is offensive.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime has a very deep meaning of life. Like, do not feel prestige or have a negative view of those who have a sense of inadequacy. This insinuation is highly indicated for the general public who accepts them as ordinary people. If in Japan itself, there may still be something like that. Even in countries other than Japan. There is also like helping someone is not enough if only using the heart, but must use the brain as well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the visual, not too good and not too bad either. Bottom line, balanced. The soundtrack is not too bad either, Opening and Ending is very good and very suitable for this anime for me. Her voice was also pretty decent. However, Youko\u2019s most prominent Youko in this anime even though she\u2019s my favorite seiyuu in the anime K-ON!, Junichi Suwabe is also very prominent in this anime considering he also once voiced Aomine Daiki in the anime Kuroko no Basket!.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cInterview With Monster Girls\u201d is a very interesting anime to watch. It\u2019s highly explorative and oriented content also has a very deep moral message about anti-discrimination. For you Slice of Life anime lovers or other casual anime, you can watch this anime.",

            "content": "Demi chan wa kataritai review (As promised)\r\nHave you always wanted to see an anime about monster girls who is not all about aesthetics and big plot but more about the characters and their own life style? Demi chan wa kataritai is an anime that at first glance looks like your typical moe-generic anime setting but on a deeper level it has so much to offer for its viewers.\r\nThe main theme of the anime is to portray the inner struggles of its characters through overcoming them and accepting their own nature. It\u2019s all about finding your own identity and a place to fit in the society. \\n\r\nOur characters aren\u2019t your typical normal high school students ,they are supernatural beings that belong to the legends and myths from different cultures and countries. We have a Dulahan, a Snow woman , a Succubus and finally a Vampire.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime offers an insight on the daily lives of those characters and their struggles to fit in the human world. What\u2019s impressive for this anime is the fact that it never loses his reality approach on each problem of our characters although they belong in the supernatural department. Using psychology , common sense , ethics and physics knowledge the anime goes deeper into the inner struggles of each of our characters to find and understand the root that causes there own problems.\\n\\n\r\nGuiding a student to the right path in life, listening to each of it\u2019s small concerns and helping him overcome them is what a good teacher is supposed to do. It\u2019s not about ethics here the problem but more of common sense , a teacher is a symbol of admiration and respect for its students and the anime puts in discussion this topic. In the Japanese education system a teacher is more like a family member for its students , it dedicates all of his time to understand his students and guide them through life. Sometimes a simple \u201cthank you\u201d is what makes a teacher proud more than the grades his students obtain.\\n\\n\r\nThe transition between the comedy and drama moments is poorly done. Sometimes the emotional atmosphere is ruined by the comic relief acts from the characters.For many people this may not seem a noticeable issue but it affects the overall story it loses some of the dramatical impact delivered for its audience.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion how others perceive you in a society is what usually establishes your own identity. Being different from others is not a bad thing and that\u2019s what this anime tries to deliver to its audience. Understanding what makes you different and accepting your own nature helps you and the ones around you to come to a coexistence.\\n\\n\r\nA 8/10 and damn A-1 made a good anime!\\n",

He tells himself, and everyone else, it's \"scientific\" and that he just wants to know more but he'd do just about anything for a demi. I'm sure he would lick the dirt off their dirty feet if he could. He emits an air of pathetic-ness that nobody in the anime can sense but you as a viewer can easily see. It just feel like watching someone who has wasted their life away so the only funthey can get out of their life is to try to live vicariously through children, which isn't so bad but the children also happened to be freaky demi children that he is into. You can tell how much he wants the demi children from how hard he tries. It's not like it's sexualized in any way but there is just no good explanation for it otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe demis themselves are just typical spoiled anime girls with little twists because they are demi. They are perfectly normal kids who get spoiled because of their \"disability\". And then this 40 year old guy, who isn't related to them, being super into them is just the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a pretty fun anime for the first half when you don't feel like this guy is nearly as pathetic and try hard but eventually it's painfully apparent that he tries too hard. And at that point, you just have ask yourself why he does it. And the answer has to just be that he is into freaky demi children. I mean this guy is way too considerate and kind to these kids. It's like he spends his whole day and night thinking of how to \"help\" them. As someone watching from afar, it just becomes weird.",

Awkward in a way that it pulls elements straight from harem anime and is a driving force behind most story elements, yet nothing ever comes of it.\r\nTo me it feels like at some point in the creators mind, it was supposed to be a harem anime. However it was altered it so that it was more \"marketable\" with only remnants remaining... Yet still being prominent in character development and storytelling.\r\nThe timescale also seems to be strange, mostlybecause there is no solid indication of time. A simple calendar with the month shown and the day(s) of the episode marked could have solved everything. Compounded when a character monologues about the previous \"year\" as the next year starts. That could be said about alot of \"slice of life\" anime though.\\n\\n\r\nI do have to give it props though. No school festival tresh.",

            "content": "Overall - 6:\r\nThis show was a passable for a chill slice of life with some fantasy elements, and at times it could be kinda funny, but it didn't really go beyond that. There were some issues with the way the set up played out.\r\nStory - 5:\r\nThe story was alright. But one of the issues with it is that the main character is a teacher, and all of the students develop feelings for him in one way or another. He does right by trying to avoid their advances (to a certain extent), but they play up them making a move on him and then someone seeingor finding out about it leading to a misunderstanding. This is overdone.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the episodes try to have a bit of a more serious tone as the characters deal with some problems they face, but, at least for me, the problems they encountered didn't seem all that bad, especially for how much they played it up. \\n\\n\r\nThe setup of the main character being intrigued by the demi-humans is good because it allows him to fill the shoes of the viewer who is also unfamiliar with demi-humans and would want to ask questions as well.\\n\\n\r\nThey also sometimes set up some new characters or raise some questions that don't get addressed very well, this happened not once but twice, and it definitely feels unsatisfying when it happens.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 5:\\n\r\nTypical anime art, nothing particularly good or bad about it (except for this really jaring 3d water from one of the later episodes that just felt so out of place, but it only lasted for like 30 seconds max, so I'm not going to take off points for that.)\\n\\n\r\nSound - 3:\\n\r\nBoring soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6:\\n\r\nI thought the most of the characters were kinda boring, nothing too bad about them, I just wasn't too interested.\\n\\n\r\nTakahashi is a decent protagonist with only being guilty of lacking any sort of flaws and therefore personal growth throughout the series. He's the protagonist, but the show really isn't about him. I like his inquisitive nature and tendency to get lost in thought.\\n\\n\r\nSatou is by far the best character in this series. She has struggles, goals, and growth through the series. My biggest issue is that she didn't get the screen time she deserved. She had like 1.5 episodes about her, which was just enough to set up her powers, struggles, and goals. Unfortunately nothing much came of her in the end, which was quite disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7:\\n\r\nDespite its flaws I did like watching it, I just feel like anything this show did has been done better in some aspect.",

            "content": "It is a relaxing, relatively calm slice of life show without much of dramatic events in it. It didn't really \"click\" for me, but it is a good show and it is worth watching. \r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory:\r\nThe story is a fairly calm one, pretty much without much drama. There was one awkward place where the story tried to make events more dramatic, but it quickly gave up on doing that. The pacing and overall mood resembles shows like Yuyushiki, \"Flying Witch\" or that one show which depicted life of banking workers (which name eludes me).The story mostly concentrate on character's antics, and while events happenin order, there really isn't much of an overarching plot with a grand end goal. So, just a slice of life anime with some comedy.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nArt is fairly low detailed (still, not as bad as faces were, say, in Mahouka), but animation is quite good. Hikari is very well animated and moved in quite fluid manner, she is interesting to watch. The protagonist, however, looks a bit odd and something about his face doesn't look right. Overall it is mostly a cuter designs of characters, with some quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe girls are interesting to watch, even though they're fairly stereotypical and without complex motives. Basically, they act mostly for the purpose of advancing story. The protagonist is really odd in comparison to them, because he displays very little character aside from having interest in talking to \"demi\" (which is never explained). Basically, it is almost as if he got no personality. Still the girls are interesting enough, and when they get screen time, they counterbalance oddness of the protagonist of the story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyement:\\n\r\nIt was interesting enough to watch, just it wasn't quite what I needed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI'd recommend to watch this if you're looking for a light-hearted show that doesn't have tons of drama to it, and provides some light entertainment. It is somewhat similar to \"Flying witch\" or \"yuyushiki\", so if you liked those, you'll probably like this one too.  If you want gore, drama, fanservice and epic fights, though, you'll need something else.",

There is of course moe-effect but it is contained in perfect amount for this kind of anime so everything doesn't seem \"sugarcoatedly moe\". This really is a less ecchi kind of monster girl anime compared to monster musume. Both are great animes on their own accord and because they have developed and enjoyable characters that go through everyday life situations and it is really eye-opening to have things looked from different aspects. That physics explanation for dullahans neck was a really funny and intriguing(studie physicsin university level).  And also for example how legends about these demis could have been formed through ages and how and why those stories have or don't have \"real\" basis. Eye-opening in such way that there are people in this world too that have special needs or differences that affect their lives in such ways that they are \"similar\" to those depicted in this anime. This really could also make people think how to improve and help those people like sensei does here.\\n\\n\r\nSo this animes good handling of multiple chars. and warmth radiating atmosphere make this a joy to watch. It's a slice of life anime and it does not drag much so it is light and it handles important real life issues neatly so I give it a solid 8/10.",

            "content": "A-1 took a premise that feels destined to be treated poorly/wasted and instead kept it consistently interesting and entertaining.\r\nIn general, each episode tries to deal with an issue with society using Demis as a metaphor (poor memory so e.g. ep.12, treating certain people differently). But rather than preaching for a certain view, the topic is discussed and usually ended with a \"well, we'll see where this goes\" -- because Demis have yet to integrate fully. Doesn't feel like a cop-out, doesn't feel like a sermon.\r\nHonestly, this is the most perfectly *just good* show I've seen in a long time. Along the same lines as SeitokaiYakuindomo S1 and maybe Hitsugi no Chaika (IIRC): the first few episodes lay out what the viewer should be expecting, and the rest of the series fulfills it very honestly. For that reason, enjoyment is the more important factor in this review. To cover the other points:\\n\\n\r\n  * Story is simple, cute, & characters are introduced one at a time in the first few episodes.\\n\r\n  * Nice art, nothing that stood out for better or worse. Environments could be rather bland.\\n\r\n  * Average OP/ED biz, BGM did its job (again, didn't stand out)\\n\r\n  * Takahashi-sensei is RIPPED.\\n\\n\r\nGood premise made great. 8 <- great show, tons of fun, but *outstanding* in very few ways, so not worth a 9. Worth a watch if you're looking for a short, simple comedy/slice-of-life series.",

            "content": "Vampires suck blood because of the myths and legends right?\r\nDullahans are the harbingers of death because of myths and legends right? \r\nSnow Women put curses on you because of myths and legends right? \r\nSuccubus' seduce because they can because of myths and legends right?\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai sees these monsters in a more different light making the actual notion of having interview with monster girls a unique and comedic watch.\r\nIf this anime is anything to go by title, the anime is essentially talking and more talking, nothing more, the unique \"flavour\" to all this talking comes from are looking at the different light of \"common\" monsters,be it playing against the type or using the monsters mythology and using it in a clever way at looking at monsters (be it through science or common sense on the part of monsters' behaviour) to it's advantage through usual comedic stances. Due to this, the characters are developed heavily, especially Yuki Kusakabe voiced by Shiina Natsukawa the snow woman and a little later on Sakie Satou voiced by Yoko Hikasa the succubus but the other main cast like Hikari Takanashi voiced by Kaede Hondo the vampire, Kyouko Machi voiced by Minami Shinoda the dullahan, Himari Takanashi voiced by Lynn, Hikari's twin sister and the main protagonist Tetsuo Takahashi voiced by Junichi Suwabe get a bit of disguised development through many of the banters the characters with each other (not just with Tetsuo mind you). \\n\\n\r\nSo going by characters, LA will just say it immediately but LA's favourite character went to Sakie Satou and no it's not because of her being a succubus (but still her natural beauty is a great bonus nonetheless *cough*), but she along with Hikari getting the best comedic skits in the anime for LA. Sakie's comedy revolves around her aphrodisiac effects on Tetsuo and BOTH of their overexaggrated expressions are comedic good albeit a running gag and outside of Tetsuo, she DOES talk about Tetsuo or her succubus effects to the other main casts with very hilarious moments. Hikari is probably the most dynamic of the main cast as she not only is the genkiest character of the series, but she like Sakie and Tetsuo interacts with the rest of the cast and she even gets serious and heartfelt especially during Yuki's opening arc. On speaking of Yuki, she is probably the next best character, as her being a snow woman, yes she is awfully shy at first but once she opens up and finishes her opening arc, she gains a very great personality and even better chemistry with the rest of the cast afterwords (with usually her running gag of laughing or trying to keep in her laughter from stupid puns). Kyouko Machi the dullahan has some stellar visually comedic moments (you can tell from the possibilities of being dullahan) also with her \"being a dullahan and her many features\" to her behaviour also makes light, again like the rest of the cast, she has great character chemistry. Next is Himari, Hikari's human twin sister, the stern yet loving sister to Hikari as well as having a rather tsundere relationship with Tetsuo, ashing out on him whenever Hikari tricks Himari into thinking Tetsuo has done something lewd to her and really her relationship with Hikari is a focal point in the anime in HAVING a \"monster girl\" as a family member, with hijinks ensuing at the same time prior thanks to Hikari. Finally we get to Tetsuo who is essentially both the catalyst and the reactant to most of the anime as a whole and he too has great character chemistry, from his awkward talks with Hikari and Kyouko to fun experiments with Yuki to his talks with Sakie about her being a succubus and her fanserviced effects on Tetsuo. LA will remind you that Tetsuo relationships with Hikari, Yuki and Kyouko are taken is a sorta harem way, HOWEVER he is still a genuine teacher to them and cares for them just not in the harem sense, Sakie is the only exception as she's a teacher just like Tetsuo is thus kinda makes sense they are pushing THAT more than Kyouko or Hikari, also to that point LA wouldn't mind Tetsuo and Sakie getting together, it's the most LOGICAL out of the bunch in LA's eyes.  Aside from Tetsuo's character chemistry, he does get a bit of character development later on, mainly about his overreaching help towards the demi's and his dilemma if his help is isolating the demi instead of familiarizing the demis with humans more other than himself. What can LA say but the character cast are very dynamic and LA said this countless times, but the cast has great chemistry with one another and is probably the main reason to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation done by A1-Pictures and the animation is actually pretty polished and very detailed to say the least, from the bright and poppy character designs to the beautiful backgrounds and even with it's comedic moments, sure it uses chibi faces at times but those faces are still in place of the detailed character designs at the same time and it can still be used to great effect due to the comedic timing, thus the animation is actually a great standout...nice job A1-Pictures.\\n\\n\r\nWith the great characters, the voice cast in it's entirety is amazing, what else can LA say, it felt like the voice cast knew the characters rather than the other way around. LA's favourite character goes to...pointing out the obvious...Yoko Hikasa. But still some standouts are Kaede Hondo as Hikari, Minami Shinoda as Kyouko, Shiina Natsukawa as Yuki and Junichi Suwabe as Tetsuo so yeah...the entire main cast.\\n\\n\r\nNow, LA kinda needs to point out the elephant in the room, that being Demi-chan wa Kataritai's relationship with it's more *ahem* suave older brother anime Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou and LA will say the obvious but the fanservice compared to Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou is a bit more mature and slightly used for comedic effect (see Sakie for the obvious), saying the god damn obvious, but if you wanted see a less fanservice hell anime vers. of Monster Musume no Iru Nichjou, then this is an obvious pick, especially wanting to know a bit more of the world of Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou. LA will note that Demi-chan wa Kataritai still HAS fanservice and isn't just omitted and limited to Sakie, there's sprinkles of fanservice here and there but not to the point of what Monster Musume no Iri Nichijou takes it to.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any flaws LA would list out (as much as LA is praising this anime), LA would just point out that if you think that Hikari is too hyper genki and on speaking of which, Hikari herself \"flirts\" with Tetsuo though it's taken for comedy so take that like you will, LA just more or less rolled LA's eyes at that notion but knew it was SUPPOSE to taken for comedy and was only used ONCE, anyways Hikari might get slightly annoying nonetheless. The most obvious flaw (which LA needs to point this flaw out, it's rather an opinion than a solid flaw) is that it's just an anime about comedic talking, nothing more and that can deter some of the audience.\\n\\n\r\nDemi-chan wa Kataritai is a slight surprise of Winter 2017 for LA, merely due to how a simple premise can do so much with it and even get serious about certain matters (supernatural racism, \"just being yourself\" and pre-conceived notions can hurt) and the best strength LA has been constantly praising is of it's characters and their chemistry with one another. If you want to see a good punchline comedy anime with a more \"heart\" to it and greatly developed cast, then Demi-chan wa Kataritai is one to watch.",

            "content": "Demi-chan wa Kataritai is probably one of the more realistic approach towards co-existing with supernatural beings in our daily lives.\r\nThe show is brimming with cute and interesting dialogues between Takahashi Tetsuo and the Demi-chans. It is amazing how the it simply never bores me with how the show manages  to continue stay interesting even though it is a Slice of Life, not many SoL animes I've seen done that, it can be comparable with 2 of the most interesting SoL animes I've watched which are Gin no Saji and Uchuu Kyoudai though the latter wouldn't really be considered in the same SoL category asDemi-chan. \\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting part of the anime are the topics talked about and how it hints many human psychology. How the Demis have trivial problems yet, it creates a huge problem in their social lives.\\n\r\nFor example, Machi, the Dullahan girl. Even though she has no personal problem with conversing and travelling as she is used to her problem of carrying her head around, it still manages to cause awkwardness between people who aren't experiencing the same things as her. Others fear asking about Machi's troubles as they're afraid of offending Machi despite the fact that isn't the case at all for Machi. \\n\r\nHinting that how people make up assumption towards what offends others  when they have no real understanding of that person, and act towards avoiding that certain topic.\\n\r\nThe show even threw in another part whereas when Hikari, another Demi, can casually ask about how Machi's head can be troublesome to move around with, yet other non-demi immediately felt uncomfortable as it has been the topic they have been avoiding to avoid offending Machi, but when they realized it isn't the case, they could casually join in on the conversation. \\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show excels in at showing how Takahashi Tetsuo, slowly manages to understand and provide support for each and every Demi in the school and how he has to help them breach that social barrier between them and the Non-demis. Making this show a very relaxing, but interesting one to watch because we as the audience get to experience the interaction firsthand between Tetsuo and the Demis. Really proving the title to make sense as Interview with Monster-girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the Comedy kickass, it's really funny and has sometimes have underlying dirty jokes. Characters are cute as hell and never fails to put a smile on my face. But what really makes this show stand out for me is how Heartwarming this show is. It teaches us a life lesson which is what Slice of Life anime should be all about.\\n",

I don't usually watch this genre of anime and I don't remember how I happen to come upon it, yet I will admit I enjoy watching this show. Reading some of the reviews make me question why some attempt to take the show to seriously, there are no major plot points and that's okay. What makes the show great are it's characters. Yes the teacher might be a little to \"hands ons\" yet it's a fictional show based on Demi-humans, normal relationships get thrown out the window. The star of the showis a young vampire named Hikari, who you can't helped to be drawn to and chuckle at all her little quirks and habits. The writing and voice over work behind her is excellent, which brings me to my next suggestion. Stay away from the dub, I love dubs for most shows but this isn't one of them. The original voice overs are what makes this show enjoyable.",

It hit the heart more than I thought it would. The girls in the anime have stories and problems that I personally understand. It's nice to see that over the course of the anime that they can work and find ways to overcome their weaknesses. I wished that the story could have shown more screen time with the humans perspective on the monster girls and gave certain characters more screen time. Iwould definitely recommend this anime to anyone who loves a calm story that really stirs up emotions. And I saw 13 episodes on Crunchyroll so I don't know if there's been a mistake on MAL, but there is 13 not 12 like it says. Oh and the anime had a beautiful ending and was overall a beautiful anime.",

He tells himself, and everyone else, it's \"scientific\" and that he just wants to know more but he'd do just about anything for a demi. I'm sure he would lick the dirt off their dirty feet if he could. He emits an air of pathetic-ness that nobody in the anime can sense but you as a viewer can easily see. It just feel like watching someone who has wasted their life away so the only funthey can get out of their life is to try to live vicariously through children, which isn't so bad but the children also happened to be freaky demi children that he is into. You can tell how much he wants the demi children from how hard he tries. It's not like it's sexualized in any way but there is just no good explanation for it otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nThe demis themselves are just typical spoiled anime girls with little twists because they are demi. They are perfectly normal kids who get spoiled because of their \"disability\". And then this 40 year old guy, who isn't related to them, being super into them is just the whole show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, it was a pretty fun anime for the first half when you don't feel like this guy is nearly as pathetic and try hard but eventually it's painfully apparent that he tries too hard. And at that point, you just have ask yourself why he does it. And the answer has to just be that he is into freaky demi children. I mean this guy is way too considerate and kind to these kids. It's like he spends his whole day and night thinking of how to \"help\" them. As someone watching from afar, it just becomes weird.\\n",

Unlike the other particularly similar anime to this one which is... well you already know the infamous title of it, this one was not centered around fan service. What drew me to watching this was my interest in mythical creatures and legends and this anime successfully executed and did not leave the premise to which the plot promises. The plot of this was well balanced and there were no unnecessary elements that would ruin this genre. I can hardly complain about anything that seemed wrong in this anime. Soif you like the genre of monster girls in the modern society, you won't be disappointed with this one!\\n\\n\r\nStory 10/10: Story was going well and it hints for a sequel. The plot was nice.Don't worry there was also a bit of PLOT in here too! \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10: A-1 pictures certainly did not slack off much in this project of theirs. The Art style is indeed from A-1 pictures. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: The main character isn't your particular teenage harem boy who gets really nervous during times and is only forced most of the time by his surroundings. What you get here is an adult with experience and doesn't f**k around. There are some cliche characters but what would be a story without those?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: If you're tired of ecchi being forced on monster girls, then you will enjoy this. But it kinda feels different now that the ecchi element is lessened in this anime. Still... there are still some remnants of it no matter how faint. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10: Indeed the anime was slow because because the character development here takes its time for sure. But since the episodes feel short there might sure be a sequel. This anime won't be a waste of time so you should try it!",

            "content": "Hello, this is my first review. I may miss some points, but just please hear me through! I stumbled upon this anime by recommendation, and decided it looked decent enough to give it a try. Demi-chan wa Kataritai is a fairly short, enjoyable anime, but lacked certain elements and a real plot.\r\nStory:\r\nI think the story is what I disliked most about this anime, as there was no real storyline. Sure, it's cool, four demis together at the same school. But nothing really happens except the demis making friends and accepting their true nature. I suppose it was just a little boring, in my opinion.\r\nArt:\r\nThe artwas very beautiful, everything animated very nicely. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSound, ahh, the sound! The sound was great, especially the theme songs! The opening song makes me very happy, I really love it! The ending song is nice, too, but especially the opening. The other aspects of sound were good too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe characters were all very interesting, different, and unique. Hikari especially, she's fun. There aren't actually very many characters in this anime, but all were well done and have colorful personalities. They all had good character development, Kusakabe and Machi especially. They both started off quite shy. They would have been good characters even if they weren't demis, but their demi natures certainly helped.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, I really did. But I wouldn't call it one of my favorite animes, due to one fact. It was often boring. Just a lot of sitting around, studying the demi girls. I've mentioned this before though, and it's not fair to say that this anime didn't have any interesting moments. There were plenty. Just not enough for me to enjoy it more. ( There were some really nice heartwarming moments though<3 )\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, it was very good. Solid eight. It was a fun, enjoyable anime, and I'd be nice to see more like it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Demi-chan wa Kataritai has an excellent angle. Monster folk have sprung into the world, or at least into public consciousness, through poorly understood means. These means are typically alluded to throughout the story in various character interactions, and aren't always fully understood by the characters themselves.\r\nThat sounds like a criticism. I assure you it is not. By leaving the broader circumstances of the setting as a point of ambiguous mystery, the story is magnified onto Tetsuo Takahashi and his Monster girl students. If I have any broad criticism of anime as an entire medium, is that it often lacks focus. Demi-chan wa Kataritai, if anything,is extremely focused. Ordinary high school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi wants to understand the physiology of Monsters, as well as how they fit in with human students. An anthropological study almost. By keeping the nucleus of the series so deeply focused on its cast individual lives, it can avoid having to world build to large extents. The series also cleverly adds some world details through character interactions in a subtle manner. It works quite well.\\n\\n\r\nI reiterate, this is a good angle. I also reiterate, it keeps it's focus well. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are quality as well. There is no melodrama that is typically found in Shoujo anime. The most dramatic situation involves Yuki Kusakabe, resident Snow Woman (more on her later), and it is far from melodramatic. The four main monster girls Hikari (Vampire), Sakie Satou (Succubus teacher), Kyouko Machi (Dullahan), and aforementioned Yuki Kusakabe (SNow WOman) all have distinct personalities, and are each individually endearing in their own ways.  They have down to earth struggles that keep the series honed in on it's wholesome situations that will illicit chuckles from any audience. This pairs well with Takahashi's genuine enthusiasm for his work and his students, which is a very infectious character trait. \\n\\n\r\nSo with such high praise? Why a 6? Before I continue, I will submit that it was almost a 7. The show hinges on it's quality cast, so the show essentially lives and dies on them and them alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe issue largely lay in character development of said characters. I blame this on the meager 12 episode format, but the only character that develops significantly is Yuki. The process of Yuki's development from the beginning to the end is very well handled. The cast's role in her development is also up to snuff.\\n\\n\r\nBut she is the only one. The other characters subsist to the final episode on charm alone, but they are all fairly static with the exception of Yuki. It feels underwhelming for such a stellar cast to ultimately be so static. Granted, I noted quite early that the episode count was only 12 and that things were moving quite slowly about half way through. In this sense, I was thoroughly braced for the lack of development.\\n\\n\r\nWhat dunked this charming series from a 7 to a 6 was the pitiful final episode. The charm was still there, but the audience is ultimately left with nothing to chew on. The episode retains the charm, with it's character focus being Sakie. But here is the rub: She is dealing with the same struggle she has experienced the entire series and still makes no progress. The episode than meanders into Scooby-Doo antics for the remaining half, followed by a vague sentiment of a promising future into a starry festival sky.\\n\\n\r\nI know the previous paragraphs threatens to fly in the face of the \"no spoilers\" guideline, but that description could describe almost every underwhelming shoujo/rom-com ending in anime:\\n\\n\r\n- Vague feel good sentiment\\n\r\n- Nothing happens\\n\\n\r\nThe lack of development across the entire cast can be attributed to external issues such as the short season. The underwhelming final note is the result of writing and decision making, and is unfortunately what kept Demi-chan wa Kataritai from being a little better. It's obviously unrealistic for any story to tie up EVERY loose end so concisely, but I just needed a PIECE of character advancement in those final moments to get a sense of satisfaction. I was denied this. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I am recommending this series. Anything above average (i.e. above a 5) is worth watching in my opinion. These characters will capture your attention only to let you down somewhat. But they are still charming and the show has a solid angle to approach it's subject matter. I hope the series gets a second season. I will definitely watch because I overall enjoyed the series, but also because I suspect that the character development issue could be solved with more episodes to flesh out the story.\\n",

            "content": "Interviews With Monster Girls is a highly enjoyable slice of life series. If you came here looking for another Monster Musume, look elsewhere. The series has a simple premise of 'how do demi-humans fit into regular human society?' It is a joy to see each character emerge from their shells as they learn how to live with their peculiar abilities. Ultimately the show is a social commentary about how difficult it is to adjust yourself to a new environment. Despite this underlying theme, warmth and happiness still fill the entire scope of this show.\r\nThe characters are this shows strong point and all of them arehighly engaging and unique individuals. This is the type of show where it becomes very difficult to choose a 'best girl'. From vampires to dullahans each character has a defining trait that makes them a joy to watch. If you've ever wondered how a dullahan would live with a separated head, you'll be pleasantly surprised to see how adorable it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe student-teacher relationships present in the show drive the progression of the story and you can be assured that no romances take place here. The true romance lies with another teacher, who is a succubus. This leads to all sorts of hilarious scenarios where she must evaluate whether or not she is experiencing true love. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to feel happy, I definitely recommend watching this show.",

Far more tasteful than similar shows in the same vein (Rosario + Vampire, Monster Misume). While there is a vampire it's not often that I see Dullachans/Headless Horsemen in anime's and that's a unique twist. The series seemed like a metaphor for understand and accepting people in society with disabilities and in that regard I think they knocked it out the park. A solid first season that I look forward to expansion on, not the normal style of anime I watch and still very enjoyable as I was able to getthrough the season in a only a few days.  I watched the English dub on FUNimation and felt the voices all fit the characters well.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nAfter finishing Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maids I wasn't sure what this anime could give me that would be in the area of adorable characters, but surprisingly enough this was still a very good anime which had it's own bundle of laughs.\r\nThe story begins with Tetsuo Takahashi who is a biology teacher that is also very interested in Demi-Humans and to his surprise there happen to be 4 of them at his high school so of course he wouldn't pass this up to know more about them.\r\nI honestly liked the story for this show it was interesting founding out more about the Demi-girls andtheir kinds history as it takes well known myths like do Vampires hate Garlic, how Dullahan's eat even though their head is separate from the body, what causes a Snow girl to create ice particles and even how strong a Succubus's temptation is , it was very interesting founding out these facts and how informative the show was instead of having to rely on comedy which it had, but wasn't shoved in your face like some anime's.\\n\r\nIt was also nice seeing the Demi-girls relationship grow with Tetsuo who wanted to know more about them and also help fit more into human society since of course there would be complications from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great each of the Demi-girls felt unique and had great chemistry together which made you feel like you want to be good friends with them, they ranged from Hikari the Vampire who isn't really into blood sucking and more nibbling your arm, Machi a kind and very self-less Dullahan, Yuki a shy but funny Snow Girl and Miss Satou a very desperate Succubus.\\n\r\nThe way these characters were was great I loved the jokes that happened from time to time and I was really into the experiments Tetsuo would do to prove theories from myths and legends about their kind to see whether they were true or not, it was also interesting seeing how they fit in human society since each of them has something that can impact their life and make things difficult at times.\\n\r\nI really liked Tetsuo as well he was a cool teacher someone you'd definitely want watching your back or having a nice conversation with and I really liked the development of the relationship between teacher and student.\\n\\n\r\nThere is hints at times of Romance like Miss Satou falling for Tetsuo because she thought her succubus powers didn't affect him even though they did and despite how weird it was Machi also developed a crush on Tetsuo, but luckily this was just one of those high school crushes that doesn't really go anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artstyle was very familiar to SAO and it isn't a surprise since it was made by A-1 pictures whose characters do have a familiar feel to them, I liked the OP to this anime too it was catchy and nicely represented the girls in their demi-human area.\\n\\n\r\nThis was a very fun anime to watch if you're into anime where the main character aren't technically human much like Monster Musume or Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maids then you can add this to the collection except it feels more mature and is much more informative compared to those two so I'd definitely consider this a fun watch.",

            "content": "Remember when vampires were supposed to be scary? Yeah, me neither.\r\nStory:\r\nTakahashi is a biology teacher with great interest in demi-humans (basically mythical creatures), but there aren\u2019t that many around to study. Luckily for him, it turns out that three students as well as a teacher in his school are in fact demi-humans, so he proceeds to interview them in the name of science. I could not foresee which direction this plot would take, but I expected it to become either an ecchi harem with tons of cringe or a wacky comedy. In the end, it decided to be a relaxing slice of life show withsome comedy for good measure, which is probably the best way to go for Demi-chan. It was also a good idea to handle the demi-humans as people rather than species, which quite some fantasy stories love to do. One might expect this show to tackle the subject of potential racism as well, but that only gets touched slightly. I think that\u2019s for the better, as this is not a drama and another anime might do a better work with this matter. We also have one of the students as well as the succubus teacher being infatuated with Takahashi, but thankfully this never gets the main focus. In total, this show knows what it is and more importantly, it knows what it isn\u2019t. If something prevents it from being great, it\u2019s the slow pacing (which does not equal being boring, mind you).\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nDemi-chan is not as colorful as other slice of life/comedy anime out there, but that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. The show goes for \u201crealism\u201d (for the lack of a better word), in the sense that there is no magical abilities or any such thing. Everybody is quite normal, with the exception of the demi-humans having some physical differences (granted, Machi is a borderline case). Unfortunately Demi-chan also takes some liberties when it comes to wide-angle shots, where everything turns a little mushy. Besides that the show looks fine to me. They went for a flashy effect with the pool water in the final episode, which is really nice to look at, but wasn\u2019t really necessary.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAll the voice actors do a solid to good job. Takahashi sounds like the nice \u201cdaddy\u201d type of guy and all the girls are playing their archetypes well. Even the side-characters like Satake sound pretty good. I didn\u2019t really know any of the seiyuus (which doesn\u2019t say much, since I\u2019m rather ignorant when it comes to individual praise and remembering their names) with the exception of Sora Amamiya, who I didn\u2019t even recognize, which could be considered a good thing I guess. The opening song was okay, though a little too low-key for my taste. It does fit the atmosphere of the anime, so I\u2019m not complaining. I really enjoyed the ending however, which was very relaxing and upbeat. The soundtrack in general was like this and worked well in combination with everything else.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nTakashi is an eager teacher, who passionately studies demi-humans, but unlike a scientist, he is very interested in the sociological side of the subject. He tries his best to treat the girls as normal people instead of fascinating freaks of nature (which may sound cruel, but technically, that\u2019s what they are). He also struggles with balancing his research and his actual job, afraid that he might favor the demis over his other students. He is a very likeable guy who has noble motives while being passionate nonetheless.\\n\r\nHikari is his first vict\u2026I mean, interview partner. She was born a vampire, though she doesn\u2019t fit many of the classical vampire tropes. She is a very energetic one and loves to have some fun. But where others of her kind get tiresome after a while, Hikari never crosses that line. She is a really kind girl, always willing to go out of her way to help others and make things more fun for them. Except maybe her sister, but siblings are a whole different matter anyway.\\n\r\nMachi was the one character who did not click with me. I thought she was just too\u2026plain. That\u2019s kinda odd, since one of the points of this anime was that the demi-humans are normal people character-wise. But if everybody else has an interesting quirk or something like that, being just there makes you fall flat in my eyes.\\n\r\nYuki starts out as a depressed little fellow who cannot comprehend her inhuman nature, but after having \u201cthe talk\u201d (just kidding) with Takahashi-sensei, she warms up (pun intended) to her fellow students. Contrary to the first impression she leaves, she has a wacky side to her, being somewhat of a covert pervert and unable to contain her laughter when hearing very bad, lame puns. I didn\u2019t care much for her Saddy McSadface introduction (which probably makes me a horrible person), but later on I started to like her a little.\\n\r\nLast but not least we have Sakie-sensei, a succubus who is ashamed of the effect she has on others and which makes her life as a teacher complicated. She has a huge crush on Takashi and starts behaving like a schoolgirl whenever he\u2019s around (or when she\u2019s at home fantasizing about him). It\u2019s really cute to see her trying to seduce him without using her pheromones or being too pushy. She also does a fine job as a big sister mentor for the demi girls, because as a teenage girl you don\u2019t want to discuss everything with a male teacher.\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is of no big importance and does what they have to to move the story along. Most of them turn out to be nice people in the end, after all, this is a cozy anime at its core.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDemi-chan is a nice little show that is easy to consume, relaxing and at times funny. The cast is full of nice people (mostly) and it\u2019s a joy to see everybody having a good time. I don\u2019t think that I will remember much about it in a year or so, but if anybody should ask me about it I\u2019ll probably say \u201cOh yeah, I liked that show\u201d. In a weaker season this may have even been my AOTS, but with shows like KonoSuba 2 and Kobayashi running the comedy and slice of life departments this winter, Demi-chan may appear a little weaker in comparison. It\u2019s still a solid recommendation for anyone who wants to spend some time watching something with good vibrations.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.8/10",

            "content": "Basically the Monster Musume without the weird fetish fuel in it. Does it make it any better? Well.. It is at least somewhat tolarable to watch through if you ignore some of the things like:\r\n1)Avarage cast at best:\r\nSo far we have:\r\n* Demi-human students and some of their family (We have only been properly introduced to Hirari's family on the series whatsoever)\r\n* Bunch of forgettable students and teachers(where there even any other teacher beside of Tetsuo and Satou?)\r\n* A head teacher that has absolutely no contribution to the show\r\n* Other authority figure that... just being there.\r\n* That German(?) kid.. Umm how long was he even relevant?A few seconds?\\n\\n\r\n2)Awkward teacher-student relationship:\\n\r\nI never understood the motivation behind Tetsuo \"researching\" or \"interviewing\" demises in the first place. It isn't really weird to have the curiosty to know humanoid species at all. But giving it an \"interview\" or \"research\" excuse just doesn't give me good vibes.. (at least he admits this was an excuse, not that it makes things any better but hey, honesty!)\\n\r\nIt isn't really odd for a teacher to have some favourite students to talk or even take a jab at, but their relationship kinda goes beyond the limit and it is mildly unsettling.\\n\\n\r\n3)A world setting as deep as a puddle of water:\\n\r\nHow does this poorly constructed human - demi-human politics works at all, it beats me. Similar cringey racial tension setting can be seen in RWBY's faunus thingy for instance. At least they tried to be more realistic on RWBYs setting. Even Monster Musume has somehow a bit more sense in it. They show it like the racism is molted.. or something. Doesn't explain how and why.\\n\\n\r\n*Tiny spoilers from different episodes ahead*\\n\\n\r\n4)The unreasonable ignorance of the students at the school not wanting to learn even a tiny bit of culture demises have:\\n\r\nOn the entire god damn school only one human being wants to know shit about \"demises\".. This is way beyond painful to accept none of other students decided to- you know at least try to learn HOW DOES THE DULLAHAN SHIT WORK AT ALL. I could somehow swallow this nonsense. But then they decided to package that important point with other students being friends with demises in just one episode. This is not how you conclude shit gentlemen.\\n\\n\r\n5)Trying to make sense:\\n\r\nOh, speaking of the Dullahan's decapitated head thingy. Yes, they actually tried to explain it in one episode with le science, wormholes, magic, spirituality(so science here) and unrelated quantum physics.. Just no.. Stop. It is beyond terrible.\\n\\n\r\n6)And last but the worst of all:\\n\r\nTHE LAST EPISODE WAS A FUCKING BEACH EPISODE(IN THIS CASE IT WAS POOL. WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SAME THING). You can just see how much they didn't try at that point\\n\\n\r\n*Spoilers over*\\n\\n\r\nIt is possible to ignore these tiny aspects and enjoy the show. I didn't see any problem with the animation or sound. But allas, the show is just bland and has no framework. The teacher-student relationship has been executed really... incoherently.",

            "content": "The worst thing about this series is that the basic premise gives almost everyone who has seen shows with similar set ups a horrible preconceived notion about how this show will play out.\r\nI'll say this now: This is far more than a monster girl school-life harem, and has a level of character depth and genre awareness that screams \"It sucks that other authors trashed what could have been something interesting.\"\r\nWhat initially stood out to me was that they took every opportunity to subvert the typical harem bullshit you'll get in the likes of Highschool DxD and all that, and not in the To Love-ru waywhere they turn it up to 11 and say \"Deal with it\". That isn't to say there's no fanservice, but it's even more tasteful with it's delivery and presentation than other A-1 Pictures such as Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that made me completely fall in love with this series, though, is the portrayal of adults as...well...adults. In most other school-based anime, the teachers and parents will all be either cartoonishly strict and intolerant, or just as immature as the students around them. Rarely is there a teacher or parent who feels as real as they do in this series.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, the parents of the Demi's aren't just your average couple. It's obvious from their first appearance (and their behaviors towards the characters) that they exist as their own people outside of the immediate story. In addition, they are genuinely concerned and thoughtful towards the \"conditions\" that their children were born with (more on that in a moment). \\n\\n\r\nThe teachers also feel like genuine role models and guides for the children of the school. Even the Vice Principle who is played up as a sort of \"villain\" later on is shown immediately to have very real and very understandable reasons for his actions and choices, acting with the students' best interest in mind and not because the series feels the need to have a villain.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all that, though, they decide to take an interesting approach on the whole \"Demi-human\" thing. Demis aren't just monsters born from other monsters. In this universe, being a Demi-human is a sort of genetic defect that people can be born with (For exaplme, Hikari is a Vampie, but her twin sister Himari is completely normal.) Not only does this add the extra question of \"Are they still human, really?\" but it also adds in the question of \"Do they WANT to be treated like a normal human?\"\\n\\n\r\nWith so many concepts to explore, you'd think that they would fall flat on that. But no. They frequently go into great detail about the conditions the demis have, and how many superstitions surrounding their demi-human race may have come about as a result, but it never feels like a gigantic info dump. It's worked seamlessly into the demi's own development, or other character's  development in understanding and reaching out to the demis.\\n\\n\r\nThere is so much more I could say about this, but I'll just say that it's a shame A-1 Pictures picked this up and not some other studio. The Art and Music are really the only detriments to this series, but even so, they aren't bad. I'm just tired of the same A-1 Picture's face plastered everywhere on their works. That's why I'm still giving this series a 9 out of 10 and a definite recommendation.",

And that's not a bad thing.\r\nStory - 7/10\r\nA good guy opens up to the different people and befriends them. Different as in physically different, as in not human. It's not completely original, but it did put a spin on the monster girl trope, especially after Monster Musume...ugh. The character interactions were genuine and everyone's beliefs were real. I felt the best part about Demi-chan wa Kataritai was the honesty and the reality of the students' situations. Specifics aside, people are often ostracised because they are different, and people automatically think they want tobe treated like everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\r\nNot super high quality, but good. Animations were generally smooth and the character design was cute. Especially in the last episode, at the pool, I liked the attention to detail, like the reflection of light bouncing off the surface of the pool hitting the walls. I guess the producers wanted to end on a high note, and they achieved just that.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\nSame deal, not amazing, but good. The OP was alright, nothing much, but the ED reminded me of Nichijou's ED, soft and lullaby-like. I really enjoyed the ED. Sound effects were cute, nothing more that could be said, really.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nNumbero uno, they stayed true to themselves throughout the anime, which is great. Secondly, I felt that Hikari, Machi, and Yuki all embraced their tropes,  which usually is a bad thing, but in this case, it worked as we experienced all their ups and downs. Hikari, the vampire, being the outgoing and cutesy girl who has no qualms about going toe-to-toe with anyone, Machi, the dullahan, being the intelligent one who reflects on herself, and Yuki, the snow woman (hence her name), being the shy reserved girl who rarely opens up to anyone. I liked how they all overcame their trope restraints and became friends with everyone. Satou-sensei I feel was just there for the humour, her obstacle wasn't dealt with as well as the others' were. At the end of the day, Hikari is still the cutest.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10/10\\n\r\nI was waiting every Saturday for the next episode to come out. I was drawn by the vulnerability of the characters and, not gonna lie, by the cuteness and good feels that the show brings out. It's a heartwarming anime, and I think everyone should watch it!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 9/10\\n\r\nI liked it, other reviewers seem to like it, so what's stopping you from watching it?",

            "content": "If one would say that is anime was underrated, I would agree with him or her 100%, since, one would never understand as to why would publish company such as Kodansha would even think about publish this in a manga and why would Studio A1 would even think of even making this into an anime, now original creator who goes by the name \"Petos\" wrote this, and for him this is meant for teenagers  or guys who are in their early 20's, so  no more BS and just present my rating the way it is:\r\nStorywise, it was decent enough, since the plot isabout some teacher who has an interest for the Ajin's of Demi's where he want's to know how they ticked......Ok, the twist here, was that the plot itself was more focus on the 4 freaks, namely a Vampire, who can walk in daylight, a Snow-girl who can only shed ice in her tears and sweat, a dullahan whose neck is connected by a portal to her body and a  succubus who is guilty of a fashion crime, whom were seemly  have some feelings for the teacher and the teacher is the usual character who is oblivious, now the problem is that whatever is this anime/ manga's genre, is basically all over the place, so story is a \"Poor\" 3.\\n\\n\r\nArt: to simply put it it was a \"Decent\" 4, so don't expect any panchira, boob flashes, nor any good swimsuit fanservices around here. The only pet peeve I have for the character's illustrations were pretty much ideal for a pedophile and the way Tetsuo Takahashi was illustrated pretty much makes him look like a  sex offender. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I was a \"Good\" 7 since the VA's who did the voices of the characters where right on cue and so as the opening and closing theme.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Pretty much \"PATHETIC\" (1), cu'z the character's themselves can be define as Oxymoron, like Hikari Takanashi, now she suppose to be a vampire, except that she doesn't act like one, she more like a meddling retard with a bad case of ADHD, in fact her being a vampire is more in name only , Ky\u014dko Machi, a  Dullahan, who can eat, feel, breathe  and drink even when her head is detached from her body, so what kind of  dullahan whose neck is replaced by a portal that connects her head from her body? Cu'z the last time I've check, they don't eat, drink, feel or breathe, since they're walking dead.  Yuki Kusakabe, if she can pass as Mr. Freeze's daughter, then she pretty much lame,  Sakie Sat\u014d the succubus , if she's just too kind to not use her powers then maybe she should have been a nun. Tetsuo Takahashi, the teacher who does some demi research, well, like I've said he can pass as a sexual predator, and what he does is something that them pedophiles does when they wanna lure their victim.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Decent (4), since, there weren't any sexual innuendo here, frankly I just find it as a chore to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: it was just poor in every way there is, the title itself doesn't comply with the anime since their is no interview to begin with, it was more like a loli romance combine with harem, where the people involved with the teacher  seems  to be competing in  a subtle way, also, everything is all over the place and lot of oxymorons with what the characters are , so really, there isn't much what this anime can offer it's just an underrated thing where harem and forbidden romance are the main thing, so season 2? No way JOSE!\\n\\n\r\nJose OUT!",

Suggest you look at this show as something fresh and new that incorporates monster girls into modern society.\r\nI usually reserve 9's for shows that did something very well and here's the reason why, it made me re-evaluate how I treat people through a different lens.  It made me change my behavior and philosophy which is a big accomplishment for a show to do for me.  If I gointo details, you'll get spoiled.  It's not something major that is mindblowing but it's still impactful for me as a person.  Of course, not everyone will experience this which is why I say this is a great show for me in particular.  Only you can know if this show can work for you.  Suggest you watch the show so you can understand if it appeals to you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't want to watch the show yet then I suggest checking out this show if you like any of these factors or can tolerate them:\\n\\n\r\n- Cute Girls Doing Cute Things (it has male characters, don't worry!)\\n\\n\r\n- Monster Girls\\n\\n\r\n- Slice of Life\\n\\n\r\n- High School Setting (a lot of it is there, so if you can't tolerate now then I urge you to come back when you can. Show is still worth the chance despite the repetitive setting in anime.)\\n\\n\r\n- Mentor-ship between students and teachers\\n\\n\r\n- A take on how people fit into society\\n\\n\r\n- Can tolerate the weirdness that anime brings (weird jokes here and there, the anime-usual but it's not excessive like other shows)\\n\\n\r\n- Anime comedy\\n\\n\r\n- There is definitely drama there but it doesn't destroy your mood and really helps push the story forward\\n\\n\r\n- Surface level enjoyment that has a little bit of depth if you decide to look. (This can be debatable, I think it has a lot of depth for the amount of world-building it created as well as delivering the messages in a way that isn't preachy.)\\n\\n\r\n==============\\n\\n\r\nBy the way, for your moral safety: the teacher DOES NOT reciprocate or pursue the students love interest.  Let those worries sink away as there are no indications of that in this season. (Thank god)\\n\\n\r\nThis show has had a profound impact on certain individuals and it can be understandable as to why. A show that can do that on an emotional level for people gets an A+ from my book.  That's why I want you to check out for yourself if this show can work for you because who knows maybe this becomes your favorite anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review was helpful in your decision, let me know if it has.",

I appreciate the focus on character development and attempting to rationalize demi-humans over sexualization and fan-service. While others may argue that it still occurs, when sexual topics were occasionally brought up, they were done a way that felt appropriate and organic to the narrative.\r\nHaving already read up to volume 6 of the English translation, I believe that this has been a faithful adaptation of the manga so far. I have to admit that when I heard about this adaptation, I was worried. As long as the creativeteams continue to work with similar due diligence, I look forward to any future manga and anime from this series.\\n\r\nThe animation was beautiful and really did bring the manga to life rather than just being a frame for frame mimic.\\n\r\nOverall, this is a good series, especially for those not into fan-service or hyper-antics. As someone who will be going into teaching, I find Takahashi Sensei to be an admirable character.\\n\r\nI hope others out their will enjoy.",

It\u2019s a laid-back thought experiment, which imagines folkloric beings like vampires and dullahans as everyday humans with rare physiology. Rather than milk its female cast for episodic titillation, it world-builds from its junky premise, imagining the lifestyle and social reality of, and history of prejudice against, those living with subtly or radically different physical circumstances.\r\nI have a certain respect for pulp stories that extrapolate to wherever their concepts may lead. Like sci-fi dramas with aliens that are simply lazy stand-ins for other races, \"Demi-chan\" could\u2019ve been a purpose-built metaphorfor disability and prejudice and left it at that.\\n\\n\r\nInstead, it goes beyond and spends part of an episode speculating how the Dullahan's head virtually connects to its body. Is the neck a miniature wormhole? The rare dullahan ponders a career in research. Another episode covers how the Japanese legal system deals with succubi, those with a supernatural aphrodisiacal aura, who are ensnared in sexual assault cases. The solution is flawed yet believably human.\\n\\n\r\nThough much of its drama is ultimately metaphorical, it doesn\u2019t feel forced to that end. The succubus character has a complex over her supernatural allure; can she ever have a real relationship? Perhaps her dilemma isn\u2019t that different from someone who\u2019s conventionally attractive, points out a colleague.\\n\\n\r\n\"Demi-chan\" still exists within the parameters of seinen manga pulp. It chronicles the lives of cute anime schoolgirls surrounding a ripped male teacher who hasn\u2019t the sharpest sense of professional ethics. It\u2019s also not terribly exciting to watch. But it still deserves kudos for deglamorizing and de-eroticising a lurid subgenre by taking its premise as seriously as one could. They said a respectable \"monster girls\" show couldn\u2019t be done...",

Yuki is the snow woman of the anime in the beginning she is more distant about herself and what not but that is before Hikari confronts some bullies and stand up to her but that's also because Takahashi helped aswell.

Tetsuo is the bio teacher and the main male of the anime he is the one who teaches the demi's of there nature and what not a pretty cool dude where the if the girls need help hes always there to lend a hand.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: i personally really liked this anime the comedy was SUPER good like really good all the characters were good and just everything about this anime i loved also this isnt a harem only really 2 girls love Tetsuo and that is Sakie and Kyouko and yeah that about it also the slice of life is easily spotted in this and a good one at that \\n\\n\r\nOverall: easily a 8 for me for sure the comedy was really good and also that the characters were good aswell gave me the 8 rating check this anime out whenever you can",

            "content": "The first impression you have when you start watching is that it looks like just another supernatural school girl anime. In fact this is certainly the basic premise but it is not only what it has to offer, the perspective of this anime is not to demonstrate a senseless ecchi or harem but to demonstrate supernatural creatures in a much more realistic way, showing what each \"monster\" Has a positive and negative side, as well as showing very realistic problems if it existed in real life.\r\nThere are also samples of how society views these beings, how they deal with them. I believe an incredible observationis that they also take to the scientific side so can explain how everything is possible, which are excellent explanations and theories that make sense.\\n\\n\r\nThe director did an excellent job in coordinating the soundtracks, they are totally outstanding and combines perfectly with the environment inserted in addition to that in several moments there is the breaking of clich\u00e9s in exciting moments because there is only the dialogue and nothing else, which is Which breaks the myth / clich\u00e9 that it takes a sad soundtrack to become engaging. And it's amazing how you become fully involved in the environment, you feel every emotion of each character.\\n\\n\r\nThe half-monster girls are all of remarkable personalities, it's amazing because they are extremely funny, they are so different and unique.",
