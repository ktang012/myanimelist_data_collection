            "content": "My experience of this anime can be summed up by the word \"meh\". I went into it hoping for a nice twist on the seven deadly sins being the good guys, and some awesome fight scenes, and ended up sorely disappointed. Sure, the characters are known by their sins, but rather than be actual embodiments of said sins, they were simply granted them as derogatory titles, so they fail to stand out as shounen manga characters in that department.\r\nThe characters don't undergo any sort of development across the series, and for the most part are bland and boring. Ban is pretty fun because of hisaloof yet silly attitude, and the rest have some decent humor, but this is definitely not a high point of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe combat was especially mediocre. The fights only ever focus on Meliodas and Ban 99% of the time, with the rest of the sins just acting as accessories. This is especially frustrating after so many of them are hyped up as 'the strongest of the deadly sins', or 'the prince of fairies'. I particularly was looking forward to Diane kicking ass, but we only ever really get one awesome moment out of her when she punches through a supposedly unbreakable barrier. The rest of the time she's either sleeping, 40 miles away, or has a hole punched through her chest and has to act as a damsel in distress. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nWe do get a couple of good battles in, but the majority only last a couple of seconds, due to the characters' (see: Meliodas and Ban's) overpoweredness. Only two or three fights really give any true sense of danger, and one of them was ruined for me by how easily Diane went down. But that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nI kept watching because I expected a more even playing field eventually, with all of the sins being equally capable, but that unfortunately never happens. Meliodas and Ban are, throughout the anime, just complete male power fantasies, while the rest of the crew just gets swept under the rug. \\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this anime, but I don't recommend it. It's not bad, just decent, and really not worth your time. It lacks any aspect that really stands out, and ultimately just falls flat, lost amidst a sea of better, more entertaining shounen anime.",

So, it\u2019s interesting to see an anime that suffers from these clich\u00e9s and more \u2013 but also utilizes them to their fullest extent, giving rhyme and reason to them; which makes the show a whole lot more fun and meaningful than was expected. \r\n[STORY]\r\n------------\r\nThe core plot is simply the adventures (and misadventures)of an unlikely team as they traverse the land, looking for other members of a mysterious group known as the \"Seven Deadly Sins\u201d. While traveling, the \u2018team\u2019 comes across other past members, gets into fights with various characters, help people out, chat, joke and just generally try to have fun and do what is just - while working towards completing their ultimate objective of reuniting all seven and reclaiming the land. The series has a great grasp on balancing the humor, the drama, and the action. One never seems to overpower the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe soul of this show though, is divided into two aspects: the fights, and the character development (which often ties into the aforementioned aspect). Most of the main characters (and many of the side characters and antagonists) get their time to shine and be developed. Character dialogue, actions and interactions, as well as fantastic backstories for many of the characters really flesh things out and add a sense of purpose and reason to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, things don\u2019t always end up being what they appear to be, and there are many points in the series where completely unexpected things happen that really help make the series more refreshing and less repetitive. But, some parts of the plot are a bit convoluted. Nothing that should detriment the experience, but things can sometimes seem a bit\u2026 off. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the ending is a bit lackluster, but still thrilling to watch. And, the way it ends leaves it open to the possibility of a new season.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThe art in \u2018Nanatsu no Taizai\u2019 is of an extremely high quality. Action scenes flow well and character designs, facial expressions, backgrounds, etc. are above par. The greatest thing about it though is that the quality is maintained throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\n [SOUND]\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nThe music in the series is more quality over quantity. There are many pieces that are repeatedly used, but they all fit the times and scenes in which they are used and didn\u2019t become annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nAll four of the openings and endings are great and add to the series, rather than being something that most people would skip.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is also of a high quality. No lines felt hammy, forced or otherwise grated on the ears. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThis is where this show absolutely excels \u2013 for most of the characters. A majority of them have unique personalities. They fear things, love things and hate things. They cry, they laugh and they have morals, hopes and dreams. The series does a great job of building most of the characters up and making it feel like these are living, breathing people.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female character, Elizabeth, has a decent amount of development. But, regrettably, the main male character, Meliodas, does not. He really doesn\u2019t seem to change over the series, and remains \u2013 for the most part \u2013 an enigma. There is a backstory given to him that helps shine a little light on who he was and currently is, but so many things remain unclear concerning his character that it can be hard to attach yourself to him as the show progresses. Also, he is just too overpowered, which means you never fear for him in any of the action scenes... and therefore lose a lot of potential tension. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters though - who I won\u2019t name or give details for, as finding out who they are and what they are like is a part of the series\u2019 enjoyment \u2013 are the most well developed in the entire series. There\u2019s a great possibility of you coming to love a character you previously hated or vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThere are a lot of flaws. But even with those flaws, this was still an immensely enjoyable series. It had great fights with meaning to them, great humor, great characters, and some really powerful stories. I was pleasantly surprised with the anime and don\u2019t regret the time I spent on it.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic action-adventure anime, and a \u201csin\u201d (forgive me for the pun, I had to) that I will gladly partake in again soon.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL SCORES~\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n",

            "content": "The funny thing about sins is that we all have it. As some part of us, there\u2019s a sin in everyone. It\u2019s simple really because they are natural human instincts. That\u2019s hardly what Nanatsu no Taizai is about though. On the surface, the show seems to talk about the sins in their variety. But really, this series is more about a journey, one that has our heroes find those lost Sins. Like a classic adventure, Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins) crafts the extraordinary portrait of how a journey should be in such a fantasy world.\r\nLet\u2019s get something over with first. This series hasthe infamous studio known as A-1 Pictures in charge which spells out for some controversy. Known for their other adaptations such as Sword Art Online, Magi, Blue Exorcist, and other related works, they have created some controversy when adapting shounen titles. If you\u2019re thinking adequacy, then you may be right. They are known for butchering up manga material with adaptations such as the latter half of Blue Exorcist and first season of Magi. For Nanatsu no Taizai, the series runs for over 100+ chapters and is still ongoing. The worry may be that the series will be butchered to an extent that will be unsalvageable.  While it does suffer a bit of that, the show does shine in its own ways. It\u2019s by no means an earth breaking adaptation yet still has its compelling ideas bought into light.\\n\\n\r\nTaking on account of premise, the show should be fairly straightforward. We have a young girl named Elizabeth, who also happens to be the princess of a kingdom. From the first episode, she meets a young boy named Meliodas happily serving to customers at a tavern. It heads into an outlandish route once we learn his true identity as the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins. From here on and out, the duo remarks on a journey to find the remaining Sins. There\u2019s also some explanations regarding the origins of the series in the beginning so all should be made clearly to the audience. Taking for granted, the show is generic from first glance. The world setting the series takes place in is decorated with fantasy gimmicks. Whether it\u2019s one of those ancient fortresses, dungeons, enchanted forests, or even land of the dead, the series doesn\u2019t try to pull anything new from its hat. However, it\u2019s also important to take notice how much they have influence with the events of the series. The show puts on emphasis on some of the settings such as the enchanted forest and its significance. Even past events connected to some of the setting becomes significant in the overall story development. Similarly, most major characters in the series has holds some significance in their roles. The seven deadly sins are perhaps the most infamous examples as the Holy Knights hunts them in an almost cat-and-mouse like story on occasions.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes to performance, it\u2019s hard to not take off eyes on our adventurers. Starting with Elizabeth, we can see how gentle she is as a princess yet also brave at heart. Her relationship with the other Sins develops gradually over the course of this show starting with Meliodas. While the two are hardly compatible, there is an innate connection between the two. It also makes us wonder more about them individually as characters. The show makes clever usage of flashbacks to give the Sins some character backgrounds such as with Meliodas, Ban, and King. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t capitalize on all of them and skips some material that are necessary. Still, the characterization is what\u2019s important there and it adapts most of that in its right path except for perhaps Elizabeth. Her character hardly gets any character development and is frustrating to watch. That same also goes for Hawk; the pig who for some reason has the name of a bird despite being incapable of flight. During their journey, they do influence certain outcome of events but the focus on their characters on an individual level is moderate at best. There\u2019s also a decent chemistry between certain characters including the Sins and Holy Knights. Nanatsu no Taizai is about a journey after all and events connecting with characters of the past can influence those in the present and even the future.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships can also be something to keep an eye on. From strong friendship to romance, the series undertakes ways to flesh them out. However, do not expect top tier adaptation coming from A-1 Pictures. Certain parts are left out that could of made specific relationship seem more realistic. At the same time, we can also see how human some of the characters are. This is demonstrated by the emotions characters show ranging from sorrow, to anger, to regret. It extends to not only the Sins but also the Holy Knights. While not as clearly focused as the Sins, some of them do get character background with examples like Gilthunder. The show makes it clear that some of them are antagonists although there are also changes down the road. Despite all this, the show still has a trend for what shounen series does which usually leads up with predictable outcomes. \\n\\n\r\nStanding on its feet, the show marks its spot for a fantasy series clearly evidenced by its colorful background. The artwork is well adapted from the manga to illustrate a diverse range of characteristics you would find in any shounen series. Mountain ranges, enchanted forests, and crude dungeons are all fantastically illustrated. The character designs also has variety to give each of them a unique look. Whether it\u2019s Diane\u2019s titanic figure, Ban\u2019s delinquent face, or Gilthunder\u2019s cold expressions, the show is able to create a concrete degree with the variety. I also give praise to the battle scenes as effort can be seen with most of the fights. A few parts will be expected to be left out while the pacing can feel oddball at times. Nonetheless, the show has a good way to balance out its action. Finally, you may be raising your eyebrows on occasions with the fan service. While the show isn\u2019t in the ecchi territory, it does have parts when Meliodas plays with Elizabeth\u2019s skirt like some kid at the candy store or when she is almost completely naked (for legitimate reasons) on more than one occasion. \\n\\n\r\nGet ready to put on your headphones. Anyone familiar with Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s work will easily recognize his music style. While it seems generic at first, the soundtrack is clearly and impeccably crafted with strong precision. It coordinates with action scenes well that some of the battles feel like miniature movies. OST also has a decent balance when it comes to comedy and drama. However when it comes to voice adaptations, there are mixed thoughts. Characters such as Meliodas and Elizabeth sound dull and stereotypical. On the other hand, characters like Diane and Ban has a better fit to their personalities. When it comes to voice mannerisms, it\u2019s important to see how their roles fit with the story. Some clearly has what it takes while others falls off short. Similarly, the OP and ED theme songs fits with the show\u2019s gimmicks but is generic to the core when it comes to rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 2 cour show, it\u2019s easy to say that adapting this series to perfection is an impossible mission. What this show did accomplish though is drawing out the shounen gimmicks to its core. The colorful cast of characters unites a variety of personalities in a classic adventurous journey. And during that journey, we see the challenges our adventurers endears and the obstacles they face. It\u2019s not a complex show really when it comes to the story in the end. Also be aware that this season apparently leaves off some hints for adaptations in the future. With the artwork and soundtrack clearly made to the point and a reasonable premise, it\u2019s all part of this said machine.",

So let's begin for a second time now.\r\nIn late 2013, I read about 23 chapters of the manga and I wasn't impress, don't know if I was not in a good mood or not. fast forward in 2015, and the anime came, I wasn't excited at all,until..... lets start with the review. ;)\\n\\n\r\nStory:7/10. The story revolves around Meliodas and Elizabeth who both goal is to gather the seven deadly sins, although initially there goal for gathering the seven deadly sins is different, in the end their reason for wanting to gather them intertwined with each other. The story follows them as they gather the sins and also clearing their names on false lies about them. while also in combat with the holy nights. The story follows the normal shounen formula but it does tweak it up a little to make this series not be named as just another generic shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10.Art looks good, I didn't really have any problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10. Sawano is the one that compose this, should I say anything else?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10. The characters are the strongest aspect of this series, The author did a great job in giving flash backs to the characters, each characters have different personality, which makes the series have interesting drama. the characters have depth imo. The author took his time to develop the characters and to give them good flashback stories. we get to know who they were and what were there reason. these characters are the type that would make any series enjoyable even if the story is complete rubbish, that's how much I enjoy these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10. I enjoy this series a lot. great action, drama, romance and suspense. it had everything.\\n\\n\r\noverall:8/10. Overall this series is very good. the anime has completely change my opinion on this series. I think its time to go back to the manga now. ;) anyways thank for reading! sorry if my review felt kinda lacking, I put so much effort in writing the previous one, and to see it go to waste really demoralized me.\\n",

            "content": "[First review] [bad english]\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nLike every clich\u00e9 shounen, The Seven Deadly Sins has a mediocre and linear story, that is only used to justify fanservice and nonsense fights. The plot follows Meliodas, a very dumb and innocent dude (despite he always abuse his friend Elizabeth and, sometimes, turns into a demon), who is unjustifiably determined to help the princess that he knew 2 seconds ago. \r\nIt's basically a generic copy of Fullmetal Alchemist, but one thousand times worse.\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nThe animation is fine, but the trait is just terrible, and the character design is so badly done.\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nThe sound composition is, ultimately, just okay. It's fundamentallycommon teenager J-Rock, and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nNanatsu No Taizai's characters are quite one-dimensional, although they are projected to be great. Meliodas is a pathetically clich\u00e9 shounen protagonist, following Dragon Ball Z and Naruto molds. Elizabeth is the Lucy Heartfilia of the show, an unbearable girl who is only used to make fanservice scenes and incite the virgin jerk-offers to search for hentai. Other characters are equally terrible, as exemple, Ban is just pure pose, and divinized by fans only for being the greedy anti-hero (ps: he is the greed, but gives up of immortality, because a girl asked for him give up).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nWith all these defects, it's hard to say that something in the show is enjoyable. The Seven Deadly Sins falls in all the aspects of a good show, it's very uncomfortable to watch, mainly because EVERY episode has at least one rape scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nThe conclusion is: Nanatsu no Taizai is the most sexist non-hentai anime and the worst battle shounen ever made, even worse than 5-minutes YouTube homemade animations.",

            "content": "I've always wanted to review Nanatsu, but I just couldn't give myself energy to do it. There's a lot of wrong things in this piece, and to flesh out each of them is gonna take time - but I really need to. A lot of reviews on MAL just didn't get to these points, so I'll have to talk about them myself.\r\nNanatsu is your average shonen, with ALL the cliches you can expect to see (overpowered characters, tits, superpowers, power of friendship and shit). But not only shonen cliches, also medieval story cliches: unbelievably unbreakable swords, giant monsters everywhere, kingdoms and knights, games of powerand sexism - A LOT of sexism. I'm actually surprised no one has talked about it until now. But let's move on and I'll flesh this out later.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a huge cliche, but has some interesting ways of don't letting it show - it is never clear if the seven deadly sins are good, bad or just a bunch of chaotic neutral egoists (much like Genei Ryodan from HxH). The corruption inside the holy knights is shown in a way that makes you think before you judge. Are they really the evil ones, they're just doing their jobs or are being manipulated?\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation: nothing that stands out. Average visuals for a battle shonen, average music for a medieval story. Loved the second ed song, though the video is quite sleepy.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are beautiful and very well-animated, but quite predictable. The main problem with overpowered characters (for Nanatsu, it means all the cast) is that you're watching a battle and BOOM someone pulls power off their asses. Ohh no he just got sliced in three BOOM he regenerates with a sacred power that no one talked about until the last 10 seconds. After seing fights like this for 3-4 times, you just start not caring anymore. Everything will get solved in some miraculous way, just leave it be. Soon this character will awake his krakenian demonic rainbow powers and beat everyone's asses up.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems in Nanatsu is the inconsistency of the characters. Not of THE characters, but of them as a whole: you have some pretty good ones, that really interest you and break some cliches, like Guila, King and Gowther. Many of the charaters have interesting stories and a lot of development as the story goes on. \\n\r\nThen you have your Bucket of Golden Crappy Characters, mainly Meliodas and Elizabeth. Meliodas is a man with the appearance, manners and mentality of a 12-year-old, infinite powers and a broken sword - and you have to put up with him being the main character. Elizabeth is a sack of potatoes with tits. Oh, and she also cries sometimes. Ok, MANY times. Just what you expected from a medieval story. (I'm personally not a fan of this kind of narrative, so keep this in mind while reading... Or not.) This is something you see very much, SO MUCH I can't stand it anymore. The swordsman with a main character-centered morality and the hot woman who falls in love with him because he is so \"brave and heroic\", and not for any other particular reason. Problem with that? Despite being a BIG cliche, no, it's not a problem. The main problem with Nanatsu comes NOW:\\n\\n\r\nEVERY EPISODE has some scene where Meliodas harasses Elizabeth - puts his hand under her skirt, inside her pants, on her tits. And he does it like he's putting a cup of tea in the table. Nothing wrong, I'm just rubbing your breasts. And what does Elizabeth do? Does she go yandere and smack him in the face, like in so many other animes? Does she call for someone to help? Does she accept it, and confesses that she gets turned on by this? No. Of all acceptable (or not) things, she does NOTHING. Elizabeth just asks \"sir Meliodas, what are you doing?\" \"oh I'm just putting my hand there, it's warm\" and gets back to what she was doing before, like she's not feeling anything at all. Elizabeth exists for the purpose of being harassed for the fanservice. Her character is shallow as a human being and as a woman.\\n\\n\r\n\"OHH NO THERE GOES THE SJW\" - no. I personally HATE sjws. Before this being a fault because of the sexism, it is a fault of CHARACTER CONSTRUCTION. Things just don't work that way. It's plausible that pigs can talk, that fairies exist in their own kingdom and that a swordsman acts like a horny teenager. It's NOT plausible that a woman exists just for crying and being harassed like nothing was wrong.\\n\\n\r\n\"OH BUT IF YOU STOP WATCHING ANIME BECAUSE OF ECCHI YOU'LL NEVER WATCH ANYTHING BLAHBLAHBLAH\". I love Tenchi Muyo!, because the women there are REAL women, with personality and reactions. I love Prison School, because is ADMITTEDLY an ero comedy, with funny reactions and unbelievable funny situations - with plausible characters for that kind of universe. Nanatsu is pure abusive fanservice. That kind of thing would be understandable in a hentai - a genre with the sole function of hardening certain body parts; though it would still be ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nanatsu no Taizai is something I watched as a challenge. A challenge for myself, \"can I stand this thing and watch it to the end?\", and a challenge for the series, \"does this get better ANYTIME?\". Yes, it gets better in the second half, though rushed, but in the end it felt so hollow. Battles and amazing powers and some deep and interesting characters and a lot of fanservice shit and oh look there's a lot of better shonen animes with much fewer cliches. \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason behind the hype for Nanatsu must be the superpowers, something that I really don't care about, despite being a fan of typical shonen. I don't really see any other reason for someone to watch this, it's just... An extremely whatever anime. Does this sentence make sense? Well, but that's it.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nI don't know why many people find this anime so good when it's really not.\r\nThe anime gives us first the introduction of the characters. It was ok, I guess...Still, I was annoyed at the character of Meliodas. Why? Because he is a fucking sexual harasser with the girl who joins him: Elizabeth. Touching her boobs and ass and looking at her panties... Is that supposed to be funny? Because I'd find it rather disgusting than something for laughs. Besides that, the other characters were very neutral for me, but this Gowther guy who appears almost at the last which had a mysterious aura waskind of interesting like  you want to know more about him and the pig makes an exeption as the second one being a sympathethic character who cares about his friends and is always protecting the useless Elizabeth from Meliodas. And you can't deny me the fact that Elizabeth isn't useless because she is. She doesn't do anything in the series. Crying, shouting Meliodas's name to save her and letting herself be touched by him doesn't mean anything of utility for me. She is the typical useless girl who everyone likes because she is so nice and pasive. Nice.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say the anime is sexist because it isn't. Women fights as we see one of our main protagonist: Dianne, yeah, she is strong and not weak like Elizabeth. There is a girl which represents the typical stereotype of characters that never opens their eyes that does fight as well as the other with white hair who seems to have an interest in Ban. I liked the girl that I mentioned in the last since she had very brave spirit. The other is very meh to me but at least she does something.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the plot, there isn't much to say about it since I didn't understand a shit. Like I mentioned first, we have the characters introduction, some funny scenes and then there is this main plot. Everything happens so fast and there is all this fights all of a sudden. I only understood that someone whichidontrememberwho kidnapped Elizabeth and everyone has to save her\\n\r\n...Wow, we never saw that before in a history, sooo original! \\n\\n\r\nThe end was good I guess....It wasn't so bad done like the main plot. We see Elizabeth with her sisters and her father in the palace when Meliodas with all the others deadly sins came to tell her if she wants to join them one more time in their adventures. She accepts and goes with them. At least it wasn't a sad drama but it didn't gave me motivation to follow the manga or be excited for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the manga, I made some research after watching the anime and there were many complains since my percepction seems to be right about how the direction of the plot has happened. The manga takes its time to explain everything not like the anime which everything happens all of a sudden, characters and relationships appears out of nowhere and you don't understand what the hell is going on.\\n\r\nAnd if you asked me if I was sad with the dead of King's friend? No, I wasn't. The part is terrible done and of course, I didn't understand it very well to feel something emotional. \\n\r\nI guess I laughed a bit with the pig being protective with the crying girl? But that was all the emotion I had rather than feeling kind of bored and asking myself what was happening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the seven deadly sins was a bad anime for me. I didn't see anything out of common and I haven't mentioned this before but this characters are supposed to be deadly sins...Why the hell didn't they focused more on that instead of putting useless and predictable fights which nobody cares? It could have been way more interesting. I mean come on, I realized they represented the deadly sins after a friend told me so I didn't took notice which is a pity because the anime could have been way better. \\n\r\nSo that's it, a fantasy anime that doesn't had much to apport only kind of fan service I guess , pretty colours and putting figths as we're supposed to be interested in that. Fights are good in shounen animes when the plot and what is happening according to the situation is well executed.",

            "content": "Shounen is a tricky genre. Too often, plot is abandoned for the sake of showcasing all of the powers and techniques of the hero, and knowing this, I was very reluctant to get into Nanatsu no Taizai. Having taken the plunge several weeks after the show's original premier, I am incredibly pleased with what I ended up with.\r\nNanatsu no Taizai does follow the same basic shounen formula: one powerful force butts heads against another, everyone is naming their attacks before they use them, a useless female companion appears--yet, these rough edges are given their time to develop into something likable and actually compelling to watch.\r\nThestory has excellent pacing in that it sticks to the typical format of battle after battle while still gradually introducing each of the main characters and forwarding the plot. With each few segments, the view gains time to grow accustom to each of the Deadly Sins themselves, and find more to them than simply different battle styles. As well, the motivation for both the protagonists' and antagonists' sides were plainly present; I was especially pleased at the motivation for the antagonists, as that is one such point that is so often vague and underdeveloped.\\n\r\nToward the very end, elements from both opposing sides came together for a satisfying conclusion, and watching everyone's goal form into one single objective was a delightful way to conclude the relations between the two sides.\\n\r\nIt was also pleasing to see that the series knew when to push fanservice down a few pegs in order to complete the story, rather than spoil the climax with the inclusion of the humorous bits of female lead at the beginning. It was nice to see the focus shift, the story taking precedence. \\n\r\nThis is not to say any attempts at lightheartedness are abandoned; they find their spotlight for each of the characters, and not just the main hero.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this, equality was provided; it wasn't just the main Sin, Meliodas, that got the spotlight. Attention was paid to the feelings and relations between the other Sins, and screen time was generously given to explain their pasts, while not completely disconnecting from the main plot. While somewhat cliche at times, for lack of a better phrase, I gave a damn about the cast. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show was also given the helpful support of clean art and magnificent sound. The selection of voices was very fitting for each character, emotions in-story being very well conveyed. \\n\r\nThe color choices were bright and the animation harbored the obviousness of a team that knew what they were doing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose this is one of those series that's popular for a reason, but more of a reason that useless moe or excessive showing off. Not being a particularly big action aficionado myself, I am unsure of whether or not my enjoyment stems from the excitement of branching out from slice of life once in a while, but I am glad I did. Nanatsu no Taizai earns its popularity, and I would not be upset at the release of another season, so long as those at the helm take careful care to put as much attention to making it more than basic shounen just as they did with these first 24 episodes.",

You have good quality animation, a group of characters with various skills and personalities that you will surely find your favorite. Action and abilities, and even some twist on historical and mythical figures in place. Even has some fan service and good humor and starts off with a captivating first episode.Yet it all feels like a whole bunch on stuff thrown together with no clear direction.\r\nThe universe isn't explained well enough or provides clarity. You have giants, humans, demons, fairies, immortals, holy knights, talking pigs etc etc.  It's as if any creaturethey wanted to exists in this realm does. This would be ok if the story did better with making everything mesh.  It just feels as if things don't make sense, we have multiple main characters whose appearances change drastically with little explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting also leaves a lot to be desired. Fights are quick and are more a display of skill than an actual engaging back and forth.  Skills can also seem quite random. The overall lack of  consistency can make it difficult to let the anime capture you. The show isn't bad it's just missing a polish to make it a great show, you may watch it and love it , but chances are you will watch keep asking yourself should you continue or should you drop it.",

            "content": "The story of how I came into watching Nanatsu no Taizai (or Seven Deadly Sins, whichever do you prefer to call it) is rather an odd one. The series isn't exactly on my anime watchlist back when it aired on Fall 2014, and I only watched it when I noticed Animax channel in my region began airing the series during winter. Considering the series seems like a good harmless shonen fun, I decided to finally watch it since I don't watch that much anime in that season. And it is quite good fun shonen, although it takes a while to get there.\r\nThe series story arepretty much what it says in the synopsis and follow the standard 'gather comrade in arms to overthrow evil ruler' plot (with some twist along the way of course). In a way, it make sense to see why Nanatsu's appealing to its fans due to the series old school JRPG-esque setting and plot (which is rather refreshing personally), but infused it with enough shonen action trope to make itself distinguishable. The reminiscence, however, doesn't stop there, with both the artstyle and character design are noticeably influenced by Akira Toriyama's ,who also did the character design for JRPG such as the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nNanatsu start quite weakly for the first few episodes with, at the time main characters, Meliodas and Elizabeth, aren't quite an engaging characters with the former being a frank, shameless, and brave pervert, while the latter being the stereotypical weak kind-hearted princess with aren't much complexity. It doesn't helped either the series humor are mostly consist of Elizabeth being groped by Meliodas. Fortunately, the series picked itself up when the rest (well, the majority of them anyway) of the Nanatsu no Taizai are introduced. There's Diane, a cheerful giantess who has a massive crush on Meliodas. Ban, an undead thief who's also a somewhat loveable ass. King, a fairy with a crush on Diane, and also the general straightman and the 'sensible' one of the group. And Gowther, who's practically a stoic robot with a human skin.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast dynamics are definitely the series main core strength. While the Nanatsu crew aren't exactly colorful, each of them had a solid personality and flaws which allows all of them to bounce off well with each other. And with the establishment that the Nanatsu crew are a very strong warriors, it also allows for a quite funny slapstick humor. The rest of the cast, both on the holy knights side and the non affiliated one, also fares pretty well. The holy knights in particular, have a distinguishable personality and also different sides to each of them which prevents them from becoming one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, special mention for the series composition, done by Shotaro Suga (Oregairu, Uchouten Kazoku). Each scenes and plot beats flows pretty nicely and the overarching story also progressed quite quickly with almost no meandering around or pointless episodes without feeling its rushed (although it does feels rushed at times). For example, during the tournament arc, one episode literally covers three fights. But each fight are short enough so it doesn't worn out its welcome, but long enough to be entertaining and meaty.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fights themselves, they're pretty entertaining spectacle with dynamic direction and some nice animation. Each of the characters have their own core magic skill and moves set that derives itself from it. While the core magic are simple in nature, they bounced off well without one power overwhelming with the other. Few of the skills derivatives and the way it work in conjunction with their weapon are also quite creative. One character has the core skill of mind invasion, which allows him to trapped his enemy in an illusion, rewrite their memories temporarily and even trigger a nightmare inside. And since he channel his power through a bow, he can do it in long range.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical front, Nanatsu had a generally solid aesthetic with a variety of colors and distinct character design, but unfortunately it's bog down by a rather generic medieval fantasy background and landscape (with one exception, that is the land of the dead). The music, done by Hiroyuki Sawano, features an appropriate range of upbeat battle music with some classic medieval instruments  to enhance the atmosphere. But compare to Sawano's previous soundtrack work such as Kill la Kill and Attack on Titan, the music in Nanatsu are surprisingly rather tame. While it did fit the mood and the tone of the series, if I hadn't know beforehand that Sawano's in charge of the music, I wouldn't even recognized who's the music composer, due to the lack of his usually more grandeur and bombastic pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, however, some niggling issues I had with the series. Asides from the aforementioned weak first few episodes and the show use of Meliodas perverted action toward Elizabeth as a recurring gag, the problem is on the way the series handle few of the character's arc, in particular, Diane and Ban's. During the final arc, Diane, out of nowhere, suddenly have loneliness because of her being a Giant. The problem with this is on the fact that Diane, up until that point, had been characterized as a cheerful girl who has a crush on Meliodas. Loneliness has never been something of a problem for her in the earllier episodes. While the series does dedicated an episode behind this later on, it still felt out of place for her character because of the lack of foreshadowing she had this problem and the lack of build up. The problem with Ban's are, quite interestingly, the exact opposite of Diane's problem. His flaws and problems are something that's already been established and explored right after he joins the crew, but it falls short on its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's pretty much Nanatsu no Taizai. You have to stuck up for the first few episodes, past that, and what you have, is a pretty entertaining shonen fantasy action with fun characters and some nice battles.",

            "content": "A group of knights have overthrown the kingdom and started an uproar, dubbed as the \"Seven Deadly Sins.\" Soon, they all suddenly disappeared and the people rejoiced over their supposed defeat. Ten years later, the kingdom is overflowing with pride, yet a hidden darkness lies within as a girl comes up to a bar...\r\n\"Nanatsu no Taizai\" or \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" is a recent anime released by A-1 Pictures that illustrate the adventures of a certain group against a kingdom deemed corrupt. That's basically it in a nutshell, so here is my review of this series! \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story basically follows a young girl named\"Elizabeth\" who seeks out to search the Deadly Sins for a certain purpose. And from then on it's load of adventures and especially action in forms of duels, battles, etc. Very simple plot line with add-on gags of humour and feels trip. Subplots don't tend to overtake it. The story is enjoyable and easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be terribly honest, the cover art did not appeal to me at first glance. It seemed quite outdated and doesn't fit the name. However, it all changes when I watched the first episode. The art is like that to fit the setting (which is good) and the action scenes were epic and simple. Perfect amount of flash and bash and detailed frames. Not the best, but beautiful nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is not a dominant part of The Seven Deadly Sins as its OSTs are quite adequate and don't stand out too much. However, I do take a BIG liking to the opening \"Netsujou no Spectrum\" since it fits it really perfectly, as well as the ED \"7 -seven\" by FLOW X GRANRODEO. OP and Ed fit and I hope it'll stay that way. I wish for more prismatic OSTs though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom an anime called the Seven Deadly Sins, you'd expect the lead to be some dark angel and the cast to be dark demons with a hint of goth and black. Nanatsu no Taizai does not follow this thought but the characters are the most amazing I've ever seen in an anime of the sorts. The cast is not very big, but the development of backstories is amazing, adding depth. Designs and personalities are very well done!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI particularly look forward to every episode because every episode's end always has some cliffhanger of sorts that prompts you to watch the next one. Each episode is unpredictable as the balance of action and humour isn't obvious. Still, every episode is unique and has their own flair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is something I've been waiting for since last season. Despite being disappointed by the preview cover art, it was quickly reversed as I watched it more. I recommend this anime to the general crowd as well as those who enjoy reading the manga (Yes it has a manga!) and people who enjoy action/adventure. I hope you enjoy it!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nEverybody sins. You and me, friends and family, neighbors and strangers; nobody is averse to acting sinful. The severity, though, changes depending on the circumstance: a rogue thought doesn\u2019t do much harm nor does a little bit of desire. But other, more malicious movements can harbor emotions with greater intent to maim. This is where atonement comes into play. For while sinning is bad, it\u2019s the good we do to make up for our grievances that truly matters. Nanatsu no Taizai takes this idea to heart, crafting an anime that needs no forgiveness.\r\nSTORY\r\nTaizai begins innocently enough.Elizabeth Liones visits a local pub where Meliodas, the now infamous \u201cDragon\u2019s Sin of Wrath\u201d resides. Seeking his and the other Sins\u2019 aide in helping not only her father but also the kingdom from encroaching civil doom, Elizabeth and Meliodas embark on a journey to find the other \u201clegendary warriors\u201d \u2013 The Seven Deadly Sins.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \u201cjourney\u201d here is important, because that\u2019s what this is. \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination that\u2019s vital, but the journey\u201d is something that\u2019s often said to highlight the experience undergone while attempting to reach that ultimate, final goal. And this couldn\u2019t be truer with Taizai. The narrative is, at first glance, a \u201cfetch quest.\u201d Elizabeth needs the combined might of the Sins in order to vanquish the evil that threatens her family and homeland. So what\u2019s initially presented is just that \u2013 the two roam the countryside, picking up information and traversing lands in order to find the mightiest heroes to ever live. But already, the proverb previously picked comes through, because the events are allowed to naturally unfold as these smaller, mini achievements are carried out. And this is due to the Sins being vastly overpowered compared to everyone else: Meliodas is impossibly strong, Ban is literally immortal, Diane controls the Earth itself, etc. More specifically, the outcomes that our characters will succeed is a given, but it\u2019s the show\u2019s ability to always keep such victory just out of reach, until the last possible second, that provides every scenario that they encounter with the same feelings of initial hope, followed by rocky despair, and eventual elation.\\n\\n\r\nThese situations are further amped by the incredible diversity that they always contain. The nature of the world presents \u201cHoly Knights,\u201d each with his or her own special weapon or set of abilities that makes that person entirely unique \u2013 the Sins are the same way, just in a league of their own. So every fight, battle, skirmish, duel, or conflict is never the same; new abilities are constantly shown and unique characters are consistently introduced. And even when the same characters and their powers appear more than once, not only do they use their abilities in combination with one another but it gives the show the opportunity to have cast members interact with each other where they had never done so before. This idea also highlights another of Taizai\u2019s strengths: character exploration. The overarching tale is explained and investigated through much of the side characters and the battles that take place, but the anime also takes its time in providing many of the people showcased with both meaningful and purposeful backstory. Ban\u2019s depressing reality, King\u2019s horror-filled past, and even bits of Meliodas\u2019s mysterious upbringing are given. Yet it\u2019s not just the mains; people like Gilthunder, Guila, Dreyfus, and many others have their motivations not just given but applied to the scenarios at hand, allowing for the narrative to contain plot points that are both worthwhile and connected to everything else that\u2019s going on. In other words, the characters and their stories form one, complete adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEven after all this, Taizai doesn\u2019t stop, for it manages to cover almost all of its bases when it comes to telling not just a complete tale but a fulfilling one, too. The journey they originally began actually ends. There are minor fragments from this original quest that still need answers, but these are more related to characterization and development as opposed to having incomplete storytelling. At the same time, a new journey begins. And not just right before the final few scenes of the show; it\u2019s introduced much earlier and it maintains that aforementioned relevancy by being used with the current narrative. Everything also ends up \u201cas it should.\u201d The anime had always been designed with happiness in mind: crazy action sequences, cute and fun comedy, characters to root for, etc. So watching as all of the good guys band together to take out the ultimate evil while providing the audience with a satisfying outcome for everyone involved gave the journey a nice sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just for good measure, Taizai creates a thematic foothold, one that was given in the introduction: the notion of atonement. People are capable of doing some rather vile things. Robbery, manipulation, murder, kidnapping, sexual harassment; or even less extreme cases such as having jealousy, insulting another, or simply being rude. Everybody sins, but it\u2019s not the sinning that\u2019s important, but the good one does to make up for the wrongs accrued that makes the difference. Meliodas protects Elizabeth with all his heart to make up for his failing on Liz, King fights for this kingdom because he couldn\u2019t fight for his, and Ban lives life to the fullest because the woman that gave it to him never had the chance. And again, the side characters exemplify this as well. Using the same examples: Gilthunder chooses to become a roaming helper, Guila has only her younger brother in mind to the point of becoming a \u201ctraitor,\u201d and Dreyfus squares off against his best friend. So while everyone in the show does something that one would consider bad, it\u2019s what they do to atone for their sins, the good that they do, that matters most.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTaizai\u2019s art is quite splendid to look at, mostly because of how colorful everything generally is. And not just with the characters \u2013 the world itself shifts in tone and mood to match the situations on-hand, with the color palate morphing accordingly. The same goes for the move-sets \u2013 it\u2019s an explosion of color at every turn. The fight choreography is also handled quite well, with the camera making sure both the big and the small actions are always front and center. For an added sense of coolness, the abilities are always given names, followed by a textual representation surrounding them to emphasize just how awesome the power, and subsequently the art, really is. Beyond this, the locations are varied, the lighting is appropriate, and the abilities shown are provided flashes, flairs, and focus to match their overall high sense of power.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also some of the strongest in the medium. Elizabeth in particular is incredibly well-designed: her intentionally concealing hair, cute, frilly, pink dress with ribbon, short skirt, one-legged tights, mismatched shoes, and teal eyes to match her teal earrings easily demonstrate how unique every character is drawn. Ban\u2019s spiky hair with red-leather vest and pants, King\u2019s favorite cloak and pillow to go with his transformations, Gowther\u2019s somewhat androgynous appearance, and literally every knight having their own distinct style makes the characters look like the over-the-top parts they play.\\n\\n\r\nIn typical Taizai fashion, actual animation is always above average. Character movements are fluid, the abilities are never not going off, and the fights are tense from start to finish due to the near constant action that occurs. Be it a bit of blinking, hair moving, or watching as dark flames engulf the surroundings in waves, the anime refuses to let up when it comes to animation.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters within Taizai, and many of them see some interesting characterization and a bit of development. While some of them could have seen a bit more \u2013 Meliodas, Diane, and Gowther, to be specific \u2013 what was given is still a healthy dose. Mostly because it wasn\u2019t just the main characters that maintained focus but the side characters did, as well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better characters offered by the anime was Ban. Ban is the \u201cFox\u2019s Sin of Greed,\u201d and he is as carefree as can possibly be. His behavior is somewhat aloof, with him coming off as entirely rude and unsympathetic to anyone he converses with. Even towards Meliodas, who is not only his captain but also his closest friend. His snarky attitude and mean spirit should make him hard to like, but it\u2019s his very uncaring nature that allows him to be as entertaining as he is, for he holds no remorse towards anyone. Save for one. Before acquiring his immortality, he was a thief looking to drink from the \u201cFountain of Youth.\u201d There, he befriended a fairy girl named Elaine, which eventually turned into love. Unfortunately, outside influences cause her to sacrifice herself to save Ban, granting him the power he had initially sought but no longer wanted. Living forever, but not having that person who is dearest to you, unable to have and to hold for the rest of your days, is one hell of an atonement. So Ban\u2019s position becomes clear: he doesn\u2019t get close to anyone because he doesn\u2019t want to have those same feelings of loss again. But even if he may not be kind towards others outright, his intentions are always founded on being there for the people that matter most, lending credit to the notion that Ban isn\u2019t so greedy after all.\\n\\n\r\nHelbram is an interesting individual for a variety of reasons. He not only has his own \u201cfake\u201d persona like his best friend King, but his background is told in a roundabout way \u2013 through King\u2019s recollection of the past. And what is given is a kindhearted fairy who was infinitely intrigued by the humans of the land. Sadly, some of these humans weren\u2019t as good as he thought them to be; witnessing the mutilation of his fairy brethren \u2013 men, women, and children alike \u2013 he dips into insanity. Similar to Ban, he lives his life in an unbearable fashion \u2013 listening to the sounds of tearing wings and desperate screams, forcing him to kill the people he thought he loved, to both \u201cget back\u201d at them and to relieve him of the nightmares he has lived with for centuries. While King ends his best friend\u2019s suffering, Helbram is reincarnated through magic twice-over as a sort of zombie with no brain and a fairy with no heart. He\u2019s a tragic character whose third death at King\u2019s hands not only (finally) saves him, but proves that sometimes, one\u2019s atonement is cruelly massive.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final look into the cast, Elizabeth acts as a foil to everyone; comparing them to her makes it easy to see how sinful everyone is. She is the princess, the \u201cdamsel in distress,\u201d and so she\u2019s initially perceived as being very weak. But she\u2019s in fact the strongest in the show. Not just because she got herself hurt one time by sneakily grabbing that bell, or allowing herself to be kidnapped to save Meliodas, or even using her druidic powers to heal everyone and the land. She\u2019s the strongest because, out of the entire cast, she\u2019s the only person who doesn\u2019t sin. This seems to go against the earlier discussion, but that\u2019s precisely the point. She\u2019s caring, doting, and kind; she\u2019s an absolutely beautiful person both inside and out. So in this world where everyone around her does something bad, she\u2019s the lone outlier, because all she ever does is good.\\n\\n\r\nThis dichotomy of hers \u2013 being \u201cweak\u201d when she is actually the \u201cstrongest\u201d \u2013 is something that is seen with each of the Sins as well. Meliodas is the \u201cDragon\u2019s Sin of Wrath,\u201d yet he is the nicest guy in the world, both to Elizabeth and the people. Diane is the \u201cSnake\u2019s Sin of Envy,\u201d yet her giant-like status is something she comes to accept. And Gowther is the \u201cGoat\u2019s Sin of Lust,\u201d yet he\u2019s purely logical, calculable, and objective in his dealings, with no emotions whatsoever let alone desire. The other Sins can be described as such, but what\u2019s most important is what this represents for Elizabeth, the Sins, and people in general: that nobody should be defined by a single facet. In other words, someone shouldn\u2019t just be known for a single sin committed, for we are all more complex than at first understood.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes are, like the majority of Taizai, top-notch in their execution. The first OP has a very adventurous feel to it, with the singing and beat being extremely catchy to listen to. It maintains a not-too-hopeful yet not-too-melancholic vibe about it, with the blend of both happiness and sadness capturing the happenings of the anime itself quite nicely. The second OP opts to go entirely optimistic. The lyrics aren\u2019t just easy to sing along with, but also hold relevancy to the themes: \u201cthe pain and the pleasure all come together\u201d is another way to phrase how sin and atonement go hand-in-hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending themes follow the same trend. The first ED just oozes fun, with its fast beat, hard guitar, and its all-over-the-place lyrics. It really does make you \u201cfly high\u201d when one sits down and jams out to it. The second ED goes in the completely opposite direction of its counterpart and everything else. The vocalist gives a strong performance, bringing about a lot of power in her voice where the instruments lean towards a \u201csofter\u201d melody. It\u2019s almost depressing, but not in the sense that something bad has gone down, but rather that something good has finally come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawana does it again, bringing about an original soundtrack that fits the mood, contains his signature style, and even has some tracks that are nice to listen to outside of the show itself. \u201cDragonsin\u201d is one of the best pieces, with the continuous violins, distinct accordion, and rising tone pumping one\u2019s adrenaline. \u201cErionesu\u201d is played during those emotional moments, with the backup drums providing that extra kick. And \u201cKenkamatsuri\u201d with its orchestral composition and choir brings the epic feeling that Taizai employs in droves.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the anime is always above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Elizabeth for her consistent and perfect princess voice, Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Ban for his nonchalant way of speaking, Misaki Kuno as Hawk for her very impressive uniqueness she brought to the pig, and Yuuhei Takagi as Gowther for performing as the emotionless mind-freak in his first major role. Realistically, though, everyone did a splendid job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of what made this show so much fun to watch was due in part to both the characters\u2019 individual personalities and the interactions they had between each other. Elizabeth\u2019s constant cuteness, Meliodas always kicking butt, and Gowther\u2019s weird yet endearing way of acting managed to make me smile every single time. Diane\u2019s crush on the captain but obliviousness to the leader of the fairies, Ban messing with King at every turn, Elizabeth patiently putting up with Meliodas\u2019s \u201cflirting;\u201d the cast have this dynamic connection that portrays them as the tight-knit group that they are. Elizabeth is my favorite, but Meliodas, Diane, Ban, Gowther, King, and Hawk are right alongside her, because everyone is just so easily likable from the moment they first appear on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe hilarity is well-done, as are the battles that take place. The wonderful animation, varying abilities, and grand scale of it all makes each fight just as exciting as the last. Ban versus Meliodas in the tiny village as well as Meliodas versus Gilthunder and Hendrickson in the royal capital were crazy to watch, and are excellent examples of what the anime has to offer in the action department. Despite all of this \u2013 the comedy and the clashes \u2013 this isn\u2019t an anime that I found myself absolutely attached to, but there was never a dull moment throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nNanatsu no Taizai is an anime with crisp visuals and killer music; a stellar story and fun-loving characters; and enough entertainment to make even the saddest person smile with glee. It\u2019s no stretch of the imagination to say that \u201cThe Seven Deadly Sins\u201d aren\u2019t just deadly: they\u2019re amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, all about the journey, with constantly unique scenarios, purposeful character exploration, a complete narrative, and themes of sin and atonement\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, colorful and fight-focused art style, incredible character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while Meliodas and a few others needed a bit more focus, Ban, Helbram, Elizabeth, and the rest of the cast received more than enough to exemplify atonement and complexity\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great first OP, great second OP, great first ED, good second ED, nice soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, endearing characters, nice comedy, and high-action battles leave one grinning ear-to-ear\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

I'm not fond of shonen's in general, I love One Piece and some classics but my interest for the genre stops there.\r\nStory: Nothing amazing or original there.\r\nLong story short, the kingdom has been overuled by Holy Knights, the princess is looking for those called the Seven Deadly Sins to help her save her country. 5/10\r\nArt: SHOUNENNNN, I mean, the art doesn't make the anime, i thought the action scene animation was quite poor too. 6/10\r\nSound: None of these terrible OP/ED, decent soundtrack, nothing I'll listen toagain. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The MC's are cute, kinda like Luffy's crew - they are linked by a powerful bond of friendship that will save them when the big fights come - don't expect big introspection or anything fancy. They're still nice guys. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm not a big fan of shonen but I think the author and the anime crew made a fine job at making Nanatsu no Taizai enjoyable. I like to watch this kind of anime & layback, have a smoke, enjoy the show. This show is definitely fun to watch, it's a lot easier to get into than a lot of shonen I've tried to watch and failed (Fairy Tail, Tokyo Ghoul etc) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think I gave it a 6 in my anime list but I'm trying to convince ya shonen fans to watch it so i'll give it a 7. This is definitely a cool anime! Don't expect One Piece (best weekly shonen since Slam Dunk/HxH IMO) but you're going to have a nice time watching this, it's friendly, fun, there's action, boobs, friendship, blood, explosions, knights & super powers. What's not to like? 7/10",

I don't understand.  \r\n+points for the anime:\r\nI do like the main concept and story idea. The main character is intriguing, and overall the cast was good.

            "content": "No Spoiler.\r\nPlot( 9/10): \r\nI think that is important to look at the tags of the anime. Talking about Nanatsu, I can see this tags: Action, Adventure, Fantasy,Shounen, Supernatural.\r\nSeeing this tags, one question crossed my mind: What means a \u201cgood adventure\u201d? \r\nThe word \u201cadventure\u201d originates from the latim \u201cad venture\u201d, which means literally \u201cwhat lies ahead\u201d. Putting this in a anime plot perspective, adventure will be the problems, conflicts, battles, etc\u2026 that the characters have to pass by to reach one determined goal.\r\nAnswer my own question, what means a \u201cgood adventure\u201d ?\r\nA \u201cgood adventure\u201d in a plot means one multiplicity of conflicts, battles, problems. Conflicts, battles,problems, have to permeates all kinds of questions of a fantasy world, so talk about politics, ethics, moral, relationships (friend-friend, lovers-lovers) are things that create a good adventure (so, good things to the characters find a solution), and ,certainly, a good plot in general.\\n\r\nPS: Some adventure can have some funny moments, and on Nanatsu all the conflicts has its pinches of comedy, if you don\u2019t like a adventure per se, you will love the comedy immersed on this.\\n\\n\r\nKnow that you know what \u201cGOOD ADVENTURE\u201d is, let's see how the plot of Nanatsu fits on this definition.\\n\r\nNanatsu no Taizai starts saying on what the world is. The humankind fought against dark creatures (I like to call them demons), the advantage was clear, but some specials humans learn who to use magic and gave the humankind some peace (conflict of survival is placed on the table), this humans become the Holy Knights (our army, nowadays). Here I have to say that the Holy Knights is the stronger corporation of the mankind, but they don't have the political power (this is the job for the king and the noble families). But, for some reason, Seven Holy Knights betrayed the Kingdom. They were known like Seven Deadly Sins, look that a political treason is another conflict to a good adventure. Some years after this event, the Holy Knights became a corrupt corporation, wishing more power, so they decide remove the Kings and Noble Families of the political power, again a good treason conflict.\\n\r\nNow you know how a good anime connect the facts:\\n\r\nOne daughter (Elizabeth) of the king flees from the attack of the Holy Knights and now she is on a mission to find the Seven Deadly Sins (even after the betrayal be eradicated, some Sins still missing) and save the Kingdom (using the traitors against the traitors, just ironic). She finds the Captain of the Sins (Meliodas), the boy on the main photo of the anime and he, smiling, accept the task of saving the Kingdom.\\n\r\nSo, how i said, a good adventure plot is the one that you have problems (facts), that permeates by all the human conflicts (both in a social perspective, than in an individual perspective) and Nanatsu connect all problems with mastery, so it\u2019s a good adventure plot.\\n\r\nIn this plot a lot of questions will grow. The Seven Deadly Sins are truly the real traitors? If not, why they are treated like traitors? What is the plan of the Holy Knights? You can create your own questions. The plot has facts that make you think, so think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nI will not talk about the Princess Elizabeth, basically she is pretty girl that will do you see panties every time, and she the perfect princess for a Utopian World, just that, is a bowl of soup character, deal with it.\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the review, I said that:\\n\r\n\", adventure will be the problems, conflicts,battles, etc\u2026 that the characters have to pass by to reach one determined goal.\"\\n\r\nSo, don't have possibility to talk about adventure without talk about the characters immersed in the adventure. Remember that Nanatsu is a Shounen, so the characters have to pass some clich\u00eas lessons and more than that, the development of the characters will happen more in a magical battlefield than in a battle inside the head of the character . But that mental fight that Nanatsu tries to create something different (and I will explain this topic)\\n\r\nIn this point, I think that name of the anime is useful.\\n\r\nAgain, I have to put some concepts on the table. What is a Sin ? In a religious way, the sin is something that separates you from God (because, it's a break of the law of Him). For the Catholic Church the Deadly Sins are sins that guides you to the condemnation (different of the others Sins). But in Nanatsu you have to observe that \"Sin\" has one small difference in meaning.\\n\r\nSin on Nanatsu is the feeling that the character has to carry. One thing that they never could forgive, one feeling that gives them a strong power and, on the other hand, the feeling that prevents them to evolve. Now you understand why I talked about the concept of sin on the begin ? Because, in Nanatsu all the development of the character never will destroy the sin that they carry.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Nanatsu tries to create a solid base for the character, based and ,I risk myself to say, delimited by the Sin. Very original.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10): \\n\r\n(eps 1-12)The opening and ending are very good, one thing that I didn't like is that the ending fits better to introduce the anime (for me, the ending must be the opening). (eps 1-12)\\n\r\n(eps 13+) Now this opening is a masterpiece, the lyrics combines with the anime a lot. The ending is very good, too. Now, i can't say that the ending must be the opening. (eps 13+)\\n\r\nBut talking about the ost (\"musics\" on the anime per se) is very weak. You don't have good battle musics that put you in the fire of the battle, or a funny music that combines with the fun moment itself. And I not found one good \"orchestra\" (a good violin solo, or a good piano solo).\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I don't like the Art. I can summarize this feeling, saying that I felt like i was in a anime of 2002, the tracing is very thin, and I missed some brightness. The effects on battle could be much better, again the lack of brightness \"helps\" this point. With the budget that the anime have, Nanatsu could do a better work here (the same with the sound).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nVery good Shounen, with something more deep than swords, magic and the cliche \"good boys vs bad boys\". You will find all this, but putting a good adventure (like I tried to explain).\\n\r\nYou will laugh a lot in this adventure. I recommend this if you want to see a shounen not so cliche and funny, and if you have some obsession with panties (prepare yourself for the \"fan service\"). Just it.",

            "content": "This anime did some things well and some...not so well. Let's break it down. \r\nStarting with the things that were done well, I want to point out the lore and a few characters. Actually, now that I think about it, most of the things done well were rarely shown on screen, such as the backgrounds of the characters. Both Ban and Meliodas had interesting backgrounds, and even King and Diane had some cool stories. On the other hand, the lore was amusing enough to make me want to keep watching it. Who were the Seven Deadly Sins, really? What was going on in the Demonworld? Who were the goddesses? Why was there just a single giant, Diane? Well, never mind. The point is, there were a lot of interesting ideas, even if many of them fell into cliches or tropes. And I'm not going to immediately dismiss something because it may be a trope. Tropes exist for a reason. When done correctly, they can elevate a story. However, there are certain times to use tropes, and certain times not to use them. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to some of the not-so-well-done aspects of this anime. It seems like the writers just couldn't brush off their habits of using tropes. So many of them! Damsel in distress, hero who saves the world, love triangles, etc. But then we get all the anime cliches, too. Just about every fight in this series makes no sense, and it's all because of the phenomenon that Gurren Lagann poked at: meaningless measures of power that fluctuate through time without any reason.  If you watch this show and try to understand the order of characters in terms of power, it's impossible. You may have a feeling that Meliodas is the strongest, and maybe that's true, but you don't see it much. He gets his ass kicked a lot. So do all the other characters. But the sad part is that none of it matters. In the end, a surge of energy overcomes our heroes, and they save the day. This is really frustrating because it's on top of the already meaningless \"special moves\" every knight has. It was disappointing to find out that the moves didn't really matter. I think there were one or two occasions when they countered each other based on the type or style of move (i.e. fire vs water, etc.). So most fights boiled down to who's stronger.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'm still giving this a 5/10 because it's stronger points, like the character backstories and the lore, made me watch it til the end. Also, Hawk, the true hero of this series, was very fun to watch, in particular.",

            "content": "My experience of this anime can be summed up by the word \"meh\". I went into it hoping for a nice twist on the seven deadly sins being the good guys, and some awesome fight scenes, and ended up sorely disappointed. Sure, the characters are known by their sins, but rather than be actual embodiments of said sins, they were simply granted them as derogatory titles, so they fail to stand out as shounen manga characters in that department.\r\nThe characters don't undergo any sort of development across the series, and for the most part are bland and boring. Ban is pretty fun because of hisaloof yet silly attitude, and the rest have some decent humor, but this is definitely not a high point of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe combat was especially mediocre. The fights only ever focus on Meliodas and Ban 99% of the time, with the rest of the sins just acting as accessories. This is especially frustrating after so many of them are hyped up as 'the strongest of the deadly sins', or 'the prince of fairies'. I particularly was looking forward to Diane kicking ass, but we only ever really get one awesome moment out of her when she punches through a supposedly unbreakable barrier. The rest of the time she's either sleeping, 40 miles away, or has a hole punched through her chest and has to act as a damsel in distress. Ugh.\\n\\n\r\nWe do get a couple of good battles in, but the majority only last a couple of seconds, due to the characters' (see: Meliodas and Ban's) overpoweredness. Only two or three fights really give any true sense of danger, and one of them was ruined for me by how easily Diane went down. But that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nI kept watching because I expected a more even playing field eventually, with all of the sins being equally capable, but that unfortunately never happens. Meliodas and Ban are, throughout the anime, just complete male power fantasies, while the rest of the crew just gets swept under the rug. \\n\\n\r\nI don't hate this anime, but I don't recommend it. It's not bad, just decent, and really not worth your time. It lacks any aspect that really stands out, and ultimately just falls flat, lost amidst a sea of better, more entertaining shounen anime.",

So, it\u2019s interesting to see an anime that suffers from these clich\u00e9s and more \u2013 but also utilizes them to their fullest extent, giving rhyme and reason to them; which makes the show a whole lot more fun and meaningful than was expected. \r\n[STORY]\r\n------------\r\nThe core plot is simply the adventures (and misadventures)of an unlikely team as they traverse the land, looking for other members of a mysterious group known as the \"Seven Deadly Sins\u201d. While traveling, the \u2018team\u2019 comes across other past members, gets into fights with various characters, help people out, chat, joke and just generally try to have fun and do what is just - while working towards completing their ultimate objective of reuniting all seven and reclaiming the land. The series has a great grasp on balancing the humor, the drama, and the action. One never seems to overpower the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe soul of this show though, is divided into two aspects: the fights, and the character development (which often ties into the aforementioned aspect). Most of the main characters (and many of the side characters and antagonists) get their time to shine and be developed. Character dialogue, actions and interactions, as well as fantastic backstories for many of the characters really flesh things out and add a sense of purpose and reason to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, things don\u2019t always end up being what they appear to be, and there are many points in the series where completely unexpected things happen that really help make the series more refreshing and less repetitive. But, some parts of the plot are a bit convoluted. Nothing that should detriment the experience, but things can sometimes seem a bit\u2026 off. \\n\\n\r\nLastly, the ending is a bit lackluster, but still thrilling to watch. And, the way it ends leaves it open to the possibility of a new season.\\n\\n\r\n[ART]\\n\r\n--------\\n\r\nThe art in \u2018Nanatsu no Taizai\u2019 is of an extremely high quality. Action scenes flow well and character designs, facial expressions, backgrounds, etc. are above par. The greatest thing about it though is that the quality is maintained throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\n [SOUND]\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nThe music in the series is more quality over quantity. There are many pieces that are repeatedly used, but they all fit the times and scenes in which they are used and didn\u2019t become annoying.  \\n\\n\r\nAll four of the openings and endings are great and add to the series, rather than being something that most people would skip.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting is also of a high quality. No lines felt hammy, forced or otherwise grated on the ears. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThis is where this show absolutely excels \u2013 for most of the characters. A majority of them have unique personalities. They fear things, love things and hate things. They cry, they laugh and they have morals, hopes and dreams. The series does a great job of building most of the characters up and making it feel like these are living, breathing people.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female character, Elizabeth, has a decent amount of development. But, regrettably, the main male character, Meliodas, does not. He really doesn\u2019t seem to change over the series, and remains \u2013 for the most part \u2013 an enigma. There is a backstory given to him that helps shine a little light on who he was and currently is, but so many things remain unclear concerning his character that it can be hard to attach yourself to him as the show progresses. Also, he is just too overpowered, which means you never fear for him in any of the action scenes... and therefore lose a lot of potential tension. \\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters though - who I won\u2019t name or give details for, as finding out who they are and what they are like is a part of the series\u2019 enjoyment \u2013 are the most well developed in the entire series. There\u2019s a great possibility of you coming to love a character you previously hated or vice-versa.\\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n------------------\\n\r\nThere are a lot of flaws. But even with those flaws, this was still an immensely enjoyable series. It had great fights with meaning to them, great humor, great characters, and some really powerful stories. I was pleasantly surprised with the anime and don\u2019t regret the time I spent on it.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n--------------\\n\r\nThis is a fantastic action-adventure anime, and a \u201csin\u201d (forgive me for the pun, I had to) that I will gladly partake in again soon.\\n\\n\r\n~FINAL SCORES~\\n\r\n----------------------\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n",

            "content": "The funny thing about sins is that we all have it. As some part of us, there\u2019s a sin in everyone. It\u2019s simple really because they are natural human instincts. That\u2019s hardly what Nanatsu no Taizai is about though. On the surface, the show seems to talk about the sins in their variety. But really, this series is more about a journey, one that has our heroes find those lost Sins. Like a classic adventure, Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins) crafts the extraordinary portrait of how a journey should be in such a fantasy world.\r\nLet\u2019s get something over with first. This series hasthe infamous studio known as A-1 Pictures in charge which spells out for some controversy. Known for their other adaptations such as Sword Art Online, Magi, Blue Exorcist, and other related works, they have created some controversy when adapting shounen titles. If you\u2019re thinking adequacy, then you may be right. They are known for butchering up manga material with adaptations such as the latter half of Blue Exorcist and first season of Magi. For Nanatsu no Taizai, the series runs for over 100+ chapters and is still ongoing. The worry may be that the series will be butchered to an extent that will be unsalvageable.  While it does suffer a bit of that, the show does shine in its own ways. It\u2019s by no means an earth breaking adaptation yet still has its compelling ideas bought into light.\\n\\n\r\nTaking on account of premise, the show should be fairly straightforward. We have a young girl named Elizabeth, who also happens to be the princess of a kingdom. From the first episode, she meets a young boy named Meliodas happily serving to customers at a tavern. It heads into an outlandish route once we learn his true identity as the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins. From here on and out, the duo remarks on a journey to find the remaining Sins. There\u2019s also some explanations regarding the origins of the series in the beginning so all should be made clearly to the audience. Taking for granted, the show is generic from first glance. The world setting the series takes place in is decorated with fantasy gimmicks. Whether it\u2019s one of those ancient fortresses, dungeons, enchanted forests, or even land of the dead, the series doesn\u2019t try to pull anything new from its hat. However, it\u2019s also important to take notice how much they have influence with the events of the series. The show puts on emphasis on some of the settings such as the enchanted forest and its significance. Even past events connected to some of the setting becomes significant in the overall story development. Similarly, most major characters in the series has holds some significance in their roles. The seven deadly sins are perhaps the most infamous examples as the Holy Knights hunts them in an almost cat-and-mouse like story on occasions.\\n\\n\r\nBut when it comes to performance, it\u2019s hard to not take off eyes on our adventurers. Starting with Elizabeth, we can see how gentle she is as a princess yet also brave at heart. Her relationship with the other Sins develops gradually over the course of this show starting with Meliodas. While the two are hardly compatible, there is an innate connection between the two. It also makes us wonder more about them individually as characters. The show makes clever usage of flashbacks to give the Sins some character backgrounds such as with Meliodas, Ban, and King. Unfortunately, the show doesn\u2019t capitalize on all of them and skips some material that are necessary. Still, the characterization is what\u2019s important there and it adapts most of that in its right path except for perhaps Elizabeth. Her character hardly gets any character development and is frustrating to watch. That same also goes for Hawk; the pig who for some reason has the name of a bird despite being incapable of flight. During their journey, they do influence certain outcome of events but the focus on their characters on an individual level is moderate at best. There\u2019s also a decent chemistry between certain characters including the Sins and Holy Knights. Nanatsu no Taizai is about a journey after all and events connecting with characters of the past can influence those in the present and even the future.\\n\\n\r\nRelationships can also be something to keep an eye on. From strong friendship to romance, the series undertakes ways to flesh them out. However, do not expect top tier adaptation coming from A-1 Pictures. Certain parts are left out that could of made specific relationship seem more realistic. At the same time, we can also see how human some of the characters are. This is demonstrated by the emotions characters show ranging from sorrow, to anger, to regret. It extends to not only the Sins but also the Holy Knights. While not as clearly focused as the Sins, some of them do get character background with examples like Gilthunder. The show makes it clear that some of them are antagonists although there are also changes down the road. Despite all this, the show still has a trend for what shounen series does which usually leads up with predictable outcomes. \\n\\n\r\nStanding on its feet, the show marks its spot for a fantasy series clearly evidenced by its colorful background. The artwork is well adapted from the manga to illustrate a diverse range of characteristics you would find in any shounen series. Mountain ranges, enchanted forests, and crude dungeons are all fantastically illustrated. The character designs also has variety to give each of them a unique look. Whether it\u2019s Diane\u2019s titanic figure, Ban\u2019s delinquent face, or Gilthunder\u2019s cold expressions, the show is able to create a concrete degree with the variety. I also give praise to the battle scenes as effort can be seen with most of the fights. A few parts will be expected to be left out while the pacing can feel oddball at times. Nonetheless, the show has a good way to balance out its action. Finally, you may be raising your eyebrows on occasions with the fan service. While the show isn\u2019t in the ecchi territory, it does have parts when Meliodas plays with Elizabeth\u2019s skirt like some kid at the candy store or when she is almost completely naked (for legitimate reasons) on more than one occasion. \\n\\n\r\nGet ready to put on your headphones. Anyone familiar with Hiroyuki Sawano\u2019s work will easily recognize his music style. While it seems generic at first, the soundtrack is clearly and impeccably crafted with strong precision. It coordinates with action scenes well that some of the battles feel like miniature movies. OST also has a decent balance when it comes to comedy and drama. However when it comes to voice adaptations, there are mixed thoughts. Characters such as Meliodas and Elizabeth sound dull and stereotypical. On the other hand, characters like Diane and Ban has a better fit to their personalities. When it comes to voice mannerisms, it\u2019s important to see how their roles fit with the story. Some clearly has what it takes while others falls off short. Similarly, the OP and ED theme songs fits with the show\u2019s gimmicks but is generic to the core when it comes to rhythm.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 2 cour show, it\u2019s easy to say that adapting this series to perfection is an impossible mission. What this show did accomplish though is drawing out the shounen gimmicks to its core. The colorful cast of characters unites a variety of personalities in a classic adventurous journey. And during that journey, we see the challenges our adventurers endears and the obstacles they face. It\u2019s not a complex show really when it comes to the story in the end. Also be aware that this season apparently leaves off some hints for adaptations in the future. With the artwork and soundtrack clearly made to the point and a reasonable premise, it\u2019s all part of this said machine.",

So let's begin for a second time now.\r\nIn late 2013, I read about 23 chapters of the manga and I wasn't impress, don't know if I was not in a good mood or not. fast forward in 2015, and the anime came, I wasn't excited at all,until..... lets start with the review. ;)\\n\\n\r\nStory:7/10. The story revolves around Meliodas and Elizabeth who both goal is to gather the seven deadly sins, although initially there goal for gathering the seven deadly sins is different, in the end their reason for wanting to gather them intertwined with each other. The story follows them as they gather the sins and also clearing their names on false lies about them. while also in combat with the holy nights. The story follows the normal shounen formula but it does tweak it up a little to make this series not be named as just another generic shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8/10.Art looks good, I didn't really have any problem.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8/10. Sawano is the one that compose this, should I say anything else?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:8/10. The characters are the strongest aspect of this series, The author did a great job in giving flash backs to the characters, each characters have different personality, which makes the series have interesting drama. the characters have depth imo. The author took his time to develop the characters and to give them good flashback stories. we get to know who they were and what were there reason. these characters are the type that would make any series enjoyable even if the story is complete rubbish, that's how much I enjoy these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8/10. I enjoy this series a lot. great action, drama, romance and suspense. it had everything.\\n\\n\r\noverall:8/10. Overall this series is very good. the anime has completely change my opinion on this series. I think its time to go back to the manga now. ;) anyways thank for reading! sorry if my review felt kinda lacking, I put so much effort in writing the previous one, and to see it go to waste really demoralized me.\\n",

            "content": "[First review] [bad english]\r\nStory: 1/10\r\nLike every clich\u00e9 shounen, The Seven Deadly Sins has a mediocre and linear story, that is only used to justify fanservice and nonsense fights. The plot follows Meliodas, a very dumb and innocent dude (despite he always abuse his friend Elizabeth and, sometimes, turns into a demon), who is unjustifiably determined to help the princess that he knew 2 seconds ago. \r\nIt's basically a generic copy of Fullmetal Alchemist, but one thousand times worse.\r\nArt: 5/10\r\nThe animation is fine, but the trait is just terrible, and the character design is so badly done.\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nThe sound composition is, ultimately, just okay. It's fundamentallycommon teenager J-Rock, and nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1/10\\n\r\nNanatsu No Taizai's characters are quite one-dimensional, although they are projected to be great. Meliodas is a pathetically clich\u00e9 shounen protagonist, following Dragon Ball Z and Naruto molds. Elizabeth is the Lucy Heartfilia of the show, an unbearable girl who is only used to make fanservice scenes and incite the virgin jerk-offers to search for hentai. Other characters are equally terrible, as exemple, Ban is just pure pose, and divinized by fans only for being the greedy anti-hero (ps: he is the greed, but gives up of immortality, because a girl asked for him give up).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nWith all these defects, it's hard to say that something in the show is enjoyable. The Seven Deadly Sins falls in all the aspects of a good show, it's very uncomfortable to watch, mainly because EVERY episode has at least one rape scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10\\n\r\nThe conclusion is: Nanatsu no Taizai is the most sexist non-hentai anime and the worst battle shounen ever made, even worse than 5-minutes YouTube homemade animations.",

            "content": "I've always wanted to review Nanatsu, but I just couldn't give myself energy to do it. There's a lot of wrong things in this piece, and to flesh out each of them is gonna take time - but I really need to. A lot of reviews on MAL just didn't get to these points, so I'll have to talk about them myself.\r\nNanatsu is your average shonen, with ALL the cliches you can expect to see (overpowered characters, tits, superpowers, power of friendship and shit). But not only shonen cliches, also medieval story cliches: unbelievably unbreakable swords, giant monsters everywhere, kingdoms and knights, games of powerand sexism - A LOT of sexism. I'm actually surprised no one has talked about it until now. But let's move on and I'll flesh this out later.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a huge cliche, but has some interesting ways of don't letting it show - it is never clear if the seven deadly sins are good, bad or just a bunch of chaotic neutral egoists (much like Genei Ryodan from HxH). The corruption inside the holy knights is shown in a way that makes you think before you judge. Are they really the evil ones, they're just doing their jobs or are being manipulated?\\n\\n\r\nSound and animation: nothing that stands out. Average visuals for a battle shonen, average music for a medieval story. Loved the second ed song, though the video is quite sleepy.\\n\\n\r\nThe fights are beautiful and very well-animated, but quite predictable. The main problem with overpowered characters (for Nanatsu, it means all the cast) is that you're watching a battle and BOOM someone pulls power off their asses. Ohh no he just got sliced in three BOOM he regenerates with a sacred power that no one talked about until the last 10 seconds. After seing fights like this for 3-4 times, you just start not caring anymore. Everything will get solved in some miraculous way, just leave it be. Soon this character will awake his krakenian demonic rainbow powers and beat everyone's asses up.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the major problems in Nanatsu is the inconsistency of the characters. Not of THE characters, but of them as a whole: you have some pretty good ones, that really interest you and break some cliches, like Guila, King and Gowther. Many of the charaters have interesting stories and a lot of development as the story goes on. \\n\r\nThen you have your Bucket of Golden Crappy Characters, mainly Meliodas and Elizabeth. Meliodas is a man with the appearance, manners and mentality of a 12-year-old, infinite powers and a broken sword - and you have to put up with him being the main character. Elizabeth is a sack of potatoes with tits. Oh, and she also cries sometimes. Ok, MANY times. Just what you expected from a medieval story. (I'm personally not a fan of this kind of narrative, so keep this in mind while reading... Or not.) This is something you see very much, SO MUCH I can't stand it anymore. The swordsman with a main character-centered morality and the hot woman who falls in love with him because he is so \"brave and heroic\", and not for any other particular reason. Problem with that? Despite being a BIG cliche, no, it's not a problem. The main problem with Nanatsu comes NOW:\\n\\n\r\nEVERY EPISODE has some scene where Meliodas harasses Elizabeth - puts his hand under her skirt, inside her pants, on her tits. And he does it like he's putting a cup of tea in the table. Nothing wrong, I'm just rubbing your breasts. And what does Elizabeth do? Does she go yandere and smack him in the face, like in so many other animes? Does she call for someone to help? Does she accept it, and confesses that she gets turned on by this? No. Of all acceptable (or not) things, she does NOTHING. Elizabeth just asks \"sir Meliodas, what are you doing?\" \"oh I'm just putting my hand there, it's warm\" and gets back to what she was doing before, like she's not feeling anything at all. Elizabeth exists for the purpose of being harassed for the fanservice. Her character is shallow as a human being and as a woman.\\n\\n\r\n\"OHH NO THERE GOES THE SJW\" - no. I personally HATE sjws. Before this being a fault because of the sexism, it is a fault of CHARACTER CONSTRUCTION. Things just don't work that way. It's plausible that pigs can talk, that fairies exist in their own kingdom and that a swordsman acts like a horny teenager. It's NOT plausible that a woman exists just for crying and being harassed like nothing was wrong.\\n\\n\r\n\"OH BUT IF YOU STOP WATCHING ANIME BECAUSE OF ECCHI YOU'LL NEVER WATCH ANYTHING BLAHBLAHBLAH\". I love Tenchi Muyo!, because the women there are REAL women, with personality and reactions. I love Prison School, because is ADMITTEDLY an ero comedy, with funny reactions and unbelievable funny situations - with plausible characters for that kind of universe. Nanatsu is pure abusive fanservice. That kind of thing would be understandable in a hentai - a genre with the sole function of hardening certain body parts; though it would still be ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Nanatsu no Taizai is something I watched as a challenge. A challenge for myself, \"can I stand this thing and watch it to the end?\", and a challenge for the series, \"does this get better ANYTIME?\". Yes, it gets better in the second half, though rushed, but in the end it felt so hollow. Battles and amazing powers and some deep and interesting characters and a lot of fanservice shit and oh look there's a lot of better shonen animes with much fewer cliches. \\n\\n\r\nThe main reason behind the hype for Nanatsu must be the superpowers, something that I really don't care about, despite being a fan of typical shonen. I don't really see any other reason for someone to watch this, it's just... An extremely whatever anime. Does this sentence make sense? Well, but that's it.",

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nI don't know why many people find this anime so good when it's really not.\r\nThe anime gives us first the introduction of the characters. It was ok, I guess...Still, I was annoyed at the character of Meliodas. Why? Because he is a fucking sexual harasser with the girl who joins him: Elizabeth. Touching her boobs and ass and looking at her panties... Is that supposed to be funny? Because I'd find it rather disgusting than something for laughs. Besides that, the other characters were very neutral for me, but this Gowther guy who appears almost at the last which had a mysterious aura waskind of interesting like  you want to know more about him and the pig makes an exeption as the second one being a sympathethic character who cares about his friends and is always protecting the useless Elizabeth from Meliodas. And you can't deny me the fact that Elizabeth isn't useless because she is. She doesn't do anything in the series. Crying, shouting Meliodas's name to save her and letting herself be touched by him doesn't mean anything of utility for me. She is the typical useless girl who everyone likes because she is so nice and pasive. Nice.\\n\\n\r\nI won't say the anime is sexist because it isn't. Women fights as we see one of our main protagonist: Dianne, yeah, she is strong and not weak like Elizabeth. There is a girl which represents the typical stereotype of characters that never opens their eyes that does fight as well as the other with white hair who seems to have an interest in Ban. I liked the girl that I mentioned in the last since she had very brave spirit. The other is very meh to me but at least she does something.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the plot, there isn't much to say about it since I didn't understand a shit. Like I mentioned first, we have the characters introduction, some funny scenes and then there is this main plot. Everything happens so fast and there is all this fights all of a sudden. I only understood that someone whichidontrememberwho kidnapped Elizabeth and everyone has to save her\\n\r\n...Wow, we never saw that before in a history, sooo original! \\n\\n\r\nThe end was good I guess....It wasn't so bad done like the main plot. We see Elizabeth with her sisters and her father in the palace when Meliodas with all the others deadly sins came to tell her if she wants to join them one more time in their adventures. She accepts and goes with them. At least it wasn't a sad drama but it didn't gave me motivation to follow the manga or be excited for a second season.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the manga, I made some research after watching the anime and there were many complains since my percepction seems to be right about how the direction of the plot has happened. The manga takes its time to explain everything not like the anime which everything happens all of a sudden, characters and relationships appears out of nowhere and you don't understand what the hell is going on.\\n\r\nAnd if you asked me if I was sad with the dead of King's friend? No, I wasn't. The part is terrible done and of course, I didn't understand it very well to feel something emotional. \\n\r\nI guess I laughed a bit with the pig being protective with the crying girl? But that was all the emotion I had rather than feeling kind of bored and asking myself what was happening.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the seven deadly sins was a bad anime for me. I didn't see anything out of common and I haven't mentioned this before but this characters are supposed to be deadly sins...Why the hell didn't they focused more on that instead of putting useless and predictable fights which nobody cares? It could have been way more interesting. I mean come on, I realized they represented the deadly sins after a friend told me so I didn't took notice which is a pity because the anime could have been way better. \\n\r\nSo that's it, a fantasy anime that doesn't had much to apport only kind of fan service I guess , pretty colours and putting figths as we're supposed to be interested in that. Fights are good in shounen animes when the plot and what is happening according to the situation is well executed.",

            "content": "Shounen is a tricky genre. Too often, plot is abandoned for the sake of showcasing all of the powers and techniques of the hero, and knowing this, I was very reluctant to get into Nanatsu no Taizai. Having taken the plunge several weeks after the show's original premier, I am incredibly pleased with what I ended up with.\r\nNanatsu no Taizai does follow the same basic shounen formula: one powerful force butts heads against another, everyone is naming their attacks before they use them, a useless female companion appears--yet, these rough edges are given their time to develop into something likable and actually compelling to watch.\r\nThestory has excellent pacing in that it sticks to the typical format of battle after battle while still gradually introducing each of the main characters and forwarding the plot. With each few segments, the view gains time to grow accustom to each of the Deadly Sins themselves, and find more to them than simply different battle styles. As well, the motivation for both the protagonists' and antagonists' sides were plainly present; I was especially pleased at the motivation for the antagonists, as that is one such point that is so often vague and underdeveloped.\\n\r\nToward the very end, elements from both opposing sides came together for a satisfying conclusion, and watching everyone's goal form into one single objective was a delightful way to conclude the relations between the two sides.\\n\r\nIt was also pleasing to see that the series knew when to push fanservice down a few pegs in order to complete the story, rather than spoil the climax with the inclusion of the humorous bits of female lead at the beginning. It was nice to see the focus shift, the story taking precedence. \\n\r\nThis is not to say any attempts at lightheartedness are abandoned; they find their spotlight for each of the characters, and not just the main hero.\\n\\n\r\nThrough this, equality was provided; it wasn't just the main Sin, Meliodas, that got the spotlight. Attention was paid to the feelings and relations between the other Sins, and screen time was generously given to explain their pasts, while not completely disconnecting from the main plot. While somewhat cliche at times, for lack of a better phrase, I gave a damn about the cast. \\n\\n\r\nEverything in the show was also given the helpful support of clean art and magnificent sound. The selection of voices was very fitting for each character, emotions in-story being very well conveyed. \\n\r\nThe color choices were bright and the animation harbored the obviousness of a team that knew what they were doing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I suppose this is one of those series that's popular for a reason, but more of a reason that useless moe or excessive showing off. Not being a particularly big action aficionado myself, I am unsure of whether or not my enjoyment stems from the excitement of branching out from slice of life once in a while, but I am glad I did. Nanatsu no Taizai earns its popularity, and I would not be upset at the release of another season, so long as those at the helm take careful care to put as much attention to making it more than basic shounen just as they did with these first 24 episodes.",

You have good quality animation, a group of characters with various skills and personalities that you will surely find your favorite. Action and abilities, and even some twist on historical and mythical figures in place. Even has some fan service and good humor and starts off with a captivating first episode.Yet it all feels like a whole bunch on stuff thrown together with no clear direction.\r\nThe universe isn't explained well enough or provides clarity. You have giants, humans, demons, fairies, immortals, holy knights, talking pigs etc etc.  It's as if any creaturethey wanted to exists in this realm does. This would be ok if the story did better with making everything mesh.  It just feels as if things don't make sense, we have multiple main characters whose appearances change drastically with little explanation.\\n\\n\r\nThe fighting also leaves a lot to be desired. Fights are quick and are more a display of skill than an actual engaging back and forth.  Skills can also seem quite random. The overall lack of  consistency can make it difficult to let the anime capture you. The show isn't bad it's just missing a polish to make it a great show, you may watch it and love it , but chances are you will watch keep asking yourself should you continue or should you drop it.",

            "content": "The story of how I came into watching Nanatsu no Taizai (or Seven Deadly Sins, whichever do you prefer to call it) is rather an odd one. The series isn't exactly on my anime watchlist back when it aired on Fall 2014, and I only watched it when I noticed Animax channel in my region began airing the series during winter. Considering the series seems like a good harmless shonen fun, I decided to finally watch it since I don't watch that much anime in that season. And it is quite good fun shonen, although it takes a while to get there.\r\nThe series story arepretty much what it says in the synopsis and follow the standard 'gather comrade in arms to overthrow evil ruler' plot (with some twist along the way of course). In a way, it make sense to see why Nanatsu's appealing to its fans due to the series old school JRPG-esque setting and plot (which is rather refreshing personally), but infused it with enough shonen action trope to make itself distinguishable. The reminiscence, however, doesn't stop there, with both the artstyle and character design are noticeably influenced by Akira Toriyama's ,who also did the character design for JRPG such as the Dragon Quest series and Chrono Trigger.\\n\\n\r\nNanatsu start quite weakly for the first few episodes with, at the time main characters, Meliodas and Elizabeth, aren't quite an engaging characters with the former being a frank, shameless, and brave pervert, while the latter being the stereotypical weak kind-hearted princess with aren't much complexity. It doesn't helped either the series humor are mostly consist of Elizabeth being groped by Meliodas. Fortunately, the series picked itself up when the rest (well, the majority of them anyway) of the Nanatsu no Taizai are introduced. There's Diane, a cheerful giantess who has a massive crush on Meliodas. Ban, an undead thief who's also a somewhat loveable ass. King, a fairy with a crush on Diane, and also the general straightman and the 'sensible' one of the group. And Gowther, who's practically a stoic robot with a human skin.\\n\\n\r\nThe main cast dynamics are definitely the series main core strength. While the Nanatsu crew aren't exactly colorful, each of them had a solid personality and flaws which allows all of them to bounce off well with each other. And with the establishment that the Nanatsu crew are a very strong warriors, it also allows for a quite funny slapstick humor. The rest of the cast, both on the holy knights side and the non affiliated one, also fares pretty well. The holy knights in particular, have a distinguishable personality and also different sides to each of them which prevents them from becoming one dimensional.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, special mention for the series composition, done by Shotaro Suga (Oregairu, Uchouten Kazoku). Each scenes and plot beats flows pretty nicely and the overarching story also progressed quite quickly with almost no meandering around or pointless episodes without feeling its rushed (although it does feels rushed at times). For example, during the tournament arc, one episode literally covers three fights. But each fight are short enough so it doesn't worn out its welcome, but long enough to be entertaining and meaty.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the fights themselves, they're pretty entertaining spectacle with dynamic direction and some nice animation. Each of the characters have their own core magic skill and moves set that derives itself from it. While the core magic are simple in nature, they bounced off well without one power overwhelming with the other. Few of the skills derivatives and the way it work in conjunction with their weapon are also quite creative. One character has the core skill of mind invasion, which allows him to trapped his enemy in an illusion, rewrite their memories temporarily and even trigger a nightmare inside. And since he channel his power through a bow, he can do it in long range.\\n\\n\r\nOn the technical front, Nanatsu had a generally solid aesthetic with a variety of colors and distinct character design, but unfortunately it's bog down by a rather generic medieval fantasy background and landscape (with one exception, that is the land of the dead). The music, done by Hiroyuki Sawano, features an appropriate range of upbeat battle music with some classic medieval instruments  to enhance the atmosphere. But compare to Sawano's previous soundtrack work such as Kill la Kill and Attack on Titan, the music in Nanatsu are surprisingly rather tame. While it did fit the mood and the tone of the series, if I hadn't know beforehand that Sawano's in charge of the music, I wouldn't even recognized who's the music composer, due to the lack of his usually more grandeur and bombastic pieces.\\n\\n\r\nThere are, however, some niggling issues I had with the series. Asides from the aforementioned weak first few episodes and the show use of Meliodas perverted action toward Elizabeth as a recurring gag, the problem is on the way the series handle few of the character's arc, in particular, Diane and Ban's. During the final arc, Diane, out of nowhere, suddenly have loneliness because of her being a Giant. The problem with this is on the fact that Diane, up until that point, had been characterized as a cheerful girl who has a crush on Meliodas. Loneliness has never been something of a problem for her in the earllier episodes. While the series does dedicated an episode behind this later on, it still felt out of place for her character because of the lack of foreshadowing she had this problem and the lack of build up. The problem with Ban's are, quite interestingly, the exact opposite of Diane's problem. His flaws and problems are something that's already been established and explored right after he joins the crew, but it falls short on its conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nSo, that's pretty much Nanatsu no Taizai. You have to stuck up for the first few episodes, past that, and what you have, is a pretty entertaining shonen fantasy action with fun characters and some nice battles.",

            "content": "A group of knights have overthrown the kingdom and started an uproar, dubbed as the \"Seven Deadly Sins.\" Soon, they all suddenly disappeared and the people rejoiced over their supposed defeat. Ten years later, the kingdom is overflowing with pride, yet a hidden darkness lies within as a girl comes up to a bar...\r\n\"Nanatsu no Taizai\" or \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" is a recent anime released by A-1 Pictures that illustrate the adventures of a certain group against a kingdom deemed corrupt. That's basically it in a nutshell, so here is my review of this series! \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story basically follows a young girl named\"Elizabeth\" who seeks out to search the Deadly Sins for a certain purpose. And from then on it's load of adventures and especially action in forms of duels, battles, etc. Very simple plot line with add-on gags of humour and feels trip. Subplots don't tend to overtake it. The story is enjoyable and easy to follow.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nTo be terribly honest, the cover art did not appeal to me at first glance. It seemed quite outdated and doesn't fit the name. However, it all changes when I watched the first episode. The art is like that to fit the setting (which is good) and the action scenes were epic and simple. Perfect amount of flash and bash and detailed frames. Not the best, but beautiful nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is not a dominant part of The Seven Deadly Sins as its OSTs are quite adequate and don't stand out too much. However, I do take a BIG liking to the opening \"Netsujou no Spectrum\" since it fits it really perfectly, as well as the ED \"7 -seven\" by FLOW X GRANRODEO. OP and Ed fit and I hope it'll stay that way. I wish for more prismatic OSTs though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nFrom an anime called the Seven Deadly Sins, you'd expect the lead to be some dark angel and the cast to be dark demons with a hint of goth and black. Nanatsu no Taizai does not follow this thought but the characters are the most amazing I've ever seen in an anime of the sorts. The cast is not very big, but the development of backstories is amazing, adding depth. Designs and personalities are very well done!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI particularly look forward to every episode because every episode's end always has some cliffhanger of sorts that prompts you to watch the next one. Each episode is unpredictable as the balance of action and humour isn't obvious. Still, every episode is unique and has their own flair.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is something I've been waiting for since last season. Despite being disappointed by the preview cover art, it was quickly reversed as I watched it more. I recommend this anime to the general crowd as well as those who enjoy reading the manga (Yes it has a manga!) and people who enjoy action/adventure. I hope you enjoy it!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nEverybody sins. You and me, friends and family, neighbors and strangers; nobody is averse to acting sinful. The severity, though, changes depending on the circumstance: a rogue thought doesn\u2019t do much harm nor does a little bit of desire. But other, more malicious movements can harbor emotions with greater intent to maim. This is where atonement comes into play. For while sinning is bad, it\u2019s the good we do to make up for our grievances that truly matters. Nanatsu no Taizai takes this idea to heart, crafting an anime that needs no forgiveness.\r\nSTORY\r\nTaizai begins innocently enough.Elizabeth Liones visits a local pub where Meliodas, the now infamous \u201cDragon\u2019s Sin of Wrath\u201d resides. Seeking his and the other Sins\u2019 aide in helping not only her father but also the kingdom from encroaching civil doom, Elizabeth and Meliodas embark on a journey to find the other \u201clegendary warriors\u201d \u2013 The Seven Deadly Sins.\\n\\n\r\nThe word \u201cjourney\u201d here is important, because that\u2019s what this is. \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination that\u2019s vital, but the journey\u201d is something that\u2019s often said to highlight the experience undergone while attempting to reach that ultimate, final goal. And this couldn\u2019t be truer with Taizai. The narrative is, at first glance, a \u201cfetch quest.\u201d Elizabeth needs the combined might of the Sins in order to vanquish the evil that threatens her family and homeland. So what\u2019s initially presented is just that \u2013 the two roam the countryside, picking up information and traversing lands in order to find the mightiest heroes to ever live. But already, the proverb previously picked comes through, because the events are allowed to naturally unfold as these smaller, mini achievements are carried out. And this is due to the Sins being vastly overpowered compared to everyone else: Meliodas is impossibly strong, Ban is literally immortal, Diane controls the Earth itself, etc. More specifically, the outcomes that our characters will succeed is a given, but it\u2019s the show\u2019s ability to always keep such victory just out of reach, until the last possible second, that provides every scenario that they encounter with the same feelings of initial hope, followed by rocky despair, and eventual elation.\\n\\n\r\nThese situations are further amped by the incredible diversity that they always contain. The nature of the world presents \u201cHoly Knights,\u201d each with his or her own special weapon or set of abilities that makes that person entirely unique \u2013 the Sins are the same way, just in a league of their own. So every fight, battle, skirmish, duel, or conflict is never the same; new abilities are constantly shown and unique characters are consistently introduced. And even when the same characters and their powers appear more than once, not only do they use their abilities in combination with one another but it gives the show the opportunity to have cast members interact with each other where they had never done so before. This idea also highlights another of Taizai\u2019s strengths: character exploration. The overarching tale is explained and investigated through much of the side characters and the battles that take place, but the anime also takes its time in providing many of the people showcased with both meaningful and purposeful backstory. Ban\u2019s depressing reality, King\u2019s horror-filled past, and even bits of Meliodas\u2019s mysterious upbringing are given. Yet it\u2019s not just the mains; people like Gilthunder, Guila, Dreyfus, and many others have their motivations not just given but applied to the scenarios at hand, allowing for the narrative to contain plot points that are both worthwhile and connected to everything else that\u2019s going on. In other words, the characters and their stories form one, complete adventure.\\n\\n\r\nEven after all this, Taizai doesn\u2019t stop, for it manages to cover almost all of its bases when it comes to telling not just a complete tale but a fulfilling one, too. The journey they originally began actually ends. There are minor fragments from this original quest that still need answers, but these are more related to characterization and development as opposed to having incomplete storytelling. At the same time, a new journey begins. And not just right before the final few scenes of the show; it\u2019s introduced much earlier and it maintains that aforementioned relevancy by being used with the current narrative. Everything also ends up \u201cas it should.\u201d The anime had always been designed with happiness in mind: crazy action sequences, cute and fun comedy, characters to root for, etc. So watching as all of the good guys band together to take out the ultimate evil while providing the audience with a satisfying outcome for everyone involved gave the journey a nice sense of closure.\\n\\n\r\nAnd just for good measure, Taizai creates a thematic foothold, one that was given in the introduction: the notion of atonement. People are capable of doing some rather vile things. Robbery, manipulation, murder, kidnapping, sexual harassment; or even less extreme cases such as having jealousy, insulting another, or simply being rude. Everybody sins, but it\u2019s not the sinning that\u2019s important, but the good one does to make up for the wrongs accrued that makes the difference. Meliodas protects Elizabeth with all his heart to make up for his failing on Liz, King fights for this kingdom because he couldn\u2019t fight for his, and Ban lives life to the fullest because the woman that gave it to him never had the chance. And again, the side characters exemplify this as well. Using the same examples: Gilthunder chooses to become a roaming helper, Guila has only her younger brother in mind to the point of becoming a \u201ctraitor,\u201d and Dreyfus squares off against his best friend. So while everyone in the show does something that one would consider bad, it\u2019s what they do to atone for their sins, the good that they do, that matters most.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTaizai\u2019s art is quite splendid to look at, mostly because of how colorful everything generally is. And not just with the characters \u2013 the world itself shifts in tone and mood to match the situations on-hand, with the color palate morphing accordingly. The same goes for the move-sets \u2013 it\u2019s an explosion of color at every turn. The fight choreography is also handled quite well, with the camera making sure both the big and the small actions are always front and center. For an added sense of coolness, the abilities are always given names, followed by a textual representation surrounding them to emphasize just how awesome the power, and subsequently the art, really is. Beyond this, the locations are varied, the lighting is appropriate, and the abilities shown are provided flashes, flairs, and focus to match their overall high sense of power.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are also some of the strongest in the medium. Elizabeth in particular is incredibly well-designed: her intentionally concealing hair, cute, frilly, pink dress with ribbon, short skirt, one-legged tights, mismatched shoes, and teal eyes to match her teal earrings easily demonstrate how unique every character is drawn. Ban\u2019s spiky hair with red-leather vest and pants, King\u2019s favorite cloak and pillow to go with his transformations, Gowther\u2019s somewhat androgynous appearance, and literally every knight having their own distinct style makes the characters look like the over-the-top parts they play.\\n\\n\r\nIn typical Taizai fashion, actual animation is always above average. Character movements are fluid, the abilities are never not going off, and the fights are tense from start to finish due to the near constant action that occurs. Be it a bit of blinking, hair moving, or watching as dark flames engulf the surroundings in waves, the anime refuses to let up when it comes to animation.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters within Taizai, and many of them see some interesting characterization and a bit of development. While some of them could have seen a bit more \u2013 Meliodas, Diane, and Gowther, to be specific \u2013 what was given is still a healthy dose. Mostly because it wasn\u2019t just the main characters that maintained focus but the side characters did, as well.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the better characters offered by the anime was Ban. Ban is the \u201cFox\u2019s Sin of Greed,\u201d and he is as carefree as can possibly be. His behavior is somewhat aloof, with him coming off as entirely rude and unsympathetic to anyone he converses with. Even towards Meliodas, who is not only his captain but also his closest friend. His snarky attitude and mean spirit should make him hard to like, but it\u2019s his very uncaring nature that allows him to be as entertaining as he is, for he holds no remorse towards anyone. Save for one. Before acquiring his immortality, he was a thief looking to drink from the \u201cFountain of Youth.\u201d There, he befriended a fairy girl named Elaine, which eventually turned into love. Unfortunately, outside influences cause her to sacrifice herself to save Ban, granting him the power he had initially sought but no longer wanted. Living forever, but not having that person who is dearest to you, unable to have and to hold for the rest of your days, is one hell of an atonement. So Ban\u2019s position becomes clear: he doesn\u2019t get close to anyone because he doesn\u2019t want to have those same feelings of loss again. But even if he may not be kind towards others outright, his intentions are always founded on being there for the people that matter most, lending credit to the notion that Ban isn\u2019t so greedy after all.\\n\\n\r\nHelbram is an interesting individual for a variety of reasons. He not only has his own \u201cfake\u201d persona like his best friend King, but his background is told in a roundabout way \u2013 through King\u2019s recollection of the past. And what is given is a kindhearted fairy who was infinitely intrigued by the humans of the land. Sadly, some of these humans weren\u2019t as good as he thought them to be; witnessing the mutilation of his fairy brethren \u2013 men, women, and children alike \u2013 he dips into insanity. Similar to Ban, he lives his life in an unbearable fashion \u2013 listening to the sounds of tearing wings and desperate screams, forcing him to kill the people he thought he loved, to both \u201cget back\u201d at them and to relieve him of the nightmares he has lived with for centuries. While King ends his best friend\u2019s suffering, Helbram is reincarnated through magic twice-over as a sort of zombie with no brain and a fairy with no heart. He\u2019s a tragic character whose third death at King\u2019s hands not only (finally) saves him, but proves that sometimes, one\u2019s atonement is cruelly massive.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final look into the cast, Elizabeth acts as a foil to everyone; comparing them to her makes it easy to see how sinful everyone is. She is the princess, the \u201cdamsel in distress,\u201d and so she\u2019s initially perceived as being very weak. But she\u2019s in fact the strongest in the show. Not just because she got herself hurt one time by sneakily grabbing that bell, or allowing herself to be kidnapped to save Meliodas, or even using her druidic powers to heal everyone and the land. She\u2019s the strongest because, out of the entire cast, she\u2019s the only person who doesn\u2019t sin. This seems to go against the earlier discussion, but that\u2019s precisely the point. She\u2019s caring, doting, and kind; she\u2019s an absolutely beautiful person both inside and out. So in this world where everyone around her does something bad, she\u2019s the lone outlier, because all she ever does is good.\\n\\n\r\nThis dichotomy of hers \u2013 being \u201cweak\u201d when she is actually the \u201cstrongest\u201d \u2013 is something that is seen with each of the Sins as well. Meliodas is the \u201cDragon\u2019s Sin of Wrath,\u201d yet he is the nicest guy in the world, both to Elizabeth and the people. Diane is the \u201cSnake\u2019s Sin of Envy,\u201d yet her giant-like status is something she comes to accept. And Gowther is the \u201cGoat\u2019s Sin of Lust,\u201d yet he\u2019s purely logical, calculable, and objective in his dealings, with no emotions whatsoever let alone desire. The other Sins can be described as such, but what\u2019s most important is what this represents for Elizabeth, the Sins, and people in general: that nobody should be defined by a single facet. In other words, someone shouldn\u2019t just be known for a single sin committed, for we are all more complex than at first understood.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes are, like the majority of Taizai, top-notch in their execution. The first OP has a very adventurous feel to it, with the singing and beat being extremely catchy to listen to. It maintains a not-too-hopeful yet not-too-melancholic vibe about it, with the blend of both happiness and sadness capturing the happenings of the anime itself quite nicely. The second OP opts to go entirely optimistic. The lyrics aren\u2019t just easy to sing along with, but also hold relevancy to the themes: \u201cthe pain and the pleasure all come together\u201d is another way to phrase how sin and atonement go hand-in-hand.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending themes follow the same trend. The first ED just oozes fun, with its fast beat, hard guitar, and its all-over-the-place lyrics. It really does make you \u201cfly high\u201d when one sits down and jams out to it. The second ED goes in the completely opposite direction of its counterpart and everything else. The vocalist gives a strong performance, bringing about a lot of power in her voice where the instruments lean towards a \u201csofter\u201d melody. It\u2019s almost depressing, but not in the sense that something bad has gone down, but rather that something good has finally come to an end.\\n\\n\r\nHiroyuki Sawana does it again, bringing about an original soundtrack that fits the mood, contains his signature style, and even has some tracks that are nice to listen to outside of the show itself. \u201cDragonsin\u201d is one of the best pieces, with the continuous violins, distinct accordion, and rising tone pumping one\u2019s adrenaline. \u201cErionesu\u201d is played during those emotional moments, with the backup drums providing that extra kick. And \u201cKenkamatsuri\u201d with its orchestral composition and choir brings the epic feeling that Taizai employs in droves.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting for the anime is always above average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Sora Amamiya as Elizabeth for her consistent and perfect princess voice, Tatsuhisa Suzuki as Ban for his nonchalant way of speaking, Misaki Kuno as Hawk for her very impressive uniqueness she brought to the pig, and Yuuhei Takagi as Gowther for performing as the emotionless mind-freak in his first major role. Realistically, though, everyone did a splendid job.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nPart of what made this show so much fun to watch was due in part to both the characters\u2019 individual personalities and the interactions they had between each other. Elizabeth\u2019s constant cuteness, Meliodas always kicking butt, and Gowther\u2019s weird yet endearing way of acting managed to make me smile every single time. Diane\u2019s crush on the captain but obliviousness to the leader of the fairies, Ban messing with King at every turn, Elizabeth patiently putting up with Meliodas\u2019s \u201cflirting;\u201d the cast have this dynamic connection that portrays them as the tight-knit group that they are. Elizabeth is my favorite, but Meliodas, Diane, Ban, Gowther, King, and Hawk are right alongside her, because everyone is just so easily likable from the moment they first appear on-screen.\\n\\n\r\nThe hilarity is well-done, as are the battles that take place. The wonderful animation, varying abilities, and grand scale of it all makes each fight just as exciting as the last. Ban versus Meliodas in the tiny village as well as Meliodas versus Gilthunder and Hendrickson in the royal capital were crazy to watch, and are excellent examples of what the anime has to offer in the action department. Despite all of this \u2013 the comedy and the clashes \u2013 this isn\u2019t an anime that I found myself absolutely attached to, but there was never a dull moment throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nNanatsu no Taizai is an anime with crisp visuals and killer music; a stellar story and fun-loving characters; and enough entertainment to make even the saddest person smile with glee. It\u2019s no stretch of the imagination to say that \u201cThe Seven Deadly Sins\u201d aren\u2019t just deadly: they\u2019re amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, all about the journey, with constantly unique scenarios, purposeful character exploration, a complete narrative, and themes of sin and atonement\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, colorful and fight-focused art style, incredible character designs, and above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, while Meliodas and a few others needed a bit more focus, Ban, Helbram, Elizabeth, and the rest of the cast received more than enough to exemplify atonement and complexity\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, great first OP, great second OP, great first ED, good second ED, nice soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, endearing characters, nice comedy, and high-action battles leave one grinning ear-to-ear\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai is one of those shonen type story for teens that is actually quite enjoyable to watch. I'm not fond of shonen's in general, I love One Piece and some classics but my interest for the genre stops there.\r\nStory: Nothing amazing or original there.\r\nLong story short, the kingdom has been overuled by Holy Knights, the princess is looking for those called the Seven Deadly Sins to help her save her country. 5/10\r\nArt: SHOUNENNNN, I mean, the art doesn't make the anime, i thought the action scene animation was quite poor too. 6/10\r\nSound: None of these terrible OP/ED, decent soundtrack, nothing I'll listen toagain. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The MC's are cute, kinda like Luffy's crew - they are linked by a powerful bond of friendship that will save them when the big fights come - don't expect big introspection or anything fancy. They're still nice guys. 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I'm not a big fan of shonen but I think the author and the anime crew made a fine job at making Nanatsu no Taizai enjoyable. I like to watch this kind of anime & layback, have a smoke, enjoy the show. This show is definitely fun to watch, it's a lot easier to get into than a lot of shonen I've tried to watch and failed (Fairy Tail, Tokyo Ghoul etc) 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I think I gave it a 6 in my anime list but I'm trying to convince ya shonen fans to watch it so i'll give it a 7. This is definitely a cool anime! Don't expect One Piece (best weekly shonen since Slam Dunk/HxH IMO) but you're going to have a nice time watching this, it's friendly, fun, there's action, boobs, friendship, blood, explosions, knights & super powers. What's not to like? 7/10",

Usually if there's one plot hole, I drop it, but this one some how managed to make me want to keep watching despite the plot holes.  I don't understand.  \r\n+points for the anime:\r\nI do like the main concept and story idea. The main character is intriguing, and overall the cast was good.  And there was a descent amount of romance in the plot.  The fighting scenes were well doneand it gave the this bad ass feel to it with and made overpowered characters that weren't actually overpowered because all the characters were OP.  weird sort of balance.\\n\r\nMain good point I have for this anime is that it is heavily plot driven (in a good way). despite the plot holes or simply the annoying hiccups in the plot that came out of nowhere, it hooked me and made me want to keep watching.  So if you want anime that hooks you, this is one of em.",

            "content": "No Spoiler.\r\nPlot( 9/10): \r\nI think that is important to look at the tags of the anime. Talking about Nanatsu, I can see this tags: Action, Adventure, Fantasy,Shounen, Supernatural.\r\nSeeing this tags, one question crossed my mind: What means a \u201cgood adventure\u201d? \r\nThe word \u201cadventure\u201d originates from the latim \u201cad venture\u201d, which means literally \u201cwhat lies ahead\u201d. Putting this in a anime plot perspective, adventure will be the problems, conflicts, battles, etc\u2026 that the characters have to pass by to reach one determined goal.\r\nAnswer my own question, what means a \u201cgood adventure\u201d ?\r\nA \u201cgood adventure\u201d in a plot means one multiplicity of conflicts, battles, problems. Conflicts, battles,problems, have to permeates all kinds of questions of a fantasy world, so talk about politics, ethics, moral, relationships (friend-friend, lovers-lovers) are things that create a good adventure (so, good things to the characters find a solution), and ,certainly, a good plot in general.\\n\r\nPS: Some adventure can have some funny moments, and on Nanatsu all the conflicts has its pinches of comedy, if you don\u2019t like a adventure per se, you will love the comedy immersed on this.\\n\\n\r\nKnow that you know what \u201cGOOD ADVENTURE\u201d is, let's see how the plot of Nanatsu fits on this definition.\\n\r\nNanatsu no Taizai starts saying on what the world is. The humankind fought against dark creatures (I like to call them demons), the advantage was clear, but some specials humans learn who to use magic and gave the humankind some peace (conflict of survival is placed on the table), this humans become the Holy Knights (our army, nowadays). Here I have to say that the Holy Knights is the stronger corporation of the mankind, but they don't have the political power (this is the job for the king and the noble families). But, for some reason, Seven Holy Knights betrayed the Kingdom. They were known like Seven Deadly Sins, look that a political treason is another conflict to a good adventure. Some years after this event, the Holy Knights became a corrupt corporation, wishing more power, so they decide remove the Kings and Noble Families of the political power, again a good treason conflict.\\n\r\nNow you know how a good anime connect the facts:\\n\r\nOne daughter (Elizabeth) of the king flees from the attack of the Holy Knights and now she is on a mission to find the Seven Deadly Sins (even after the betrayal be eradicated, some Sins still missing) and save the Kingdom (using the traitors against the traitors, just ironic). She finds the Captain of the Sins (Meliodas), the boy on the main photo of the anime and he, smiling, accept the task of saving the Kingdom.\\n\r\nSo, how i said, a good adventure plot is the one that you have problems (facts), that permeates by all the human conflicts (both in a social perspective, than in an individual perspective) and Nanatsu connect all problems with mastery, so it\u2019s a good adventure plot.\\n\r\nIn this plot a lot of questions will grow. The Seven Deadly Sins are truly the real traitors? If not, why they are treated like traitors? What is the plan of the Holy Knights? You can create your own questions. The plot has facts that make you think, so think.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10):\\n\r\nI will not talk about the Princess Elizabeth, basically she is pretty girl that will do you see panties every time, and she the perfect princess for a Utopian World, just that, is a bowl of soup character, deal with it.\\n\r\nIn the beginning of the review, I said that:\\n\r\n\", adventure will be the problems, conflicts,battles, etc\u2026 that the characters have to pass by to reach one determined goal.\"\\n\r\nSo, don't have possibility to talk about adventure without talk about the characters immersed in the adventure. Remember that Nanatsu is a Shounen, so the characters have to pass some clich\u00eas lessons and more than that, the development of the characters will happen more in a magical battlefield than in a battle inside the head of the character . But that mental fight that Nanatsu tries to create something different (and I will explain this topic)\\n\r\nIn this point, I think that name of the anime is useful.\\n\r\nAgain, I have to put some concepts on the table. What is a Sin ? In a religious way, the sin is something that separates you from God (because, it's a break of the law of Him). For the Catholic Church the Deadly Sins are sins that guides you to the condemnation (different of the others Sins). But in Nanatsu you have to observe that \"Sin\" has one small difference in meaning.\\n\r\nSin on Nanatsu is the feeling that the character has to carry. One thing that they never could forgive, one feeling that gives them a strong power and, on the other hand, the feeling that prevents them to evolve. Now you understand why I talked about the concept of sin on the begin ? Because, in Nanatsu all the development of the character never will destroy the sin that they carry.\\n\\n\r\nSo, Nanatsu tries to create a solid base for the character, based and ,I risk myself to say, delimited by the Sin. Very original.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7/10): \\n\r\n(eps 1-12)The opening and ending are very good, one thing that I didn't like is that the ending fits better to introduce the anime (for me, the ending must be the opening). (eps 1-12)\\n\r\n(eps 13+) Now this opening is a masterpiece, the lyrics combines with the anime a lot. The ending is very good, too. Now, i can't say that the ending must be the opening. (eps 13+)\\n\r\nBut talking about the ost (\"musics\" on the anime per se) is very weak. You don't have good battle musics that put you in the fire of the battle, or a funny music that combines with the fun moment itself. And I not found one good \"orchestra\" (a good violin solo, or a good piano solo).\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10):\\n\\n\r\nI have to say that I don't like the Art. I can summarize this feeling, saying that I felt like i was in a anime of 2002, the tracing is very thin, and I missed some brightness. The effects on battle could be much better, again the lack of brightness \"helps\" this point. With the budget that the anime have, Nanatsu could do a better work here (the same with the sound).\\n\\n\r\nOverall (8/10):\\n\r\nVery good Shounen, with something more deep than swords, magic and the cliche \"good boys vs bad boys\". You will find all this, but putting a good adventure (like I tried to explain).\\n\r\nYou will laugh a lot in this adventure. I recommend this if you want to see a shounen not so cliche and funny, and if you have some obsession with panties (prepare yourself for the \"fan service\"). Just it.",

            "content": "This anime did some things well and some...not so well. Let's break it down. \r\nStarting with the things that were done well, I want to point out the lore and a few characters. Actually, now that I think about it, most of the things done well were rarely shown on screen, such as the backgrounds of the characters. Both Ban and Meliodas had interesting backgrounds, and even King and Diane had some cool stories. On the other hand, the lore was amusing enough to make me want to keep watching it. Who were the Seven Deadly Sins, really? What was going on in the Demonworld? Who were the goddesses? Why was there just a single giant, Diane? Well, never mind. The point is, there were a lot of interesting ideas, even if many of them fell into cliches or tropes. And I'm not going to immediately dismiss something because it may be a trope. Tropes exist for a reason. When done correctly, they can elevate a story. However, there are certain times to use tropes, and certain times not to use them. \\n\\n\r\nWhich brings me to some of the not-so-well-done aspects of this anime. It seems like the writers just couldn't brush off their habits of using tropes. So many of them! Damsel in distress, hero who saves the world, love triangles, etc. But then we get all the anime cliches, too. Just about every fight in this series makes no sense, and it's all because of the phenomenon that Gurren Lagann poked at: meaningless measures of power that fluctuate through time without any reason.  If you watch this show and try to understand the order of characters in terms of power, it's impossible. You may have a feeling that Meliodas is the strongest, and maybe that's true, but you don't see it much. He gets his ass kicked a lot. So do all the other characters. But the sad part is that none of it matters. In the end, a surge of energy overcomes our heroes, and they save the day. This is really frustrating because it's on top of the already meaningless \"special moves\" every knight has. It was disappointing to find out that the moves didn't really matter. I think there were one or two occasions when they countered each other based on the type or style of move (i.e. fire vs water, etc.). So most fights boiled down to who's stronger.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'm still giving this a 5/10 because it's stronger points, like the character backstories and the lore, made me watch it til the end. Also, Hawk, the true hero of this series, was very fun to watch, in particular.",

The animation lacking to be honest, theres alot of animation derps and farts.

The personalities are just amazing and they make the show even better. Here you have adventure, comedy and all other shounen-like genres packaged in a single show. And packaged well.\r\nThere were also some awesome battles and epic moments that make you go \"hohoho\" .

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai also known as The seven deadly sins is one of the few shounen anime that breaks the generic shounen barrier.\r\nStory- You can read the synopsis on the story.Elizabeth the main girl in the story is looking for the seven deadly sins basically her and the captain which she ends up finding out who he is look for the rest of the members in the seven deadly sins Elizabeth is not in it btw.... spoiler. It is kinda of a generic story but the characters really make it enjoyable and the adventure aspect is just so good and the journey makes this reallyenjoyable.The fights and abilities of the characters were awesome the only thing i really kinda was dissatisfied with was the pacing but again in 24 episodes you cant really do much when the story and characters should have made a bigger impact on a longer level also has some pervy kinda fanservice stuff that it doesnt really need but it is mildly minimal in the series as a whole so you can live with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt- First glance it looks like a kids show thats what i thought but the art style really fits the show its one of those anime that have a distinct art style that if you change you wont get the same feel. the fights are really a work of great art the style is like a fairy tail meets dragon ball z in one epic scene for certain fights you will notice it quickly and it is just really cool to watch everything is smooth consistent and just really good.\\n\\n\r\nSound- Great 1st opening generic 1st ending song and then the second half of the show 2nd opening and 2nd ending are generic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- In this category i gave it a perfect 10 mainly because you get a huge variety of characters alot you care about throughout the series you learn their abilities backgrounds  and sometimes stories its like  it was just something great to watch \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Really enjoyed it i give it a 10 in this category i really enjoyed it, Seven deadly sins i just couldnt stop watching i mean it was hard alot of the episodes i was left with wanting more and more i watched all 24 episodes in one run. 10+ hours of just straight watching it and i dont regret it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 with the great characters, great fight scenes, good story and the fact i enjoyed it a lot i think a its worty of the score i gave it just a really good series. I'd recommend this to anime viewers who like good shounen anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt is one of those anime that leave you wanting more because it feels like the story is not truly complete shown off by the very ending but it hints at future projects for this series i'd be glad to watch it if it had another season or anything id even read the manga and i dont even read manga it was that type of anime that makes you want more to sum it up it is a solid all around anime. It has its few inconsistencies and doesn't explain some of the bigger things that you wonder about the main character's true form which they completely skim over and some other stuff not a big deal but it wouldve helped to know. All in all i felt it was a great show to say the least.\\n\\n\\n",

I won't bother to elaborate.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are what make this show interesting. I love each character for different reasons but my favourites have to be Ban and King. I just love how much depth Ban has and his past ties into the plot incredibly well, as does Kings. They are probably the two characters to get the most attention. Hopefully the next season will explore other characters a little more.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the show. It was a pleasure to watch and I'm excited for season 2.

Little originality, nothing innovative, nothing impressive. Missing construction!\r\nArt: I will be less aggressive, the anime has good art, of course, it is neither complex nor innovative, but it manages to be \"perfect\" inside the play and enjoyable. Nothing to complain about!\r\nSound Production: Nothing to complain, no bad soundtrack or disconnected with the theme. Good OST's.\r\nCharacters: How to explain the poverty of the anime in this matter? Well, it's complicated, since the anime has no depth in the characters; the characters donot represent their \"capital sins\"; lack charisma in all of them; lack development; poor performance; the presentation of every sin is pathetic and weak.\\n\r\nEnjoyment-7, yes, that's right. Even though it is a weak work, it can be pleasing to most people, and it captivates a certain audience. I myself, I liked to watch and finish the anime, however, I could not take this to my critical opinion\\n\r\nOverall-4. I still think a high note. I am giving this note for the graphic and sound production, because if it depended on the other aspects, it would be 1. An extremely weak anime, a weak protagonist in construction and charisma; weak characters; summarizing: Only indicate this work for those without any critical sense. Do not expect too much, not even from the fights. Incidentally, one point I forgot to mention, the \"ecchi\" completely bland, forced and disgusting.",

I will also review this season based on how good it is on its own so I won\u2019t cut it some slag because of the necessity in the greater story and after all is said and done I still recommend Nanatsu no Taisai to anyone who is looking for a good action series.\r\nThis season follows the story of Elizabeth, the third princess of Britannia and Meliodas, the leader of the infamous Seven Deadly Sins, who areaccused of having planed to gain control of the kingdom 10 years ago. After unexpectedly meeting each other in the first episode they team up to search for the remaining members of the Seven Deady Sins and to stop the rebellion of the Holy Knights.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does a good job in establishing a relaxing atmosphere, while sometimes letting us see through the cracks and hinting at the idea that not all is as relaxing as it first seams, giving the anime a nice dark undertone. Ignoring these moments however it is hard not to relax while watching this anime because from the color palette to the actions of the characters, everything is creating this nice relaxing atmosphere. This however also means that there is no tension for the majority of the show, only the last conflict has any tension because for the first time it seems like the Sins are being pushed to their limits.\\n\r\nTurning the eye to the characters, it is easy to identified them as stereotypes. Later down in the story however it becomes apparent that they have more going on then one can see on the surface. This is mostly hinted at in flashbacks to tragic moments in their life but the don\u2019t get to much information regarding the past of the Sins. All members of the Seven Deadly Sins also have tragedies or sins corresponding to their title, Wrath (Meliodas), Greed (Ban), Sloth (King), Lust (Gowther), Gluttony(Merlin), Envy (Diane) and Pride (Unknown).\\n\r\nThe story structure is rather easy, the first half focuses on the gathering of the Sins and follows the easy sequence of somehow getting information that a Sin is rumored to bin in x location, then making their way to check if its true or not and either on the way or after reuniting with a Sin getting dragged in a conflict or attack. The second half is mostly fighting after responding to a kidnapping so there isn\u2019t much of a story. The only story progression is the revelation of the enemy mastermind and his motivation and I have to say, it\u2019s questionable at best.\\n\\n\r\nEven if this review sounds quite negative, I still recommend Nanatsu no Taisai because most of the problem I have with this season get addressed late on in the story. I view this season as I view the first season of HeroAca, bad in comparison of the rest of the story but it needed to do what it did because this is the foundation on which the rest of the story lies.",

            "content": "In the midst of a boring ass night of scrolling through awful Netflix anime, I happened to fall upon this show. I've heard it pop in and around of a few shounen discussions so I figured I should give it a shot since I've been a huge fan of shounen anime since I was young. And even though I've experienced all the shounen cliche's and linear story lines, something about Nanatsu no Taizai feels genuinely offensive to me in how it manages to surpass even the worst of shounen anime in terms of being uninspired and linear.\r\nStory: 2/10 Honestly, the concept of a princess's journeyto find an exiled group of knights to take back her kingdom sounds like it could be really good on paper, however any and all potential is immediately squashed as most of it is used for shitty fights and nonsensical and awkward fanservice. Elizabeth and Meliodas have 0 chemistry and the only times they do are when she's just randomly okay with him molesting the shit out of her on every journey. The story hits you with cliche after cliche and none of them are done in a tasteful to get enjoyment out of. The fanservice is awful and surprisingly sexist, the characters always border on useless or way too overpowered, the plot is linear, etc. You'll get 0 surprises from this anime and if you're like me, you'll probably just get irritated from the shit this anime tries to feed you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10 Apart from character design, the animation is pretty decent. Nothing really to see here. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10 Definitely the worst quality of this anime. Majority of the characters and people in it are very uninteresting and horribly designed. Meliodas is overpowered, Elizabeth just cries and is there for nothing but being groped on screen. Other characters are about as one-dimensional as the protagonists, just not as annoying cause they don't get nearly as much screen time as these two morons.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10 All of the sounds from the OST to the openings are just serviceable. Nothing that really stands out and enhances the scenes but at the same time I don't really hate any of the music they have.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10 This anime is really mind-numbing. I generally have never outright hated an anime but this one really takes the cake. Everything about it feels offensive to my soul and I can barely find any good things to say about it. I feel like this anime sends out a bad message about how bare-minimum and untasteful you can make a series and still have it praised as a good shounen. Everything Nanatsu does has been done before but a thousand times better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1/10 You're probably just better off finding another shounen series if you want something entertaining with characters duking it out. This anime is awful.",

            "content": "PSA Warning:\r\nOut of concern for your eyes, if you are allergic to stupidity do not read my review. This is my first ever review and is therefore bound to suck. I have never been much of a writer either. However if you still wish to continue you have my condolences.\r\nSPOILER FREE REVIEW\r\nNanatsu no taizai is an action adventure oriented anime with a lot of light-hearted humor to kind of gloss over the serious tones that the show throws at us every now and then. The show is good for a fun watch as it doesn't provide much in terms of character development, with such amassive cast of characters though, that is to be expected. This doesn't however take away from the fact that a lot of the characters are indeed very fun and interesting. The show will give backstories to many of the characters, and even mess around with our emotions regarding some of them. However that's all fine and dandy, but the main character, Meliodas, gets little to no development aside from his superficial change that he experience thanks to Elizabeth near the end of the show. Now this would be okay if the story were told from the perspective of a character who has no impact on the world being viewed, however he is not only the main character of the show, but also one of the most influential and renowned person in their world. So while there is little that could have been done to rectify this problem of lack of development among all the characters (other than create a 100 episode long show), it is one of the bigger problems I have with the show.\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 7\\n\r\nMoving on to the plot and pacing of the show, there is little that I can really poke ate. Now that isn't to say that the story is an amazing piece of work that has never been done before; in fact its is the complete opposite. This show follows your usual adventure action type of story-line in that its predictable and rather simple. It doesn't do anything complex regarding its topic of \"betrayed by your own now corrupt kingdom\" (for that check out Ubel Blatt an amazing manga) which is an always fun theme but is extremely hard to do well. All this comes down to the fact that I didn't go into this show expecting some amazing story telling and complex and head turning plot twists. No I expected the usual below average shounen that get produced by the hundreds, and was instead pleasantly surprised with a better than okay story. However that doesn't forgive its many flaws in pacing. I like to compare this shows pacing to Attack on Titan since everyone knows that show, the show starts off at a breakneck pace and doesn't slow down for a good amount of time, but suddenly you will find that the story comes to an abrupt halt, and slows to a snails crawl. Now I'm not saying that the originally fast paced plot is good, in fact it can also be very badly done, as seen at the end of the show as it seemingly speeds everything up in order to just barely fit in the ending, the ending which that they pulled out of one of their intern's ass and just slapped on with bunch of Elmer's glue and staples.\\n\r\nPlot: 8\\n\r\nPacing: 6\\n\r\nNothing special to say about the art and music really, do love both openings of the show dearly, and I always find myself singing along to them, much to the dismay of my roommate. Otherwise the rest of the soundtrack I found to be rather dismissible, and the art while not bad was by no means anything special, it had the usual A-1 Pictures feel that a lot of their animation has, in that its really nice and you can literally see the money flowing out of your screen (too bad you can\u2019t take some of it though), but it didn\u2019t manage to leave an impression on me.\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nMusic: 8\\n\r\nFinally the most important part, the enjoyment category (I should try and put this as my first category next time). This show like I said earlier is a fun watch, its upbeat and happy, and has a feel similar to that of one piece, one of my childhood shows that I still watch to this day. It is for that reason that I most likely enjoyed it. I while I do love to get down and dirty watching some super-duper serious shows that only the \u201celites\u201d can understand, I like to go back to my roots and enjoy a fun laugh with a light hearted show such as this. And it is for that reason that the highest rating any of the sections gets is in this one. I managed to make time out of my busy college and work life to watch the whole show in three days, all with little to no fast forwarding. Taking that into account this show definitely deserves a good score for managing to hold my terrible attention.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall it was rather enjoyable to watch this show and I even started reading the manga because of it, and it is for that reason that I award this show with an:\\n\r\n8/10\\n\r\nHope you all enjoyed reading my review, feel free to check out my poopy list of anime and manga, and feel free to shoot me any questions, comments, or friend requests. I plan to continue writing these reviews as often as I can as its actually pretty fun. And also to those thinking about writing a review just do it. You won\u2019t regret it, the first step is starting and that is always the hardest part.\\n",

            "content": "I didn't think I was gonna be a fan of Nanatsu when I watched the first episode, cus the art was a bit not my style and the fanservice seemed to be in your face and obnoxious. Then I watched the 2nd episode for kicks. Then the third. Then the fourth. You get the idea. Soon I was obsessed.\r\nStory: 10\r\nStory was, as MAL describes it, outstanding. It didn't really seem all that stereotypical at first (though I saw Meliodas being a sin coming from a mile away... thought he was gonna be lust though lol) and as the plot developed, I found myself waiting forthe next episode with bated breath. The way it captures you with each episode is unique and can only be credited back to excellent writing and a LOT of developmental work. So much love and care is put into each episode and that's what makes it worth watching, if not anything else.\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art, like I said, did not capture me at first. Too cutesy and the anatomy was ridiculous (what skinny female has boobs that big???????), but it most certainly grew on me. It suits the show really well and the background art was so amazingly detailed and beautiful. Though A-1 Pictures is generally known for the abominations of Aldnoah 2, Magi, and SAO, they honestly transferred manga-to-anime art so smoothly that I didn't even know it was A-1 until I looked on MAL. The animation is stunning, but A-1 has always been pretty good with animation so that wasn't too shocking. What brought this rating down was the amount of effort I put in before I liked the art. What saved it was its evolution and the gradual look of aging and maturity you can see in the characters.\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI could listen to the NnT OST all day. The openings and endings are so great that I can't pick a favorite, and the BGM suits each scene really well. Not really much to say here, good job A-1.\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nA-1 is known for its plot-annihilating adaptions. It loves to reduce characters down to their stereotypes and rip up plots like a dog rips up newspaper.  I haven't read the manga of NnT, but the characters and plot were very well put together in my opinion. A manga reader may say otherwise, but this is just my own input. The characters develop so well and the backstories are tragic yet beautiful. One complaint I have is the obsession with Elaine, a minor character who was only there to advance Ban's character, and yet she continues to be brought back again and again and treated like an actual major character. This show's inability to separate protagonists from tritagonists brought its rating down.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nIf the fanservice was less boobs-and-ass-in-your-face-all-the-time, it'd have gotten a 10 from me. I guess that's just my own take on it, as I'm pretty sick of fanservice, so take that in stride. Still, its ability to smoothly transition from comedy to angst to action to ecchi was spectacular, and I stopped minding the fanservice after a few episodes. It really made me interested in the manga, and I have no regrets watching this series. It made my week so interesting, thinking about each episode for days afterwards. Nanatsu no Taizai is memorable, to say the very least. It has a sort of charm to it that makes it unusual for its type, and I recommend it to anyone who wants an excellent plot, a few good tear-jerking moments, and cute and powerful girls.",

            "content": "Right now, as of writing this review, the number-one review for this show is 5 lines long. Look, I understand that being concise is nice, but I think few shows deserve that kind of treatment. \r\nObviously not every show is for everyone. Not only that, but people are often looking for different shows at different times. For instance, I'm usually into really dark thematic shit like Utena and Madoka, but I recently moved across the country to teach highschool in a culture I know nothing about, and I found that at the end of each insanely stressful day the last thing I wanted was toget home and overload my brain with symbolism and essays. Once I adjusted I returned to my usual ways of course, but for that first week I just wanted something that would entertain me and lift my mood. So, in spite of myself, I actually had the audacity to hit \"play\" on the first episode of The Seven Deadly Sins, a show I had heard was pretty much complete garbage. And guess what? I ate up every single episode, OVAs included, and if season two were to go out right now I would pour myself a drink and binge it straight through the night.\\n\\n\r\nWhy?\\n\\n\r\nDo I think the show is actually good?\\n\\n\r\nWell, that's actually kind of tricky. Let's start off with the reasons you shouldn't watch this show. \\n\\n\r\n1. If you literally cannot stand cliche plots, you should not bother with this show. The plot is as cliche as you can get. There are essentially no serious surprises, and the show doesn't attempt to base itself around any sort of novel premise. It's pretty much just standard fantasy, with good guys versus bad guys and a few in-between guys. Don't overthink it.\\n\\n\r\n2. If you hate bad writing, don't bother. There's a ton of extremely unnatural dialogue in this show. Every episode has blatant dismissals of the 'show-don't-tell' rule, and no one talks about anything that actually matters, ever. Go read a book instead.\\n\\n\r\n3. If you're turned away by fanservice, put on something else. There's not all too much of it, but the smattering of fanservice in this show is some of the most egregious shit I've seen. Basically, the main character likes to grope the other main character seemingly against her will every couple of episodes and it's supposed to be a joke. That's kind of fucked up, and if you are incapable of just kinda zoning out for those scenes (which makes total sense) then get out of here right now. \\n\\n\r\nWow, that makes this show sound absolutely terrible. I guess it kind of is? And yet, Here I am, advocating for this pile of stereotypical tropey garbage. Why? Well, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed it a lot. I mean, I really don't binge shows anymore. I don't have that kind of stamina. But I watched like 5 episode of this thing a day, I firmly believe there's a reason to its addicting nature.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, and this is a grossly overlooked quality-- The Seven Deadly Sins is consistent. It literally only takes one or two off-beat episodes for me to drop a show like this, meaning that I drop most of them. However, this particular one never made a significant misstep. From the beginning it promised action, humor, cuteness, adventure, and plot development every episode, and it delivered straight through. It never stopped building its core story, providing enough hooks to pull you to the next episode, but it also never stopped spending heartwarming quality time with its main cast. This is  actually a pretty tough accomplishment to pull off over 24 episodes, and I fully commend the highly-qualified production team for their success here. The show doesn't let up, with a finely-tuned pacing that expertly holds the viewer's attention span without feeling excessively rushed at any point.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the music. Look, music can carry an entire show if it's used right. And I don't just mean that the music is good: I mean that it's placed well and not abused. The music is done by Hiroyuki Sawano, so the tracks are obviously great already, but many a great soundtrack has been squandered by abusing its signature songs and bombarding early episodes with the full numbers. The Seven Deadly Sins holds back: it's got the song Perfect Time under its belt, which is likely one of the hypest soundtracks of all time, and yet instead of drowning all the action scenes with this particular piece until you become numb to it, it saves the full version with lyrics until THE VERY LAST EPISODE. Before that, it uses only instrumental versions of the song, leaning instead on a myriad of other pieces to carry the bulk of the excitement. On top of this, the second opening is one of the best openings ever made, going a long way towards pushing investment without playing the show's trump cards. This is smart and conservative show-making, guys. I was impressed.\\n\\n\r\nThird, the plot. Look, it's literally a stitched-together corpse of tropes, as I've already mentioned. However, it's stitched together in a different way then shows before it. This might seem like I'm grasping for straws, but it makes a huge difference. There are very few moments in this show where you won't say \"I've seen this before\", but by stapling together a wide range of cliches it keeps the overall story from being too predictable while also preventing you from being entirely sure how a scenario will play out. It's the sense of guessing that keeps stuff interesting, and The Seven Deadly Sins does a fairly good job of keeping you guessing through all of the cliches.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, and this is easily the most important--The Seven Deadly Sins is [i]uplifting.[/i] Seriously, this makes the biggest difference in the world. I enjoyed watching this show way more than Fullmetal Alchemist:B, even though that show is much better by traditional metrics. Tone pulls WEIGHT like NOTHING ELSE, and if you go down the route of committing to being serious and intense you had better be able to back it up with execution or else your show will quickly become trying and boring no matter how big your plot is. The Seven Deadly Sins never pretends to be anything other than a raunchy, loud, feel-good adventure tale, focusing on the fun rather than the drama and keeping its characters rather free of the 'tragic backstory' trap, slipping in moments of substance but never de-railing to go chase some idiotic piece of prehistoric drama that no one cares about. Everything in the show works towards the atmosphere: the bright, crisp, cartoony art, the upbeat music, the generally positive character interactions, the morally simplistic plot; this is a concerted effort to craft something wholly positive, and by Jove does it pay off. This thing is a blast to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall? Overall, if you're looking for a smart, thoughtful story, run for the hills. However, if you're at the place we all reach eventually where you just want something to entertain you and make your mood improve, give this thing a whirl. It's got a team of geniuses behind it: no really, you've got key members of the teams of everything from Evangelion to Steins;Gate to Oregairu and the Eccentric Family, and all they're trying to do is make you feel good. They're pretty good at it. Just don't go in expecting a masterpiece and you should be alright.",

            "content": "A fairly immature anime centered around friendship and adventure. It has an almost \"fairytail\" like feel to it, where no one important actually dies and they make friends with their rivals/enemies but to an even worse degree. The action is fairly strong in this anime but i can't really ignore the numerous anime cliche's, character tropes and the fairly bad/fast pacing. Most of the cliche's and tropes are forgiven overtime through story progression and character development but you can still feel the traces of it lingering on. (elizabeth = princess trope, diane = the over obsessed #1 meliodas fan, king = the nosebleed shy boy,ban = the aloof keep to himself cool guy whom drinks the most because of his problematic past, this also isn't short from the cliches of excessive groping, friendship is power, no one can die, hidden main character abilities and how the main character is always smiling etc.)\\n\\n\r\nOther than that they did execute the plotline fairly well and in a concise matter which was enjoyable. The action was fun, the story was paced well, and even with the tropes you did find the characters intriguing in some sort of way. I think how they executed the backstories was it's best suit.",

And back then I thought it was ok. It had a couple of interesting things going on and but a few similarities to Fairy Tail (And I hate Fairy Tail... but it's probably only because A-1 Pictures is adapting this series which is probably why the art style and atmosphere and resemble that of Fairy Tail). Either way since we are on the topic of what this anime remindsme of from A-1 Pictures another on that comes to mind is Magi. And the only reason Magi comes to mind is because when it comes to adaptation quality and pacing of Nanatsu No Tazai (as far as I heard) this was a series (just like Magi) that A-1 Pictures decided to speed run adapt 24 episodes within the contents of around 100 chapters. If you know how much content is within 100 chapters of a manga then you should already know that when it comes to adaptation quality things are definitely going to be left out. Now as an anime only watcher I've only heard of certain key elements that were left out and I heard they were quite important to the arcs presented in this 24 episode season and future arcs in seasons to come. And as I watched about majority of this anime of Nanatsu No Taizai it definitely felt like certain areas were rushed or didn't make entirely too much sense because it wasn't really focus on as much or just flat out MIA. And those were the issues I felt lead to me feeling not as interesting in the overall story as I should have been had certain missing plots were present. Either way it didn't make the overall story bad it, I should can't see myself giving the story anything higher than a 6 know I was fed a arguably half-assed version of the manga's original story because A-1 wanted to speed run adapt apparently a manga that has a good story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (7/10) Good \\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.50/10) Good+\\n\\n\r\nThe Art when done right in certain scenes can look very good, same thing goes for animation on certain scenes animation can look very good also but the art style during these very good animation scenes always seems to take an immense drop in art quality to the point were it annoyed me. Now the same thing happened in Magi but not as much as this series. The choreography for the fight scenes probably looked amazing in the manga and when the choreography was adapted here the actual choreography was great and the animation that went with those scenes were very good but the art style could not hold up 90% of the time which makes me definitely look at A-1 Pictures in a different light, before Magi, Fairy Tail and this I thought A-1 was around and a little bit behind Madhouse (only going off of SOA Season 1). Now I would say there are just a little bit above like Toei and Studio Perriot on their off days.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10) Great\\n\\n\r\nIf there's anything A-1 or any studio really can't fuck up now these days is the sound. Nanatsu No Taizai has great sound. OST is great, voice acting (at least for the JP VA) are great, but I can't say the same thing for the english dub for a couple of the voices in particular Meliodas I couldn't stand his english dub it was horrible to me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nI thought the characters in Nanatsu No Taizai are good. Some good backstory on the ones they gave us like King, Diane and Bon. Like I heard certain important things were missing from this anime adaptation but oh well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10) Good\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment for this season of Nanatsu No Taizai overall is a 7. It could have been higher if it could have kept my interest around the beginning which to me felt a little bit lack luster, uninteresting and generic quite honestly. And it's probably what led me to put it on hold around episode 13 because I just felt it wasn't something worth getting excited over weekly to watch only one episode of. There are a few anime that get me hyped every week a new episode dropped and this wasn't one of them. Now that I've binge watched it, I can tell you I honestly didn't start to really enjoy it until the last arc of this season which I heard before I even started that it that it is probably the best arc in Nanatsu No Taizai right now and I can see why it was a good arc or at least good enough for the enjoyment section of this review to not be anything lower than a 7 that is because without that arc enjoyment would have probably been at a 5. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10) Good \\n\r\nMore Specifically (7.30/10)\\n\\n\r\nNanatsu No Taizai is a good anime... it's good... that's it. That's all I can give it, I know I shouldn't compare this Magi or any other anime in this review but I just have to say since A-1 Pictures treated this and Magi with the same \"let's adapt 100+ chapter of your manga into a 25 some odd anime series\" I just have to compare the two and with that being said I like Magi a whole lot more. But Nanatsu No Taizai was still enjoyable enough for me not to drop it and it was good enough for me to give the next season which is apparently starting in 2016 a shot. I'll try to stay caught up weekly with that one because this one couldn't do it for me.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review will also be including season 2, becuase I'd rather not make two seperate reviews for the same series. There might also be a few spoilers included in this review just so I can fully prove how bad this anime is.\r\nFirst things first, do not watch this anime if you are above the age of 16. This is one of the most childish anime I've ever watched in my life. I honestly felt as if I was watching some type of Disney cartoon. That's how fucking childish this anime was. This is one of the most generic, predictable, and childish anime I've everwatched in my life. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is about our main characters (Meliodas and Elizabeth) travelling together to gather the rest of the Seven Deadly Sins. Their goal is to take back the kingdom of Britania. This is one of the most cliche stories I've seen in a shounen. So right from the start this anime is already uninteresting with its generic ass story. The plot is also terrible. It's literally just the typical pokemon type of plot structure. Another reason why the story is shit, there's no worldbuilding whatsoever. We don't know shit about the world they're living in, besides a couple of towns. Without worldbuilding, I didn't give a shit about the story for this anime at all.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters, there isn't a single good character in this series. There's three words that best describe the characters: generic, underdeveloped, and boring. Firstly we have Meliodas, a main character that hasn't gotten an ounce of character development for 50 episodes. His laidback personality is cool and all, but there's no reason to be interested in this character. He lacks any element that makes a character great. The rest of the cast is trash aswell. Next we have Elizabeth, the cliche damsel in distress character. Once again, there's no reason to like this character. \\n\\n\r\nDo I even need to bring up character development? There isn't even a single character that gets character development, so I won't even bother bringing that up anymore. They're all one dimensional characters and overall just aren't interesting. Escanor has to be one of the most overrated characters I've seen in a Shounen. I find it werid how Shounen fanboys like characters simply because of the fact that they're overpowered. Like these fanboys don't care if a character has depth/development, they literally just like characters because they're strong. That's the most stupid reason for liking a character. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the sins are complete trash aswell. When it comes to villains, there isn't even one good villain in this series. Gilthunder was cool at first until he got thrown away by the writers. After season 1, he's always in the background and is pretty much an irrelevant character. So yeah...sorry to the Gilthunder fans that recently started watching this...Hendrickson is the typical shounen villain aswell. \\n\\n\r\nThe best character in this series is Hawk btw\\n\\n\r\nThe villains for the second season are even worse than the first one! It's crazy how so many people were hyping the 10 Commandments up, yet they turned out to be complete garbage and a massive disappointment. As usual, they're the typical villains you see in shounen that are just evil for the sake of being evil. Their motivations weren't interesting in the slightest. All of them are one dimensional charactes, even Zeldris which is apparently one of the more important ones of the 10 Commandments. In conclusion, the 10 Commandments are the worst group of villains I've seen in a battle shounen. \\n\\n\r\nNow lets talk about the second season. This will go down as the worst second season I've ever seen in an anime EVER. The story/plot for the second season is even worse. The second seasons story is about the Demon Clan. They finally have awakened (thanks to Hendrickson). So this whole season they're pretty much just fighting off the 10 Commandments. Here are all the problems I found in this season.\\n\\n\r\n Firstly, the plot is just fucking horrible. The writer clearly had no idea what he wanted to do. The plot was just all over the place! One second everything is peaceful, next second they're fighting a Commandment that just came out of nowhere. One second they're training, next they're fighting a commandment again. It's all over the damn place. Another problem I had with this season is the other garbage ass plot points, especially the one about Diane. That has to be one of the most boring things I've ever watched.  There's a bunch of stupid plot points that were introduced in this season it just became ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThere was a lot of deus ex machina being used in this season. One of the biggest examples of this is when Ban was 1v2ing two of the Commandments. He was losing the fight until he just found a random cave where Escanor just happened to be running a bar. After that he was saved by Escanor. If you cant see how stupid that shit is then I don't know what to tell you. In general there are a lot of asspull powers that just come out of nowhere. I wont make this part too long though. It's a battle shounen so it isn't that surprising that there is bad writing like this.\\n\\n\r\nLets talk about the fights now. The fights in season 1 were all pretty decent in terms of choreography. Well, the only actual good fight scenes were when Meliodas fought Hendrickson. Everything else was just average at best. The second season on the other hand, had AWFUL fights. As someone that read the manga, it was just a massive disappointment to see some of these fights animated. The animation was just straight up garbage in season 2. A-1 just dropped the ball on this one.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has hands down some of the ugliest art I've seen in a shounen. All of the characters just look so goofy and ugly it's insane. Like seriously, they all have fucked up noses and shit it just looks ridiculous. The art overall just looks like childish nonsense. The mangaka was trying to be unique, but no it just looks like shit.\\n\\n\r\nSo here are my scores for each category\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory/Plot: 1/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\r\nAnimation: 5/10\\n\\n\\n",

This show has a lot of potential but fails to reach it.\r\nStory :5 \r\nThe story started out interesting which made me wanting to continue watch it, how the Seven deadly sins were a bunch of traitors this and that. But progressing through  the story it started to become cliche. Cliches are fine but it was not executed well. The hero had to save the damsel in distressed and some plot twist that didn't really made sense ? The writers just gave some pathetic excuse and i was left \"oh thats it?\" Ultimately the last few episodes really dragged the score down\r\nArt:7\\n\\n\r\nI actually like the style but you can tell that they only put in effort in fights scenes that the main hero is in. It doesn't give much impact for the rest of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nSound:7\\n\\n\r\nIm not that good at music so who am I to accurately judge this. It was enjoyable to me and i loved the openings and endings.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\\n\r\nThe score would have been much lower if it were not for the supporting cast. The two main characters were something i could not bring myself to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nMeliodas was such a boring character. His personality was like a wooden block. He is usually happy and is perverted. Thats all i got from the 24 episodes. He gets angry when elizabeth is hurt an what not thats all. There is no depth in his character other that his mysterious past which im not remotely interested in. Furthermore he is overpowered. I get that he is supposed to be but he keeps pulling deus ex machina bullshit powers out of his ass whenever convenient. \\n\\n\r\nElizabeth was nothing but a nice crybaby. There is nothing else to her personality. Also deus ex machina powers again. She is also useless, always getting her self in trouble like you cannot fight just stay out of battle. Then she just screams for meliodas to save her. Additionally her portrayal pf a sensitive girl is quite ironic. She cried when a pig died and whenever meliodas is hurt but not rarely for the other sins ????????  \\n\\n\r\nJesus they are the only two characters that i have problems with which sullen this anime experience.\\n\\n\r\nWhat would have been better is giving depth to meliodas character and just remove elizabeth from the story, i really did not see her use other that uniting the sins (which they could have done themelves) and her blood for some ritual. Or they should have made her a supporting character.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked characters like diane and king as they display many qualities like their insecurity and other WIDE RANGE OF EMOTIONS.\\n\\n\r\nBan and gowther were fun to watch, villians were interesting if they were given more time and not defeated in one fight.(goddamit overpowered mc)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\n regardless of the many mistakes I still enjoyed the show but overall it was meh.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Is this the next big Sh\u014dnen hit? Better yet, is it good? These questions rose quickly when this series got an anime adaptation. And I'm here to answer them.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nThe story of most Sh\u014dnen is usually where their fans come from. Nanatsu no Taizai has a very unique story, but it isn't flawless like that of other Sh\u014dnen. The basic explanation of it is that the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins decides to regather up the other sins with his new traveling companion, a girl who needs their strength to save her kingdom. The story is full of plotholes and missing information, and inthe end feels very rushed. However it is very lighthearted and even hilarious at times, but serious when necessary, and overall is good.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this show is definitely it's art. NO, THAT DOES NOT MEAN THE ANIMATION, THE ANIMATION IS OF VERY HIGH QUALITY AND DESERVES A MUCH HIGHER SCORE. However the art...well it's unique, to say the least. However, it is very...circular, I guess would be the best way to describe it. It makes character's eyes look very weird, which is the second most defining feature other than hair. Something about it just...bothered me.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is one of Sawano's better works. AND THEY WERE ALREADY GODLY! His epicness combined with the fairy tail type soundtrack proved to be an incredible combination. However, in the end, the soundtrack couldn't be perfect unless Sawano is working with flat out serious anime, but he still did a great job with this!\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest aspect of nanatsu no taizai is it's character arsenal. I have nothing to say about this. They're all unique, funny, and awesome in there own way, even the villains.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is my favorite anime ever. However that is proabably because of my personal preference towards the story. Besides, even blinded by that I can tell it's not perfect. But it is good. Very Good.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10  The story is nothing SUPER special. The main female protagonist, Elizabeth goes about seeking the Seven Deadly Sins to try and stop the uprising of the main villainous force (The Holy Knights). She runs into Meliodas who just so happens to one of the Seven Deadly Sins. From there they come to a mutual agreement to search for the remaining Seven Deadly Sins to take down the threat of the Holy Knights. Antics are plentiful along their adventures so you can expect some light hearted comedy along the way. Some twists and turns happen as well to keep you on your toesa bit. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10  The art style is very vivid. One thing that sometimes determines what I watch is the art, and for me, this one hits the nail on the head. It's not the most amazing art in the world, but it's anything but bad. You can tell by seeing the landscapes and such that you will be traversing through a very fantasy-esque adventure. The characters are all different and are very colorful as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10  The soundtrack for this anime is pretty good. It has a medieval sound to them and all of the soundtracks fit very well with the scenes. If you want to include the intro and outros, all of them are great and I find myself watching them instead of skipping them. More so the first outro and the second intro. Finally let's cover the voices. All of the voices fit for all of the characters and they all just feel natural.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10  This is where the anime truly shines. Every character is likeable in some way. They all have distinct personalities and have some pros and cons going for them. Even the villains have amazing personalities, so much that you may find yourself actually liking them instead of hating them. The characters alone made this show for me and I hope you enjoy them just as much as I did.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10  Everything about this anime just felt right to me. It's one of if not my all time favorite anime. The pacing feels right, the humor to serious ratio seems just right, the characters and how they interact with each other are all great as well. It's just one of those anime that I enjoyed from episode one to finish.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10  Personally I want to give this a 10/10, but I know everyone has their own opinions and I'm trying not to be biased. I know the anime has it's flaws, but maybe I'm just blinded by my personal feelings towards it because I find it painful to give it anything lower than an 8.5/10 (I rounded up because it's more of a 9 than an 8). However, if you're looking for an anime with some nice fight scenes, a likeable story, some good humor, a lovable cast, and a bright world full of adventure. I think you should give this a try.",

            "content": "\u201cNo matter how much you bleed and even if your tears run dry, you stick to it. That\u2019s what a knight stands for.\u201d\r\nElizabeth Liones, the third princess of the Liones Kingdom, sets out to find the \u201cSeven Deadly Sins,\u201d an ill-reputed group of former knights, with the hopes of taking back her once-peaceful land from the corrupt Holy Knights who have taken over. The show is, unsurprisingly, packed to the brim with the larger-than-life fights, adventurous spirit and charismatic characters that one would expect from a battle shounen.\r\nNanatsu no Taizai\u2018s artwork is vivid and lively, with lush, emerald hillsides, rustic cottages and eye-popping shades ofblue sky depicting the show\u2019s English countryside-inspired setting to great effect. In addition, character designs are unique and memorable, doing a good job of conveying personality and ensuring the viewer is able to distinguish between the individuals of quite a large cast.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, Nanatsu has its weak moments, especially during more static scenes that center around a conversation or something to that effect. For the most part though, the show\u2019s animation works greatly to its advantage. Fast-paced action and movement scenes look dynamic and visceral, to the point where if you blink at the wrong moment, you might miss something important.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the color palette is full of life and spectacularly pretty, while the animation is quite strong, especially during the show\u2019s high-octane fight scenes. Amongst A-1\u2019s works, Nanatsu no Taizai stands near the top visually.\\n\\n\r\nAdhering to the status quo as far as battle shounens go, Nanatsu\u2018s overarching story doesn\u2019t really stand out as anything spectacular or refreshing. \u201cPrincess recruits ragtag outlaws to save kingdom from new corrupt leaders\u201d doesn\u2019t really stand on its own as a strong, mind-blowing narrative. On the way to resolving this main arc, the show takes us through an assortment of mini side arcs, which introduce the viewer to new team recruits and flesh them out, mainly via backstory. Again, this should be pretty standard fare for anybody accustomed to battle shounens, and though some may view it as repetitive, tired even, Nanatsu does its best at making it work. And for the most part, it does. And that\u2019s because of the\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 one of the major things this show has going for it. The cast involved are charming, likeable and memorable, each with their own stories and special abilities. As one of the \u201cSeven Deadly Sins,\u201d each of these characters has a past shrouded in mystery and regret, and it\u2019s a lot of fun as a viewer learning more about them, and seeing how they overcome their past struggles in the present. For this type of story, it\u2019s essential that we as viewers are presented with a group of fleshed-out protagonists whom we want to root for, and Nanatsu no Taizai does a great job of this, making up for the barebones nature of its overarching narrative.\\n\\n\r\nBan, King and Meliodas stand out as fantastic additions to the cast, and even characters that come across somewhat one-dimensional and annoying when they are introduced, like Diane and Gowther, grow on you by the end of the show. Hawk functions more as a sort of mascot for the show, but provides some welcome comedic relief at select moments throughout. The main gripe, character-wise, is Elizabeth, the main heroine, who reverts to being a passive damsel-in-distress whenever the events of the story call for it. After all, the show does have a tendency to fall back on shounen tropes now and then, so this doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. Even the main antagonist comes off a bit clich\u00e9 and probably would\u2019ve been more effective had they been written to be more charismatic and/or interesting.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of Episode 24, I realized that I didn\u2019t want these characters\u2019 adventure to end, and couldn\u2019t wait for a second season (which is thankfully coming in a month). Looking past the sometimes tropey writing, Nanatsu no Taizai is at its core, a fun, light-hearted adventure, complete with the fights, plot twists and hints of romance that we have come to expect from the genre. It\u2019s more akin to something like Boku no Hero Academia in its tendency to stick to genre conventions while still telling an enjoyable, highly effective story, than it is to Hunter x Hunter, which redefines the battle shounen entirely.\\n\\n\r\nOne element which may be a turn-off to some people is the ecchi present throughout. Though it occurs only a handful of times in the span of the show, instances of Meliodas groping Elizabeth or peeking under her skirt are quite jarring and seem unnecessary to the overall narrative. Elizabeth\u2019s general passivity in these situations only serves to make things worse. Perhaps it is an attempt to paint Meliodas as a less-than-honourable figure or more likely a pandering to the target demographic, but it still feels like the show could have gone without it.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Nanatsu is so easily digestible (coming in at only 24 episodes), especially compared to longer shounen series plagued by filler and 5-episode long flashbacks, makes it an easy show to recommend. Unless you are vehemently opposed to shounen tropes being thrown in here and there, there is little reason not to watch and appreciate this show for what it is: a fun, colorful adventure and strong entry in the shounen lineup. Though it likely won\u2019t end up becoming one of your all-time favourite anime, and you may not even remember much of it a few years down the road, Nanatsu has plenty of heart and charm to keep you entertained for the time being.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re hot off the heels of watching a whole bunch of battle shounen anime (Naruto, Bleach, Hero Academia, etc.) and are now desperately seeking something new to fill the void, Nanatsu no Taizai is a fantastic choice. It plays off a good deal of the genre\u2019s tropes, and while it doesn\u2019t do anything ground-breaking with them, it still manages to be a highly enjoyable experience. Pleasing visuals, dynamic fights, a vast and memorable cast, and a satisfying array of romance, comedy, adventure, fantasy and plot twists all make for an exciting and fulfilling ride.",

Well, yeah, season 1 is meant to introduce you to 5 of the 7 deadly sins and get to know why some of them hate each other, love each other, support one another, and get to know their personalities. This sets the stage for the major growth personally as well as improvements in their abilities and fight scenes to come. \r\nInstant gratification is not on everyone's list of requirements for an excellent anime. Instead, we are introduced to several subtleties that I didn't evenrealize until reading the manga. It was rewarding to rewatch having caught up with the manga as of 10/30/18.\\n\\n\r\nThere are several things in season 1, and even season 2, that you don't even know you don't know, because you haven't questioned it yet. The anime follows the manga quite well, and the subtle romantic, friendship growth, or childhood cut aways give depth and meaning to the lives of the characters besides simply being strong adventurers traveling together. Thankfully, there are no needless cutaways, rather they're actually enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nPlease stop writing negative reviews of anime's after 1 season unless you completed the manga to date anime's use the first season to set up the show as a whole. Based on the manga, season 3 is going to be absolutely epic.",

            "content": "The number seven is always a thing that comes up in anime. It\u2019s always used as way to give characters diverse tropes or is a number to represent objects a hero must smash to save the world. Seven Deadly Sins or SDS is your generic action series about a group of interesting characters uniting to fight a large scale foe. If you like stuff such as the \"Legend of Arslan\" and \"Yona of the Dawn\" you might like this show as the story is similar to a degree.\r\nLike Yona and Arslan SDS includes a young future ruler Elizabeth seeking out a group of powerful warriorsto take back her kingdom from tyranny. The warriors are the Sins who are these very powerful magic wielding knights who are wanted for trying to take over the kingdom ten years before. Each episode has our heroes fight new foes continuously who are at different levels of strength so it\u2019s pretty generic but is still interesting.\\n\\n\r\n There was a point in the story where I felt there was a cop out to make things less serious then they were at that point. Despite its looks this show can be very dark at points. The cop out was that they had this one opportunity in later episodes where they can make the show more intense but they did not go through with it likely out of fear of how the fans would react. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art of this series is very bright and colorful which at first makes you kind of feel you are watching something meant for kids. Later on however when you see stuff like people get torn in halve and stabbed a lot, you come to think \"oh I underestimated this show in the R Rating\". Character designs are another reason I thought this series seemed very childish at first. All characters are dressed in very colorful clothing  thus not looking like the battle hardened knights of legend they are known to be.  Our main hero who is the strongest does not look like a force to be reckoned with while characters such as Ban who look bad but are the probably the most nicest of the bunch in terms of what they stand for.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in SDS are a peculiar bunch of interesting faces Meliodas being our main character is a very powerful bada$$ full of mystery. He has a bit of a tragic backstory that had not been fully fleshed out. Ban who was one of the characters I liked the most is the a$$hole of the group but you come to really love him when you learn his true goal in his current affairs. I also liked the character Gowther who was more a comic relief character during his role in the show. I got to like the other characters such as King and Diane. Elizabeth I only saw as the girl who needed to be saved however and thus her character was the one I paid less attention to.\\n\\n\r\nSDS was pretty good in terms of an action series. It has its high moments and thus it will be memorable.\\n\\n\\n",

Were the descriptions a little too much ? This is simply one of the best show anyone has ever watched, i asked around and i'm not lying. Characters = Annoying yet lovable. Art = Two thumbs up.

            "content": "Hey there ! Before explaining my score, I wanna tell that it's my first review, and I'd like to apologise if my english isn't perfect too.\r\nSo what do we have ? A shonen. To be honest, I don't like shonens. A friend really wanted me to watch it, soooo I gave it a try.. What can I say ? TOTALLY WORTH IT.\r\nLet's start !\r\n\u00a4 Story : 9/10\r\nThe plot, at first glance, is kinda basic, but after bunch of episodes, you'll discover that the thing is way deeper you imagined, of course I won't spoil so I can't really tell more about it. \r\nThough, I can'tput a 10 because sometimes, it seems like the story is quite rushed, and there are some plot holes that can be frustrating as hell. \\n\\n\r\n\u00a4 Art : 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first, I didn't really like the art of this anime. When I saw Meliodas' face for the first time, I was like \"Meh..\".  But I really got used to like it, especially when they introduced characters like Ban, and some random knights because the way they look is kinda unusual, but in the good way. \\n\r\nHowever, the animation during the battles and stuff is pretty good, I can't really say more about it D:\\n\\n\r\n\u00a4 Sound : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNothing much to say. The voices (like Ban, Hawk) are just perfect, so what can I say?\\n\r\nOH YES, THE SONGS OF THIS ANIME ARE FREAKING AWESOME ! Hiroyuki Sawano and Takafumi Wada really did a wonderful job, these OST bring us in the wonderful world of Nanatsu no Taizai.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a4 Character : 11/10\\n\\n\r\nHere we go, it's the thing I enjoyed the most about Nanatsu no Taizai (tho it's 10, m'kay) ! \\n\r\nI mean, when I finished the anime, I figured out that I liked almost each character in this show. They're all awesome in their way. Plus, the sins all have a very interesting backstory, which make them much deeper and lovable. \\n\\n\r\n- The sins, especially Meliodas, Ban and King, have, as you could guess, a very dark and touching backstory, and you feel it everytime they appear, by the way they interact with other characters, and that, THAT IS GOLD GUYS.\\n\r\n- The other guys, like knighs, like Gilthunder and stuff, also have a great development, which make a lot of characters enjoyable. Of course, there will be some guys you won't even give a fuck about, but it's all about your tastes !\\n\r\n- Hawk. Do I need to say more ? I really don't like that kind of characters usually, but seriously, this pig made me laugh way, way too many times.  We don't even know what the hell he is doing there, but who cares?\\n\\n\r\n\u00a4 Enjoyment : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nYep, still a good mark. The thing is, I got hyped, I laughed hard, I felt bad, I nearly have tears at some part.. So yeah, this is one of the anime I enjoyed the most. This may be not a masterpiece or so, this may be not the best anime, with the best animation and the best story. But this is definitely a thing with a incredible universe and it has a lot to offer.\\n\r\nI rushed it in two nights, which is a thing I rarely do, but this f*cking anime really likes to put some enormous cliffhangers at the end of each episode so you want to see the next one.\\n\\n\r\n\u00a4 Overall : 9,4/10\\n\\n\r\nI think I've said all I had to say. As you probably guess, I highly recommand you guys to watch this piece of treasure.\\n\r\nI really hope they will do a good job with the season 2 incoming next year, and I hope as well that they're going to follow the manga so it doesn't end like Tokyo Ghoul : masterpiece manga to piece of shit anime.\\n\\n\r\nPS1 : Oh, don't be afraid about overpowered characters. In fact, all characters in this show are OP anyway.\\n\\n\r\nPS2 : NEVER forget to watch the episodes until the end. It's kinda stupid but a lot of very important scenes were put.. after endings. Yeah, that's annoying if you're not used to watch endings.\\n\\n\r\nKOTOKOTOKOTOKOTO",

It is an enjoyable series for people who loves medieval times and Arthurian legends.\r\nFor people who are wondering about the plot, then allow me to give out some details in the beginning of the episode:\r\nThe story is about seven notorious criminals who got exiled from the Kingdom of Liones after killing the Great Holy Knight Zaratras. The seven criminals disbanded and hid all over Britannia. Ten years later, the princess of Liones left the kingdom to find the seven criminals in order to seek for some help, and \"that\" moment all startedin a bar called the Boar's Hat...\\n\\n\r\nI have said enough. The rest is up to you. ;D\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, allow me to give the pros and cons of this series:\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n*A lot of likable characters. Trust me, once you start watching more episodes, you'll be interested in a handful of characters.\\n\r\n*Plot is solid. The only major difference I can say between the Manga and the Anime is the Armor Giant Arc, and both of the versions are still great regardless.\\n\r\n*Amazing soundtracks. It's well done and fitting for the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n*Quality of the show was poorly animated. This one isn't the show's fault, but A-1.\\n\r\n*Fight scenes are sub-par compared to the manga.\\n\r\n*MAJOR difference between the Manga and the Anime is the ending. What happened in the anime never happened in the manga. So I personally would read the manga instead.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some other flaws I would say about this show, but most of them are either not relevant or not appeared in the anime. Either way, this is a show I personally would recommend.",

            "content": "Seven Deadly Sins could have been a great anime, but there's just something...off...about it. I feel like, more than anything, the show lacks cohesion. It's one of those annoying shows that just constantly resorts to flashbacks to attempt to explain what is currently happening, and these flashbacks often happen right before the event they pertain to. I know this is very typical in anime, but here it just gives me the sense that the story is writing itself as it goes along.\r\nIt just breaks my suspension of disbelief, because it makes me painfully aware that this is a universe created out of a manga, andthe manga author kept his world as fluid as possible so that he would have no trouble cranking them out. No need to actually foreshadow anything...we'll just do it right before it happens. Why are we doing this? Well it's because of something that happened 100 years ago...let me tell you about it! Ugh. \\n\\n\r\nAlso the \"big reveals\" on this show don't feel like big reveals, because they were NEVER foreshadowed at all. Instead of being like \"WHOA, of course! that makes sense!\" I just think...\"huh? What? Uh, sure I guess.\"\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the fights. It's the kind of anime where everyone is ridiculously OP and it makes for some awesome fights. From an animation standpoint they are really impressive, which is why I gave the art a 10, but while they are fun to watch, they often make zero sense. Again, it's like the author never wanted to be nailed down. There are no real ground rules or limits on any of the main character's strength, and their abilities feel random.\\n\\n\r\nFor instance the Grizzly Sin of Sloth, named King, has the most random powers. He can petrify people, he controls a magical spear that flies around, he has a magical pillow that can transform into different stuff, oh, and he can summon these giant vines. Alright, fine, I got it, but just when you think you understand what his capabilities are he summons a MAGICAL SHIELD out of NOWHERE. Which was clearly just because he REALLY NEEDED that shield. The fighting lost all sense of suspense and danger because it become clear very quickly that whenever one of the Sins has their back against the wall, they're just going to pull out some bullshit ability and win the day.\\n\\n\r\nThen, of course, they have their \"special abilities\" that they call out by name. Some of them, like Full Counter, repeat often, but the majority of them don't. They're always pulling out a new trick. Like I said, there's no consistency. I always thought the point of naming an ability is so the audience could latch on to it and recognize it in the future, but if  you're never going to do it again, why bother? They should just scream out \"COOL THING I'M PULLING OUT OF MY ASS\" because that would be the most accurate way to describe it.\\n\\n\r\nI also just can't stand Meliodas' personality. You want it summed up in a single phrase? Happy-go-lucky. That's it. That's all. He's just too one-note and it grates on me. I know there's a good story reason why he doesn't allow himself to lose his cool, but he could really use a broader range of emotions. It's kind of bad thing when the main character has the most wooden and thin personality of everyone in his gang.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion...this could have been a great anime if everything didn't feel so random and off the cuff. It's so clear that so many things where just made up on the spot that it really knocks me out of the moment and stops me from enjoying the show. If I could somehow ignore the glaring plotholes and deus ex machina I would probably really enjoy this anime, but I just can't do that. So I'm going to have to give this a 6 for now.",

            "content": "The first time I heard of such thing as \"Netflix original anime,\" I could not hold back a snort. Although a fan of most original content Netflix offers, I could not combine three words together. While there are plenty of great series made in Europe, such as my personal all-time favourite Oban Star Racers, I had no faith Netflix could do a good job. To save myself time and disappointment, I decided not to bother.\r\nA while ago, I noticed the USB cable no longer connects my phone to a computer, thus I can no longer transfer myself new episodes of anime. I have sheepishly convincedmyself I will find something online via my phone during a lunch break at work. It appeared to be more difficult than expected, and scrolling through ad-filled listings was unpleasant. Annoyed by the obvious virus sites constantly popping out as I tried to find a title of the series I had on MyAnimeList, I eventually decided to settle on something that sounded relatively familiar\u2014Seven Deadly Sins. I was not sure if it was on my list, but the name rang a bell and so I went for it.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning did not impress me a slightest bit. \"Generic\" was the only word that echoed through my head, as I watched endless and absolutely unnecessary ecchi scenes and had been introduced to the world's most boring characters. Apart from Hawk, of course.\\n\\n\r\nDropping the series sounded like the only solution, but my mom did not raise a quitter\u2014instead, she brought up an OCD otaku, who must finish every damned series she starts. With a deep sigh, I carried on watching. After all, I have condemned myself to much worse shows before.\\n\\n\r\nWith appearance of other characters, the series was finally starting to draw me in. Although unimpressed at first, I found myself growing more and more eager to learn what the next episode had to offer. In fact, soon I even stopped noticing the irritating sexual scenes at all as my concentration was set on the story. That was when I have realized my soul had been stolen by the show I was quick to dismiss as clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, the strongest aspect of the series is its flow. The mistake most animes make is that the very first battles or small introduction stories (both are present in SDS) are forgotten as the show progresses and the original plot starts evolving. I was pleasantly surprised how Seven Deadly Sins actually included very minor characters to the main story, giving them extra screen time and somewhat of a development long after the viewer had forgotten them. What made me purr like a big fat cat was that it wasn't a one-time wonder, but has been continuously carried out throughout the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I give my praises to is character development. Probably not so much on the main characters who, in my opinion, had very little growth at all. I find it very interesting how creators of the anime put a much bigger emphasis on the side characters and their evolution rather than the main cast. The said evolution also resulted in great and unexpected plot twists that made me clap hands. Although far from a rookie when it comes to anime, I must admit it's the first time I've seen such approach. Normally, I would not expect it to work and the idea alone sounds mad. However, in Seven Deadly Sins it was executed so well it left me speechless.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime that started light and silly, filled with every clich\u00e9 joke and element you could think of, was quick to start getting dark. I found myself deeply impressed how smooth this transition was, as myself I could not pinpoint it and yet it was happening. I like to believe the more serious themes started appearing around the time I found myself growing fond of the series, but again, it's just my ego demanding a few strokes.\\n\\n\r\nMoving to the cons, I will once again mention character development. Although I welcome and cherish the idea of focusing on different kinds of characters, leaving the mains with close to no development should still not be a thing. Especially if, which is a serious case in Seven Deadly Sins, there is a hella annoying female character. Elizabeth is seriously everything I hate in a female antagonist and although there were brief attempts to make it seem as if she grows, till the very end she remains a damsel in distress with an overly squeaky voice. I guess being able to grope her was the only thing that made Meliodas tolerate her talking.\\n\\n\r\nFew stories that are viewed as complete, especially regarding back story of the main characters, in my opinion are too rushed. With Ban and Elaine, who live through a tragic love story, I failed to suffer the pain that was meant to be inflicted on my feels. No, it did not happen because I am insensitive\u2014in fact, I'm a notorious anime-cryer, but it was just not presented the way it should be to evoke one's feelings. It was short and clearly rushed, giving the viewer no time to actually get drawn into. At no moment I could feel the pain of the characters, it was only my common sense suggesting the story is actually very sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe part I have most complaints on is the end. I have spent days and days trying to figure out how I felt about it. The episode before the last was when emotions filled me so badly I was physically weeping, and I was, in fact, stressed to see how it all ends. Most series I was so into were forever ruined to me due to a stupid, ridiculous ending (I'm looking at you, Occultic;Nine), and goodness how I wished not to be disappointed. To this day, I can't tell if I am or not. It is difficult to put it in words without any spoilers, but let's just say I would be devastated if it ended the way I wanted to end, thus I am happy it ended the way it did. On the other hand, I would probably be devastated but satisfied, while now I am happy, yet rather annoyed.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the cons, I still genuinely enjoyed the series, and once I've finished them I did not wait to start looking for a new season. That's when I came across Wikipedia article on Seven Deadly Sins, and for some reason decided to skim through it.\\n\\n\r\nNo words could describe my amazement when I saw the same three words I refused to put together: \"Netflix original anime.\" I stared blank at the screen for nearly a minute, letting the idea to sink in. The series I liked more than the most (and I've seen a lot) were actually the ones I rejected before even giving it a try.\\n\\n\r\nLesson has been learned. The mind has been opened. All that is left now is to wait for a new season.",

Sometimes I just want to stop thinking about the flaws of a series and just enjoy it- Nanatsu no Taizai is that series. \r\nThis season of the series mainly focuses on regrouping the Seven Deadly Sins, all of whom having their own unqiue superpowers and personalities, to beat down the Holy Knights (basically the government of this world). This premise is simple and clear, and that's good enough. This is all okay because the series focuses and excelsat enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nTake the characters for example. The characters are definitely NOT complex (well maybe exempt one), but they just make you root for them. For example, the pig Hawk's main purpose is to be the comedic relief, which I usually despise, but I am charmed by his reactions and suggestions to the way more powerful pack that is the Seven Deadly Sins. \\n\\n\r\nThe original sound track, openings, and endings are just fun too. They all set up this as a tale, an adventure.\\n\\n\r\nI did watch this in order to watch the second season, and I am just going to say that if you are on the borderline of watching Nanatsu no Taizai then just watch the opening of season 2.\\n",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nSince the proper second season of The Seven Deadly Sins has now started, I thought it was time to rewatch the first series to refresh my brain about it. The first time it ended up being pretty fun to watch, yet the second time it ended up being even better.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nSet in early medieval Britannia, it follows a princess called Elizabeth, who is looking for the Seven Deadly Sins to help her stop the Holy Knights. Luckily she happens to accidentally encounter the Sins Captain, Meliodas.\r\nIt actually has a fairly simple story, the first half mainly has Meliodas, Elizabeth and Hawk finding theother sins, while also battling with the Holy Knights on some occasions.\\n\r\nBut it keeps the story entertaining by concentrating a lot on the characters while also having them fight a bunch of battles, which was entertaining and fun to watch because the show gives the characters very quick development where you just like them instantly and a lot of the stuff that happens between the sins can be either hilarious or emotional because these guys have such good chemistry together in battle or having nice beer.\\n\r\nThe second half of the story does continue with finding the sins, but once Gowther was acquired, the story really takes a shift in tone as it becomes more serious and gives us more information on the Holy War and The Holy Knights. A lot of these episodes actually focus on the big climatic battle for this series and boy is the action non-stop fun, but it also has a break from the action at points to give us some more background on the sins, It also tries to go for a Akame ga Kill vibe where the Holy Knight characters get a lot more focus and we see they aren't as connected as we first thought and they suddenly see through the lies they've been fed over the years.\\n\r\nThe final battle also introduces on of my favourite aspects of the show and why I love it's setting, because it is set during the time of King Arthur and I really like how they have brought this myth into play.\\n\r\nThe series also ended on a good note, the bad guy is defeated and the heroes continue on their journey, which really did open for a season 2, but it just got me hyped for the eventual second season which has finally arrived.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nSeven Deadly Sins has a huge range of characters, but it manages to balance them out very well especially the sins themselves.\\n\\n\r\nMeliodas is the Captain of the Seven Deadly Sins and is the sin of Wrath, however he is probably the most laid back and chill Captain I have ever seen. However that doesn't mean you should underestimate him, because he is probably one of the most OP characters I have ever seen, but in a good way since the enemies are pretty powerful too. He's also a big pervert and tends to mess around with Elizabeth from time to time, but he also cares for his team and any civilians he comes across making him willing to sacrifice his own life to protect them.\\n\r\nElizabeth is the third princess of Liones, after watching this the second time I can see why Elizabeth isn't as popular compared to the other characters, to me she isn't a bad character by far, her reasons for trying to fight and not run away are commendable, but it just becomes a drag for her character and makes her a little annoying sometimes. However in the end I still liked her character and hopefully her new powers can help develop these faults.\\n\r\nDiane is the sin of Envy, she is the giant of the team, no seriously and she actually ends up being the best female character of the series, because it amazes me how they make a giant girl adorable yet badass at the same time, her relationship with King also helps too as their both developed quite a lot during this season. Despite being a badass fighter, her unrequited love for Meliodas makes her a big Tsundere sometimes especially when he clings to Elizabeth which is probably her only negative, but it does work sometimes as a comedic device.\\n\r\nBan is the sin of Greed, Ban is arguably the best character of the series even though I like each and every one of the sins, but Ban just kicks ass. He's that very likeable douchebag character who plays jokes and doesn't take the situation too seriously, but he is also a tormented character who has been cursed with Immortality and yearns to bring back the one he loves making him a very well rounded character, his relationship with Meliodas, King and Hawk made him such a funny character until the moment got very serious which definitely happened between him and Meliodas as the situation got a little drastic.\\n\r\nKing is the sin of Sloth, He's actually the fairy king and is probably the most powerful member of the sins thus far just from magical power, although he's painfully the weakest when it comes to physical fights, his feelings towards Diane and the bumpy relationship he has with Ban made him a fun and relatable character even if he was a bit smug sometimes, it was also funny seeing him pop between his normal and bigger forms which always made great timing.\\n\r\nGowther is the sin of lust, despite only joining the crew just after the halfway point, Gowther manages to become an instant likeable character, by being the clueless guy who doesn't really know the meanings of what the other characters say very well and his unintended jokes just end up being absolutely hilarious, he can also be a pretty creepy character especially with the power he has which mainly focuses on peoples minds.\\n\r\nHawk is the sin of Scraps disposal as he likes to be called, Hawk is pretty much the talking animal character of this show, people might think Hawk is pretty annoying, but rewatching this made me realise that Hawk actually makes a lot of good points to the characters and is secretly badass at times, proving to be a bit of an underrated character, but I feel like the whole talking pig thing is leading up to something big.\\n\r\nMerlin the sin of Gluttony, she shows up towards the very end which does suck a little because the screentime she got, made her out to be a ruthless Mage especially considering none of the sins even dare pull a joke on her showing how feared she is.\\n\r\nThe Holy Knights consisted of a lot of characters, but they were all memorable in  some way, well apart from a few who were just there because of how ridiculous they looked. I did like how they weren't entirely the bad guys apart from Hendrickson and Dreyfus who are the ones pulling the strings all along and tricking everyone else.\\n\\n\r\nArt (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really liked about the artstyle in this show, has got to be the variety in the character design, because each of the sins looked awesome and different so it was pretty cool how each of them are a different race as well. The same can be said for the Holy Knights, each of their armour felt unique and really colourful albeit a few that just looked stupid.\\n\r\nSome of the locations looked pretty damn good too like the Fairy forest kingdom and the land of the dead looked very cool too, instead of feeling like death and misery it felt very mystic. However most of the other places just felt like they lacking, the whole countryside just doesn't feel great to look at, maybe it's because the setting is Britain and I'm British.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nBoth of the ops in this anime were well done and fitted the style of the Seven Deadly Sins, the first op had the adventurous feel while the second op had the more serious vibe going as we entered the final battle.\\n\r\nIt also provided one of my favourite ed's during the first half, which made me feel like this should've been the op because it was so catchy and fitted really well with how the characters are portrayed in the show. However the second ed just didn't do well for me and felt very lackluster after the first one.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also pretty damn good, it always had the right beat when the moment felt comedic or when there was a battle going on and the main theme Perfect Time was definitely the best choice for a show like this.\\n\\n\r\nExtras: \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the action, it just kept getting more and more intense each time something happened and I felt like they didn't hold back either, especially when we got to the final episodes when everything is unleashed upon us, the only thing action wise or even character wise is, the show really doesn't have much of a backbone for killing off characters. With the sins it made sense, but I'm surprised how only two characters that actually made an impact died, also the names of the magic spells weren't very amazing to hear they just didn't feel like they had any omph to them and felt very simple.\\n\r\nThis show actually has a lot of comedy and it works really well on so many levels, mainly due to the chemistry between the sins which has made them a very likeable bunch compared to other anime's who try to create a group of characters.\\n\r\nNow despite having Ecchi in there, it isn't too bad from what I remembered, just a bunch of groping, pantie shots and a few jiggle effects, so the usual really, but it doesn't overstay it's welcome and never becomes a big distraction. I think what kinda hurts the story a little is the amount of romance subplots, the one between Meliodas and Elizabeth just doesn't stick with me and I see them more as friends than lovers. On the other hand the ship between King and Diane is definitely one I can get behind and made them much better characters by the end, because they work so well together and every moment between them felt so cute.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a very entertaining fantasy, adventure anime, sure it has slight problems, but they don't impact the anime that much and I can't wait to see how season 2 ups the enjoyment factor.",

            "content": "Taizai greatness! This is the second time I\u2019ve watched the show this year: once subbed and once dubbed into Spanish (thanks Netflix). I enjoyed it from the very beginning, and now that there\u2019s a new season (or maybe a remake) coming in 2016, I just can\u2019t wait for more of my favorite shounen. The problem is, however, how this first season ends. While the anime was almost faithful to the manga (some details all along the series were taken off during the adaptation, but it wasn\u2019t terrible), the problem comes at the last 5 minutes, something that is indeed bad, and can put in problemsthe development our characters (especially Gowther) get in the following 20 chapters. But first, I\u2019ll talk briefly about the anime.\\n\\n\r\n(Skip to the next paragraph if you just want to read my thoughts on the ending and the new Taizai series)\\n\\n\r\nTaizai the anime is a well done adaptation that can leave anyone with satisfaction once they\u2019ve finished. If you're looking for some fun without caring about missing information and some deus ex machina plot twists, then this is the show for you.  The animation is average for A-1 pictures standards, and if you\u2019re picky, you\u2019re going to watch lots of off-model characters. But is nothing that will ruin the experience for you. The music is good enough to make the action scenes more compelling, and the OPs EDs are pleasant enough to watch them every time at the beginning and end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt isn\u2019t a good stand-alone show, though, as it leave major plot holes opened by the time it ends. It\u2019s not a problem of the writers, nor of the original creator, Nakaba Suzuki. The problem was how quick A-1 got the rights to adapt the manga. Adapting 102 episodes and finish at a point where nothing is resolved and without the certainty of a second season is dangerous for the quality if the show, and it is worst when it\u2019s finished with an anime original conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that, as I said before, it leaves a possible 2nd season (not confirmed as of today) in a very difficult point, mostly because of the anime original ending. Major development for Gowther and very good details for the story, like the Balor\u2019s eye or the introduction of the Pleiades knights, come right after the end of the Hendrickson arc. So the scriptwriters are in for a very good challenge if a 2nd season is indeed confirmed. In order to connect the ending of the 1st season with how the story goes in the manga without losing such important information, the most logical thing would be remake the second part of the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is less likely, a remake of the complete show is another possibility, but it would be a lost of time and money in something that was, for the most time, well done and without any major flaw. And frankly, watching everything again would be boring for a lot of people as it hasn't passed much time since this anime ended.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up, Taizai the anime is a great show for people who just want to have some mindless fun and don\u2019t want to analyze every single detail of it. For or those who don\u2019t plan to read the manga and don\u2019t like plot holes and deux ex machinas, the show may be a lost of time. But for manga readers like me, the ending might be underwhelming and might put in danger information presented right after the last animated arc of the manga if a second season is confirmed.\\n\\n\r\nSo the recommendation of this show will totally depend on the tolerance of the possible viewer. To me, this show was a treat from beginning to end, and I can\u2019t wait to see how the writers would manage to solve this big problem.",

            "content": "Yes, I realize that my individual scores are actually higher than my overall score, but there's a reason for this.  Seven Deadly Sins starts off great...the writing is excellent, the characters are likable, and the story is great.  Especially this last element.  This show throws you into the story without explaining whether the characters have actually done the horrible things they're rumored to have done (killing dozens of knights and attempting to overthrow the kingdom, to name the main accusations).  For a time, the viewer is allowed to judge whether or not the Seven Deadly Sins (as well as some ofthe supporting cast) are who they appear to be, and to try to figure out what their true motivations are.  I found this to be a fascinating element of the show.  I really enjoyed this show...for a while, anyway. \\n\\n\r\nBut there's no rating on this site for consistency, which is what this show lacks.  It has no follow-through.  The first dozen plus episodes are great, but around maybe 18 episodes in, this anime kind of takes a nose dive.  I'm making it sound like it gets awful, which it does by no means, but quality takes a major hit.  While there are some great moments towards the end of season one, the show basically becomes obsessed with the final battle between the main characters and the antagonist, and keeps building it up.  This buildup to this final fight and the fight itself must take up like 8 episodes, which is ridiculous, since that takes up a full third of season 1.  Seven Deadly Sins works really well on one to three episode arcs.  I can't really remember there being more than that before this final battle, so to have this kind of format all of a sudden really throws off the pacing of the show, and honestly, makes it boring.  I really wish a lot of animes weren't so obsessed with having this epic final battle kind of thing.  I see it so frequently, and while it can work really well sometimes, it just drags this show down to the point of boredom.  I recognize the need for some kind of major climax to the season, but again, this could have been another 3 episode arc, and it would have been great.  I would still recommend this show, but just realize that you might not find it as satisfying towards the end of the season.",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai, what can I say?\r\nFirst off, I went into this show highly skeptical considering I was of the impression that this would be retarded and a waste of my time. I believed that it would be another happy disney show about saving the princess and wahhh wahh wahh boo hoo kids flick for the romantically petrified and foreveralone mundane.\r\nBoy was I epicly wrong. This show right here people, is one of the best in the last 10 years. I havent been this hyped watching a show since I saw Lord Lelouch is code geass from the first episode. Ill talk about every sectionlater on but if you are only reading up to this point, ill say this, do not be quick to judge lest be judged,\\n\\n\r\nNow for the sectional review:\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n- This show is about a group of people that are dragonballz level assassins, coming together through time to try and save a kingdom under siege by an evil \"group\" known as the Holy Knights. The main two characters or love com, are that of the Great captain of the assassin group known as the \"seven deadly sins\" called Meliodas, who has a carefare personality that will either grip you at the beginning or at some point and the wonderful bonified fairy tail piece or so I thought, Elizabeth, the third princess of the empire under siege.\\n\r\n- As Elizabeth runs away from home, she came across this wonderful bad ass mother of all ages bonified beast Meliodas, their journey to find the rest of the assassin group comes into play and a large sequence of events occur. \\n\r\n-I will not spoil the overall anime as I really wish for you to see it but I will say this, the story has no fillers, every episode has a large amount of action, and comedy and will have you rooting for at least one character from the beginning to the end. This show is what I wanted other so called \"top brass\" anime to be like. It will not in anyway bore you and It certainly is not a Disney flick for kids of all ages. This show is for a mature mind, meaning if you believe an adolescent is smart enough to understand the events of the show then they may watch it as there is blood and gore in this show so dont permit children under 12 to watch this thank you.\\n\\n\r\n-Art\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the art, it has a similar feel to that of fairy tail before 2014 thank you very much. The design of the world is marvelous and truly makes you feel as if you are a citizen of the kingdom and fellow lands and engulfs your mind into a fantasy like no other. The last anime that had me batcrap crazy like this was sword art online first season thank you very much. Anyways yeah, there is modern day art that would hurt your eyes to watch and the comparison of fairy tail design should give you a decent perspective as to what this anime's art is all about.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\n- Regarding the characters, I believe the anime team and the author definitely got this section on track as one of the best anime to ever have such a proper level of character development. Truly, I was in awe when I found out about each Sinners story and in the words of one of them:\" A sin is only something that you cannot ever erase.\" I was brought to tears by every single one of their pasts and it is so immense as to how a human being can endure their pain and have so much life to live for. The show makes you truly think as you watch as to what \"sin\" really is? Who can truly judge sin? And as you watch you will understand that only the one who made you can as there are some religious perspectives in this so it tests your beliefs as well. Oh my god, the feels ugh. Definitely good character development. Anyone who watches this with an open mind will be able to find at least one character to feel that they are similar to as it is that vast. Damn.\\n\\n\r\n-Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nAs you can obviously see if you are still reading this review, you can tell how much I loved this anime. Ive watched a lot of anime in my time and this definitely is at the top of my list. So damn good, they packed so much genre in here it had me mind messed. If there is anything that I am disappointed with regarding this anime, it is that it might not have another season. This is Code Geass level people. Beautiful. I hope yall enjoyed my review and peace. Love yall. \\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\\n\r\n9.3/10",

            "content": "!SPOILERS MIGHT BE HERE AND THERE IN THIS FKING REVIEW, DON'T JUDGE!\r\nAl' Fking right here we go again\r\nThis is one of my favorite animes for sure, so a lot of what you hear might be a little over the top but i truly loved the anime.\r\nStory: Yes please.\r\nIts a very mysterious story. A lot more backstory then other animes, which keeps you watching and hoping that you might figure something out about MC or something like that. The amount of plot twists are also insane to say non the least, like are the seven deadly sins bad or good? Who is MC? Who are thebad guys? all that shit, and there's tons of it. Then there's the backstory we don't get told about and we just have to try'n figure out on our own until we get it told. But if you want to know what it basically is about then ill try yo sum it up here: Its about This dude who is the captain of the seven deadly sins, who meets a girl with the name Elizabeth. She turns out to be a princess, and that her goal is to find all of the seven deadly sins. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaand of coarse she is talking to the captain who also wants in on the action, and thats how the story begins. Pretty neat. \\n\\n\r\nArt: Very nac\\n\r\nOk the art might not look that insane at first. You might think that some of the characters have ugly faces, but trust me when i say this. You will grow to like it. And hey the princess is pretty hot so there's that as well. The fights actually look pretty cool with all the blood, immense power, Swords and tits. Not as good looking art as in for example fairy tail or highschool dxd (if you need another ecchi as a reference) but its very nac. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Cewl.\\n\r\nSo i watched the dub(don't hunt me down plez) because it was there and the voice acting was not half bad tbh. I really liked it, and it didn't bother me one bit. So watch dub if your pride can take a hit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: omGYAAAAAAAAHD!\\n\r\nThe fking Characters in this anime is to die for. Some1 like Ban, like cmon he is so fking epic its unbelievable. Or fking Gowther who give 0 fks. (dont mind it if you dont know them, but you will love them 100p) Meliodas is actually pretty cool aswell! All of them have backstories and we have only heard a handful of them. Fx we dont know jackshit about Gowther but he cool af. Ban about how he lost a loved one, and how he... you know... well you will c it when he comes around. Or how king lost his sister. The shit is cool. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Amazin.\\n\r\nI really enjoyed tis, like if you even saw what i said above then you would know how much i loved it. No more to say\\n\\n\r\nOverall: den/den would rewatch agian\\n\r\nLoved it, it was a combination of epic battles, great humor, amazing characters, waifus and ecchi. I say its a much watch for people who like that kind of stuff.",

The power of maths compels me,  the power of maths....  you get it.\r\n            The summary provided by MAL, and every other anime site,kind of points you in the right direction for the story; but its so vague you don't really quite know what you are signing up for.  The show itself goes way beyond the summary and you really don't get a proper taste of the vast world contained by the anime.  Seven Deadly Sins is full of growing plots  and very well placed insights to character backstories that all pair together for a wonderful 24 episode adventure.  This particular anime is down right littered with cliffhangers,  so praise the gods its already a completed series.   I personally would have absolutely died not being able to watch one episode after the other.  So my heart goes out to all who endured the struggle during its release.   With a variety of landscapes and scenarios, and the constant character development; this show will easily steal your consciousness and demand a binge.  You have been warned.  I give this fable a [9/10] for story.\\n\\n\\n\r\n     The animation is a little above average at best.   However, it was also consistent for 24 episodes.  No matter the characters introduced or the changes in landscape, there was never a dip in animation quality, earning it an [7/10] for art. \\n\\n\r\n    The first 12 episodes had an amazing OP and ED.  Like damn those were some tasty jams.  The second cour not so much.  Even with the final 12 episodes failing in the soundtrack department,  I am happy to still give the sound a 9.  Cause the dub work on this anime was more than satisfactory, and good dubs is hard to find. If you are a dub only anime fan,  don't forget to add the seven deadly sins to your watch list. \\n\\n\\n\r\n    Characters:  Well being dubbed the seven deadly sins does kind of give the viewer a misleading introduction.   You expect these vile beings,  just to discover the Sins are very similar to the call signs of fighter pilots.  Maverick and Goose?  Nay,  Wrath and Greed bitches.  Welcome to the danger zone.  While each having their own tropes and archetypes,  the diversity of the people in Nanatsu no Taizai will lead you to a believable concept that they are in a big wide world with a vast history.  I found myself personally not hating any of the characters in this show,  villains included.   So that's a top gunned [9/10] in the character department.\\n\\n\\n\r\n  Did I enjoy this anime?...   well did I?     I binge watched it in a single day.  Ass glued to the sofa and eyes dried by my intense reception of this animated pleasure.  Personal Enjoyment [10/10] \\n\\n\\n\r\n            As always your anime pal Grizzziff Kingsbeard coaches moderation in all things.   Do as I say and not as I do; but if you find yourself wanting to kill some free time, whether a few hours at a time or a whole day at once,  then The Seven Deadly Sins isn't a bad way to go about it.   Highly recommend in either the sub or Dub formant, cant go wrong either way.",

            "content": "The Seven Deadly Sins is a show I'd tell people I like, but to be honest, I'm a bit conflicted about it. My first time watching through it, I considered it really enjoyable and exciting! But rewatchng some of it, I see quite a bit of flaws and things I kind of glossed over the first time around.\r\nStory-7\r\n*contains light spoilers*\r\nThe story starts of on a very exciting note. On episode 1, we open up on a kingdom in ruins, immediately creating a sense of tension and curiosity. Then we get to a tavern, where we are introduced to some quirky characters like Melodias and Hawk,and hear rumors and chatter about the titular Seven Deadly Sins, when a silent armored figure enters. This person is revealed to be Elizabeth, the princess of the Liones kingdom. After seeing Elizabeth's unflattering clothes from under the armor, Melodias gives her the rather promiscuous, Boar Hat female uniform. Then, holy nights come looking for Melodias. Melodias slays them all with his interesting broken sword. Melodias the reveals himself to Elizabeth as the captain of the Seven Deadly Sins. The subsequent episode manages to keep up the excitement from the first and establishes what seems to be a main antagonist. Episode 3 and 4 start to drag a lot though, and are mostly to set up more characters and future events. The pace of the story does start to pick up though as more sins are re-recruited, until we get to the first major arc, The Necropolis arc. Which, believe it or not was my favorite part of the show. Characters like Ban and King have a lot of time to develop during this arc, which is a pretty good thing. Up until this arc, it's easy to see Ban as just a jerk and selfish. But through flashbacks and events that take place in this arc, you realize that not everything is black and white with him. He always had some level of selfishness to him, but there are people like Elaine and places like the Fairy Forrest that he genuinely cares for and tries to protect.He even is willing to sacrifice his life for the sins. And as the story goes on, Ban's existence seems painful...and this could just be his way of taking it out. King also kicks ass and proves to be valuable to the team. However, the best arc of the show is quickly followed up with the worst arc, the Vaizel Fighting Festival. I was actually pretty excited for this arc of the show because tournament arcs can sometimes have the potential to be one of, if not, the best arcs of the show. Heck, just look at the Dark Tournament arc from YuYu Hakusho, and a lot of people get hooked on Naruto after the Chunin Exam arc. They have the potential to have amazing fights, putting an end to rivalries, and overall, just proving who's the best. However, instead of doing most of this, The Seven Deadly Sins just uses this arc as a platform to introduce a TON of new major characters, story elements, backstories, ect. to the audience. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this if they were able to do all of that and have good fights, but that's not what happens. Most of the fights are literally happen just to show us gags (Diane vs. Griamore, King vs. Cain) or flashbacks (Melodias vs. Cain, and Melodias vs Ban to some extent). Speaking of Melodias vs. Ban, that was definitely the most disappointing fight. In forms of fight choreography, what they do with it is fine. There are a couple cool sequences, like when Melodias and Ban start flipping each other, and when Melodias and Ban punch each other's fists, and Melodias' fist makes Ban's fist curl back which lets him hit Ban's gut, however, you have two characters fighting who are established to be...practically immortal! We've seen King drill a giant hole into Ban's upper torso with his Chastiefol, and have had Ban come out perfectly fine, but they don't even go that far in this fight. I was expecting Melodias and Ban really tearing into each other! Instead it just ends with powers and abilities that haven't been previously set up in the series and more foreshadowing.There's not even any tension going on during the tournament. Except for Griamore, who Diane defeats in the first round, there's no one who poses a threat! Instead, most of the tension comes within running the risk that the holy nights could find out that the Seven Deadly Sins are back together and out in the open. Although, after Melodias and Ban's fight, which almost splits the battlefield in half, you start to wonder if their even trying to hide it anymore. Thankfully, the last two arcs do the series justice. The Armored Giant arc has a nice heartwarming ending and prepares all the characters for the final arc. And the last arc, The Kingdom Infiltration arc, is in my opinion, a great way to end the show. Everything ties together very nicely and we're actually explained some things that have remained pretty elusive throughout the whole show like why Melodias' broken sword is so important to the government, why King was absent from the Fairy Forrest when Ban was, Diane's backstory,and who Elizabeth really is. There are also some pretty good fights and I really enjoyed the ending. It kind of reminds me of the ending of Dragonball Z, where all of the characters use their power all at once to defeat the villian.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I didn't really like about The Seven Deadly Sin's story though is that they kind of steal a bunch of plot points or aspects from other shonen series and try to retool them to get them to work into their story. You can obviously tell from the visuals that TSO takes more than a little influence from Fairy Tail but they also take a little more than that as well. Just like in Fairy Tail, there's a hot teenage girl who wants to be independent and a part of the team, like Lucy. There's demon blood, a quick and easy resource to turn failed knights into the strongest of holy knights referred to as a new generation, just like the wizards in Fairy Tail who were implanted with dragon lacrimas to become a new generation of dragon slayers. There's also this confusing magical circle where a bunch of holy knights stand around and trade powers with each other, which gives the respective hero of that holy knight that specific power to temporary use in battle (The show doesn't explain it that well but it makes sense when you see it) but the point is, looks exactly like the magical council meetings from Fairy Tail!!! Not only that, but they also take a surprising amount of influence from One Piece as well! From Melodias and Ban having a tradition of arm wrestling, to the last scene of the show resembling the end of the Alabasta arc a little too closely (Except in this show, the princess gets what she wants) it's a little blatant. Thankfully, they do try to retool these concepts enough so it doesn't feel tired, and they're pretty spread out across the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-6\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit of a mixed bag, but I find about half of them to be generally enjoyable\\n\\n\r\nMelodias= Melodias is the captain of the sins and represents the dragon sin, wraith. However, that doesn't really fit his personality at all. In fact, wikipedia even says \"despite being called the sin of wraith, Melodias acts more like a mellow trickster who is often seen fondling over Elizabeth one way or another\". In fact, at the start of the series, I thought he would probably represent the goat sin, lust, as he dresses Elizabeth in skimpy clothes and gropes her for the sake of comedy. Throughout most of the show, he is pretty laid back. Which is pretty rare for most shonen protagonist and certainly sets him apart. However, Melodias' laid back attitude kind of pisses me off sometimes. It can sometimes come off as him not really caring about what's going and kill tension in a scene. Later on in the show when we learn about his past, his personality starts to make a little more sense. Maybe he's just bored cuz he's been through so much that this adventure isn't as exciting as it is to Elizabeth, or the writers may be trying to subvert our expectations. Y'know, him being the representation of wrath but really acting mellow. And that is an interesting idea to try to subvert. There are a lot of other anime like Fullmetal Alchemist or Trinity Seven that create personifications out of the seven deadly sins, however it's all in the execution. And I don't think they exactly accomplished what they were going for. I love this kid's character design though. The saggy looking vest and tie just look perfect for the protagonist of an adventure series.\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth= Elizabeth is a character I loved the first time watching The Seven Deadly Sins. But now that I've really analyzed the show, I don't think she's really as great as I remembered. Elizabeth is a princess from the Liones kingdom, who ran away from home to find the Seven Deadly Sins so they can resolve turmoil going on in the kingdom. Elizabeth is kinda just the character that tags around while the sins do all the heroic work. However, she does try and make herself useful, which is what brought me to start to like her character. She always puts herself in harms way if it means helping the sins and she actually saves them all at the end of the series. However, she still does come off as weak even after saving the sins. She still lets Melodias grope her and she never actually fights along side the sins. To me, she's kind of like a poor man's Lucy Heartfilia. A teenage girl who stands by and tries to help a team of powerful heroes, while also gaining independence from her father while still looking really good. However, I consider Lucy a more dynamic and likable character because she worked hard with her friends to become stronger, and eventually could hold her own just like the others in Natsu's team, and she didn't aspire for anything less than that. She had confidence to rise above her father and his obsession of money and trivial things, and carved out her own identity by becoming a member of Fairy Tail. When Elizabeth tries to help the sins, it feels like she's just kinda half-assing it, or doesn't want to risk actually fighting. She is against violent conflict, but she doesn't make an attempt to get around having to hurt people or stop the sins from doing it. In the end, she's alright.\\n\\n\r\nBan- Ban represents the fox sin, greed. He's a pretty cool character and a fan favorite for most. And I can certainly see why. Ban is probably the most vicious looking of the sins, with his fangs, scars, and bloody eyes. He can also be incredibly ruthless, willing to kill his own teammates. But he also has somewhat of a sweet side, I won't spoil it. His red coat and pants with spikes also kind of reminds of late 80's and early 90's rock fashion which is pretty interesting. The only thing I don't really like about him is that, like Melodias, I don't think he really represents his sins well. When Ban is first introduced in the series, I thought he was going to represent lust because of his interesting fashion sense. I know I've said that twice but I'm seriously not kidding XD And yeah, his powers do have to do with greed, but aside from in flashbacks, nothing about his personality screams \"greed!\". He's not even like Melodias where they may be trying to subvert the audience's expectations. For what he's though, I think Ban is a pretty good character.\\n\\n\r\nDiane- Wow! A character who actually has characteristics and a personality that their sin represents!? I can't tell if this was intentional or they weren't trying to be subversive but they actually did it! Diane, the serpent sin, envy. Diane is pretty different compared to a lot of the characters as well, in the way that she is a giant. She's fierce, strong, and can also turn her body into iron. However, being a giant comes with it's drawbacks.Diane constantly feels lonely because humans discriminate against her, and also, she has a crush on Melodias. But do to her size, she's not often able to comfort him while he's inside of buildings or hospitals. So she comes to envy the humans. Diane can be pretty interesting on occasion. But most of the time, it's just her gawking over the captain. I find Diane to be annoying most of the time and she certainly isn't my favorite of the sins. \\n\\n\r\nKing- King, the grizzly sin, laziness. King, surprisingly, is another character who actually represents his sin quite well. Actually even better than Diane. Unlike Diane, who's personality was only designed around envy, King's entire character design definitely had laziness in mind. He wears a hoodie and sits on a floating pillow. Nice to see you guys go all the way for one character. King is often pretty laid back, although he can occasionally butt heads with Ban. He also is in love with Diane which creates a love triangle. King's a pretty serviceable character. That's all I got.\\n\\n\r\nGowther- The goat sin, lust. Well after I already through two characters in this series were lust, this one must really stand out right? Not really. Next to King, she's probably wearing the most clothes of the sins. She's also very plain and most of her powers involve controlling minds, which isn't as interesting as it sounds. Maybe she was supposed to be subversive too. Either way, she's still my least favorite of the sins. \\n\\n\r\nOther Characters: I actually found myself liking a lot of the side villains. There's a lot of conflict within the Kingdom of Liones which leads to some interesting debates between the holy knights. And the holy nights aren't portrayed as being evil and irredeemable. There are some knights that are just doing this for the sake of their families. This is something I haven't seen in a shonen in a long time and I was glad to see this incorporated here.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-8\\n\\n\r\nNot going to touch on this much since I mostly focused on Story and Characters, but the animation is pretty nice. It's got that overly glossy look we've come to expect from A-1 Picture's shows, which I generally don't like. However in the Seven Deadly Sins, I think it actually works. I'm not really sure how to explain why, but it just does. Also, I like the attention to detail, like the strands of Elizabeth's hair. Nothing really more for me to comment on.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\\n\r\nExtremely enjoyable!! Well paced and great for binge watching!\\n\\n\r\nOverall-6\\n\\n\r\nI think a 6 is a pretty appropriate rating for the Seven Deadly. It's a wildly enjoyable series that I always love watching!! I feel really attached to characters like Elizabeth, Ban, King and way more. However, objectively, I'd say it's just above average. It has some good ideas, but trouble executing them. It can also be moving too fast or too slow. And the Fighting Festival will always suck. I would seriously recommend this if you love shonen, specifically ones that take place in Celtic settings and want a quick watch. If not, I think it's okay to skip this one. I'm seriously interested to see what happens in season 2 coming this January!",

Not else to say other than i was a fun way to finish (despite the fact it took more time to waste due to work and etc.) Otherwise it was good. No filer being a good sing since that really bores me.\r\nNow for the things i kinda wanna talk why this show is good/bad for my taste.\r\nI really find it's plot to be generic and easy to spot allmajor things. No seriously that plot was east to figure out in matter of one episode.For example: The search for the Seven Sins, Ban looking for a way to find Elieen back to life. The whole show is easy to watch and not bore you at all.Overall it is kinda cringey at times to glare it with a different view.\\n\r\nAnimation,Music and etc. stuff was all fantastic. The marks at the end of episode of episode 24 got me to think for more plotholes.\\n\\n\r\nBan was aways my reason to watch this show from start to finish. I hope he we get see his arc in the next season soon...\\n\r\nHawk was really annoying and not much to say about her/he.\\n\\n\r\nThe character were kinda funny and likable at times. Ban was aways my biased tbh.Thier development was amazing and i wanted more.I wanted to see Escanor soo badly...\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the thing that REALLY killed this show for me was being told for 3 years that it was amazing and best anime ever writen. I thought it was bad at first, then i was alright. Honestly, it's not the best anime i've seen or that great. I found to be good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was just OK. Definitely not the best anime series. But eh, it wasn\u2019t a total waste of my time as it did have some interesting ideas and characters\u2026 I just wish I ignored the fandom beforehand.\\n\r\nI rate it 8/10 and hope Season 2 hits BY THE BALLS HARD THAN THIS ARC.\\n\\n\r\nSide Note: 24 Episode of an anime is easy for reviews since not much can be expected lol.\\n",

However, The Seven Deadly Sins manage this nothing like they do with Kirito in SAO. They seem to make *every* main character (both villain and hero) super overpowered so it all kinda balances out. This makes it surprisingly more enjoyable than you may think, as the fight scenes become quite spectacular - especially near the end. \r\nI'm giving this show an 8 because, although it is quite an extraordinary show, the repetitive \"sexual references\" (as Netflixput it) definitely don't help its case. The excessive boob and ass gropes from the main male protagonist (redacting name for spoiler reasons) are annoying and unnecessary, but are too low frequency for it to put me off watching the show.",

Their rule is now threatened by their former allies whom they betrayed known as the Seven Deadly Sins, who are beginning to reappear throughout the land. \r\nSeven Deadly Sins is a solid shonen battle anime. It has what you would expect with many cool powers, fights, colorful characters, and a balance of funny and serious moments. This anime is a little too swayed in the direction of humor for my taste, though I am sure many others would enjoy this. \r\nThe anime itself is decent is mostregards. Decent plot, decent worldbuilding, decent actions. Some aspects were even bad in my opinion, with the comedy not landing well with its atmosphere or being very funny and the animation being average. The characters at first felt decent at best, though I will admit I was surprised with the characterization and character development we see with each of our characters throughout the story. These characters are fun and entertaining, but also have deep backstories behind them. The characters arent amazing, but they are I would say they are good. \\n\\n\r\nThe story itself isnt very intersting up until the last 8 episodes of the 25 episodes which were great and my favorite part of the series. I hope this series continues with the serious tension and atmosphere in season 2, at least for the important arcs. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend Seven Deadly Sins if you enjoy shonen battle series and are looking for a recent one to watch. This anime isnt anything great or groudbreaking, but it might be a better alternative to some of the other shonen battle series airing recently. I have a feeling fans of One Piece and Fairy Tail would enjoy this since they will be able to get past the goofiness.",

No boob-squeezing, no panty-stealing, and I'd have liked this series all that much more. Sometimes I fell out of the loop, confused by where the story was going. Decisions seem to be made without thought, fairly randomly. Like, ask \"How did that happen?\" and the show answers back \"Don't worry about it, just accept this nonsense and keep watching.\"\r\nDespite that, I've enjoyed watching the show, it's pretty good.",

            "content": "Oh my christ I can't believe some comments and actual reviews of people being amazed by the plot , the music , interactions and characters. Im going to just throw all thoughts out so this will definitely be more for a rant than a review. *Contains spoilers*\r\nWhere do I begin?\r\nUninspired basic-level dialogue and typical cliches throughout 24 episodes? Check.\r\nLack of any memorable music? Check.\r\nLack of understanding on how to pace the animation and story well? Check.\r\nRandom backstories of characters we have seen for literally 5 total minutes, that \"die\" (whether its true death or they just come back later because \"happy ending\") that main charactersget emotional about, for 3 good minutes until they stop crying and then give inspirational speeches with happy faces? F*CKING CHECK! (?????)\\n\\n\r\nPlot of backstories? Absolutely generic , ZERO exceptions. CHECK\\n\\n\r\nMain plot? No matter how good of a story you might have on paper, if you're not good at presenting it it will definitely go to waste, while i still believe its mostly uninspired , as in its not innovative at all, and at various parts doesn't make a lot of sense. I still believe they could've done a better job at it:\\n\\n\r\nThey tried countless times to make you give a shit about characters no one should ever give a fuck with how little they were presented or how basic their backstories were and how fast it flew by giving zero time for it to sink in. Bad guys that have zero reason to help eachother yet they still do it regardless. For no good reason 9.9 out of 10 \"Holy knights\" apparently are corrupt to the bone not giving a shit about anyone and cant for a single second see the evil around them, this is  thrown in your face for 23 episodes until on the last one everyone is \"very sorry , we strayed away from our path\" and all is forgiven because now all these guys are going to rebuild the kingdom , hooray.\\n\\n\r\nMain characters? Well there's a few that can be likeable honestly , what they mostly have going for them is cheap-vague mysteriousness that the more they dive in their past the more they prove how vague they are. The main female protagonist that motivates the group to reuinite has a bad case of orihime-chan multiplied by 10. The main protagonist , meliodas, can't be bothered to give a shit up until his close ones are in true trouble , typically gets beat up over and over and over again in the midst to come back either healed or determined to win ZZZzzzz.. As in for their main mascot \"hawk\" a talking pig they have around with them has to be one of the most pointless and annoying characters of them all that they also expect you to give a shit near the end where it supposedly dies by tanking a huge attack that would've \"finished off\" the good guys and next episodes gets revived because of , literal explanation by the pig \"its a mystery\". Yeah what a surprise , vague as ever.\\n\\n\r\nEnemies? Throughout the entire anime nobody ever poses them an actual threat till the very end where you know they'll win to conclude the story. The few times they try to throw someone supposedly strong its blatant as hell they were never a threat.\\n\\n\r\nFights? \"You stand no chance against me! Seven deadly sin member!\" -> \"How can someone be this strong?\" -> \"So this is the true power of the deadly sins, wouldn't expect less\"  -> \"Loses or ends up siding with them later on\" or \"Guy 1: I bet you didnt expect that attack\" , \"Guy 2: I did , i bet you didnt expect this attack\" , \"Guy 1 gasps in surprise and gets hit\". Seriously, fuck you.\\n\\n\r\nSo what the actual fuck does this anime do right? Beats me, I guess cliches do their work and the fact that they approach things in such a vague way i guess makes people try to think deep into it as they theorize in their minds to justify enjoying this rollercoaster of nonsense. Maybe its the harem scenes/jokes they throw every 1-2 episodes or so. What a great accomplishment. I SHIT YOU NOT , THE ONLY THING THIS ANIME GETS CONSISTENTLY RIGHT WHICH IS THE FUNNIEST THING , IS MAKING ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT WHENEVER A FEMALE CHARACTER'S CLOTHES GETS TORN,THAT UNTIL THEY CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON NEW CLOTHES, IN EVERY UPCOMING SCENE , WHETHER THEY ARE TEMPORARILY DEFEATED , OR IN THE BACKGROUND , OR DURING VICTORY MOMENTS , THAT THEY NEVER MESS UP THAT DETAIL DOWN TO THE PIXEL. LOL WELL DONE ON THAT FOLKS! PUTTING ATTENTION WHERE ITS WORTH WHILE EVERYTHING ELSE IS FALLING APART\\n\\n\r\nWell, jokes aside (Even  though that really actually happens in disturbingly funny detail), the popularity probably mostly comes from the flashiness of the fights. While the pacing and generic reactions of characters makes the fights less enjoyable , combined with the fact that most of the attacks seem more random than memorable with few exceptions. You have your typical shonen fast paced attacks and your large scale powerful ones so I can see how it can grab attention in that department , while the pacing is as i've said numerous times is bad , the animation is pretty alright for 2014 standards. Anything other good than that  i would probably say its the background art. If you're into medieval fantasy worlds i would say its pretty pleasing.\\n\\n\r\nConclussion:\\n\\n\r\nIf your argument is going to be: \"Well its a shounen , what do you expect?\". This isn't an argument. \\n\\n\r\nWhile even classics or popular shounens can have what you would typically expect from this genre they make sure to deliver it right and in some department stand out from the rest in a unique way. Seven deadly sins so far severely lacks that. It feels like a mass of ambiguous ideas grabbed from right and left put together with little effort to be original, innovative or smart and for that i'll be giving it a generous 4.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want to approach this in the most enjoyable way despite all my personal opinions , go into this anime with the very least expectations, expect things to sort of be generic and take it lightly for what it is. Otherwise something should definitely tick you off episode by episode, well atleast assuming you have any standards at all and you can see things in a larger scope. Atleast that's my subjective opinion. Apologises for the long rant , thanks for listening.\\n",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai, Seven Deadly Sins in English, is a shounen anime that should have been seinen. It suffers greatly because of its aimed demographics, and brings about a lot of head scratches along the way. It's unfortunate mainly because its foundations are quite superb, only to be dwindled down by the constraints of its own \"genre\". \r\nTL;DR - pros/cons \r\n+ Amazing production values\r\n+ Huge cast of diverse characters\r\n+ Interesting main cast (for the most part)\r\n+ Well set-up world\r\n+ Diversity in powers gives space for huge opportunities \r\n+ A whole lot of space to expand (other Kingdoms, worlds etc.)\r\n- Very badly executed story\r\n- Ending isterrible \\n\r\n- Main villain is neither interesting nor intimidating \\n\r\n- Fuckton of asspulls \\n\r\n- Most of the side characters are pointless and go nowhere \\n\r\n- Very little is know about majority of main cast \\n\r\n- More than a few dull moments before the final arc\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory in NnT follows Princess Elizabeth on her quest to reunite Seven Deadly Sins, Kingdom's strongest Holy Knights who are believed to have betrayed the Kingdom ten years ago. Initial setup works well, as it presents clear goal and a path of adventure. Its initial characters spark up the charm, and the mystery behind each of the Seven keeps you going. Unfortunately, somewhere along the line, it turns into a ... mess. You know, that generic plotline of \"dude wishes for power so he combines with gods or whatever\". That can work if executed well, but here, however, it was executed quite poorly. Story suffers massively from its own incapability to cope with its rules within universe, and relies upon random asspulls to salvage the concurrent plot. The vision is there, and is clearly present at the start, yet it is lost somewhere along the way. \\n\\n\r\nI'll explain my first sentence in a little bit of a detail here, as the story suffers the most from it (possible minor spoilers ahead, so read at your own risk): the author seemed to think that by making it shounen, he couldn't pull out actual heartbreaking moments and instead gives us unsatisfying endings all over the place, overdrawn subplots that end abruptly, and a whole fuckton of asspulls, especially towards the end. If you want an example, think of a climax of Berserk's Golden Age Arc, but instead of playing out as it did, imagine if nobody died - that's NnT in a nutshell. Forming deep bonds that are tempered by death is nigh impossible here because you know no one within the main cast will die. \\n\\n\r\nAnother bad point of the story is the final arc - which in itself drew my initial score of the anime from 7 to 6. It's absurd on so many levels I don't know where to being. As I previously said, aside from the generic villain plotline, a bunch of new random shit is introduced out of nowhere without any prior mention, and even things that were mentioned previously were mentioned maybe 1 episode before that very thing miraculously spawned within the world. Ultimately, what this anime turns into towards the end is literally asspull galore, as a bunch of new and random powers and connections are introduced out of nowhere, numbing down my enjoyment greatly. I can't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it, but it gets cringe-worthy by the last episode, and that's not a feeling your story should invoke. \\n\\n\r\nUltimately, though, I stand by my initial statement: that the anime was ruined simply because of the demographic it was aimed at. It would have served it far better if it held deep and mature story with realistic stakes, fleshed out rules of the world, removing its pointless asspulls completely. I feel that most of the things that were actually resolved via asspulls could have been handled so much better, and that's only using things that were already present in the story. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, anime looks and sounds gorgeous. It's colorful and there's rarely a dull moment in colors. Action varies from good to amazing, and there's enough diversity within the powers of Holy Knights to always showcase something new and amazing. Movements feel fluid and natural, and I was particularly impressed by fist fights in this anime, as they really were able to get my adrenaline going. The designs of the characters, creatures as well as the world are exceptional. They're varied enough for you not to get bored, but you'll still find yourself finding similarities between them. The whole anime is colorful and it never really dulls its own color pallet for the sake of \"artistry\", and that's something I appreciate. \\n\\n\r\nIt's been awhile since I've heard some good soundtrack in anime - surprisingly. The score of NnT is amazing, and definitely one of the high points of the whole thing. Openings and endings were done well, especially the first one, and the whole ambiance within each different zone really captures the feel. When it comes to voice acting, it can be a hit or miss, but for the most part it holds itself up. Another impressive feat here is the array of special effects for each special and not-so-special attack, as they really do vary it up. Sadly, production really is the peak of this anime, so props to A-1 on this one. \\n\\n\r\nWith the huge cast of characters that NnT boasts, it's obvious there's going to be good ones, bad ones and ... well, ugly ones. Elizabeth is your everyday cookie-cutter sheltered princess who goes on a journey and develops \"strength\" to fight for her friends. She seems more like a fodder than an actual character, as very little is actually done with her. In a nutshell, she's your lovely airhead princess with big boobs. \\n\\n\r\nOut of the Seven Deadly Sins (well, Six), I actually enjoyed majority of them - some more than others, Ban probably being the highlight. Unfortunately, aside from Ban, King, Diane and, to a very small extent, Mel, we know very little of who the hell are these people. This is what holds the characters back immensely and it's mainly because the anime focuses far too much on its generic villain subplot and overall theme of \"Holy Knights are actually evil, kyaaaah!\" rather than developing its characters properly. My least favorite of Six is probably Mel, followed closely by Diane. Although Mel really is a badass character when it comes to fighting, he's your masked shounen lead. Sure, he has his moments, but there were far too many times I've wanted to punch him in the head for those moments to overshadow it. \\n\\n\r\nAside from them, there's, as I said, a whole fuckton of side characters, most of which you really don't care for. Quite a large number of them are used mainly as drama fodder and plot devices, so you shouldn't really get your hopes up. \\n\\n\r\nVillain of the series is bad - not as he's bad in the sense of evil, he's just boring. Up until the very end, you have no idea what his motives are - yeah, there are hints \"the start of the Holy War, release this, I gotta drink it to match them etc.\", but they're just boring excuses. He's not charming, he's not interesting, he's even dull looking, and, quite frankly, he's not even badass as the ultimate enemy. His mega move is making some purple shit snow and then gathering it in one spot for like 30 seconds while everyone else around him sits and drools in awe. Good job ye Holy Knights. \\n\\n\r\nI'd lie if I said I didn't enjoy Nanatsu no Taizai. However, I'd also lie if I said I was never bothered by its lackluster story and overabundance of pointless characters that go nowhere. If you exclude last 3-4 episodes, this show would definitely get 7, even bordering 8, however its ending is really, really good example of why you need to have an idea of your ending before you write it, because you can't use asspulls to save your story over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a fun watch, and if you're not a nitpicker like me, you'll probably get far more out of NnT than I did - and even I got plenty.",

You can see subtle and not so subtle glimpses of elements borrowed from animes like Full Metal Alchemist, Fushigi Yugi, Naruto, the list goes on. However, what makes this show so much more enjoyable is the characterization of the Seven Sins. Each one of them is unique in demeanor and even species and while there are your quintessential team idiosyncracies, it never gets too repetitive or too dumb. \r\nThe highlightof the show is, of course, the action. The sequences are not too long, nor too short and the balance between exposition and fighting is great. On the whole, this is the kind of limited series anime that you can binge watch over a weekend, and while you know you haven't seen anything truly spectacular you'll not feel it was a waste of your time either.",

            "content": "I did not plan on watching this anime at all. After discovering the show on Netflix, I decided to watch the first episode because of how bored I was and my brother was annoying the hell out of me so I needed something to watch. Now that I have finished watching the show...... \r\n(There will be SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (7/10) (SPOILERS)\r\nBased on the best-selling manga series of the same name, Nanatsu no Taizai follows the adventures of Elizabeth, the third princess of the Kingdom of Liones, and her search for the Seven Deadly Sins. With their help, she endeavors to not only take backher kingdom from the Holy Knights, but to also seek justice in an unjust world.\\n\\n\r\nI don't watch a lot of Shounen shows because it's purely fighting scenes and lacks dialogue scenes. It seems to appeal to brain dead viewers out there, hence the reason why the big 3 animes are all Shounen. I don't hate the genre, I just don't love it as much as the other genres out there like mystery or psychological animes or whatever. However, there are some Shounen genres out there that I love but I won't mention the show's name. \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" is now one of the Shounen animes that I love and I personally think it's better than most Shounen shows out there. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, \"The Seven Deadly Sin's\" story is....not the greatest. It's fairly generic, to say the least. The first half is just them searching for the members of the Seven Deadly Sins and the second half is \"princess gets kidnapped and she must be saved\". You don't need to be a smart-ass to figure out the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhat you do need is an above-average working brain or maybe an average working brain will do. By the time you reach the second half of the show, you will experience a lot of plot twists. Most of this plot twists are downright ridiculous because to me, it looks like the twists were pulled right out of their ass. From Meliodas being part of the Demon Race to Gilthunder who turns out he was being manipulated by some Holy Knight (forgot her name) and he was actually a good guy all along. There are a lot of plot twists and you need to prepare your brain when that happens. \\n\\n\r\nThe show also contains an insane amount of plot holes. While I was watching the show, I noticed the show's plot holes were piling up but I ignored them because I thought they were all going to get answered by the 2nd half of the show or at the end. Some of them were answered but most of them weren't. For example, Meliodas' \"OverPowered Demon Mode\" which occurs when he's at a disadvantage. This really bothered me because it kept happening to him when he was about to die and I really really wanted to know why this was happening to him in the first place. When a character goes all OP mode, I want to know why it's happening to that character or else it's all just pure bullshit to me. Luckily, the show is going to get a second season next year so I'm willing to forgive the first season's plot holes as long as they answer them in the upcoming second season. \\n\\n\r\nThe show's pacing is somewhat rushed. I mean, this shouldn't be a surprised if you've seen over 2 or 3 A-1 Pictures anime. If you didn't know, A-1 Pictures likes to rush their anime for whatever reason. This is why when I see an A-1 Pictures anime, I think long and hard whether to watch the show or not. Thank God the anime is not rushed, to the point where it will be hard to understand what's going on. \\n\\n\r\nTwo more things that I want to talk about. First, the show's fanservice. What in the bloody f*cking hell is up with A-1 Pictures, along with the author and the fanservice? The protagonist of the show constantly touches, gropes and harasses (not rape) the princess and the princess constantly forgives him like it's nothing. It'd be ok if it was a minor fanservice scene but it's not. It kept happening every episode. It turned from a humour fanservice scene to a distracting fanservice scene. My mom even asked me why I was watching a goddamn kid rape a young adult lady. *sigh* The explanations that I have to come up with just so she can leave me alone.  Anyways. You will notice that the fanservice is almost non-existant in the second half of the show as it switches from light-hearted story to dark and serious tone. \\n\\n\r\nLast thing that I want to talk about will answer the question that you have right now. If you're going to ask me why I rated the show a 8 even though I just mentioned all the flaws then here are my reasons. Firstly, the glorious fight scenes which I will talk about in the \"Animation\" category. Secondly, unlike most shounen shows out there which contains a lot of goddamn fucking fillers, The Seven Deadly Sins contains little to no fillers. When the arc is done, the show moves on to another arc. This prevented me from getting bored at the show. Third and lastly, the characters are surprisingly better than the story itself. I'll talk more about the characters in the \"Characters\" category. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9.3/10)\\n\r\nIf you have seen an A-1 Pictures anime before then you should be familiar with the animation. It's very similar in terms of visual and character designs. However, there is one difference when comparing this show's animation to other A-1 Pictures show's animation. I'm talking about the fight scenes. I'm very surprised at how smooth the fight scenes are and this is coming from the studio who also created Fairy Tail and Sword Art Online. If you have seen those two shows before then you should know that the fight/action scenes in both of those shows weren't that smooth. They were, for the most part, choppy and there were some still animation. In the Seven Deadly Sins, the choppiness is almost non-existent and the still animation barely exists. It's probably because of the year gap but whatever, that doesn't matter.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThe show did not disappoint in the \"Sound\" department. The OST's are f*cking awesome to listen to and the battle themes are glorious. It perfectly fits with the action scenes. I'm now moving on to the OP and ED theme songs because the majority of the score for sound comes from the OP and ED theme. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme songs are \"Netsujou no Spectrum\" by Ikimono-gakari and \"Seven Deadly Sins\" by MAN WITH A MISSION. I'm the probably the only person here who did not like the 1st OP theme song. The singer's voice is annoying as hell. However, I.freaking.LOVE! the 2nd OP theme song. When I first heard the song, I didn't even know the guy was singing mostly in English. The singer's accent is so heavy. After 2 episodes, I fell in love with the 2nd OP theme song. It sounds amazing and the transition from English to Japanese gives me goosebumps. I really really hate Engrish songs *ahem Mirai Nikki OP 2 ahem* but this is one of those Engrish songs that I love. \\n\r\nThe ED theme songs are \"7 -seven-\" by FLOW x GRANRODEO and \"Season\" by Alisa Takigawa. I didn't really like the 1st ED theme song. Maybe because it just didn't fit my taste. The 2nd ED theme song was decent. I don't hate it but I don't love it either. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'll be reviewing the English VA. Most of them sounds great except I have 2 complaints. 1st is Meliodas' voice actor. It's Bryce..f*cking...Papenbrook. Why do companies love to hire this guy? I mean, his voice acting ain't that bad but I'm getting tired of hearing the same voice actor over and over. His role also includes Kirito from SAO, Eren from AOT, Shirou from UBW, Rin from Ao No Exorcist and many more. If you notice, all of the characters he voiced are protagonists from famous shows. That's why he's well known and that's why I'm tired of hearing the same voice. 2nd is the Princess' voice actress. She's not bad but she honestly got annoying after a few episodes with her squeaks and constant moaning (by moaning, I don't mean her sex voice). \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters] (9.5/10)\\n\r\nThe following reasons why I gave this show a 8 despite the generic story is because of the characters. \"The Seven Deadly Sins\" contains one of the best characters for a shounen show. \\n\\n\r\nEach main characters contains one of the best personalities I have ever seen. Their personalities are funny as hell and the interactions between the characters are not something that should be missed. What I also love about the characters is the fact that they don't get ignored once a new arc happens. They're still important and relevant to the story. \\n\\n\r\nEvery main character also receives character development. They all get their own flashbacks so you can understand them better. Even if the character's arc has passed by, they still get some flashbacks in order to explain their current actions. The flashbacks aren't as boring as I thought it would be and they're all very important to watch. \\n\\n\r\nI just want to point out one minor issue and that's Meliodas. To me, he's a Gary Sue. If they bothered explaining how he got the Demon powers and why he has those powers in the first place then I wouldn't even be calling him a Gary Sue right now. It's ridiculous that he's getting out of those inescapable situations every single time. Why do you think this is a minor issue only? Because the show ended inconclusively so it's obvious that there's going to be a second season and I'm very positive that it's going to be answered on the next season. If the show ended right on the 24th episode without explaining the Demon crap then I would have rated this show a lot lower. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to bother introducing the characters because this review is intended for viewers who have already seen the show. Not for people deciding whether they want to watch the show or not. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nDespite the generic storyline, I truly enjoyed this anime. The fighting scenes are eye candy, the characters are hilarious and once they get serious, that's where the characters really shines. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"The Seven Deadly Sins\" is a great shounen anime to watch because of its wonderful and smooth fighting scenes, great soundtrack and great and hilarious characters. It does have its weak points like having a generic storyline, excessive fanservice at the first half of the show and tons of plot holes that is likely going to get filled in the next season. \\n\r\nP.S The show has a generic storyline but in my opinion, it's not that crap like some fans claim. At the end of the day, the show having a crap storyline is for you to decide. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Decent Story\\n\r\n+Great Visuals and Animation\\n\r\n+Smooth Fighting scenes\\n\r\n+Great OST and Battle themes\\n\r\n+Awesome 2nd OP theme song\\n\r\n+Great and Developed Characters\\n\r\n+Tons of Funny Moments in the first half\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Generic Storyline\\n\r\n-Excessive Fanservice\\n\r\n-Tons of Plot Holes\\n\r\n-Inconclusive Ending\\n\r\n-Pacing Issues",

In summary, the anime basically shows great character development with an interesting story. The art and animation is fluid and good for most of the parts but the sound/music is okay, nothing too memorable. However, I felt the opening and ending of the series has always been on point. Moving to the negatives of the anime, Nanantsu no Taizai seems to have a lot of plot holes when watched at first but it mostly addresses the issues somewhere later in the series. Overall, if you like a fast-paced animefilled with action-packed fighting scenes, this anime is a must. Nanantsu no Taiza or The Seven Deadly Sins is the type of anime that will leave you spamming the next episode button and begging for more.",

            "content": "Story: 10 -  While classic in nature, with its princesses, knights, and kingdom takeovers, it's also unique in its own special way. Interesting powers, situations, and creatures. Even though the general plot is actually quite dark, when it's not a moment for heavy emotions, the anime is actually fairly light hearted and comedic. The twists and backstabs are pretty good, if although sometimes predictable, however I was never not entertained.\r\nArt: 9 - I've read around online that many people apparently didn't like this art style, however I actually really enjoyed it. Although I do think it could have been a little bit more polishedin some spots, for the most part, it does its job very well, actions, scenery, and emotions, are all easily conveyed, with appropriate emphasis and impact.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 -  It's usually pretty rare for me to like a full cast of any anime, but I actually really liked all the voices in this show, and the sound effects were pretty good too. Everything suited its purpose, and nothing really felt out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 - The characters I think I enjoyed the most. This is very much a character driven anime, and although not everyone gets a backstory, I hope they continue this trend if the anime is granted a sequel. Each unique character has their own intensely personal and fleshed out personality, and it's so refreshing to not see blatant copy-paste stereotypes for everyone. I really enjoyed all the quirky behaviours and the motivations for each individual regardless of what side of the fight they were on. There is real emotional damage and insecurities for everyone involved, and it all make sense with regard to each characters personality and behaviours, which makes for a very well rounded cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 -  Every moment of the show was a joy to watch, and that's what I love about it. A tell-tale sign of a great anime, is it being able to captivate you at every episode, and once I started watching this show, it was agony waiting and wanting to know what would happen next (even if you already thought you knew where it was going). As well as its emotional impact, I think a good anime also has to hold some kind of weight. If it doesn't mean anything to you, then why should you watch it? I think when an anime has pulled at your heart strings, or your intellectual curiosity, it has done something right.\\n",

Thus it would be better to add 'Ecchi' in the genre description.\r\nThe male protaganist's strength was exaggerated a lot. But i liked his friends. The background history of MC's is not clear. Every time they refer to the incident that occurred 10 years back.\r\nI enjoyed it purely for the adventure they had and even in the opponent team there are good guys. It is different from the shounen anime i have seen sofar only in this context. What i I found in this anime as refreshing is the main concept that when two parties involved in a war doen't mean that they are bad guys; in reality they are  are obliged to fight for their country and are not bad, which  is shown in this anime well.",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai, The Seven Deadly Sins, a shounen action adventure fantasy anime with some comedy. As for the shounen part, it satisfies it completely. Action? There's a lot of it and really awesome fights too. Fantasy and adventure? Yup, you got it. A kingdom with good guys and bad guys. Comedy? Don't even get me started. Loads of laughs in each episode. Characters? All are amazing with unique abilities and personalities.\r\nIt's a really good anime, and it's so enjoyable that I didn't even realize how quickly it ended.\r\nStory 9/10:\r\nThe series follows a single storyline: to gather all the Seven Deadly Sins (SDS) and takeback the kingdom from the Holy Knights (HK). The first half of the anime is dedicated to finding and recruiting all the SDS. The next half of the story is a war between the SDS and HK. The SDS are legendary knights while the HK are not as strong as the SDS but are still in the top ranks of knights of the kingdom, each having their own power.\\n\r\nAlong the story, you get some history lessons of most of the characters, be they a member of the SDS or HK.\\n\r\nThe story progression is really nice. It's not a slow pace and not too fast as to skip some parts. It just goes along nicely and you enjoy it to the full.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10:\\n\r\nWhile some people may disagree, I personally believe this anime perfectly captures the essence of a fantasy land and a shounen anime. Too serious an animation would not give the anime it's comedy and lighthearted feel that it has sometimes. And too bad an animation would make the characters unappealing.\\n\r\nThe character designs are really amazing. In all the anime I've seen, this one has quite a different art style and it's really nice and soothing.\\n\r\nAs for the fights and special powers, they are also well animated. No censorship, which again is a plus point.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nThere are 2 openings and 2 endings. They aren't anything special and not so bad as to regret not skipping them. Though my favorite is the 2nd ending \"Seasons\". \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10:\\n\r\nThe characters truly are amazing. Each member of the SDS has his/her own backstory, personality and power. Though some characters didn't get a backstory but that's also fine, since it doesn't affect the understanding of the story. Aside from the SDS and HK, other characters include the Kingdom's princesses, the King and some village folk.\\n\\n\r\nSome episodes are dedicated to specific characters in order to make the story clear. Histories can be sad and the fights may have feels but that makes them all the better. As for the superpowers, they are out of this world. At first, they all may seem like normal people but once their power starts flowing, it's epic.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are somewhat like you won't hate them all. Even if they are on the bad side, they are pretty cool. And since this is a fantasy anime, some inhuman things are sure to come. Those include Fairies, demons and some other demons human stuff.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10:\\n\r\nI really really enjoyed this anime. So much, that I can watch it again and won't get bored. I started this series when it had completed 15 or something episodes and I watched those 15 episodes in a single run. I was completely glued to the screen once I started the anime. It's really fun to watch. You got some really funny comedy and some pervy stuff too (though not the ecchi pervy kind). But it's really fun to watch. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is complete and it doesn't leave any cliffhangers. But it does hint the start of a new story and therefore the possibility of a sequel. And this anime truly deserves a sequel.",

            "content": "This is my first review so try to judge it with kindness XD \r\nTo the main dish now, Seven Deadly Sins as it\u2019s the alternative name is an addictive anime which it moved from manga to anime some time before. Lacking the experience to comment manga\u2019s plot since I haven\u2019t read it yet, I can\u2019t judge the differences between these two. So, the story is a bit linear at start (as always) but with every episode you discover more and more about different stories and histories, to the point that many of them  come together to one point and I don\u2019t believe it reachedits climax at  the end of the anime. It was just a bite of a great cake.  I believe story wise this anime has much more to offer in the near future(I hope). Now as far as the art is concerned they did a great job making some great scenes, the fights are really good having intensity in almost each attack, focusing to the surroundings not to standing there as dull objects but as parts of the fight. Sound is not the strong aspect of this anime. Do not expect to meet great songs or intensity created by songs and sound alone. Giving a quick thought now I don\u2019t remember a song played in entire anime. Let\u2019s go the strongest hand in this anime. If sound was one pair, characters are full house at least. Every char is unique some of them have a common story, and one of them is just epic.. No I\u2019m not referring the main char but all my credits go to Hawk. When you see the anime you will remember my words.  I really really enjoyed this anime to the point watching it in 2 days and enjoying every single second that passed watching SDS. \\n\r\nSo as an overall score, i say 9 since for me sounds are the drawback in this anime.\\n",

This anime started off very good and seemed like it would've been one of the anime that would stay true to it's source material.\r\nI was a little disappointed when I realized the route it took.\r\nAfter episode 3: rushed pacing, cut scenes, story changing. The Nanatsu no Taizai anime blitzed through over 100 manga chapters and crunched them into only 24 episodes. From a manga, that has a deep story line such as One Piece, which has amazing foreshadowing and and gives just about all of the content shown with it a purpose, nomatter how small. \\n\\n\r\nThough this anime had great animation, art , and overall, caught the essence of the series, it very much disappointed a fan that read the manga before the anime even began. \\n\\n\r\nGowther's story was changed, it cut out Dreyfus' fight that he had with Hendricksen along with his son and skipped an entire two chapters that was characterization of Elizabeth's sister. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, as an anime, yeah, this was a fucking awesome ride, but as an adaption, it was tragic. \\n\\n\r\nBasically, what I'm trying to say by this review is to those of you that haven't read the manga and watched the anime first, read the manga because the anime skipped on a lot of important details that the anime left off on and sped through this decently paced masterpiece. \\n\\n\r\nI give it a 9 as an anime.\\n\r\nBut a 5 or 6 as an adaption.",

I dropped this after 5 episodes because I just couldn't take it.\r\nAs soon as I started to watch this anime, on the first episode, I was able to predict what was going to happen. The characters were predictable and way too cliche (in the bad way) for me. Sure, most animes usually take the first three to five episodes to properly start (they have to introduce us to the world first) but gettingthrough the first five episodes was hard. I sighed loudly, rolled my eyes and cringed almost every minute. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are one of those people who enjoy the same old kind-of-love-triangles and fan-service and way-too-OP male protagonists, and you can just shut your brain off for hours, then sure, watch this anime. \\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I hate this, I just didn't enjoy this at all and don't recommend this.",

I must admit I was VERY skeptical about this anime series since it was being advertised as a Netflix original. I didn't expect a \"Netflix original\" anime to be any good. However, I was beyond surprised. The start of the first episode was a bit iffy. It came off as a very perverted, sexual based kind of show, but towards the end of the episode, I realized I couldn't wait to watch episode two. I really grew to love this series. The characters were so lovable and epic, the storyline wasso interesting and I was always on the edge of my seat. The pervertedness continued, but I strangely grew to love this interaction between the princess and the dragon sin. It was always a good laugh, that's for sure. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves action, romance, and comedy. I truly loved it, and am praying for a season 2!",

Its the pure awesomeness of the characters that I just want more and more of. Meliodas is everything a character aspires to be, and Ban is his darker counterpart. King is incredibly powerful, yet struggles with internal issues of relationships and Diane, Merlin and Escanor are pretty flat tho. We dont really come to see em. Escanor is awesome, buts also relativly flat.\r\nPeople watching this only care about Meliodas,Ban, King and maybe Diane because their pure prowess and internal struggles are so captivating. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the only show I have ever watched subbed (I cant stand watching things subbed. Why would I want to read, when I could hear,) because I simply couldnt wait for the dubbed version. The scale of the plot is epic, with the wars and betrayals beating me up so bad! Is was AWESOME.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is dope, but is only AWESOME when combined with characters. The Art was fine, nothing to scoff at, and the sound as well. The characters were ok, half of them being great, the other half useless, but not bad.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally I love an epic journey of powerful beings reclaiming the world from evil, and so I enjoyed this as one of my fav animes of all time. But overall, it does lack in character and plot at some point.",

            "content": "I am new to this site, but I have watched a wide variety anime over the years, and this is the first time that I have seen an anime with so many plot holes and such a frenetic ending receive so much undeserved appeal and 10 out of 10s (since SAO). What I write does not come from a hipster-like desire to stand against popular opinion, but from my own notes taken while watching the show.\r\nStory -- \r\nThe story has an interesting premise that drew me in at first. This idea that there is this guild of renegade, all powerful knights who were first exiled,but are now needed to combat a greater evil is an idea that I happen to be quite fond of. However, this story gets confused among all the side stories, flashbacks and plot twists used to manufacture tension and build characters during their fights with their rivals. There is one point toward the endgame, where the protagonist spots a plot aspect from what seems like thin air before destroying it, saving \"the girl\" and appeasing his rival (I was befuddled until I watched 3 more times). Another, where a character spawns from nowhere simply for the purpose of interluding to set up the second season. Events like these, for the astute viewer, serve only to muddle the main conflict. However, I will give some credit to this shonen for bothering to show the backstory for characters like King and Guila (although, this makes it more apparent when characters like Jericho don't receive proper background). \\n\r\nThe interweaving of characters is rather interesting, as all characters seem to be connected to others in some way.\\n\r\nALSO, might I add, that there are four instances in which characters escape the inescapable or breech the unbreechable. These frustrate me to no end as it means that tension is truly manufactured in some instances.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -- \\n\r\nThe characters tend to frustrate me, since, although they are Knights of an esteemed order, they seem to lack chemistry in battle until the last battle, behave like pouting teenagers despite all being adults (except for Goat Sin), and they never wear armor in combat, eroding any semblance of their being these legendary knights, especially when compared to other knights in the show. There is little tension in combat, since at least two of the sins are absolutely unkillable and at least three have no clear limit established for their abilities, meaning that they could be even more powerful then they demonstrate when the PLOT needs them to be. Other characters tend to hide their power, some times to a grave fault, as many of the characters have OP abilities that they don't use in some battles, for some reason.\\n\r\nPersonally, Hawk the Pig and Elizabeth are my least favorite characters, as the Pig is trying VERY hard to be funny and Elizabeth is practically a Fairy Tale character with all the crying, name-shouting and power-of-friendship-ing that she does. \\n\r\nThere are some funny characters like Goat Sin and Dragon Sin (early on) that serve to keep the anime light-hearted in spite of all the edgy themes.\\n\r\nThere is some fan service, but it is rare.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound -- \\n\r\nThis is an A-1 pictures production, so both are bog standard. Not amazing, but not terrible. The first OP and the last credits theme are pretty good, not much else sticks out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall -- \\n\r\nFor a shonen, its mostly predictable, with the least developed and most annoying characters(Elizabeth, Hawk, etc.) taking up more time than the more developed and most interesting ones(Gil, Gowther and Jericho). Character designs are erratic (some seem as though they are from entirely different animes, or at least in the wrong time period) and major plot elements are predictable (except for one RIDICULOUS one).\\n\r\nIf you like shonen, you may like it, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it except for a laugh at how ludicrous its final episodes get.\\n\r\nPlease don't believe the hype.\\n\\n",

The acceleration of abilities in this anime is just right, which is rare. I still can't get over how unique these characters are and the MC is great! The MC really carries this anime through his confidence. It's really nice to see an MC who is no joke and will beat your ass. The music andaudio is excellent, but there's not many tunes to get attached to or inspired by. The art doesn't particularly stand out either. There are other series that produce a lot more effort but that doesn't mean sins doesn't have its own style. Other than the uninteresting music score and unspectacular art, sins is simply amazing. All in all, sins is a rush of refreshing characters and adventure! Watch this and you will not regret it.",

We were watching all the episodes in one go which kinda indicates how hooked we were.\r\nThe tension builds up nicely and one reveal is more spectacular than the other. Of course this anime has it's downsides but let's take a closer look at every aspect.\r\nStory: \r\nWhile the first half of the anime feels like a light shonen anime, it smoothely progresses up to the very big showdown. \r\nThe creators of this show understood one thing so many hollywood studios tend to forget. An epic and spectacular fight scene is somewhat useless when it does nothelp to develop a character. Nanatsu no Taizai does everything right here. During the fight you learn a lot about the people who fight, why they fight and how they feel. Prepare for awesome plot twists and revealed secrets.\\n\r\nSometimes a bit cheesy though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Looks nice. A bit too much bubble-gum atmosphere for my personal taste but still good and leaves nothing to bitch about.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Some flaws here. Sometimes the music doesn't fit too well to the scene. Still some nice folk-music in it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThe character development especially during the fights is great. \\n\r\nI didn't like that they introduced the 6th Deadly Sin so late in the series and told the viewer nothing about her while we got to see a lot from the other characters. Maybe that will change in Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nCouldn't stop watching.\\n\r\nA few plot-holes here and there but luckily the show manages to make up for that with it's brilliant character development.\\n\\n",

I am a biy disappointed to find another shounen where the next boss is actually more powerful, and the main character unlocks a whole new level. The typical, trash someone would write if they only planned out the beginning and ending, and fills the story with coincidences so the plot holes are as blaring, but I'm sure most of us can distinguish.\r\nIt would be unfair to say I didn't enjoy this, cause I did, but only the parts where I didn't rollmy eyes. I don't mind copy and paste character tropes, and these characters were unique enough where watching them interact warrants a 20 minute episode, and for once the mascot is likeable from the start.\\n\\n\r\nThere were times when the soundtrack far exceeded what this anime could have ever been, and I was ignorantly excited for what was to come.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is pretty good, and I never really felt like any major storylines from any character was forced. It somehow felt very natural for everyone to end up together. But besides that, there are many, many moments where the coincidences are really too obvious.\\n\\n\r\nSo, all in all: mediocre at best, and watch it if you're in the mood for shounen.",

If you have problems with non-consensual sexual stuff going on, this is one of the things I can't suggest.\r\nThe story is basic \"hide and seek\" platform. Characters set off on a quest to find other people to do a thing! It's pretty trope-y and cliche, but that's some of what's good about it. The way the story plays out had me on the edge of my seat a few times. What I didn't understand were the main male character's lack of facial expressions. It seemed like a problem that got fixedas time went on but when it first started he was groping the main female character's body with a straight-face. She also didn't do anything about. I prefer when the characters react to stuff like that, too. Or maybe it's a \"if I pretend that it didn't happen he'll stop.\" But, it doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nThere were some things that were more inopportune, and out of place. A lot of things with the main male character didn't get explained. More into that, there's no explanation on where all but one character came from. The writing also lacked at some moments, but nothing too hurtful.\\n\\n\r\nSub or dub? Dub.",

From its core, like most other adventure anime, The Seven Deadly Sins is about getting from 1 location to the next, implementing enjoyment into the journey and not one that keeps you guessing for the fate of the ending.\r\nThe characters each have their own personalities as  they all come from different backgrounds and even races, they interact with each other especially well as they have been absent from one another's company for many years, this something I really enjoyed and a big plusfor this anime.\\n\r\nThe music was nothing special, it was nothing memorable or something that stood out above anything else, It served its purpose whilst watching but nothing else.\\n\r\nThe Story is Good (for an adventure anime at least) but nothing that really made me emotionally connected to the world.\\n\r\nOne of the biggest downfalls with Nanatsu no Taizai is one of the main characters Elizabeth, who for the most part did nothing of value and only served as a fan service prop just so it could receive the stamp of Ecchi on its front cover and a cheap tool for the other main character, Meliodas to play with as a love interest.\\n\r\nWhile the Story, Art and Sound was nothing special, the character diversity was enough to get me griped into watching this to the end and my personal love of Adventure Fantasy anime made this extremely enjoyable for me.\\n\r\nI give this anime a 7 outa 10, Above Average and the title of a Good anime.\\n\r\n(Note that my scores are based upon the idea that a 5 out of 10 anime are considered \"Average\" animes)",

            "content": "This action-packed anime has become one of my top 10 favorites within just a few episodes. Let me tell you why you should be watching Nanatsu no Taizai. \r\nStory 9/10- This story is about a group of people that supposedly \"betrayed\" their homeland. The main girl character, Elizabeth, is one of the princess of Liones. She sets out to seek help from the notorious legendary knights to protect her homeland from the Holy Knights. From the first episode to the last episode, there is nonstop action. So if you don't like action stuff then I don't even know what you're doing here.\r\nArt 10/10- From theever famous studio A-1 pictures, the art sure is glorious. I've seen most of the A-1 pictures animes and I think this one is by far the best. I like how they drew Meliodas, instead of portraying him as a [spoiler]3,000 year old male[/spoiler], they portrayed him as a kid. And a perverted one at that too. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10- The music is epic!! I can't stop listening to it after I finished watching the whole thing. I just replayed everything over and over. It is beautiful, as expected of Hiroyuki Sawano. I also liked the opening song. I just didn't like the second one. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10- Meliodas is a great leader, and he is OP as well. Ban is [spoiler]immortal[/spoiler], I didn't really like him that much at first but he's pretty cool with his killing intent. Him and King don't really get along that much though. King, or King Harlequin, he cares deeply for his friends and his sister. Diane, well, she was jealous of Elizabeth at first because of all the attention Meliodas was giving to her, learned to like and befriend Elizabeth. Gowther was kind of useless tbh, and Merlin didn't show up until towards the end. Merlin was pretty cool though, didn't expect Merlin to be girl. Gilthunder is also pretty cool. And who can forget about the talking pig?? He was so cute and loyal!!!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10- I enjoyed this anime a lot, I am so hyped for a season 2!!! I need to see Escanor. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10- This is a really good anime. If you liked Akame ga Kill! or Akatuski no Yona (haven't seen that one but heard it was like Nanatus no Taizai) then you should definitely watch this. Except imo this was so much better than Akame ga Kill. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Rank at time of review: 88th.\r\nMain genres: Adventure, Shounen, Action, Fantasy & Ecchi.\r\nAnime summary - This show was incredibly hard to rate but also very easy to rate and that in some respects actually highlights the strengths and weaknesses in and of itself. Nanatsu no Taizai (The seven deadly sins) is a show that tries to do a little bit of everything and succeeds marvelously whilst also failing to pinpoint any specific emotion from me. I will expand on this concept throughout my review.\r\nStory [7] - The story begins as many others do, a young, beautiful princess with a great big heart and even biggermission. She is looking for the most hated villians in all the land, the seven deadly sins. This shy, loving princess shows up out of nowhere requiring a knight in shining armour to come to her rescue when all of a sudden an incredibly strong (almost invincibly so) young lad shows up and wins her heart over with his undying kindness and spunk. This young lad also turns out to be one of \"the seven deadly sins\" which the princess left her home to find. And here begins their journey, the innocent princess and the young perverted knight go in search of the remaining deadly sins with their companions, a talking cute pink pig and a massive green pig carrying a house. Also, this show is ecchi which explains why the hero of this story is a pervert (I think thats the only reason) Also, its got some pretty hilarious sexual harrassment, so thats a thing. The story is dark, bittersweet, full of tears, love, romance and a lot of action. \\n\\n\r\nArt [7] - The art is a tough one to rate. I can't help but draw a comparison with Soul Eater and Hunter X Hunter. All 3 of these shows are somewhat dark with pretty child-friendly art that grows on you and has genuinely scary moments. They are all extremely unique art-styles and all compliment the shows perfectly. When you get used to the artwork it can take your breath away at times. The one critique I would make of it is sometimes the blood (and trust me, there is plenty of it, this show hasn't been cencored to any large degree) can look fake and lack impact due to it. But this is a minor problem that doesn't take anything away from the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7] - The OP and EP's were pretty mediocre, they didn't really fit the 'vibe' of the show as much as they should have. There were some heart-breaking moments that felt ruined and lacked emotion because the ending song didn't represent the emotions being portrayed by the characters. As for the music actually in the show, I can't complain about any of it. The music created tension before a fight, drew in suspense during it, and broke your heart when something bad happened. You could close your eyes throughout the show and understand what was happening by the tone of the music (if you ignore the OP and EP)\\n\\n\r\nCharacters [9] = This is probably a highlight of the show. I wasn't sure about the cast in the first few episodes, it seemed like a pretty fun show with some cliche characters and I was genuinely confused about how it was ranked so high.. But after around episode 8 I found myself wanting to know more and more about these wonderful new companions. \\n\\n\r\nA big positive was the fact that the characters personalities were in no way linear. They actually developed throughout, big events actually change their personalities and the way they behaved. We see why they are who they are through both heart-breaking and tender monologues about their past and that pain they feel is evident in the way they behave as well. If someone is reading this review who hasn't seen the show and I could get only one point across to them, it is don't give this show up after just a few episodes. Don't ignore it because everything seems too cliche. This show grows. It plants a seed within you in the beginning and that seed slowely grows into your heart until you simply understand why this show is so good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9] - This show is undoubtedly one of the more enjoyable watches in anime. It may not be the most sophisticated anime in the world but it does everything very well. Comedy, action, ecchi, more action, it literally has everything that you could want and combines them really, really well. Like I said, its not a masterpeice and there aren't going to be many people rate this a 10. But there won't be many rate it below a 7 either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall [8] - The seven deadly sins is an anime which is very hard to not enjoy and thats the reason for its rating (88). Not because it blows you away, but because it will suck you in and force you to at least enjoy it a little. This might not seem like a compliment, but it is. Its impossible to impress everyone.. But this show comes dang close and thats incredibly impressive.",

Not just the talking pig (doesn't really affect me but still.) The wait for it... FAN SERVICE! The fact that Meliodas touches Elizabeth on her breasts, arse or w/e really annoys me, same as the fact that every woman is practically naked,  and simply because it's not there for the plot, it's there for the guys that sit at home jerking off to this. I mean I'm not judging haha butthe fact that it's so much fan service just really bothers me. Could've been a great anime. Just wish they would've keep the fan service to a minimum and I probably would've given this anime a 10/10. There's some incredible fights tho. If you're okay with fan service I recommend this if you're into adventure/fighting animes with a great story.\\n\\n\r\n//limpan",

Generally, in shonen anime one to three characters get the lime-light per-say, but in this anime every single sin with exception of gluttony and pride (because one hasn't been around long and the other has yet to appear), has all had plenty of screen time level full of epicness. They even found time for the useless female that follows the main character and the mascot to make epic moves. However, if you'reanything like me you'll see then ending as a bit of a cop out, but the anime will hopefully continue as the manga has. The cop-out brought my enjoyment to a 9, but every other category remains 10/10.\\n",

Of course it starts out with the generic cliches of characters but after the first impression you realize that these are not your normal cliches that are over used and annoying to watch. Whether it's good or bad events that happen to the characters, they develop onward damn near instantly and are in now way stunted. \r\nThe bad guys are not just the good guys, the good guys arenot just the bad guys in disguise. The entire world, it's history, the monsters/races are tastefully used and it cultivates mystic that makes you wonder just what else is roaming in the world. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no beating around the bush with story or character development. Instead they start you off with what you think is the classic cliche personality and immediately they take off and plow through all of the annoying malarky that's commonly used and dragged out throughout the series. They don't over dramatize the characters or their relationships which makes for a far more 'realist' feel on the world, the character's reactions and and the events that take place which shape the characters.",

            "content": "So I watched this show after knowing that the manga was the best-selling manga for the first-half of 2015 dethroning the big ones like One Piece and Attack on Titan. I picked up this show to know on what the hype was all about. \r\n\"The Seven Deadly Sins\" - hearing this makes me think that the main characters are villains, but they aren't. I mean, I am pretty sure The Seven Deadly Sins of FMA (One of my favorite anime out there) were villains, but this anime doesn't portray them as villains. Apparently, The Seven Deadly Sins have been set up by someone on thekingdom that they're going to overthrow the kingdom. The truth is, they aren't. One girl named Elizabeth, is on a journey to find the Seven Deadly Sins to take back her kingdom. This... is actually nothing new, but I do feel like the story was executed very well. It was written creatively. The story is on-point and it doesn't rumble. Not to mention, it's properly paced. The ending wasn't really that bitter. It was rather the best way to leave the show hanging and wait for Season 2. Though, it does give us a teaser on what's next in the future.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to A-1 Pictures in terms of animations in action-packed anime, I don't expect a lot. I do feel like they're very inconsistent. Take a look at Fairy Tail. It's choreography when it comes to fight scenes are mostly poor. Well, if long-running anime isn't the case, take a look at SAO. The anime had it's moments in animation, but it doesn't keep up. So what did I think of the animation in Nanatsu no Taizai? Well, it's actually good. Though, there are so many moments on this show where it could have been animated better; where it could have been choreographed better. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Nanatsu no Taizai reminds me of Fairy Tail. Though for me, IN TERMS OF SOUNDTRACK (Not the whole anime), it's soundtrack is not on par with FT. FT's soundtrack is better. The soundtrack totally feels like you're in the Middle Age of Europe. For the openings, well, OP 2 is better than OP 1 and I think most can agree. OP 1 is pretty light, though, I wasn't really feeling the song. She sang one of the best Naruto Shippuuden OPs (Blue Bird and Hotaru no Hikari), but this one just seem a little off. OP 2 was like, REALLY GOOD. MAN WITH A MISSION is really a great band. For the EDs, both ED 1 and ED 2 was good. I cannot pick.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Nanatsu no Taizai are good. They're very entertaining at times. However, the characterization and the portrayal somewhat confuses me at times. These are the Seven Deadly Sins, yet they don't really portray their sins a lot. Sure, Diane showcased her envy side; Meliodas showcased his wrath side, but it's not like they show it all the time. Characters like Elizabeth seems to be your ordinary girl main character of a Shonen anime. You know, where they're so weak, but then shines at the later part, then you came to realize that she's actually a badass (Sakura from Naruto, Lucy from FT). Though, Elizabeth seems to be at the \"shines at the later part\". I don't think she's a \"badass\" (yet). I am not hating alright. So far, they're enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of enjoyable, I did enjoy the show a lot, but what puts me off is the humor it offers. There are some humor of this show that doesn't make me laugh at all especially Hawk's humor and Meliodas touching boobies - it doesn't make me laugh, but I don't hate the show for it. What made this show great is simply the storyline. I thought it was epic and it really gave me a ride.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 7.6/10",

            "content": "If you can look past all its flaws, the Seven Deadly Sins is very enjoyable show. \r\nMany people criticize the show for its dues ex machina plot. I would agree to a certain extent. Many of these devices are used near the very the end of the show, specifically the last two episodes. Fortunately there is a little backup for each d.e.m. used so it doesn't feel completely ridiculous. See the story loves to put these little hints throughout the entirety of the story to explain the ending. Then, they show all these \"hints\" in a quick flash to make you feel like itsjustified. Most of the time there is no explanation. It just is and you have to accept it.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the show excels at showcasing vibrant characters. This is by far the best part of the show. There is such an uniqueness found in each and every one of the characters. You fall in love with all of the personalities as they clash and bond. The show will have you laughing at just how ridiculous each person is.  This is the height of the show. Many times you will question their decisions but you will never question their person. \\n\\n\r\nThe art, like the characters, is very vibrant. Flashy and colorful, it catches the eye. The animation felt very similar to Magi. It's no wonder the show was made by the same studio. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is decent. Good themes come in at the right time and I get my excitement going but it definitely doesn't blow me away.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, this show has a identity crisis. It is constantly not taking itself seriously with slapstick humor but it tries to be serious with demons, murder, and pure evil. Its very good at the humor but not so good at the evil. The middle of the show is the creme of the crop while the beginning and end leave something to be desired. By the end, I think you won't think this show is very good, but you will have enjoyed the hell out of it along the way.",

This is one of those series where since episode 5 you're checking which episode you're on, hoping there's plenty more to go.\r\nStory -Despite being an anime, the depth of the plot and background is comparable to Tolkien. The meticulous unravelling of past events and ancient lore is nothing short of a masterpiece. Prepare to get sucked into a world that leaves you yearning for more after each episode.\r\nArt/sound - Art perfectly suits the series' fantasy setting along with its brilliant aptitude for adding the right amount of humor in every episode.\r\nCharacter - This is where the seriesshines. You'd expect the characters to run dull after hearing of 7 (yes, SEVEN) main characters along with a horde of side characters. However, every character brings a perfect balance of individuality and uniqueness without hogging precious screen time. The characters are also introduced in a spectacular fashion; where you know its coming, but you're just waiting to see how it unravels. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Although there are some plot holes and inconsistencies with the strength of characters, lore, reasoning, the show was incredibly enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "I suggest you watch this anime on Netflix with the HD turned ON. \r\nThe story is a typical shounen format... you have your main cast, a princess who finds this pervy kid (who's actually really old, really powerful former knight who has a bounty on his head for treason), and they go on this journey to find their friends to help them fight and save the kingdom. Nothing new, uses a bunch of things we have seen before in other stories (7 sins, short main character with blonde hair, magical weapons that harness their users powers, fairies, demons, etc etc), but it sure is entertainingwhen you get to watching it. However, I do feel like 25 episodes is a bit short and there was barely any story development since the series seemed to focus more on telling the stories of the characters. If you like legends of medieval England, you'll probably like this anime because of the similarity in the setting, magical element, and characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is awesome. The colors are very bright, almost felt like I was watching Hunter X Hunter (2011) and the quality is excellent. The background music will make you feel like you are taking a trip to Stonehenge and watching a jousting match in Camelot. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters I think are the best part of this anime. The seven deadly sins themselves are interesting to try to analyze and watch as the story develops. They are also quite interesting and are not what you would expect given their titles and their roles as knights. You have Meliodas, who although is \"Wrath\" is actually a pretty pleasant, friendly, and caring guy who rarely gets mad. You start to have all these questions for the other \"sins\" throughout the story and try to figure out why they got those titles. Elizabeth, who initially I initially disliked since she seemed like she was the epitomy of \"useless, pretty, female character in a shonen who only works as a love interest\" tries throughout the whole series to make something of herself, for her friends and the kingdom she cares about.  The side characters get a lot of screentime as well and you get to know them and their motives. There is also a talking pig. You HAVE to watch it for the talking pig. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, although the story is not AMAZING (I mean...what can you really do for an ongoing shonen series in 24 episodes?), the characters themselves drive the series make it truly enjoyable to watch despite its flaws. Give it a try and don't forget to watch it in HD!",

            "content": "The Seven Deadly Sins (TSDS to save space from here on) is a work created by the studio A-1 Pictures, a studio known for their lackluster shows, and unfortunately, TSDS is no different.\r\nStory\r\nThe story is as basic as it gets, kingdom gets taken over by evil corrupt organization and group of adventurers team up to save the day. Nothing special, but nothing terrible in the setup. How said setup is executed is where the problem lies. Since one of the main characters we primarily see the story unfold around brings nothing to the table and has nothing to do with the story other than beingobvious waifu-bait there\u2019s a large disconnect with the actual heroes\u2019 perspective and her own, we often just see her crying over everything when that time could be better allocated to fleshing out better fight scenes or developing the actual characters who matter. What we get for this trade-off is a stunning lack of establishing shot for villains, explanations for whatever ass-pull the heroes just used, or time to enhance the fights. Villains often just show up out of the blue with no indication they were even in the area of our heroes, they do something mean, fight the heroes and show how weak the heroes are in comparison, and then the heroes decide to actually start trying and wipe the floor with them. Heroes and Villians often just bring out the super-ultra-hidden technique that they\u2019ve been saving for just his moment that we had no idea that they could use to instantly win or be completely shrugged off by their opponent's super-ultra-hidden technique.  There\u2019s never any tension that the heroes are ever in any danger so you just become null to all the explosions and vicious stabbing they are being dealt because you can be sure they start walking it off in no time because the plot never has the timetable to sit still and have a break because we have to have one of our characters cry all the time. At some point, the story decides it needs to start wrapping this up so a character just teleports to a location they had no idea the heroes were and kidnaps one of them so the team has a reason to head over to capital to defeat the big baddie and save the kingdom. It feels like the plot had little planning.\\n\\n\r\nMagic System\\n\r\nThis being a fantasy show set in a world where anyone can use magic an explanation to how the magic works in this world is needed, sadly the show never gives us one and this results in characters being able to do whatever they please when the plot demands it and having certain characters being leagues stronger than others because of their immense power, but it\u2019s never explained what this power is and we can never get a gauge of how strong certain characters are in relation to others before a fight. How strong is Meliodas in comparison to random villain #3? You never know, especially since our characters are often just messing around and not even trying until someone much weaker gets hurt because they refuse to try. What determines characters abilities is never explained either they just start using abilities we didn\u2019t have privy to beforehand and it\u2019s never clear why they can\u2019t use other abilities they\u2019ve seen before. What multiplies this problem later on in the series is that there are characters that specialize in magic called mages, but what is the extent of their abilities? You guessed it, you never know, and the explanation used for anything that can\u2019t be explained is\u201cIt\u2019s magic.\u201d Lazy storytelling 101\\n\\n\r\nFights\\n\r\nThe fights are brief and riddled with power levels you are never sure of. All the characters are capable of destroying mountains if they wanted to and able to take hits that could do so regularly and keep fighting. There\u2019s never clear indication if the damage the characters are taking matters. There are characters who are actually immortal, but it\u2019s clear early on that none of the characters are ever in any real danger and as such, there\u2019s never any tension in any of the fights, and a fight without tension is a fight that is boring. A fun fight needs two things, mechanics, and narrative. The mechanics of a fight is the fight itself, fight choreography, the various fighting styles, the weapons used, physical skill, etc. This is essential to keep the audience engaged in the action, and battle shounen should have a solid foundation established in the first few episodes, preferably the first one, however, TSDS fails in this respect because the characters are so ridiculously overpowered that there is never a moment of understanding of what makes these characters so strong since if they just decide to win, they do. The mechanics of a fight is nothing without the underlying context of the narrative behind it. There is a simple narrative in the fights of TSDS, but it never goes far enough for the audience to care for the battles themselves. You\u2019re never sure of who the underdog in each fight is, if the opponents are equal, or if the fight is with a true villain or someone being manipulated by someone else. The heroes often just see the fights as bothersome and severely underestimate their opponents, giving them the upper hand, only to immediately get destroyed when the heroes get angry. The fights in this battle show are pretty lackluster, fast, and add little value to the overall narrative.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThis being an A-1 Pictures show you can expect them to shell out the budget needed to make TSDS feel consistent in theme and tone. Nothing ever feels out of place and the fights, while short, never looked like they were running out of money to animate. It\u2019s a solid look for the show that they\u2019re trying to create.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nAnother category A-1 Pictures often delivers is in the soundtrack that we hear throughout the story. I\u2019m happy to report that they do so in this show as well and when the drama needs a tear-jerker or we need the epicness to crank up to eleven the soundtrack can turn a bland scene into a memorable one. By itself the soundtrack is great and it feels appropriate for the show. The opening and ending themes are worthy of the praise they get and can definitely be added among the greats.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe characters are how we see the story presented and as I mentioned before in the story section there is a major problem with one of them in particular, Elizabeth, chief among them is that she has no purpose. If you took her out of the story not only would you save a large amount of time that could be used to improve the overall show you wouldn\u2019t lose much in the plot. Just have Meliodas journey around looking for TSDS from the start while working and gradually feel as though he has to do something about The Holy Knights and their cruelty would be natural and flow better with the story. She\u2019s just there so people can project her as their princess in distress. Meliodas, captain of TSDS has his flaws, and two of them really hurt the experience, one is he\u2019s a sexual assaulter, I\u2019m not even making it up, he does it regularly for what I assume is supposed to be humor for the show but in reality is just kinda scary, at one point when a consenting girl ask him why he doesn\u2019t do it to her, he responds \u201cIt\u2019s no fun if you want it.\u201d Another problem is his inability to take his opponents seriously, since he knows he\u2019s ridiculously overpowered he often destroys the mood the show is trying to established by pointing out that he\u2019s not even concerned that the villains are there with a nonchalant one-liner, and he does this all the time, many times in a single fight usually. The other characters all have their problems too, but nothing on the same magnitude of the main two. We often get flashbacks of our characters so we can know their backstory and motivations, and most of these flashbacks are done well enough, but nothing in the present is ever as tense as the moment in the past and this is because there is actual loss or risk of loss in the flashbacks. The characters are just so badass that the only way that they can be in any danger is if they are doing something stupid on purpose.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nGetting through this show was a real chore. The biggest problem is it\u2019s just boring I think I have hammered home that the show has zero tension and because of this, it lacks any weight. I know the show is rather popular and I tried to understand the appeal while watching it, but the only value is as a time waster to have in the background. I\u2019d give the show an overall score of 2/10. It\u2019s not worth watching for anyone.\\n\\n",

Not sure if that says something about the show or that says something about me haha. I think this is the kind of show that I would have loved as a kid but now with a more jaded view on things I see a lot of flaws that I wouldn't have before. I should probably also note that I'm a big medieval/fantasy fan so there is some genre bias here. Let's first start with the..\r\nStory (7/10) - slight spoilers!\r\nI grapple with this one quite a bit.This show is one step away from being predictable at every turn. The \"twists\" are all fairly common. However, I'm still interested in the big pictures. I also like the attention to detail (such as the red-eye raven following Gilthunder around paying off later in the show). I also enjoy the sprinkling of flashbacks that we get about the characters past (Diane and King's time together, events ten years prior) that explains their motivation. Overall the story-telling is not bad and this is one of the main reasons why I will be watching the next season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (6/10) \\n\r\nWhile the story itself is pretty engaging for me, the characters are meh. All the characters are fairly boring except for Ban (a sentiment echoed by many here). Character progression was non-existent in the current timeline. As mentioned before though I did like how all of the characters had their motives at least somewhat explained. This isn't true for everyone but true for enough members of the main casts that I felt like it deserved a shout-out. \\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10)\\n\r\nAverage, not memorable. I liked the second ending but that's about it.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10)\\n\r\nSome of the abilities were pretty cool. I really enjoyed the animation for Chastiefol (sp?) as well as some of the Holy Knights abilities (Howzer, Gilthunder). The fight scenes were good. The fanservice was good (sorry I'm easy). I wish they tried harder with some of the effects though (Hendrickson in Grey Demon mode shot these shoddy looking black balls that didn't do anything for me, perhaps just a result of the color choices)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Closing Remarks (7/10)\\n\r\nI don't know how to rate this category so this ended up being the same rating as my overall score for the show. Overall I recognize that this isn't the best show out there but there are enough elements of action/story to keep me interested. Looking forward to the next season!",

            "content": "When I first saw The Seven Deadly Sins, I downloaded as a quick crappy shonen anime to watch while I multitasked on the side. I was pleasantly surprised.\r\nIts no Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, but it doesn't have to be. It's fun and entertaining to the point that I was watching it full window, freaking shocked on how it was actually, GOOD.\r\nStory: \r\nThe plot is maybe one of the weakest aspects of the show, but it still is strong enough to be entertaining. Though the lore of the land is never explained, I enjoy when they don't go out of their way to over explain, because ittakes away from the flow of the story and seems forced when there are lengthy explanations of boring backstory. It was cliche and sort of silly, but it was enjoyable. Not all anime need a FMA level of backstory.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI found the art very pleasing to look at, and didn't see any big errors on my first run through. All the characters seemed to move in different ways and were very expressive. This anime does have a case of the \"Everyone is pretty or hot expect bad guys or old people\" but the designs were very varied so I didn't have any problem with it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI enjoyed the opening theme enough to sit through it and the ED was good enough. The soundtrack was pretty generic but I didn't really notice a lot of obvious repeats so I was fine with it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nElizabeth is a pile of useless shit, but, while being sort of obnoxious, it is amusing to see her get groped by Meliodas with no repercussions (And I'm a anime boy loving girl.) Elizabeth is a classic useless anime girl, but she doesn't annoy me by being all tsundere so points to that.\\n\\n\r\nMeliodas is a OP, edgy protagonist but he somehow is his own character. Kaji Yuki as is VA does a great job being sort of carefree but a tad bit edgy. There isn't much to his character, but he is amusing and not the worst MC to follow (Fucking Charlotte and all it's shittyness) \\n\\n\r\nBan, Diane and King are all good and serve their purpose. Ban's VA also voiced Makato in Free! which amuses me to no end. \\n\\n\r\nNothing magical, but there all pretty good characters (expect Hawk, fuck Hawk)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the blatant ecchi aspect of the show and the action was engaging, I would say I liked it and will be looking out for the next season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIf you like classic anime action, some tits, and cute boys (Yeah, you got me, I was here for Meliodas' character design. He's a shota MC, you don't see that a lot.) Your going to like this anime.\\n\\n\r\nIt's harmless for the most part and kept me interested (Something a lot of anime seem to not be able to do. I'm looking at you Blue Exorcist/Charlotte/SAO)  \\n\\n\r\nGive it a watch~",

            "content": "[MILD SPOILERS]\r\nNanatsu No Taizai Season 1 is solely dedicated to explaining the backstory of each of the characters, including the ones that turn bad.\r\nIt however still provides alot of action and comedy, being a funny Shonen.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nThe story talks about 7 beings whom were the strongest and cruelest order of Holy Knights in the Kingdom of Liones. They were formed by seven brutal criminals, who had all been convicted for grievous crimes and had carved the symbols of seven beasts onto their bodies. After having been framed for murdering the Great Holy Knight, they were indefinitely disbanded, as well as branded as traitors and villains.They are the main protagonists of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe captain, Meliodas the Sin of Wrath is not your average captain in Shonen anime.\\n\\n\r\nHe is extremely overpowered and can probably one shot any holy knight but... He has a limit to his ability and when faced with a tough opponent like his teammate Ban the Sin of greed, can still take alot of damage.\\n\\n\r\nIn season 1, the story goes about explaining Ban's backstory in detail.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what I found interesting was that the members of the Sins somehow had interlinked backstories and the writer used Ban's story to link up to another character, so on and so forth.\\n\\n\r\nEach of the character are extremely powerful but not to the Saitama extent, the writer draws a clear boundary between the weak and the strong.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I enjoyed very much was the comedy in this anime and not to mention the well developed backstories and of course the fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story provides an action filled plot and not one episode goes by without an awesome fight scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe story shows Meliodas and a girl, Princess Elizabeth gathering up the old Sins to fight against the Great Holy Knights whom were said to be the strongest knights in Britiana.\\n\\n\r\nThe show then slowly reveals snippets of Meliodas's backstory, although not entirely but enough to last us through season 1.\\n\\n\r\nMeliodas slowly gathered up MOST OF the members with some left out, most likely to be included in season 2.\\n\\n\r\nThe story overall was pretty well developed and well done. It thoroughly went through with most of the main character's backstory and not to mention the OVAs being made to further emphasize on certain backstories and give us a better understanding on why some characters hate each other etc.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\nBeing an A-1 film, I have no complaints with the artstyle.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI really do enjoy the music used in the anime, it fits the theme correctly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI highly recommend this anime",

            "content": "Sometimes hype is justifiable, sometimes not. Nanatsu no Taizai (or Seven Deadly Sins in the west) is one of the cases of the second group. And I will explain why\r\nStory - 3/10\r\nAlthough the history keeps the spectator curious to know who are the terrible Seven Deadly Sins (with desapointing results) what they've really done and why are people blaming than to the catastophre that happened in the past, the anime doesn't show us nothing new. Is a terrible oldfashined poor screenwriting, with loads of deus ex machina, overpowerd characters that you know will always win, predictable action blended with comedy and a childish plot. Alsoit has terrible sexist ecchi scenes between Meliodas and Elizabeth that are revolting and unnecessary. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters- 1/10\\n\\n\r\nBy far the worst part of the show. All characters are ridicoulously bad developed, have the most idiotic aspirations and do not change from the begining to the end. The one most ridicoulous, in fact, is Elizabeth, one of the most despicable representations of a woman on screen. It was not good just show her as the danzel in distress, she is a totaly dumbass in distress, something rooted on the old american movies and series, not accetable in the XXI century as feminine representation. Even more in the japanese animation, that has a powerfull background of great femine characters. Meliodas is also despicaple, just an overpowerd perv withouth a developed personality. The villain is just the common bad guy and the other sins, well, plain as a pizza, and, for that, a great desapointment. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 3/10\\n\r\nThe character design is just lame, is even not crative. Is a rip off of a series of 80s anime and manga. Also the art looks like something from 20 years ago, with simple backgrounds and a excessive use of bright colors. \\n\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\r\nThe only thing remarcable in the show, the soundtrack is very good and blends modern with classic perfectly. The ops. and endings are pretty decent too, however, are not remarcable at all. The sound efects are oldfashioned, but as the show is all oldfashioned, that is the minor problem. \\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment and Overall\\n\\n\r\nNanatsu was to me the forgetable anime that televion stations positioned between memorable shows such as Digimon Adventure, Dragon Ball or Cardcaptor Sakura to mantain the kids tuned and therefore earn more money from sponsorships. Well, if it was not by the sexist ecchi. It's a lame, childish anime, oldfashined in the wrong way, with tem most simplistic plot and characters. So, why it is such a phenomenon in the anime community? Why is the most popular anime of 2014? Are people this nostalgic about the old times that even the bad nostalgic show is a sucess? I really cannot understand. But, as being born and raised in the 90's and early 2000's, Nanatsu would not be the success it is today if was launched in that time.",

            "content": "Very good so far, the art is reminiscent of the original Dragon Ball series but also brings a vibrant display of combat to the mix. The story flows very fluently through the episodes with very little filler. Each episode leaves you waiting for the next but the show ends a bit to abruptly and the extra 4 ova's bring little other than questions to the plot. It still leaves me excited for the second season. \r\nTo expand on the TLDR version:\r\n1. Story:\r\nThe story only receives a 7 for me because, albeit good, it is predictable. Although that does not stop the overall action and buildup that the show is able to produce. \\n\\n\r\n2. Art:\\n\r\nNothing more to really add here then from my short form explanation. The show gave me a nostalgic feeling of being a kid waiting for the next episode of dragon ball to come on. \\n\\n\r\n3. Sound:\\n\r\nThe sound and music did not do anything special but was good at key points of the story. Only really adding to the fight scenes but occasionally giving me chills of anticipation for a fight. \\n\\n\r\n4. Character:\\n\r\nCharacter build up and writing are executed very well. Although the same goes for the characters as the story, by being predictable, it still is thrilling to watch as the characters interact and build their character. \\n\\n\r\n5. Enjoyment:\\n\r\nFor me, the enjoyment of this show really shines in the battles. This show is able to skip the 'building' phase that cripples some other similar shows. The characters are instantly shown as powerful, and this is able to lead to some very great fights not only at the end of the season but at the very first couple of episodes. \\n\\n\r\n6. Overall this show really encapsulates what it means to be a shonen anime. It really shines in its battles and combat scenes. 7/10",

I was not really fan of the face of Meliodas, the round nose, it looks like a 90's shounen, and I couldn't think about anything else. Also some of the armors are gross AF.\r\nSound - 8 : gound songs, ambiance music and sounds didn't hurt my ears, so it's cool !\r\nCharacter - 6 : This is were it starts to hurt. The characters are interesting ! You have a giant, a fairy king, a demon boy, an immortal, etc... But due tothe format, you don't have any clue on who are those people ! I can't even tell you who is the main character ! We know shit on King, Ban and Diane a bit (and we don't even know why she's alone). Meliodas gets no exposition, same for Gowther, and my favorite is the seven's sin, whose name is told twice in 24 episodes. And I can't even remember it ! I would love to know why is Meliodas demon (or part demon, I don't know), where does Ellie gets her powers, and who the f*ck is Gowther.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4 : Same here, the 24 episodes killed it. The end of the story is rushed, we don't get to know why is there a second demon under the castle, we don't know why Ellie can use Deus Ex Machina god-like powers, and it goes on. So many questions ! It's so frustrating, even the characters kept asking at the end \"Is this really over?\". Well I hope not. I need some explanations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6 \\n\r\nOverall - 4 \\n\r\nThe rating seems bad, but I actually enjoyed 90% of the anime, I was just so disappointed to get to episode 24 without knowing shit about what the hell is happening to those people I barely know. \\n\\n\r\nLove you.",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai, or The Seven Deadly Sins was a very good anime that I will probably keep in my mind for some time. The plot is simple, and develops greatly throughout the story. It kept me wanting to watch more after each episode, which allowed me to finish this anime is about two days.\r\nStory-10\r\nThe story of Nanatsu no Taizai will always be somewhere in the back of my mind, because it was amazing. The concept of the story was a bit generic at first, but definitely develops throughout all 24 episodes. Elizabeth's reason for requesting help was very reasonable and after meeting every Sin,the plot would develop a little bit more. Small little things that were hinted at become a large part many episodes later, which was one of the best things about this anime (in my opinion of course).\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art for this anime was very good, but due to my personal preference, I didn't enjoy it as much as others. The main characters' art was great but it seemed like the other characters were a bit neglected. They looked like they just took the build from another character, and changed the hair color or the eyes or something like that. \\n\\n\r\nSound-10\\n\r\nI absolutely loved the anime opening and endings. The OST during the fights were also amazing and perfectly fit the setting. This anime's soundtrack was one of my favorite. I'm a fan of faster paced songs with good rhythm and a nice tune. Both the opening and the ending exceeded that criteria. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-7\\n\r\nFirst, let me just say this. Ban, King, and Meliodas had a great character as well as development during the anime. Ban's past strengthened his chartcter development as well as King's. King's tearjerking past helped him become the way he is now. Although Meliodas's past is more mysterious than the other, it made sense even without further explanation. On the other hand, Diane, Elizabeth, Gowther, and Melin's past (which wasn't even shown) were thrown together. Also, we never met the seventh sin :/. Now, lets get to the point here. Elizabeth. It looked like the author was desperately trying to make Elizabeth look useful at the end when she unleashed her \"true power\". It felt a bit too pushy to me and didn't glide into the story well. The last complaint I have about the characters is:if someone dies, they should stay dead unless there is a big explanation for their revival.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-9\\n\r\nThe anime was pretty good and put its action scenes in the right spot. The flashy battle scenes were my favorite type because of the fast paced action and the accompanying music in the background. Ban and King stood out to me as characters which made the anime stand out even more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall-8\\n\r\nThe anime had its ups and downs but overall, it was very good. If it wasn't for Elizabeth, who was poorly portrayed in the anime (in my opinion), the anime would have gotten a higher score. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading this, my reviews are really biased... Sorry :P",

But the series does quite a bit to buck many of the typical cliches of many shounen action titles as the series focuses on Meliodas trying to find the old members of his group while protecting the princess of Leones, Elizabeth, from the corrupt Holy Knights.\r\nThe major thing that sticks out with Seven Deadly Sins is the careful balance it delivers with storytelling and action. Many shounen action titles get in the bad habit of focusing too much on their actionat the expense of exploring whatever fantastical worlds they offer up. Here in Seven Deadly Sins though, the series offers a good deal of exploration on its fantasy-medieval style world with several fantasy-based beings like fairies, giants, and demons making their presence felt in the series. It also devotes time to fleshing out a good deal of elements to its plot that revolve around character connections, story elements that become relevant in later episodes, and provide hints with the true motives and/or capabilities of certain characters. Many characters get a good deal of fleshing out or dimension that allow many to be more than whatever typical character type of the shounen genre they would be tacked on with, from those involved with the Seven Deadly Sins to some of the villains they confront among the Holy Knights.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say that everything is perfect with Seven Deadly Sins. As a lead character, Meliodas can seem a bit too carefree and well-adjusted at many points with his response to serious situations and his frequent sexual harassment of Elizabeth is out of place and irked me with his character at points. It does take the series several episodes to start picking up steam with its storytelling as it otherwise sports the typical feel of a shounen action anime at that point, something that could turn away first-time viewers of the series as I went through. Biggest of all though, the series has several big plot threads it leaves unresolved in spite of resolving its major plot arc with the threat of the Holy Knights. Details such as the origins of Meliodas, Elizabeth's role in the bigger scheme of things, and the location of the seventh member of the Deadly Sins are left unresolved for later anime in the series to focus on.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to presentation, Seven Deadly Sins is a mixed bag. The show appears to attempt trying to mix a cartoonish style for a number of its character designs a la One Piece, particularly with some of the armor designs for those among the Holy Knights. While unique, a number of them look ridiculous and clash badly with the anime's more serious scenes. Otherwise, other character designs are a bit on the plain side with nothing remarkable or unique and scenery designs are inspired from European medieval settings as typical of medieval fantasy based anime. While the show's animation is also nothing too impressive, battle choreography is mostly solid with a number of the unique physical and magical abilities that characters show off.\\n\\n\r\nThe show's soundtrack makes for the more better piece of its presentation, sporting a nice symphonic score for insert tracks that becomes more moody and dramatic for later episodes, which is quite fitting for the second half's more serious developments. The energetic openers and mild-sounding closer songs are solid as well.\\n\\n\r\nStill in spite of its faults, Seven Deadly Sins is mostly a solid entry in the shounen action genre that offers a nice balance of storytelling and action that is effective enough to have viewers care for its characters and avoid many of the typical pitfalls that titles of the genre can fall into. If you can get pass its first several unimpressive episodes, you will find a surprisingly engaging story that could keep you hooked to the anime's very end.",

            "content": "I have never thought that The Seven Deadly Sins would be presented in a very stylish and badass way. All of us learned this, right? Makes me remind of my Religion class before in High School where we used to study about it.\r\nFor beginners, Nanatsu no Taizai may appear just another shounen-type anime out there, but what makes it standout is the battle scenes, the foreshadowing (although it's not used too much in the series, but the manga has an assload of it) and the entertainment value. For someone like me who reads the manga, I can say that everything is better when animated. Butif you're like me who reads the manga, you probably felt a little disappointed for A-1 Pictures in removing certain important keypoints that quite messed up the series. So if you're an anime-only watcher, you'll never know how upset I am (but just a bit).\\n\\n\r\nBut if I were to ignore that fact, this series is really a blast. It's like something I have never seen before in a series. I last felt this when I was watching Soul Eater. The impact is there... only a little more intense. 24 episodes is just not enough, but I understand because it has came close to the latest chapters of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nI just so love this series I have to write a review for it. This may be quite long, but I'll appreciate it if you read it till the very end.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The infamous group of knights called The Seven Deadly Sins was framed for a crime they didn't committed. This caused them to scatter all across the country. Elizabeth, the Third Princess of Liones, decided to find The Seven Deadly Sins for the purpose of seeking their help to save Liones from an upcoming war. During her journey, he meets a bar owner named Meliodas, alongside his assistant, Hawk, which is technically a talking pig. When one of the Kingdom's Holy Knight came in to retrieve Elizabeth, Meliodas saves her and is revealed to be the captain of The Seven Deadly Sins, which he represents the Dragon's Sin of Wrath. Upon his revelation, he agreed to Elizabeth to find the remaining Sins. And thus begins an epic journey.\\n\\n\r\nThe story may appear cliche, but it has it's own uniqueness. It's like... reimagining and recreating the plot for a new and more wholesome storyline. I thus give it a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.9/10, Why did I say so? If you have a keen eye for animation dirt, you can probably spot multiple dirt during the course of the series, but the epic battle scenes and awesome special effects makes up for it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I just got to love every BGM used to the series because it all fits perfectly on every scene. I also have to mention the OP and ED's used. Ikimonogakari did a great job is delivering the first OP, \"Netsujou no Spectrum\" while I experienced LSS on the ED, which is a collaboration of 2 of my most favorite JRock groups, FLOW and GRANRODEO! They did justice to \"7-seven\"! Meanwhile, I cannot deny I was stuck in LSS too on the 2nd OP, \"Seven Deadly Sins\" by MAN WITH A MISSION, while the 2nd ED, \"Season\" by Arisa Takigawa delivered a smooth, sometimes emotional but powerful song for the current happenings covering the second half of the series. Yes, the sound is just so good! 10/10 for me!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: You just gotta love each and everyone. Each one has their own uniqueness and awesomeness. Take Ban for example. He may appear a jerk most of the time, but hidden under that persona is a truly caring person. King also has his spotlight. He may appear weak, but don't underestimate his powers. But my favorite among the cast would be Gowther, being the one who is always straight-forward about everything and keeping a straight face all the time, with his signature poses too. Everyone was awesome in their own ways, so it's a 9.5/10.\\n\\n\r\nEntertainment value: It goes waaaaaaaaaaaay beyond 10. I'm serious. Cliffhangers? Yes, there's so plenty of them it makes me cringe. Battle scenes? Super epic. Interactions of the characters with each other. Always fun to watch and exciting. Meliodas and Elizabeth moments? Absolutely yes! Diane and King? A BIG YES! There's just too much about Taizai that I just can;t leave alone. So just for entertainment, I'd give it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Despite having a quite messy storyline due to a lot of omitted keypoints, I have to give the series a 9.9/10. That's just how much I love the series, I just gave a mere 0.1% for my disappointment. I don't really take it to heart. Knowing A-1 Pictures, they could have given us a better anime series with a better adaptation. But what can I do? It's already over, guess I'll just have to deal with it. But nonetheless, I highly recommend it to everybody who's in for adventure, comedy, fantasy and a little historical. If I enjoyed it, you will, too.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. Please don't compare it to Fairy Tail. I beg you. Those two are waaaaaaaay different from each other.",

            "content": "Full disclosure, that 9 you see there? It doesn't start there. We'll get there when we get there though.\r\nThe Seven Deadly Sins is a medieval fantasy action anime directed by Tensai Okamura. If that name sounds familiar to you, it's because he is the creator of Darker Than Black. It's about a group of criminals who worked for the kingdom of Liones until something happened and they were blamed for a heinous crime against the kingdom. 10 years later, Princess Elizabeth of Liones searches for them in order to stop a coup against the kingdom. If a group of criminals going on a mission thatseems impossible sounds familiar as well, it's because it's slightly reminiscent of Suicide Squad. So basically this is a medieval fantasy Suicide Squad directed by the same person who made Darker than Black. Already, this sounds amazing.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is amazing about the story is how in depth it goes. At the beginning there isn't a lot of information given, but as the episodes continue along we receive more and more information about the characters, the situation they're in, the world they're in, how they think and feel about everything, and we get a bigger understanding of everything that is happening. It gives us so many details about what's happening that we as an audience can truly immerse ourselves into the world. But it's not shoved in our faces or forced in any place. The progression of acquiring information is natural and we learn what we need to learn when we need to learn it. It's not just information dumping whenever we don't have a fight scene. You learn everything with everyone.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's really cool about this aspect of the story is how they pull off twists and reveals. Because we learn with the characters the twists are pulled off so intricately. It's not just that we learn some big revelation, but we see how it connects with everything else we've learned so far. So it's like we learn the big thing, and then we remember how it connects with another thing, and then another thing, and then so on and so on, and the entire scope of the show changes drastically. It's not just a twist, it's a chain reaction.\\n\\n\r\nThe story telling is really neat, but this is also an action anime as well. The action itself is really well put together. It blends the fantastical elements of each character's magical abilities with the good old-fashioned sword fighting and hand to hand combat that you would expect out of a medieval fantasy. Every attack hit well and the sheer impact of it all is felt with each blow. How they handle the combat in a general sense is great as well. Since The Seven Deadly Sins are supposed to have an almost limitless amount of power, creating highly intense action scenes where they have the possibility to lose is rather difficult. They decided to take an Occam's Razor approach to it, and just made the villains they fight also have almost limitless power, and that really works. Not only are the action scenes tense, they go all out with them.\\n\\n\r\nIt being called The Seven Deadly Sins, it is obviously going to be very character heavy. Like I said earlier, we learn everything with the characters, and as such we see them go through everything. Whether it be seeing them grow and change, or just seeing what makes them who they are. Every sin is elaborated on as much as they need to, and all of them are engaging and exciting to see every time we see them. My personal favorite is Gowther because he is just so blunt with everything. Nothing seems to phase him. Although all of them are fun in their own way. And I feel like if we got to know Merlin more she might be my favorite. But even with the small amount we see of her, she is already amazing. Best team mom.\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth herself is also a really good character. She's not just a damsel in distress, but she's also not just another stereotypical badass female. She helps where she can help, and does all she can, but knows her limitations as well. Her will and determination shine through each sticky situation, even after the sins seem to give up or are too weak. Her true character is in that she is willing to fight for her kingdom and everyone in it, and do whatever it takes to ensure that they are all safe. I really can't think of anything negative about this character. Nothing at all. Well, I seem to have this nagging feeling that something negative happens with this character, but I do not recall what it is. Oh well, I guess it can't be that important.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not just the protagonists that get a lot of development and characterization. The villains do so as well. We see what motivates each villain and see why they do what they do. Why they follow along with this coup and what is important to each of them. Each motivation for each villain is varied widely, which makes each villain unique in their own way, and helps us sympathize with most of them.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, I've been hyping this up like there's no tomorrow. You might think that there are no flaws. Well, this did get a 9 in my book, so there are obviously flaws. In fact, my brain is telling me of a really big flaw, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Hmmm. Well, whatever it is, it doesn't seem important, so I guess I don't need to talk abou-OK! FINE! I'll talk about it.\\n\\n\r\nSo, the thing I didn't mention about Elizabeth is that she is also used for fanservice. Obviously, I consider this a bad thing. It is unnecessary and it doesn't do the character justice. In fact, it's the worst part about the entire show. \"It's just a little fanservice, what could possibly be so bad about it?\" you may ask. Well I'm glad you asked.\\n\\n\r\nSome of you may have noticed that I made jokes about me completely forgetting that this anime even has fanservice. I had planned to do that from the moment I decided to review this anime. However even during the writing of this review I forgot about putting this joke in and complaining about the fanservice. It's THAT unimportant. And that's the problem. There is no weight to the fanservice whatsoever. \"Are you asking for more fanservice?\" No I'm not. I'm asking why is it here in the first place. Beside the obvious reason of trying to appeal to people trying to get their jollies. And I know that's why a lot of fanservice is in so many anime, but here it doesn't last long. It's like 30 seconds to a minute each episode tops. And not every episode has it. For comparison sake, look at Kampfer. One of my biggest complaints with it is that it focuses too much on silly fanservice. But if you were to cut out the fanservice, you would have to replace with more story, or more characterization, or more action. Seven Deadly Sins is lacking in none of those fields, and if they removed the fanservice nothing about the rest of the show would change. So not only is it unnecessary in the usual way fanservice is unnecessary, it's unnecessary in that you can skip over it entirly and not feel like you're missing anything important and that it doesn't feel like it's lacking content. So yeah, it's not just bad because it's bad, it's bad because there is literally NO REASON for it.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, I have a few more complaints. Remember all the way in the beginning I said it doesn't start out at a 9. As much as I praise how well the story is paced, it is also a particularly a slow boil. When I saw we learn everything with the characters, I mean everything. At the beginning we don't know a whole lot about any of the characters that we see, and the little we do know doesn't make them stand out. They seemed very cliche. What kept me going wasn't the characters, like it usually is. It was the world and story. And it's not even the story beats that kept me going, it was the general story about a kingdom in peril and  the fact that 7 criminals have to save it. The potential in what is going on. But once it gets going and we know more about everyone, and we meet more people, it becomes more interesting and we become more invested. And it especially picks up in the last five episodes. Those episodes alone helped it redeem the uninteresting cliched beginning.\\n\\n\r\nAnother complaint is something that's not bad, but just a little weird. There's a character named Jericho who is one of the villains. She is embarrassed about not having a lot of power and being a girl. And these fears grow when she meets Ban, one of the Sins. This is not a bad motivation, or a bad way to advance her motivation. But it's weird because in her first appearance Ban strips her of her armor, but the next time we see her, Ban doesn't seem to know she's a girl. That utterly confuses me. It also seems like we're not supposed to know she's a girl until Ban strips her, but it was very obvious from when we first see her.\\n\\n\r\nOne final complaint is that, while most of the villains get very good characterization that helps us understand who they are and develop them as a whole, the main villain has decent motivations and decent characterization, but is kind of hindered by the fact that they went out of their way to make them the most evil person in the show. It's not entirely bad per say, but when everyone else has complex motivations for doing what they do, the villain lacking that makes them seem mostly uninteresting.\\n\\n\r\nNow, back to things I like. Starting with the production value. It is really amazing. The artwork is so colorful and varied that each scene is a treat to look at. Every color used is used to its fullest effect. The character designs are all unique and each character stands out, even at a distance, or in a constantly moving environment, such as the action scenes. Speaking of, each action scenes come together really well. With most of the characters involved being super powerful, each movement or action is felt and the impact hits a lot harder. And since a lot of the characters have a unique fighting style, the presentation is absolutely spectacular. One of my favorite action scenes is when they break Ban out of the prison he's in. When Ban's and Meliodas's eyes meet they just bro out and start hitting each other like they do, and the sheer force of them just hitting each other and arm wrestling just brings down the whole prison.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is also really good as well. It has a booming orchestral soundtrack, and each piece fits the scenes they're in really well. It makes great use of stringed instruments and drums during more intense scenes, but it also works in the piano quite nicely during some of the more somber scenes. As for the openings and endings, opening 1 is alright, but nothing special, ending 1 is really fucking good, opening 2  is one of the best anime openings I've scene in recent times, and ending 2 while not as good as ending 1, is still really good and worth listening too.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that this show handles really well is its theme of forgiveness. It explores different aspects about forgiving someone else or yourself in very complicated ways, but the theme is clear and simple to understand. Each character has varying degrees of things that they are or should be forgiven for, and when they are forgiven by the person who forgives them, they both come out of it better and stronger, and the situation they're in becomes a lot easier. However, if they aren't forgiven the person who doesn't forgive them only makes matters more complicated for the person who doesn't forgive them. And there are a good number of scenes in which a character can't forgive themselves, but someone forgives them for them, and that makes things better as well. It just really gets to the heart of understand people, and with the large cast of characters and it being a character-centric series, the theme plays really nice into the structure of the show really nicely.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing, I'd like to talk about the ending. Not in any sort of specific way though. Just how it's structured. So, during the course of the show, I found out there was going to be a season 2.  The ending is set up is the perfect way to do a lead in to another season. It concludes the story it has in a way where everything is neat an tidy, but it opens up a few questions on what comes next. So it satisfies you in a way where yes you do want more, but you can wait for it because what you got so far feels complete. That is such a cool way to end something.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, while it starts off kind of generic, if you stick with it it becomes a really entertaining and engaging experience. You will grow to like the characters as you see more of them, and you will grow to like the story the more you see of it. It opens itself up for a lot of surprises along the way, and I would say that this might be an anime that's even better the second time you watch it, just because you know why the characters do the things they do, and so a joke becomes much more, or a downer moment becomes more sad, because you know now. And that is really amazing. 9/10",

That was how cool this anime was. This anime has a nice action scene and a very hilarious scene. Some scenes can made me laugh like hell. This anime has a very soft ecchi as well. So,\u00a0the story was good, animation, sound, characters are amazing. This show might be a bit cliche, but cliche is not bad at all. I would recommend the people who haven't \r\nwatched it to give it a try. It's Shounen/Action/ Comedy/ Romance. Give it a try! :)\\n\r\n10/10 \\n\r\nVery awesome season",

Not spoiling too much this anime is about a princess trying to gather 7 OP warriors to save the kingdom which were deemed as traitors.\r\nLet us cut to the chase and get to the points, story-wise pretty standard anime style adventure-ish sort of series. There are a few minor plot twists here and there but nothing of significance. And what I do not like about the female MC is that sheis rather annoying with that typical damsel in distress attitude. Visuals are pretty brilliant, maybe a bit too colorful, but not as much exaggerated as No Game No Life. \\n\\n\r\nAnd we get to the good parts, we start of with the characters of the anime. One word. \"Sugoi\". Each of the main characters has their own backstory and the development are close to flawless, there is even one character of the series called Ban that has an entire anime dedicated to his backstory. The next best thing about this anime is that the Opening 1 of this song is so good that I had it on my mobile phone.\\n\\n\r\nGood characters checked, outstanding music checked, beautiful visuals checked. Whats not to like about this anime :) Watch it if you like OP MC, I know a lot of you guys do hehehe",

It was funny right from the start, but not gripping; at the end of an episode I wasn't left with that lovely feeling of \"Oh my fucking Gods how does it go on\", yet, each episode had been enjoyable, so I had rated it as a 7 to start with. \r\nHowever, it turns pretty dark and grizzly after the second half, with some nice and somewhat surprising turns, which made me enjoy the story even more. Hidden dark stories? Beautiful.\r\nI alsoliked how the characters aren't entirely trope-y. You have CHARACTERS, but not really \"the dumb one with the huge breasts\" and \"the young innocent one\", \"the big bully\", etc. Some anime really take it too far I feel. In a way, yes it's still anime and there's still types, like Ban the noisy obnoxious one with the dark/sad secret etc, and Gowther is the \"smart one with the glasses\", but it didn't seem forced, but natural. I felt them as individuals much more than in some other more or less recent anime (Like Akagame for example). \\n\\n\r\nSo all in all, the story is good, I really enjoyed the characters and their individual backstories, it's a solid anime.",

I enjoyed myself while watching it, and although I might not necessarily recommend it to others, I wouldn't discourage someone from watching it. It also took me forever to actually decide to watch the anime, but I'm glad I did. \r\nI really liked the music of this anime; both of the openings were very nice. I also liked the art style, both of which are pretty important aspects to me. After thinking about it, the characterization was done just as well. I say \"after thinking about it\" becauseat the surface, the characterization was very shallow; however, it's done a lot better than what you see at first glance. The characters have good backstories, but with the exception of Ban, I feel like the romance between some of the characters is quite superficial. \\n\\n\r\nIn addition, this anime also has a lot of problems, particularly with the plot. I feel as if 60% of the anime was goofing off, and the other 30% was hastily written battle scenes with a deus ex machina at the end. By the last two episodes, I was just shouting at the screen because it was so ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nDespite this, however, I still look forward to the second season. Although it wasn't the most captivating show I've ever viewed, it was still worth watching.",

            "content": "PLEASE READ THIS!\r\nRead this because this anime deserves attention that I have a duty to bring to light. If you don't want to read any further, take away at least this. This is a masterpiece of action/adventure. Even if you don't like these categories, this is still a must watch, as it contains elements of many other genres including comedy, thriller, sci-fi and mystery and romance. \r\nNow comes the review that I believe you all should read (just take a little time out of your day and I would really appreciate it):\r\nWhat a hidden anime. No one I know talks about this anime. None ofthe other anime lovers I know have seen or heard of this series. I don't know why but, man, what a shame. I'm sure it has been watched and appreciated/hated by many people but I don't think this anime has the credit it truly deserves. The description of this anime isn't really that catchy, the title art looks kind of odd and it is not in any of the top slots on most sites (none that I have seen, although it isn't that low on the scale, it definitely deserves a higher standing). But this anime will surprise you in every way possible. While I am aware plenty of people disagree, I disagree with them. I am not saying this is better or worse than anything out there (doing that is rude and does disservice to all anime). But I am (know that I mean no disservice to the other anime out there in any way). This anime does not disappoint. There are so many anime out there that are outstanding and deserve a 10 that I haven't written about. I am simply writing about anime I have just watched. \\n\\n\r\nEvery part of this anime should receive a 10/10 score. The story. Ha. Ha. Ha. Yeah. It's good. Its very good. While you can probably draw some tangents to other anime (as humans its what we naturally do), the story rapidly adapts and twists so well that you never have any real need to draw these connections. You are simply never given the chance. Now when I say that is twists, I am not saying it is a confusing story at all. Well it is. That is the beauty of it. The story provides a stable foundation, a premise, a goal then it starts to move forward. While it feels like a straight path, in retrospect, you see that you have really been pushed through a maze that you could not have foreseen. The story is so simple but it utilizes plot bends, and good story-telling to round out this anime into one that gives you a sense of belief, sorry, loss, hate, forgiveness, despair and any other emotion you can think of. It is not a dark anime, but I wouldn't say it dismisses that black abyss. It simply acknowledges that will always be dark parts that are needed. The story is done very, very well. You never feel like anything is lacking. If you want fan-service, you got it. Action, done. Loss, take it. Happiness, definitely. Embrace this anime to its fullest, and you will be taken for a ride that only comes once and awhile. \\n\\n\r\nThe art. While it isn't particularly the BEST part of the anime, I am still giving it a 10 because of what it brings to the anime. This ties pretty deeply with the characters, but the art is a different. The main character is cool looking and done very well. But, how do I describe it, its like what I said at the beginning. Look at the cover art on any description of this anime. It doesn't stand out very much but I'm telling you, get into this and you will see that the art is fantastic. It is pretty, bright and in general just cool looking. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound. For most of the anime I review, I generically like the music. This one is no exception. No. It is an exception. I REALLY like the music. Like I always do, I listen to the soundtrack while writing this. It is pretty incredible.  I say that a lot but this one is more so. I feel pure emotion just emanating from the sound. No matter if it is sad, happy or tragic music, all of the music in this anime is just captivating. Do any of you listen to soundtracks of anime? Not just the openings/closing tunes but the actual soundtrack on you tube or wherever you find it? That is what I do. And do any of you ever skip certain parts of the soundtrack because you don't like it, or it sounds too odd on its own? I do that a decent amount, even if I like the music very much. I haven't skipped a sound. That is how well done this music is. The music alone makes me feel like I am re-watching the anime. It is just so damn beautiful. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters. Hehehehehe. Now here is where it gets real fun. The characters are incredibly vibrant and well balanced. I feel like many anime shove characters in there just to fill a role like \"the smart-one\", \"the strong one\", \"the dumb one\", etc. While at first it did kind of feel like that (when I say at first I mean for like 3 or 4 minutes), the story does a great job at giving you more information about the characters that leads you to change your mind. When the \"tough guy\" character is introduced, and I was like \"oh here we go again, another character who is just simply strong and will stay plain and creepy for the whole show\" I was super surprised after 2 minutes later. You will fall in love for all of these characters, whether you like it or not. So I recommend, like I always do, go at them with an open mind. You might hate some characters for awhile. That is all planned. Trust the story and enjoy it all. Now don't go assume things from what I am telling you now. Don't try to code how they will turn out because that MIGHT make you a little  disappointed. Dive in and enjoy what happens!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall impression. What a bad anime, no enjoyment whatsoever couldn't you tell from my description (in case you are wondering, that was sarcasm)? In all honesty this is a once in a generation anime. You will never be able to re-make it because it is done so well. This anime is so great because it leaves you wanting more, giving some hints on a future of the characters, while at the same time grants you closure on the things that are important. This anime deserves a watch, no matter who you are or what you like. It will make your blood boil and your heart beat out of your chest. Give this a chance and you will not be disappointed. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I really appreciate you taking the time to read it. Tell your friends about this anime. I really want to see more support for anime like this, and maybe even continuations of such good anime. Like always, enjoy!",

            "content": "The 7 deadly sins seems like a ridiculous anime hell bent on filling the cliches of all shonen- and well, it is. It is filled with sexual references and over the top action, as well as the titular protagonist; the good guy; the savior; the good guy always winning. It takes no chances on itself whether it's the lack of diversity between similar protagonists or the limited to near zero real deaths of anyone they have invested screen time in & unlike HunterXHunter, it does not teach or develop what people refer to as a \"power scale\"- meaning that the strongest people are the strongestpeople because they are main characters. The show follows closely with that of major shonen before it, such as Naruto or Bleach. This method is successful however, and will be sure to give it a fan base as well as money but it does not leave much room for particular greatness. \\n\\n\r\nUntil this surprising gem that somehow molds itself into something just a bit different and unique, which manages to sit on top a pile of generic shounen, all filled with their busty female leads who are head over heels for the protagonist and like their unrequited love that could never be shown( a shonen is meant for young boys after all) they are often rather useless in ability. So then how could an anime that somehow checks off every box in the page of 'safe' be this good? \\n\\n\r\nIt's because it takes itself seriously. That may seem like a shock with the big bust of Elizabeth( your female lead) and the comedic perversion of Meliodas( your protagonist) but hear me out for. While the anime fits every box for shonen, it at least checked it off in a diamond fountain pen. The show's characters are developed and pop out whether in appearance, personality, costume or power( or some of all) Whether it is from the simple fact that the show is set up to mislead the viewer( as well as the characters in the anime) that the sins look very different than they truly do or the personalities that do so well to compliment their respective sins: Ban, the sin of greed thinks only for himself, tying not only to every day comedic relief to his past and ultimate goals. This does well with every sin( even those not shared by the same deadly sin group) which accents nearly everything in the show. From corner to corner, you find an anime that could not have been safer yet could not have been more different. Someone buying a turtle rather than a cat or a dog comes to mind. I can only see this example as true when I look at anime like Kill la kill which compares to me more that someone bought an anteater as a pet rather than a cat or dog. \\n\\n\r\nYou get a story with clarity; with defined goals; Princess recruits the sins to take back the corrupt kingdom. That's safe. That's shonen. Yet you somehow get twists, unprecedented turns, and by the end, you hardly end up on the same freeway( although, it still is a freeway). \\n\\n\r\nThis proves true with the characters just the same. You get your 5 or 6 major characters as well as your generic villain(s) and your few developed minor characters, each with obvious flaws and goals with just enough depth for real character development but not enough to leave us with something deep and resounding. An example I feel would work would be a character developing through their need to be the most powerful and a character developing between their need to feel like they're the most powerful. The latter leads into branches of why, how, when- which leads into other branches and other problems, goals and themes. The first one just says \"I want to be strong\", something akin to nearly every generic superhero villain we find in the movies. Yet, the characters created by the writing staff( or the manga artist I should say) focus deep on the simple mindsets and goals of each character giving us something more and certainly better than \"I want to be strong\". \\n\\n\r\nThis relates very well back to our story which again, was very simple from the start and although it branches little off in ways of the story changing( a story like House ( little to non changing story) to a show like Breaking bad( branches very far off by season 5) it delves deep into the story it does have, leaving us at least on a different, bumpier road than we started. \\n\\n\r\nThe road we end up on gives us real development between what we saw as enemies and friends, and does a great job at giving us those unseen twists we as viewers love. \\n\\n\r\nThe check marks have also been checked( though again with the same fancy pen) under the art and sound categories. The artwork is typical of a shounen- almost goofy and unrealistic but it is done well and animated well for the majority of the series, hardly letting us see those terrible animation sequences during fights. The sound plays well in what a shonen expects- a mix between upbeat pop and rock, and the in show soundtrack does well to either become compatible or happily forgetful.  \\n\\n\r\nIf the story suffers from anything it is from the fact that it should have been named the (5 deadly sins) as that is pretty much the amount you will see( maybe 5 & a half) and truly only 4 of them are truly great characters. Though that is less to do with the manga and more to do with the anime adaption as the manga was developed fine and spaced properly given it did not have a frame of episodes to meet. In true but very appropriate nit-picking the show also suffers from sometimes generic uninspired fights that do well to show action and gore but not so well in showing something different. After all, if you are an actions show and have a lot of action, it seems important to not 1/4 of it be the same boring scenes you already showed. Finally, as far as characters, it suffers from the fact there are just too many, with some becoming important far too late, then presenting them as very important to either the characters or the plot, as well as showing them off as if we were supposed to care or know they were important all along. Though I will say that surprisingly they managed to do well with a few of these pop-ups which I find very hard to do. \\n\r\nAll and all, it is that general sense of seriousness given to a safe shonen like this that are very appreciated and evident throughout, giving this show a powerful and entertaining watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Lured in by the high rankings on both MyAnimeList and IMDB, and eager to discover original anime on Netflix, I started watching The Seven Deadly Sins. The title of this series was not too promising, though I must say this is one of the elements that I enjoyed most and gave a very human touch to the story. \r\nThe best part of this anime is the characters. They have original, sometimes heartbreaking backgrounds, interesting passions and flaws, and struggle with different problems. Best ones to me are Diane and Ban. Diane is a giant who wishes to be the size of a normal woman. Shegets envious every time something seems to be going on between \"her\" Melodias and other women. \\n\r\nBan`s magical power enables him to snatch away other people's abilites, but although his greediness made him immomrtal, it was also the cause he lost the person dearest to him. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the main hero, Melodias, he seems just unrealistic to me. He is kind yet perverted, looks like 12-year old and most of the time behaves like one, too. Heroine Elizabeth reacts impossibly naive to all the perverted grabbing she receives from Melodias. She is also very kind and caring, but that's about it. In general, she is a boring character that hardly develops as a person and would be better fit as a side character. \\n\\n\r\nFor the rest of the aspects, I could say something about: story line, suspense arcs, fighting, world-building, it's all mediocre or even bad. \\n\\n\r\nThe story line feels rushed. There's hardly time to get to know the characters before we are confronted with problems and villains that pop up just like that, after which we are told there are some grounded reasons for all this to happen. \\n\\n\r\nSuspense arcs (meaning the urge to watch on) are mostly low, despite well-placed cliff-hangers after each episode. The goal of the main hero and heroine are joined and their friends help out, but apparenty there is time for intermezzo's that feel forced and slow down the actual storyline. It could be me, but I count too many villains that all seem a bit alike. Their background is (mostly) missing, they all wear suits of armor, they all have a thing against the Seven Deadly Sins... The big WHY is missing to me though. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the suspence comes however from the quarreling between Melodias and his gang of Sins. Just the human feelings that collide and cause conflict. Suspence from the fighting (see below) and the story line are weak. \\n\\n\r\nThe fighting is easy and flashy, there almost no thought given to it. Just some banging and clanging. Actually the quarrels between Melodias and Ban are more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough it is a fantasy show, or may, especially because it's a fantasy show, the magic and such should not only play a rol but also feel justified. And in this show, it is not really. Why can they use magic? How did they learn this? What are the drawbacks? At one point it is mentioned magic is produced by mere will power, but to me that seems like a lazy way to explain such a core element of the show.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat's with Melodias` super strenght? It erects some excitement when the hero is beating another bad guy, but how did he become like that? It could be a good suspence trigger to postpone the explanation of the heroes` abilities, but obtaining these powers and learning to use them is a fairly interesting part of a character's development that is now completely missing. \\n\\n\r\nBoth Melodias` gang and the villains introduce new magic and tricks one afther the other without me knowing how it is all possible. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against fantasy, but as a writer of fantasy myself, there is nothing more important than the world-building to make any fantasy elements believable and constructive to the story. \\n\\n\r\nTo end with a positive note on this series, the art work is enjoyable, both the style of the characters and the background. Also the music is quite good, something that I expect from an anime series. Maybe because I had high hopes, this series was quite a disappointment to me. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "For the sake of those fried brains who are still on summer vacation and don't want to read a novel for an anime review like me, here is my attempt at a simple yet hopefully informative review of The Seven Deadly Sins- spoiler free.\r\nStory\r\nFirst of all, the main story plot is simple and straightforward. The main character Elizabeth is on a quest to stop the corruptness of the Holy Knights. The people who help her on her quest are known as the seven deadly sins. WARNING: Starting with the first episode, there are surprises and slight twists that may leave you in a state onlythose who have seen the show can call, hypeness. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThere are actually shockingly a lot of characters for a 24episode anime. But what I loved about it was the show did a great job to dilute screen time to all characters. Personally, I'm a huge fan of shows that consists of a team of completely different personality and ability characters. Mainstream examples of this are the ninjas in Naruto or the Strawhat crew. Each character in the show basically has his/her own ability that is super cool and it kept me wanting to see more characters introduced.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nThe animation was on point throughout the show and they did a great job using vibrant colors to display the epic fight scenes, laidback moments, and character designs that are just pleasing to the eye.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nI loved the intros and outros in the show, and the one soundtrack that stood out to me was the epic music they used in the fight scenes which reminded me of a mix between Zelda and a Smash Bros map/boss fight. (called PERFECT TIME). Also the anime begins with a short prologue in every episode that is super epic and gets me hyped every time. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall\\n\r\nFor someone who doesn't watch too much anime, the show did a great job providing endless twists and surprises, creating characters I grew quite fond of, keeping me entertained with awesome fights and action, and let's be honest, the occasional fanservice was nice comic relief and just funny to watch every now and then.",

            "content": "The plot has a course very similar to the other animes of the genre. It starts with the protagonist, who ends up with a completely random villain, so the journey begins and he has to solve one problem and then solve a bigger one. Are we talking about Naruto? No friends, it's Nanatsu in Taizai, the way the story unfolds is nothing interesting, things just happen. Mangaka can not fit situations well, everything there is clearly forced and this is repetitive in most similar anime.\r\nLet's look at the plot of Nanatsu in Taizai in a cool way, leaving the emotions aside. Basically, the princess Elizabethof the kingdom of Liones is in search of 7 knights of an old organization that served the king, the seven deadly sins. She finds one of them with that old script feature, and this one already begins to \"palpate\" her breasts while she sleeps and instantly falls in love with her, since it was similar to her former lover. Beginning with the completely forced romance between Elizabeth and Meliodas, which basically serves only as fanservice (subject that will be deepened in the blog in the future). Following the logical sense, a princess, who theoretically received a good education, falls suddenly in love with a renegade knight who basically sexually abuses her, touching her breasts almost every episode. This does not even make sense, the princess never tries to berate him for his disrespectful and perverted behavior, just accepting everything without question, a completely empty character.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the characters' own motivation is clich\u00e9, since basically the story is about Elizabeth and Meliodas seeking to assemble a group of ex-knights to save the kingdom. An extremely clich\u00e9d and well-known type of motivation, both in animes and in other means of entertainment. The story unfolding also leaves much to be desired, since the protagonist and the coadjuvantes do not develop their personalities well, with some exceptions (like Ban), the majority is poorly worked and superficial. The protagonist himself is a pevertido whose sole objectives were to save the kingdom and to defeat the villain. A classic cliche hero.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the protagonism is very common in animes shounen, but it is not something necessary, on the contrary, it is abominable. Nanatsu no Tazai uses and abuses this, the protagonist, Meliodas, is the classic omnipotent character that destroys all with his incalculable power, however, there are also the invincible villains who come to fight with incredible ease versus the tattooed blonde, who by divine miracle, Ends up winning. Do you realize how much it harms the work? The protagonism takes all the emotion of the combat and disrupts much the development of the characters, this is one of the most negative points of Nanatsu in the Tazai.\\n\\n\r\nSomething that exemplifies very well this is the scene of the first episode, in which Meliodas simply destroys a mountain using a simple twig, a huge demonstration of its immense protagonism. In his useless and repetitive battles against Ban, Meliodas always draws the strength to match and even surpass him, still having his energy \"drained.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to all of the above, Meliodas still has the old clich\u00e9 of a dark and powerful side that manifests itself when he loses control of his emotions. A horrible mix of protagonism and enforced powers. Remembering, of course, the absurd force he gains when he awakens his demonic side, being almost insurmountable by enemies within the anime\\n\\n\r\nThe ecchi / fanservice is one of the most ridiculous things a shounen can have, I'm not against use, but it's very damaging to the play. When it is not intended to enrich the work (which is very rare) or cause comedy (it is more common), there is no point in using this medium. Nanatsu in Taizai has this kind of scene with the aim of attracting an audience and satisfying this demand, but it defuses a good part of the work, as when Diane went to fight in that tournament, I understand that it was necessary to put it smaller, What the hell had to involve Elizabeth like that? I can not look favorably at a work that does this, even because that is not her only problem.\\n\\n\r\nA light ecchi, made for the purpose of reaching more users, is not so harmful. The problem with Nanatsu is the fact that she uses this in almost every episode for no reason, leading to several forced scenes of fanservice, which is usually related to Meliodas and Elizabeth. The story itself is undermined by this appealing fanservice, spending screen time that could be used to deepen the characters, in some forced situation that shows her almost naked.\\n\\n\r\nAnd not just Elizabeth, several important female characters are targets of fanservice all the time, harming the development of these characters. The forced romance between herself and Meliodas, only serves as an excuse\\n\\n\r\nCritically analyzing, Nanatsu in Taizai is a reasonably bad anime, as it has very exaggerated fanservice scenes and a weak plot. I definitely do not recommend the anime if you like good plots, as Nanatsu sins a lot in this respect. But if it's a person who does not care much for plot, just wants to watch an anime for the action, you might even like Nanatsu in Taizai.",

I'm a huge fan of the reverse concept they use here with the \"Sin's\" being the protagonists against the evil religious regime so to speak. In this regard I found even more depth in the show. I love the music from the opening score to the battle themes, some of it is downright inspirational on par with that Naruto (though a much smaller sample size mind you). The show is a good blend of might of magic, comedy and perviness with some amazing fight scenes. Elizabeth is as cute as any heroine inanime and she seems in earnest to want to fight for her companions, I believe that she would die defending the sins as opposed to arbitrarily feeling she has to defend them (ie. Sakura). Demons, Knights, Giants and Faeries ! I'm mean this show packs so much into one season. I can't wait to see where Season 2 takes these characters!",

I wasn't particularly invested in the characters and therefore their cause wasn't as compelling as it possibly would have been, but I became even more disinterested due to what seemed like a lack of consequences. Any actual consequences seemed to be undone very easily for no real reason and this made the show lose its edge for me.\r\nART - 9\r\nVery clean and crisp, beautiful landscapes andgreat animation in fights. Some unique character designs and cool attack designs in the show.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8\\n\r\nI liked the OPs and EDs and the OST sounded good but was not particularly memorable. Good voice acting too.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 7\\n\r\nThis was a bit of a problem for me; Ban was the only character I really liked. I thought he was the best written character with some great conflicts and a fairly good, developed backstory which was further developed in the second season. I didn't particularly care about any of the other characters that much - Meliodas was cool but he seemed a bit one dimensional and all I could say about his personaility is that he's very nice and also very OP. Not much to say about the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 7\\n\r\nLike I said it's easy to watch, fairly enjoyable but overall not memorable. I got kind of bored as it went on and was just watching the episodes in order to finish the season so I could get to season 2 which I was told was better.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7\\n\r\nI wouldn't say I regret watching it, but I certainly wouldn't watch it again and would not recommend watching it unless you have watched everything else, there are plenty of better alternatives IMO.",

I enjoy the action and the depth of the friendships, as well as the humor aspect (although a tad perverted). I also really, really enjoy the romantics, to me it's a really cute dash added into an already pretty good storyline.\r\nTo be honest withyou, I didn't want to watch the show? I would hear about it from my co-workers and it just didn't seem like my kind of show. So I would say if you have any reservations about the show, just from something stupid like your feelings about the art or the first episode, push past it and give it a good shot.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely think there really isn't anything too too special about Seven Deadly Sins, but I am genuinely enjoying watching the show there is so much going on... and I can't wait to meet the other characters.\\n\\n\r\nI would say anyone who was a fan of any other anime that has really blown up in the states should give it a shot!

This is not Naruto, nor HunterXHunter nor Boku no Hero Academia i.e shounens that in spite of using typical shounens tropes develop a clear direction and universe. Nope. Take your classical recipe book of \"how to create a medieval fantasy novel\" and you get Nanatsu no Taizai. The plot doesn't even capitalize on its premise. If you introduce characters with SEVEN DEADLY SINS, make it count! They just have this title because it sounds cool not even because they embody these sins >_<\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\\n\r\nDone in 2014. Animation is sub-par. The action scenes are poor on average, not a lot of effort in terms of choreography of the fight scenes, not a lot of creativity in terms of powers. Lots of explosions everywhere, it's cheap globally. Ah... Well I also hate the character designs which consists of childlike characters ( yeah I don't care anymore about the artistic choices of the author doesn't matter) and BOOBS. BIG BOOBS, Women parading in underwear, or mini skirts, and big cleavage.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is meh, the ending is meh, the only thing I liked was the song in the intro. The OST is random fantasy music completely forgettable. The Japanese actor playing the talking pig made my ears bleed big time. In fact, I stopped the series for that, I just couldn't bear it anymore. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 1\\n\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nOh my... I said I'll make it short, so I'll keep it short:\\n\\n\r\nMeliodas: Main character is a pervert, sexually obsessed, sexually frustrated obviously, spending his time groping Elizabeth's ass, or boobs, or stealing her pants or making disgusting jokes. THIS IS NOT FUNNY. This is degrading for women in general. What a sorry excuse for a hero. Is this guy supposed to be cool? Are we supposed to root for him? Nobody puts him in his place which is just surreal. \\n\r\nI know this is a classic shounen trope but you don't need to be so heavy handed with it seriously. Even Love Hina is ecchi and has a character who ends up \"innocently\" in awkward situations. This guy is just a perv. Erro Sennin in Naruto is a pervert but he is first and foremost a very cool guy, Leorio is cool even if he's got a pervy side. Meliodas is just a perv and he's so shallow why HIM as a hero instead of Ban or King or somebody with some depth? No effort is made to make him slightly more than a pervert, nothing to redeem him in 9 fucking episodes. I'm not giving you any more chances.\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth: ... This character obviously doesn't exist in real life but should be forbidden to exist in fiction as well. She is an insult to all females on this planet. When a perv squishes your boobs, touches your ass or other body parts, you REACT, you slap him, you escape, or if you want to sleep with him you do and you teach him some manners or not, I don't know BUT YOU DO SOMETHING. \\n\r\nThis idiot just does NOTHING, and goes on like nothing happened. She also cries a lot and acts all innocent with her mini-skirt and her big breast . Typical Japanese fantasy. She's just irritating. IR-RI-TA-TING.\\n\\n\r\nDiane: All I can say is that it's surprising Meliodas doesn't try to grope her. After all, her breast and ass are of gigantic proportions. That's not coherent with the story... especially since she's so WILLING to be groped by her chief.\\n\\n\r\nBan and King: More interesting than the rest but still shallow.\\n\\n\r\nRest: Typical villains, no depth whatsoever except pink haired guy... who looks more the hero than boob man mentioned above.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\\n\r\n3 because It's got its shounen moments when it knows to be slightly more serious but the whole group is too strong  and therefore it makes all fights pretty uninteresting. You always know these guys can get out of trouble easy because they're just that powerful. As we all know \"No pain, no gain\". Well there's never any pain there, if there is you know these characters are faking so each victory is cheap. It's just a way to fill the fights quota. Minus 7 for the screaming pig who can't shut his mouth and for BOOB man for being an insult to Heroes and Men in general as well as Elizabeth for being... whatever she is.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\r\nWHY THE HYPE? WHY OH WHY?\\n\r\nIs it me or is the anime industry just going downhill? How many recent shows have I watched that were just plain dreadful? PLEASE Stop producing so many anime and refocus on quality! I've been catching up with animes from the end of the first decade/early 2010s this past year and most animes I've watched were either over-hyped or just dreadful being rated 8 or above here. Seriously? \\n\r\nThis is not bad. This sucks. This is not me thinking well... Not really my thing but I can understand why people like it. No. This is me saying I've seen LOTS of shounens which were pretty average all these \"average shows\" of the early 2000s were WAY better than this shit which got 8.25 on MAL at the time I'm writing these lines.\\n\r\nMan I don't know anymore.\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review here on MAL. I hope everybody here can get a good idea of what this show is about, and what you can expect from Seven Deadly Sins or Nanatsu No Taizai.\r\n\"nanatsu no taizai is another round of the mill shounen 0/10 do not recommend......BAHAHAHA yeah right.\"\r\nAll jokes aside.\r\nThe basic underlining of this show can be summed up to ones burden or \"sin\" if you will. We all have something we regret doing in our lifetime whether it is something small like eating your room mates food, or as bad cheating on a test. This is the premise of Nanatsu NoTaizai. One's sin.\\n\\n\r\nTo start off i'd like to say that i stumbled upon this show by accident. I found myself watching abridged episodes and, auto-play being what it is, brought me to Nanatsu No Taizai.\\n\\n\r\nFirst let's get one of my dislikes out of the way.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying it safe.\\n\r\nThis is why it get's a 9 from me. Playing it safe is also probably why it's not as popular as other shonen, i think the fact that it does this is the reason the series is held back a bit.\\n\\n\r\nPlot convenience is also fairly prevalent here, although that could be summed up because of the OP nature of the main cast.\\n\\n\r\nBUT!.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is by no means predictable, it does a great job at surprising you with it's jacked-up action scenes and it's random(where the hell did that comes from?)scenes. But seeing as how strong the main characters are, it's really hard for the writers to work outside of this box. With everything this anime throws at you, it get's kind of dumbed-down, although with quite a few twists and turns. This is subjective as it was my own expectation that allowed this sort of thinking in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say here except that this show does have a solid story and is well worth investing yourself in. It cuts right to the chase with the basic formula and setup of the world. But this is by no mean's the bottom line. You will soon find out that while it does have a pretty basic premise to start off with, it evolves into much more when backstories come into-play. The fan-service is hilarious and isn't over the top, and the story is very well rounded with some conclusions to be made in a second season(or so it's hinted at the end). This does not hinder the ending at all.\\n\\n\r\nIt has a good amount of(let's not fuck around)moments which in my opinion adds to the overall enjoyment. Which is why i slightly compare it to the higher rated shonen :)\\n\\n\r\nArt and Design.\\n\r\nThere's not much to say here really. It's absolutely gorgeous!. I especially love the fantasy style they went for, and to this day i haven't really seen anything similar to what they've done, in this industry alone of course.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\nEvery single character has a use and a good backstory, except for a couple side characters that didn't really have much screen time.\\n\\n\r\nThe main leading protagonist meliodas...well to put it simply, he's amazing!.\\n\\n\r\nThe main female protagonist, while i thought to be slightly annoying at first had some really awesome moments and doesn't beat up the main character for every little thing they do(which in my opinion, when you save somebodies life 21 times...you get it.)well...he does get beat up by Diane a lot. The main female leads development throughout the anime and toward the end was very well done. The others characters are way to likable, and are a lot deeper than your typical shonen character.\\n\\n\r\nSound. \\n\r\nSawano . The music itself is your classic medieval fantasy-esc sound, with quality skyrocketing as the anime further develops.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nThis anime has absolutely everything you could wish for. Comedy, parody, action, story, good character development, art and a great OST. It is by far one of my favorite shonen of all time!.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI think this anime deserves a lot more attention than it currently has, and i don't say these things lightly. In-fact i never have. Some people call this anime \"generic shounen\" oh boy is it anything but that. It pokes fun at itself and other generic shounen while maintaining it's own dignity, premise and story in the process. \\n\\n\r\nFor a show of this quality it is a very underrated anime. i've never seen this specific anime mentioned anywhere. Not here, not facebook, nowhere in particular. I know this doesn't mean it's underrated but compared to some of the bigger titles it has little to no mention or recommendation, even though this particular anime is equivalent to if not better than a lot of the Shonen i've watched and deserves much more attention.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion to my enjoyment of this anime, i will be supporting these developers in any way i possibly can, whether that is through buying copies or spreading the word.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nExtremely enjoyable to watch.",

We learn about the cast as we go, as if we've been shot out of a cannon. The cast, like the show, are easy to love although some cast members get more backstory then others.\r\nThis might seem to be a flaw but it reflects the outcome of the show. For example we wanted to see more of Gowther's past. It was too late into production and it's understandable that the studio couldn't afford to get another storyin. The reason I'm letting this slide is because we have Ban, King, and Diane in one story-arch.\\n\r\nIt does check-out, and it's not a boring story in retrospect.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have very few quarrels with this anime, on a personal level I did not like how they treated King's story regarding what ended up happening. This part of the story made me cry a lot, but I daresay, it makes you seriously hate the villain.\\n\r\nWhich in turn, makes a good villain.\\n\\n\r\nGive her a watch.\\n\r\nOr better yet, buy the series.\\n\r\nIt's worth your GP.\\n",

            "content": "I actually created an account just to review The Seven Deadly Sins.\r\nI've watched my fair share of animes, and this one tops the cake (so far anyway).\r\nI was reading some of the reviews, and some I just do not agree with and think they don't go in-depth enough, so I wanted to write my own.\r\n****(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)****\r\nThe Seven Deadly Sins is great. Point blank. It has a great story line and gives you tastes of background information a little at a time of each character so you can identify with them easier. It is a tear-jerker, comedy, and has a perverted take all in one.What more could you want?\\n\\n\r\nI read a review where they said the characters' \"markings\" do not correspond with their personalities. This is, in fact, a lie.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Meliodas. His sin is Wrath, which he portrays very well. He is the strongest of them all. He also has demon blood inside of him, and from what I can tell, he has a secret about him.\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth. She isn't part of the Seven Deadly Sins, but we do find out later that she is a goddess and she does have powers. Hence why she is very kind, helping, and soft. One of her known powers is healing.\\n\\n\r\nDiane. Her sin is Envy. Her power has a strong connection with the Earth. (Hence \"Green with Envy\"). She is also very jealous of many things, especially when it comes to Meliodas and Elizabeth. \\n\\n\r\nBan. His sin is Greed. He is very greedy for the taste of blood. He loves conflict. Plus, he's immortal. Another example is in a background story of his when he was trying to take from the fountain of youth.\\n\\n\r\nKing. His sin is Sloth. He is a fairy king. He floats around with is pillow and is even seen sleeping. He does not engage in physical contact. Instead, he just uses hand movements to control his weapons. He is very weak in physical fist fighting. Hence his sloth nature.\\n\\n\r\nGowther. His sin is Lust. In one episode, he uses his powers to make a mob of fighters \"fall in love\" with himself, Ban, and Meliodas. He even saves Guila from transforming into a demon with, from what she says, the power of love.\\n\\n\r\nMerlin. Her sin is Gluttony. We haven't experienced much of her character in the anime yet, along with the seventh unknown sin. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime to anyone? The question is obvious. Of course. And I've stated my reasons. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai (The Seven Deadly Sins) was suggested to me by one of my best friends and, I have to thank him for recommending it as this show was probably the best show I've watched since Noragami Aragoto. \r\nThe seven deadly sins is pretty much your average shone anime but, with the storyline of getting the band back together a story arc I've always enjoyed. The story takes place in the kingdom of Britainia during medical times where an order of seven knights (the sins) have been framed for murder and, the princess of the kingdom tries to get them to help save thekingdom. We follow this princess Elisabeth and, dragon sin of wrath Meliodas on their quest to bring the others together.\\n\\n\r\nThe story was pretty basic and, easy to follow and, it thankfully did not have much filler. I liked the way the sins were introduced and, the each have their own unique personalities with my personal favorite being Ban the fox sin of greed who is the most charismatic and, emotionally compelling character of the show as he is totally awesome and, has the best story arc in the show and, it feature a great romance story. The story arc between King and Dianne (Sloth & Envy) was also a pretty good story arc with an amazing flashback episode. Gowther and, Merlin felt more like supporting characters as they didn't get much development this season but, still has their badass moments. Meliodas reminded me of Saitama in a way in that he was indestructible in a way and, comic relief to the max and, there was never any dull moment with him on screen. Elisabeth on the other hand is another plot device and, towards the end of the season one of the most annoying characters I've seen in recent memory. The supporting cast is great for the most part I loved the knights of Liones and, the antagonist were defiantly a surprise and, semi well established. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation pretty good, nothing really stands out in terms of location design. Character design is pretty crisp and solid thanks to the wonderful staff of A1. The openings and, ending were completely forgettable in my eyes I don't even remember the names of the songs or the artists to be perfectly honest.\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences of the show were absolutely fluid in motion and, phenomenal especially the final battle of the season, there defiantly are large number of lol moments as well as holy shit moments. I loved the progression of the story and, characters as it was well paced. I was blown away by the twists and, turns of the story and, there were defiantly a number of emotional moments even though some things did drag on a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say that Nanatsu no Taizai is a great way to introduce someone to anime, I feel as if it would be a great first anime for people to watch but, as I have seen many shine anime I did not enjoy the season as much as I would have liked but, it is still a really good show.",

Seven deadly sins had some pretty decent comedy as well as serious elements to  the show that you can get into. I found myself kind of getting dragon ball vibes from the show when they use their magic, because they call out the names of their attacks a lot during battle sequences. The show also had a deep and immersing backstory to it and great artwork to keep you interested in the show. Although the show hasa lot of fanservice and doesn't really get a full explanation as to some of the things that happened during the show. All the more reason i'm excited to go and watch season 2 right after i'm done with this review. I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy, comedy and doesn't mind a  lot of fanservice. See you all after season 2!",

            "content": "Seven Deadly Sins is an anime that is difficult to pin down. This is because, like  many other anime, it offers an unpolished and yet highly enjoyable experience. The result is that it has many flaws and yet an abundance of positives. In many ways its raw and charming nature is what makes it a good anime but, the glaring mistakes cannot and should not be overlooked.\r\nStory line (7) - It would be disingenuous to suggest that the plot is in anyway unique. Avid anime watchers will be all too familiar with this epic fantasy style plot; in which a fellowship of adventurers mustovercome world-threatening evil. Despite this, Seven Deadly Sins manages to provide a passable story line. It is not so generic that you'd describe it as banal nor is it so grand that you'd describe it as convoluted. Seven Deadly Sin's plot line sits in the comfortable middle-ground of \"good\".\\n\\n\r\nArt (9) - Despite lacking in other areas, this anime really excels in its visual effects and artistic details. Vibrant landscapes, charred battlefields and iridescent magical effects are copious throughout. The art really triumphs with regards to the combat. Many times I found myself aghast at how brutal and yet beautiful the battle scenes were animated; often a sundry of bold colours. Facial features and movement are both also done to a very high standard.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9) - Aside from the art the other standout feature of this anime is its fantastic soundtrack. Those with a keen ear will notice that tracks are often recycled but, that they are never used inappropriately and thus always have maximum effect. The soundtrack has outstanding musical quality and makes full use of the ambiance to deliver a truly powerful audiovisual experience. The only criticism of the music is that a greater variety of tracks could potentially enhance the anime however, Seven Deadly Sin's quality over quantity style is certainly refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7) - Much like the story line the character development certainly leaves something to be desired. In season one I was beguiled by the idea of seven incredibly powerful and mysterious warriors that had been banished for heinous crimes but, once the identities and personalities of the crew has been revealed the air of mystery quickly disappears. While there is character development to a degree, for certain characters it feels like they are little more than place holders. The anime shows glimpses of further development and interest at times but these opportunities need to be explored further. All-in-all the characters aren't badly written whatsoever but some are far more interesting than others.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8) - Despite its flaws, such as the run-of-the-mill story line and a few lackluster characters, Seven Deadly Sins is a very enjoyable anime. It won't revolutionise the anime industry or change your whole perception of animated series but, it will most definitely evoke emotions and give you a strong sense of satisfaction. In many ways Seven Deadly Sins is on the cusp of being a 10/10 anime, if it could just iron out a few flaws. The second season for example, in my opinion, was a huge let down. It is careless mistakes like this that stop Seven Deadly Sins from pushing into the upper echelon of anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

The Seven Deadly Sins anime was the 30th best selling anime of the first half of 2015. On the Anime News Network, it is rated as Very Good.\r\nPersonnally, I think that this series is very intersesting and I love the fact that those who were once considered evil are now been asked to fight those who used to be good, it's an interesting plot. The characters are very well-thought and really different one from another, which makes the series richerand keeps us attracted to it. The animation is good and the drawing is not too complicated,which goes well with the comedic aspect of the anime. I also likes the soudtrack pretty much. The only weak point of the series, according to my opinion, is the love story that takes place in the middle of it, which weakens a little bit the action and comedic bases of the story.",

The one and only thing is CAN MY GALS WEAR MORE CLOTHING PLEASE. Everytime Elizabeth is about to get a new outfit I`m like thank God. And then it`s the same skimpy thing or even less. You can tell the artists really care for big boobs and no waist *rolls eyes* but anyways. The plot is so good. It did what was required. The only time I`ve ever read ahead in the manga is with attack on titan andI did the same for this. Iconic. Also just try it out, what I love about this anime is at the end of the seasons there is no cliffhangers like for example someone went missing or dying, there is none of that. So the creators/directors want you to have enough sleep for the next season. As I said before, iconic.",

            "content": "I dont usually write reviews for shows, but I guess my feelings on what I just watched were so strong that I just needed to write about it.\r\nThis is by far the worst anime I have seen... ever.\r\nIt's quite harsh but as a person who loves shounen, I tried super hard to find something that makes it stands out. And after comparing this with seasonal shounen like Magi and Sword Art Online(yes, even sword art online is better than this), I can't find anything at all.\r\nStory - So the story I find to be the weakest part of the anime. Good shows take previously donestorylines and plots and uses their direction, character and world to make it interesting... but none of that is done well. The settings are so similar I can show you two episodes in completely different locations and you couldn't even tell that you were in a different arc. The conflicts are for the most part, us vs them, and for a show about sins it's rarely about inner conflicts and more about what's going on around them but... the story is basically told from the very beginning and it's no shock as to what happens next at all. And i'm not talking about how the heroes win, theres much more to that when I mean predictability. \\n\\n\r\nArt - I think the story struggles a lot because of the art direction. This is going to sound weird but, the show is too god damn bright and colurful when it shouldn't be. There are some scenes that try to get you to feel emotions but when the environment is so bright, colorful and happy, who cares if someone cries? The actual animation, fight scenes and such are at least done where it looks visually pleasing, even the 3D parts which don't strain your eyes. I wouldn't say the show stands out compared to other shounen, but at least it's above average.\\n\\n\r\nSound - There's not really a lot I want to say for sound because overall, the music fit well and there wasn't too much that I disliked, but some things just weren't my taste. A criticism I have that isn't too big is that during the mid-way pauses, sometimes Hawk would make these oink noises that were just unpleasing and annoying. But thats pretty minor.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - For characters, I'm going to go over the ones I want to talk about one by one.\\n\\n\r\nBan: When it comes to characters I actually like, Ban is basically the only one. He's cool, isn't a one-dimensional character and has inner conflicts that he fights throughout the series. He's fun to watch in fights, and uses his immortality ability in a way thats fun for the viewer as well. \\n\\n\r\nMelodias: He's a very typical main protagonist for a shounen, but unlike the other tropes in the series, he's not done poorly, but I would call it average. I do think the whole broken-sword fighting was a cool aspect of his character, but everything in this series gets worse due to....\\n\\n\r\nElizabeth: This fucking character. Oh my god if MAL had a least favorites list this character would be #1 without a doubt. She is the prime example of how to make a character no one cares about into a character everybody fucking hates. For the beginning half of the series she's just crying and being well, useless despite everybody trying to help her. When she's crying I couldn't give a shit at all because it was so predictable. And her relationship with Melodias is just poorly written. She weakens every character because she tries to be something she isn't. Then we get to the conclusion of the series, and its hard to talk about it without spoiling, but this part of the story is honestly astonishing how they take this shitty character and make it worse. I'm going to talk briefly about the ending of the story, so if you want to avoid them please skip the rest of this paragraph, just know that it ruins her character. Elizabeth's plot twist fills the show with plot holes, as the idea of death is a fucking joke now. Hawk's moment specifically is treated horribly and I blame both the story and the characters for what happened with her at the end, stories should never toy whether or not a character can come back to life, and for gods sake don't fucking pull it twice in a row. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters just follow tropes and cliches and don't really do anything interesting, with a few minor exceptions. They're all incredibly 1 dimensional and as I said, Ban is the only likable and 2 dimensional character. So props to having a character I like I guess?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Didn't really enjoy the series at all, only watched because I was interested in seeing how it would end. In fact, it was actually getting gradually better up until the last 2-3 episodes where it just reminded me that this show was not worth a season 2, and I love how the series ends by reminding us that Elizabeth is coming back for another adventure and that Ban isn't. Telling, isn't it?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: just a bad show overall, if you're interested in shounen and want to see what a bad shounen is, I reccomend this. If you want to see some good shounen, Magi is probably the better option, as the first season is 25 episodes as well, and has actually interesting characters, an interesting magic system and a much more interesting world.",

Good backstories to the characters, but that was kind of it.\r\nThe visuals were pretty good. Nothing great, but still good\r\nThe music was very forgettable\r\nI really like the characters\r\nSpoiler-filled part:\r\nI'll start off with the visuals:\r\nIt was pretty good. I enjoyed the style and the animation was pretty good. Nothing great, but still pretty good.\r\nNext, characters:\r\nThis was definitely my favorite part of the show. Most of the characters had a good backstory. But there were two characters I didn't like as much.Melodias, Elizabeth, and Hawk. I'll start off with Melodias, cause he's the one I liked the most out of the three. Melodias had some parts that I liked, but it wasn't enough. He was a pervert most of the show, which made him very unlikeable. He also felt very bland. He was another shounen (I don't know if it classifies as a shounen, but whatever) main character to me. Next, Elizabeth. She didn't have any effect on the story for the longest time, she was just there to be Meliodas play doll until the end where she actually does something. And then we have Hawk. She is probably the most annoying anime character I have ever seen. She didn't have any effect on the story, other than her making Meliodas not rape Elizabeth, and she was just annoying all the time. I was happy when she died for an episode, too bad she didn't. \\n\\n\\n\r\nNext, the music:\\n\\n\r\nVery forgettable. I don't remember any of the songs. I know I liked one of the battle songs, but I already forgot it. Not terrible, just very forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNext, the story:\\n\\n\r\nThis was the thing that I liked the least. Not that I didn't like the plot as a whole. I liked the idea, the concept. But there were so many things in the story that were weird. Like King didn't get a reaction from seeing a friend that he murdered a hundred years before, Meliodas seemed to really care that the enemy took Elizabeth he didn't show any love for Elizabeth except sexual before that, why didn't ban try to kill Meliodas as fast as possible (he was going to kill Meliodas to get Elaine back from the dead) and so many more. \\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, there were things that I liked. Like the humanity in some of the villains (but those who eventually switch side. The rest aren't presented as humans)and that Elizabeth has an effect on the story (in the end. Before that, she has no purpose than to be the subject of a joke) but it was very bad in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the end, I didn't like this anime.",

Other anime (such as Darling In The Franxx - to name  but one I'm currently watching) are better on so *many* levels yet they can't even scratch an 8.0!\r\nI'll forget the novel-sized rant I put on Reddit but the main reasons I dislike this anime so much (apart from the art style - I just don't get along with it) are as follows:\r\nAmnesia!\r\nIt's a cheap writer's trick but if used well,it can be utterly amazing. Suffice to say 7 Deadly Sins not only doesn't use it well.. it uses it incredibly badly TWICE! And with the same character! That's just lazy and so, *so* bad!\\n\\n\r\nGowther.\\n\r\nGowther is by far the most uninteresting and frustrating character. He's emotionally empty and socially inept (which are things I usually empathise with in a character as I'm terrible at social cues myself etc.. So the fact that I don't like him where I normally would in an anime, is saying something!) He does dumb things that make no sense (for plot progression I presume?) that hurt people and cause ridiculous issues! There is no way a character would ever do the things he does, even a robot would have pause and reconsider its options!\\n\\n\r\nPlot holes and flashbacks.\\n\r\nIt seems like nothing in this show was planned from the start (even though I understand that it's based off of source material too?). At later points in the show they shoe-horn in flashbacks to explain what random things they've decided to happen, happened.. Someone suddenly becomes a good guy? Flashback. Someone has a new power they've never shown before? Flashback! Someone made a promise to someone and loves them where they were deadly enemies before? Flashback!\\n\\n\r\nI think at one point it was explained that someone was only a bad guy because they were being spied on the entire time or something.. I'll admit that you *do* see a raven or something in some scenes that he's in but it feels more like an animator just so happened to include the bird in the backgrounds in his scenes and they were able to quickly think up a reason for it and make it into something... \"let's put this in and think of something much later in the series for it to be\".\\n\\n\r\nAll of these flashbacks cause massive, massive plot holes and they tried to fix some of them with guess what, flashbacks!\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nI really can't understand why this show has such a high rating.. I can only guess that it's because the manga/LN has been going on for *so* long that it has a massive fan base and they'll upvote anything to do with it.. Or I've just become jaded to this kind of show and can't appreciate them anymore?",

            "content": "\"Nanatsu no Taizai\" seemed quite promising, having characters on the cover of the anime that looked colorful and diverse, like any successful Shounen anime that aired... but after watching this season, i felt that there were a number of things that was lacking in the show. Hence, my rating of the show overall had dropped to a 6, even when i first thought that it might actually be worth a 9 or 10 with its current popularity.\r\nStory: 6\r\nI found myself quite interested in some of the backstories of the Sins, such as Ban and King's. They were well written imo, but the fights in theshow were quite a letdown to me. I felt that they do not actually have a very big twist, and the outcome for almost all fights are quite predictable. After going through a few battles at the beginning, I am almost certain that the protagonists\u2019 side will always win by some means, and it always involves a new ability that would come as a surprise to the audience every time. Too many of these surprises made the show repetitive to me, and the show seemed less appealing to me as a result.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAlthough the colors used by A-1 Pictures were rich and very consistently presented throughout the world that Nanatsu no Taizai takes place in, the same cannot be said for the animations used for each characters\u2019 unique skills in battle. Powers harnessed by each of the major characters in the show do not seem impressive enough in the aesthetic sense, and they do not actually feel truly special to any one of the characters. The attacks always seem to look the same to me, always accompanied by a flash of white light followed by a huge lump of debris being thrown about. (e.g. Gil\u2019s lightning attacks feel almost the same with every strike, regardless of how differently he says it; the lightning animation is always the same, making the attacks and fights seem really bland and boring.) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\r\nThe music was pretty decent! OST sounded good (especially Perfect Time), and the 2nd Opening was a nice shounen tune to hype me up for the episodes. MAN WITH A MISSION does a good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nWhen Meliodas started to hunt down his former comrades, I thought that it was going to be promising when it started off by meeting Ban and Diane. Altho Diane's lines were pretty disappointing and somewhat cheesy, Ban's backstory and lines were pretty smooth. But after seeing Gowther and Merlin, they just seemed like they were having different personalities just for the sake of being different members of the group. Although they do seem like characters with some depth, I feel like they had way more potential than this, and that their characters weren't as nicely fleshed out as someone like Ban. King was pretty decent tho. Hopefully we will see some more development in the ongoing Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4\\n\r\nThis was pretty saddening for me. The show came strong with its first 5-6 episodes and got me hooked, but the premise of the show started to get pretty boring. The main antagonist for the season turned out to be someone that didn't get developed well in the season, with the help of only a handful of short flashbacks to get to know the dude. I found myself more interested in finding out who the next member of the Sins was and their backstories, and didn't really enjoy the rest of the season after that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6 \\n\r\nWith all that negative stuff being said, I still feel that Nanatsu no Taizai wields the influence of a Shounen genre heavyweight and rightfully so, even being one of the more happening series in WSM. It just isn't an objectively good anime in my opinion, and dulls in comparison to some other Shounen shows that i happen to watch.",

            "content": "To begin this review, I\u2019d like to say that if you\u2019re looking for a show with an exceptionally deep plot line which shatters cliches and is groundbreaking in its storytelling, this anime is not for you. But if you\u2019re fine with watching a lighted hearted, superhero-style, comfort food show which you can watch without getting anxiety over which major character is going to be killed off next, then Seven Deadly Sins is very good.\r\n   The characters are definitely the series\u2019s strongest point. Most of the characters, including both the Sins and the Holy Knight antagonists, are unique in both personalityand design. The interactions between the characters is usually light and comedic, but still goes a long way in developing them as people. Both the protagonist\u2019s and antagonist\u2019s motivations are plainly  expressed, which was very refreshing (even if the characters\u2019 reasoning was a but silly at times). Many of the Sins are especially likeable, with Ban, King, and Gowther being the most interesting. Ban is almost used as a Deadpool-type character (because of his ability to regenerate from literally anything) and there\u2019s a running gag where he gets punched in half or blown up and nobody really cares (including himself). \\n\\n\r\n   This isn\u2019t to say I didn\u2019t have a problem with any of the characters; Melodias, the Captain of the Sins, is an immortal with the appearance and intelligence of a fifteen year old. He\u2019s also pretty much the most basic and annoying piece of shit you could write into a show. He\u2019s overpowered as all hell, and literally pulls a new god-tier power out of his ass every episode. In addition, he is a molester and pervert, who gropes the female lead at every possible moment. This is probably meant to be funny, but the joke usually falls flat because it doesn\u2019t really fit into anything else going on. \\n\\n\r\n   Speaking of the female lead, Elizabeth- a princess of the very stereotypical fantasy kingdom- is such a badly written character. She\u2019s literally just a pair of giant tits who exists purely for fan service and for Melodias to molest. She does nothing, has no personality, and is a literal detriment to the team. Even Hawk, the annoying talking animal sidekick, was more interesting and useful than Elizabeth. Also, she falls in love with Melodias from the instant she meets him solely because he\u2019s op as hell (which is a terrible, overused cliche). Even so, the show isn\u2019t really sexist; Diane the giant is intimidating on paper (although she doesn\u2019t really use her hyped up strength to any great effect) and there are several female Holy Knights who were fairly well fleshed out and kicked major ass. The major detriment to the characters was probably the overuse of fan-service (the female protagonists outfits and Melodias\u2019s fondness for sticking his head up skirts) which was really unfortunate because, overall, this aspect of the show was really very strong.\\n\\n\r\n The overall story is very, very cliche fantasy, which is not inherently a bad thing if you like that sort of thing. Even so, I found the world-building to be very weak, and it almost seemed as if the writers were randomly throwing different fantasy cliches into the story as it went along. King Arthur even randomly made an appearance, and I was just like \u201chuh?\u201d But keeping the fantasy monster-mash in mind, the plot was paced so that along with the great characters (not you melodias), it kept me interested and entertained. \\n\\n\r\n   The soundtrack was alright, but the ending song to the first half actually caught my attention. It fit well with the overall ~aesthetic~ and along with the shot of the Sins\u2019 wanted posters waving in the wind, it was actually kind of cool. Or maybe it wasn\u2019t, and I\u2019m just goofy as hell. Who knows. Anyway, the art and animation is very well done, and it\u2019s obvious the show had quite the budget behind it. \\n\\n\r\n   Overall, I enjoyed it. It had quite a lot of flaws, but none that were so heinous I wasn\u2019t able to overlook them and see the show for what it was. Will some people dislike this show? Certainly. Will some people despise this show? Certainly. But I enjoyed it, was entertained by it, and felt like my time was well-spent in the end. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\\n",

This for my money is the difference between Ah My Goddess! and Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid. It's also the difference between The Seven Deadly Sins and Fairy Tail. Sure, friendship is a wonderful thing, but we don't need to be reminded of this every 10 minutes or so (a slight exaggeration, just go with it).\r\nThe Seven Deadly Sins is one of the better shonen series currently floating around out there, withlikable characters matching those of every other shonen series, decent animation and character design. Its story doesn't relegate itself to telling a long succession of story arcs. Instead it focuses on just one season-long arc, which at times plays out more like a Fire Emblem game than your typical shonen anime. There's also a noticeable lack of plot armour here, with our heroes facing a lot of tense situations throughout.\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably me being presumptuous, but any Fairy Tail fan looking for a more mature approach to storytelling without losing any fun elements could do a lot worse than check this out.",

            "content": "Honestly, I had very few expectations going into the anime. I knew that this had been famous for quite some time, but I've been pretty out of the anime loop until recently and my standards for Shonen anime have sadly dropped a lot. I don't have a certain style of anime that I really love( I've watched it all from yaoi to comedy to shonen), I just like a well written plot. I don't mean that it has to be super deep or very out of the ordinary, but rather something that keeps me interested. Usually, for shonen, the characters tend to be placed onthe back seat while the plot and the fighting and whatever, probably war, that is going on is a lot more emphasized than character development. In terms of this textbook formula, Nanastu no Taizai is not that different. It has the classic over-powered male character with the somewhat damsel in distress type female lead. But I will give it this-- it kept me interested. A lot of shonen have a bunch of fillers and nonsensical episodes that just show off how strong the male lead is, but Nanastu no Taizai used each episode to further the plot, even if a majority of it was fighting. The anime did also make me pretty invested in each character. Although there was a severe lack of character development, with arguably only one character having any sort of personal journey, each character did have their unique quirks and abilities and their backstories and such made them a bit more flushed out in terms of character portrayal. Another thing that Nanastu no Taizai did really well was it kept a balance. I mean this in two ways. One, it balanced out the comedy and slightly more plot heavy aspects of the show, and though shonen typically don't have massive problems with this, it becomes a real deal-breaker when the writers are trying to be funny and failing. Secondly, and much more importantly to me, Nanastu no Taizai established a few rules and actually stuck to them. This a problem I see in a lot of shonen anime. It starts off well and within some boundaries of reason, but as the show progresses, the writers start to really stretch my suspension of disbelief in an effort to make characters seem more and more powerful. That is my #1 pet peeve of shonen anime. It just becomes repetitive and really irritating when characters just have these unexplained add-ons in terms of ability. That, to me, is just a sign of sloppy writing and I usually just stop watching the anime or have to mentally prepare myself to watch the standard of the anime to drop severely. I am very happy to say Nanastu no Taizai did not have this problem.\\n\\n\r\nOn a separate note, I like the animation. It was, once again, not anything super special, but it was easy on the eyes and well executed. The fighting scenes looked really nice as well. Other than that, there's not much to be said about the visual aspect of it. I did like the music though. The one hype song that came up during the really intense fight scenes was really nice. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say that Nanastu no Taizai is a pretty typical shonen anime, but it is well executed and well thought out. I would recommend it to any Naruto or Fairy Tail or other classic shonen fan. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nOverall this is a good show. The story is a little by the numbers though and there are quite a few beats where you'll be left scratching your head at how convoluted some things can be. Overall though its and enjoyable enough story, just very underwhelming and not really anything to write home about. If you're looking for an anime to watch and turn your brain off, this is (mostly) the show you're looking for. Plus its on netflix (which most people have) so its easy to get a hold of and binge without having to worry about subpar subs or dubs.\r\n I just wishthat the sins werent so heavily established as being absurdly OP. It takes a lot of tension out of most of the fights. Even at the end when they fight whats basically the devil it becomes hard to think that meliodas or the sins are going to lose. Though admittedly that issue is mostly fixed towards the end when it starts to look like the sins are capable of losing. Which happens more than you would think based off of the first few episodes. Also there are a few too many unresolved plot lines and unanswered questions for a 24 episode series for my liking. But luckily it (mostly) doesnt take away from your enjoyment while watching the show. Just while thinking about it\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIts good. Lots of fun, action, and the character designs really stand out. its all pretty well animated. My only gripe with the character designs however do have to do with the minor characters. They all look very drab and basic compared to the Sins. So much so that it sort of helps with the story at some times. In particular, the main villain(s). They just look so basic and uniteresting that you wont realize that their the villain until its made very obvious that they are. Which helps, but at the same point, certainly does the story no favors, as it makes the villains seem forgettable. Which I would argue isnt exactly a bad thing, if the show were shorter. With a show's arc running over 13 episodes, I would argue that the villains need to have more substance to them. But that might just be me. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSounds good. Neat music, basic enough score. Moving on. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\n6 out of the 8 main characters are pretty dope characters. Diane is adorable but not overly so where she becomes annoying or is made into a damsel. The princess isnt exactly going to be a feminist icon but her goals are made clear and she is very relatable overall. King has got to hit way too close to home for lots of weebs and neckbeards that will watch the show, but not in an overly cringey way, certainly not in an unhealthy way. Ban at first seems incredibly annoying but by the time you learn his backstory and his cooking skills get rid of one of the most annoying running gags in the series you'll learn to love him too. And Gowther seems like they could be a great LGBT character, though I wish they were given more backstory (more than what we got anyway) so maybe in season 2 (which just started airing at the time of my writing this review). And Merlin, while having an overly fanservicey design still has an intruging air of mystery about her to make watching her interesting. Though I certainly wish that we would get more of her (looks like we will in season 2). Even some of the minor characters, despite having mostly dull designs are incredibly well developed and fleshed out. It leaves you wanting to root for them.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are two massive issues with the show, and they are two of the main three characters that we follow through most of the series! bwah bwahhhhhhh. Meliodas is wayyyyy too overpowered. Like. Stupidly so. At first you think it might be fun to watch like in One Punch Man or Mob Psycho 100. But nope. Its everything that people think One Punch Man would be when they heard the pitch. The fight scenes involving him are robbed of all tension, and its just annoying. Plus he's a massive perv. Which they try to play off as cute, but despite his 12 year old body, he's still like forty or some shit. Probably way older. Just makes me hate him more. Also he keeps secrets from his best friends for little to no reason. Hes an awful leader. Ask anyone who has held a job for more than a month. Good leaders communicate. Meliodas doesnt communicate. He just asks and takes. He sucks and I hate him. \\n\\n\r\nThe other massive issue with the show is the pig, Hawk. He's not cute. He's annoying AF. He constantly tries to be endearing but it jsut doesnt pay off. None of his jokes land. He's like if your 14 year old cousin's instagram account was made into an anime talking pig. It especially sucks when they try to make him into the emotional core of the show. It just takes you out of it completely and there were several parts thoughout the end of the show where my eyes rolled so far into the back of my head I could see into my skull and see the aneurism that this stupid fucking pig was giving me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed everything but the pig, meliodas, and the lack of stakes as a result of meliodas or my hatred for said pig. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nWould recommend, but only to those such as myself who also have no lives and are free to complain about pigs in a japanese cartoon on an internet forum post that nobody will ever read. Or if you want to get fucking drunk while binging an anime. (Take a drink everytime meliodas or one of the sins is stupid OP, only rule)",

From this moment anime was becoming less and less enjoyable. This whole seriousness felt pushed, fake and sometimes even cringe. Especially around romance threads - almost all of them turned cheesy, unnatural and one (I'm looking at you, Ban...) even a bit of sick. Nanatsu no Taizai's humor wasn't very subtle but at least it was, and alltogether with nice dynamics and bit of fanservice it was just matching as a simple entertainment. When anime decided to became serious, the whole funwas gone. If I want feels, I'd watch a nice written drama, not something which is by definition written as simple, flat and uncomplicated. What is nice for humor and action, won't get along well with different threads. What a pity, Nanatsu, you failed here. I'm not regreting spending time with it but I'm not gonna watch 2nd season nor read the manga.",

This review will be surface level, very short, and basically devoid of spoilers.\r\nI personally really loved this series. I have been putting off watching any shounens for a while because of the typical tropes that have become so prevalent in each one with very similar and predictable plots. This anime took me by surprise, while it still had some typical shounen aspects, it felt very original. Whether it be the characters or the plot, itall felt very refreshing and I was genuinely excited for each new episode. The end of the series left me craving for more so, while I'm not usually one to read manga, I may end up actually picking up this series.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that may put some people off is the ecchi tag, but I feel like that the \"ecchi moments\" were few and far between so they didn't take away from the series although ecchi has never really bothered me personally. I think my only real gripe with the show was Hawk. I really have grown to despise the token talking animal/creature character in these types of series but that's just me. I didn't really enjoy the endless flow of \"scraps\" and \"pork\" jokes thrown in every other episode either. \\n\\n\r\nOverall wonderful series, I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun/feel good fantasy action series with OP characters.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Seven Deadly Sins\u2014Known for its ecchi(although it actually doesn't have much) and its overpowered main character(can't disagree), its one of the post popular shows made by A-1 Pictures. This is a tale much like Yona of the Dawn, a princess gathers a strong group to bring down the powerful enemies.Its a thrilling adventure\u2014and nothing less.\r\nStory(8) Like I said, it is very much like Yona of the Dawn. The story is captivating because the main point is to gather the most powerful people, which is extremely exciting. They also have to bring down their common enemy, the Holy Knights. However, this type of story isn't unique,which is why it's not a ten.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9) The art has a special bubbly feeling to it. Especially the character designs of Meliodas and Elizabeth, the art doesn't seem to have a dark and serious setting. The colors are bright, and the backgrounds and castles look wonderful. Not much else to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound(9) The first intro I really loved, a lot more than the second one. It had one of those catchy tunes that you will remember forever. The sound effected the show a lot, and the sound tracks of the battle scenes and death scenes were amazing. The part where Elaine gave the water to Ban had THE MOST EFFECT ON ME, especially with the fiery art and the ABSOLUTELY AMAZING music that played at that scene. That scene was one of the most impactful I have ever watched in anime.  The sound and music are a BIG part of this anime's feel.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7) The part that's lacking in this show is the characters, and the character development. The characters all have different powers, and different strengths. Its easy to notice the difference between them, which is why many people would like the characters. However, compared to Yona of the Dawn, the character development isn't great. Sure, there are a few short flashbacks here and there, but it doesn't go in depth to each of the individual characters. This show would be much better if we knew the characters and their backstories more, especially Meliodas. The characters are also \"flat characters,\" which means that they don't change too much throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall(8): This show was enjoyable, and it was fun seeing Meliodas destroy many people. The fight scenes were great, and there was even some decent comedy in there. I would have liked to see more developments between the characters and their interactions with each other. Overall, this was a very enjoyable show .",

            "content": "I didn\u2019t enjoy this show, but it had some redeeming qualities. The best way I can put it is that The Seven Deadly Sins is like a strawberry smoothie with a little mucus mixed in. Ban and Gilthunder and King\u2019s past are some of the absolute best things about this show. I enjoyed the slow development of who the big bad bosses really were and some information about Meliodas\u2019 true origin. Fight scenes are nicely-executed as well. \r\nHowever, I was really turned off by the copious blood vomits/spit-takes (it's like the blood spews out in two forms: bite-sized nuggets and water hose pressure DX), Meliodas\u2019gropey-grabby hands (the fanservice feels icky and too contrived; sorry not sorry), and Elizabeth\u2019s utter uselessness (I swear her personality is \u201cbest girl\u201d; I don\u2019t care too much about moe chicks). The piggy character runs its mouth too much for me, but it fulfilled the animal sidekick role well enough.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I love romance as I\u2019m always reading a good shoujo, but I didn\u2019t care for Elizabeth\u2019s undying love for our golden boy. I actually preferred Ban\u2019s thinly-developed love more even though I can\u2019t stand lolicon stuff. \\n\r\nThe story moved too slowly in certain episodes before picking up an exciting pace toward the 20\u2019s.  \\n\\n\r\nMISC: ANIMATION, VOICE ACTING\\n\r\nAs far as the English dub, I thought the voices were good. I think each voice fit its character well though Elizabeth\u2019s voice is sickly sweet and her crying leaves a lot to be desired. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is very fluid and smooth, but some of the bodies look weirdly proportionate (i.e Griamore and Elizabeth).\\n\\n\r\nThe music is beautiful and empathy-inducing. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nIs it worth watching? For me, I would\u2019ve dropped this show much quicker if it weren\u2019t for Ban and the interesting build-up to a satisfying end. But for something I found on Netflix, it is pretty entertaining. For all its stupid moments, there is a lot of heart, great characters, and foreshadowing. Give it a try!\\n",

            "content": "I agree with the top guy's review, the plot is too generic and character development is too rushed. \r\n[Light spoiler ahead]\r\nSo, we got power level thing, nice. Things gonna be more exciting because there will be no stupid protagonist comeback overpowering enemy much more powerful than him in the last minute... I was wrong. \r\nThe fight is basically only a show for overpowered characters while everyone else sit back and watch, maybe helping a bit by cleaning up useless troops.\r\n\"If we help him we are only going to be a burden for him.\"\r\nWeak character exist only for diversity, until the author decide to power himup.\\n\\n\r\nFirst you got useless meliodas that can barely defeat guila 3 vs 1, the next day he regained his power and one hit everyone, then 10 commandments come, he gained more power AGAIN in few days and suddenly become the strongest. Thats okay i guess, he is supposed to be the strongest, he lived through the holy war afterall.\\n\\n\r\nBut what about his 2 other comrades that also got 10x stronger overnight?? It's like the author can not think of ways for the protagonists to stand a chance against OP commandments other than sudden powercreeps. I feel like the number is bullshit and not a rational one, i dont think 20 holy knights with 4000 power level can fight against the weakest of commandments.\\n\\n\r\nEmotional story is build only from romance, and memory erase. Like, everyone is fucking losing their memory, and then they started to cry. Or they got someone they loved killed in a war. The only thing that surprise me is they keep doing that over and over again when i thought they will have something else. Everything is so shallow its lame, not emotional at all.\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea why I'm still reading the manga, maybe I still have that expectation for nanatsu no taizai, I like the concept very much and still waiting for the author to come up with a more interesting plot. \\n\\n\r\n\"Maybe things will get more interesting next chapter..\"\\n\r\n- me, while quickly reading through the boring fights and conversations.",

Especially when they provide with the backstory of them, it really brings new light into the anime and lets you watch it with the considerations of the characters' past.\\n\\n\r\nThere were many things that was left open ended and it was not one of the things that are \"left to the viewer's interpretation-type thing.\" So I'm definitely still expecting a continuation or something of that sort.\\n\\n\r\nThis was probably the most fan service anime I've watched - I typically try to avoid those kinds of anime if I knew it were included; but I guess I have to encounter it some time or another right?\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I think it's a pretty good anime to watch in your free time.",

Could be because of the predictable characters, but for some reason I'm into things like that. \r\nThe art style is appealing. It's very unique for what it is. I think it was risky considering everyone would end up looking alittle too goofy with those button noses, but it actually looks cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is unique in the fact that I can't think of many other anime that have touched on the seven deadly sins. Obviously Fullmetal Alchemist is known for its brilliant incorporation of the sins in its plot, though this anime has decided to portray them in a more fun, lighthearted manner which I find is very refreshing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, breddy good.",

From that point on it is beautifully crafted, full throttle action. Everything leading up to those last 6-7 episodes becomes a whole lot clearer and you can really sit back and enjoy everything you've seen. \r\nI will admit that personally, I am someone who is bothered when anime/television programs take a while to kick in.

I felt compelled to continue watching this series in full despite not knowing where it was truly going until three quarters through, and when it finally got down to business it really made me take a step back and appreciate everything I had seen up until that point.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this anime is far from perfect, it is definitely worth the watch. I have high hopes for the second season.",

It completely reverses the idea of the Seven Deadly Sins and uses it in interesting ways. The character's personalities do not reflect the sins they each represent, but their past does. However, most characters are forgettable and one-dimensional. None of these characters feel like they could be actual people personality wise, they're all walking talking fucking archetypes that don't develop in any way. The only decent character is Ban, who actually has different layers of his personality, an interesting background, and other goalsthan just reclaiming the kingdom. The music is fantastic and the action scenes, while not anything special, are pretty entertaining. However, without good characters to carry the series forward, it shows you all the worst of the shonen genre with not enough positives to make up for it.",

Some minor flaws of course, but still great. \r\n Now, the name may put some people off, seeing as how many countless anime are based off of the (Catholic) seven deadly sins, however, i didn't find this a problem for once. Most likely because for one, the sins were the good guys AND were really interesting and had in depth backstories that i find all unique.\r\nNow of course, like i said, there are flaws. I am NOT a fan of \"ecchi\".  I more orless tolerate it. The main reason being is i do not like the over-sexualisation of women. (They are not objects and are to be treated equally).  Saying that, what upset me the most, was how such a great character such as elizabeth was put into such skimpy outfits, and constantly molested by one of the MCs constantly. (people like that piss me off, in real life and out)  \\n\\n\r\n*Ahem* Anyway, overall this has everything a good story needs. A great setting, great Characters, a good comic relief, a good villain, a good mystery, and so on. The only downside to this story, is that it's not over yet.  The manga continues the story, and (i haven't watched them yet but) there are a few OVAs.  I am not a big manga fan mostly because i just prefer anime to it.  (as a side note, i also liked how colorful this anime was) \\n\\n\r\nOverall, i say give it a try.  I say till about episode 5 or so.",

            "content": "Nanatsu no Taizai was a series that I brushed off at first due to its \"ecchi\" tag. But thankfully, I was convinced that I should give this anime a short despite having such a genre. However, I was pleased that the ecchi elements were extremely minimal in this and its definitely not the focus of the show at all. \r\nLet us first start off with the mediocre parts of this anime. The plot, sadly, is extremely clich\u00e9 and overused, something like your typical shonen material. The main female protagonist of the series is your seemingly typical damsel in distress, the one in need of constantsaving, to the point it gets slightly annoying. And additionally, it has considerably many deus ex machine moments. BUT the strange thing about this series, is that many of its weakest points are also its strongest if seen from another perspective. \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing of the plot is done extremely well, with a more lighthearted beginning (although there were many serious moments in the first few episodes) and as the plot progresses and the story starts to unveil itself to be the complex and thrilling plot that it is. It goes beyond a one-dimensional and simplistic story, to bring to the viewers something that is both visually stunning with its wonderful fight scenes as well as emotionally resonating. This show made me shed quite a few tears and there will be FEELZ. The show tries to trick you at the start of the series, rendering you more confused as the episodes follow, only to reveal plot twists that I personally think was presented in such a beautiful way. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, THE CHARACTERS URGHH WHERE DO I BEGIN? ;_; They are all really really precious and I honestly can't pick a favourite because they are all unique and lovable in their own ways. Each of them is tied together with a sin, but in contrast to what I thought at first, the sins do not represent their personality at all so don't be fooled into thinking that the cast is a bunch of one-dimensional unrealistic characters. I can't reveal too much about the other characters because they are slowly introduced as the episodes come along, and meeting them one by one was really such a fun experience for me. Their backstories are captivating and will have you rooting for them because you will subconsciously empathise with their pains and misery, although much has yet to be revealed but no worries a season 2 is already in its makings! \\n\\n\r\nSoundwise, both openings were pure awesomeness and set the right tone for such an awesome anime. The first ending theme will make you want to get up and dance and the sadder/slower second ending really sets the change in mood in the later half of the show. The battle themes are also really amazing. Although the story consists of subplots, everything is woven nicely together and overall it was such a joy to watch this I hope you will like it too! \\n\\n\\n\r\n many may pass it off as just another series to join the excessively hyped shonen realm along with other popular series.",

            "content": "The Seven Deadly Sins is the light beer of anime. The anime seems like FMA:B and Attack on Titan had a shitty baby. No really. The Seven Deadly Sins all have red marks on their bodies, like the ones in FMA. But unlike the Sins in FMA, these Sins aren't actually afflicted with their sins, especially Lust. (No really, when you meet Lust, you'll be just as confused as the characters in the show.) On the other end of the spectrum, it seems like Greed is a direct rip from FMA. Everything about him is the same.\r\nThere are countless times in the show where aplot line just stops. It was like the writers wanted so desperately to breathe some life into this corpse of an anime, but corporate wouldn't let them. At one point, it seems as though we are going to get introduced to a conflict within the Sins, but two episodes later: \"...no hard feelings right?\" and it's gone. And I was actaully looking forward to an actual character conflict like we had in FMA. It would have been easy, since this is the same show, but shittier. Actually, there are only two characters with this high level internal conflict in the show, and they aren't even main characters. (In the four episodes following the first season, which apparently shift the anime from action/adventure to romcom, they have cumulatively about fifteen lines.)\\n\\n\r\nNext, there are characters whose attitude changes completely, which isn't really a plot hole, but completely unnecessary. But let's talk characters. Elizabeth, can you chill? Why are you always crying? I get the writers were going for a Winry type character, but honestly, just stop. They use her to try to force the cliche \"inspiring anime monologue,\" to fill a few minutes in the show. \"I'll keep fighting for you even if I'm dead.\" Dude, shut up.\\n\\n\r\nOne more point about plot. I don't mind if anime stick to cliches at all, but if you're fighting, don't take your eyes off the enemy. Nearly half the times where a character is \"down for the count\" is when they took their eyes off their opponent. Just...lazy writing in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the whole show is predictable. If you have any sense of stroytelling, you'll be able to pick out the \"twist\" at the end in the first four episodes.\\n\\n\r\nHere are it's redeeming qualities: epic sound track, the art is actually decent, and there are some great supporting characters who aren't squeaky ass \"comic relief if you can even call it that\" pigs.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like Sword Art Online, you'll like this.\\n\\n\r\n4/10",

Story wise it's rather exciting, although not much actually happened in the 24 episodes - but I believe there's so much room for development of further episodes as evidenced by the manga. Going on to read the manga now and it is indeed entertaining! Love every single character and rly enjoyed the backstory of Ban, King and Diane (as explored further in the manga). Elizabeth is also extremely sweet and likeable, unlike other female MCs there solely as a romantic interest. However she's not very well developed and ratherone dimensional, but still likeable nonetheless (: looking forward to S2 already!",

            "content": "For an anime produced by A-1 Pictures, I was impressed. Compared to Fairy Tail and Sword Art Online, the content was a lot more mature. By mature, I'm speaking of sexual innuendo, fluidity of combat, and blood spillage. Many a time do characters die, or come close to dying, as Nanatsu no Taizai is a clash of epic powers. For an anime of its length, I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer quantity of power and strength in so many characters.\r\nThe premise: a princess searches for a group of powerful fighters known as the Seven Deadly Sins, each so named for committing a Sin inthe past. Now these guys, whenever a new one joins the team, boy you're continually stunned by his/her abilities. Their opponents? The kingdom's Holy Knights, each with his or her own unique abilities. Compared to the fighting in Fairy Tail, the combat here is much more fast-paced and visually enrapturing, so much so that I looked forward to watching more episodes just for that aspect.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this series shares some similarities with Naruto and Bleach and I won't say why but after you watch it you'll understand what I mean. They have to do with greater power within and the corrupted search for even more power.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was very good, openings and endings superb. Animation was pretty clear. In terms of character development, since the members of the Seven Deadly Sins don't all show up at once, not much really can happen. Some deep and dark things happened in the past, which continually haunt and shadow several of the main characters' current personalities and motivations. I'll just say that Ban is one of my favorite anime characters of all time.",

Because here's your typical one, surfing on familiar waves such as Fairy Tail and Dragon Ball, bringing its own share of epic. So, if the answer is yes, it's unlikely you won't enjoy the show.\r\nEven without spoilers, you know what to expect of that kind of anime simply from the genre they belong to; that's the problem with stereotypes and this show is no exception. In fact, it doesn't even try to break the stall, doesn't try to run free and surpriseyou, or to amaze you in some way or another. Instead, it gives the feeling of honestly doing its job, and with enjoyment. What could be seen as a flaw leaves eventually a rather good impression. Yes, it's classic! Nevertheless, the story is very decent and the protagonists offer enough interest in every aspect of their characterization to make them more than likeable (now, I love giants). In the end, everything contributes to a very entertaining show, well-paced, which doesn't take his audience for fools and simply shares a common passion for the genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe art might look a bit weak or old-fashioned, but it's not a bother and, somehow, it contributes to the charming and colorful Dragon Ball side. That, and fist fights, super powers, transformations and the quest side. From Fairy Tail we got more of a general tone, with heroic fantasy, magic, mysterious pasts and motivations, friendship and dedication. So, once again, even without exploits in the direction and average animation, the job is pleasantly done.\\n\\n\r\nEnough to say the best part is there will be sequels.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

Supposedly the strongest, most fearsome of these knights, the Seven Deadly Sins, betrayed the kingdom and made enemies of all the other knights. But Princess Elizabeth didn't believe this story, and sets out to find the Sins - but when she meets the first Sin at a tavern (Melodias, the dragon sin of Wrath) he's not what she expected. But even so they set out to find the other sins and thus started theirepic adventure, filled with action, a bit of strange romance, humor and mystery. \\n",

            "content": "I feel like this anime could have been much better. The premise is good, the character design is good, the settings is interesting. But the story flow and the decision making of the author makes this anime/series annoyingly tedious. I mean, why would you hype your protagonists to be the strongest of the knights who could dispose of dozens, but then, only show them struggle with a meager one or two half-assed not even fully-fledged knight. It's inane and unwarranted. Having the main characters struggle and lose, is I know, a part of the story. But them, being the strongest knights, to lose at eachand every turn. To be beaten by each and every minor villains. They, being the legends that they are, never did once beat an fodder villain effortlessly. It's counter-intuitive and annoying. The payback period is so long. At least show us the Sins overwhelm minor characters once or twice. I mean really, 3 of the sins against a minor character at the beginning, and they can't seem to take her on? What's up with their supposed strength. This anime/series could be so much better with a proper balance and clear distinction of strength and power. Imagine, it's the first arc and the much hyped \"legendary\" sins are already getting their asses handed to them. That's idiotic.",
