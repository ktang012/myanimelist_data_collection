            "content": "What is right and wrong? Who decides this anyway? When the time comes, will you do things based on what you think is right, or what other people say is?\r\nWhen I first started watching this, it was some form of a \"guilty pleasure\" decision, while I thought it was going to be just another under-developed hentai (or half-hentai, as I used to call it). I was very pleasantly surprised.\r\nBelieve me, this is NOT a hentai. Yes, the main character does have sex with multiple girls over the course of the series, but these scenes have a meaning. More important thing is how they got toit, the story behind each girl, more than just the act of having sex.\\n\\n\r\nThis was made after a visual novel, so it's reasonable that every girl gets a story. Still, in this anime, stories are seperated from each other and only in the last arc, some of the elements from other ones come together. It is obvious that every story, a lot of things change related to each other, but I think it would be more correct to say that the only thing that's really changed is one: the main character.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why I started watching this anime, was the art. Everything was done fluid and crisp; I equally enjoyed watching the nature and surroundings, and... hmm... body parts. (lol) The people seem real, and the girls are differently built (I really hate it when in anime, all girls look the same). The endings of each episode are made using chibi art, with normal one only used during a ecchi scene. I thought Akira's enourmous chibi head was hilarious, though xD\\n\\n\r\nSound is great too, both voice actors and music. The background music was done nicely, and it didn't feel weird in any part.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, the characters seem chiched and boring: tsundere girl, meganekko slut, awkward class president, childish/mature girl convo... but at the end almost every character has depth.\\n\r\nDuring the different timelines, as Haruka's personality changes for a little, girls' personalities change a little too. Maybe out of jealousy, the non-main girls become much less likeable than they are in their own arc, even though it is made that the personalities are believable: they didn't change the essence, only circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka is a main character out of the cliche from the very beginning. Even though he isn't one of the typical male harem leads, he seems a little too perfect; nice and charming, so much that all the girls love him. Though, he is a \"Prince Charming\" only on the surface; when the time comes for it, he becomes undecisive and weak. The thing changing over the acrs isn't only the girl he likes, it's his personality as well. Even though, in the end, he always stays the same.\\n\\n\r\nSora is a troubled girl, so much that you can't actually hate her, even if you try. She is clingy, moody, dishonest and insecure, maybe because of the time spent at a hospital that made her delicate like a doll. But, unlike Haru, she knows exactly what she wants and doesn't care what others'll think about it. And it is, being with Haru.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main arc's, the other timelines' heroines were likeable too: at the start, Nao seems annoying for some reason, but every time there is a need, whichever timeline, she is there to help like an older sister of some sort. Akira reminds me of those theather masks that only have smile on them: regardless the situation, she will mask everything with a smile. Kazuha tries and tries to be like a strict older sister, despite her real gentle personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe order of arcs was the backwards one of my enjoyment as well. I liked the Kazuha one the least, Akira a little more, and so. Motoka chibis in the ending were hilarious, too.\\n\\n\r\nIf insecure, try to make the best decision possible. At the end, at least one person must be hurt, and that is the natural course of things. When loving someone, you shouldn't care what other people think or say. That's what I think, at least!\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this \"half-hentai\" a lot more than I previously thought. :)",

            "content": "First of all, lets make things clear. THERE ARE SEX SCENES WITHIN THIS SERIES!! and this component usually makes people want to simply watch this series as a hentai. If you are planning on doing so, you will be trading a GREAT anime with a HORRIBLE hentai because those scenes are short and not very exciting. Instead, the sex scenes create an unique mood for the story development.\r\nStory 9/10 Yosuga no sora was originally a PC visual novel, this means that the story cannot possibly lack content. The story is very unique, instead of having a million girls liking the main character at the sametime, the story focuses on one heroine for a few episodes then goes back to a \"save point\" and starts a new story with the next one. \\n\\n\r\nI have to split the art part into two.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral art (how the characters look) 8/10\\n\r\nMood art (what makes the current situation or story more interesting)10/10    The art of this anime is capable of completely expressing the character's feelings. The artist is not simply making the characters blush and changing the eyes and eyebrows to express a character's emotions. Instead, the artist uses the body language of the characters. ( the way a character is standing, sitting, lying down, getting f**ked) \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 The voice acting for most characters is very satisfying.\\n\r\nThe background music and sounds were generally good. ( with a few scenes that have great background music and sounds) The opening is one of my favorite anime openings. The op song beautifully expresses the general feeling of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 In general (because I might flood the review with my own opinions and lower the quality since i have too much to say\uff09The character portrayal is great, partially thanks to the art; each character has a very unique and attractive personality which also makes the individuality of the characters extremely strong. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 The only thing holding me back from giving this series a 10/10 for enjoyment is the intense conflicts made one episode seem very long and made me want to take a break. Which is also the reason this anime is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI would suggest this series to everyone, especially people who likes interesting conflicts and romance.\\n\\n\r\nPS: The visual novel is still much better so why not give the VN a chance while you're at it. Both the art and music are amazing and the stories are more developed in the VN :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Normally I don't review series, even if I really love them, but one very negative review on this series that I bumped into prompted me to want to give it as much credit as possible. \r\nI am a 18 year old girl. I love anime, but I'm not anti-social or any other stereotype that really fits otaku. I have plenty of friends who think anime in general is weird. And I, possibly the most 'normal' out of all my otaku friends, LOVED this anime.\r\nThe art is amazing. especially when contrasted with the characters. I adored how they made the lead male a bishi without havinghis character be a total soft-hearted pussy, like they do in almost every harem anime I've ever seen!\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, normally I don't even go for harem anime, but this one was very... sincere? I think that's a good way to put it. It really made the best of each arch, so that I felt good and satisfied when the happy ending was reached for each pairing. Even the twincest arch, which I'd never have pinned myself as being a particular fan of.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all this, the voice acting is very high quality. A lot of the time, what I find in more obscure anime, especially ones like this, is that they supplement their budget by having crappy voice actors. Not Yosuga no Sora. The voice acting was actually very noticeably better than even some mainstream stuff out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the rating should depend on what you're looking for. When I try to rate anime, I do it based on how someone looking for that genre would rate it. Like, I wouldn't grade Code Geass by the same criteria I would grade Princess Princess. So, that being taken into account, this is an awesome series for those who can go into it with an open mind, and look at the good qualities. The soft-core porn is just a bonus XP\\n",

            "content": "I am at lost for words for this anime.. Hmm.. Give me a moment. Ok now, I  was expecting this to be a harem themed anime but unfortunately, the whole \"Give each girl a seperate arc\" theme that Amagami SS brought in ruined the whole harem genre. However, at least this new style killed many \"THIS IS GOING TO END LIKE SCHOOL DAYS!\" trolls along with it.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nBelieve it or not this actually have a story to it! And a pretty decent one too! However if you're a pacifist then Im sure you'll enjoy it because it deals with a lot of negative emotionssurrounding the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnd did I mention Incest? Yes, like many Autumn line up this year, this one is incest themed, but only for the final arc. Most probably if you read the other reviews, they would have given a low rating due to \"promoting incestuous relationship\"\\n\r\nHey, Im ok with incest, Im ok with homosexuality, but I am definetely not ok with Incestuous homosexuals! (Luckily for me, this anime has none)\\n\\n\r\nBack to the story, every important girl in this anime is given the arc, even the maid in her little amusing chibi skit. (Except for the class president. WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LIKE HER!) And in each arc, Haru here, a.k.a Mr I Dont Know How To Lock Doors When Having Sex, will get down (No not that geddan spastic dance) with each girl. I think that's another reason why most people (including me) gave it a bad review. The sex scene was so unexpected an really... REALLY.. not needed. But does make up for a good fanservice and I know a lot of you pervert out there ain't complaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nLike any visual novel adapted into an anime, art is one important aspect. Basically, I would even watch an anime with cruddy story plot if the art is outstanding (Which reminds me of Shukufu no Campbella) Nevertheless, the art is one of the positive side about this anime. It is exceptionally well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nBesides the sound of girls moaning and Haru having sex, the choice of BGM for each scene is quite melancholic. I definitely would be adding this anime OST to my list.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nLike every harem, each girl has their own unique set of.. Urmm.. racks...\\n\r\nForget about that. Each girl portrays one of the many fetishes modern day otakus have. There's a gothic like lolicon. There's a cheerful miko. There's a glasses girl (Seriously, glasses? I still dont understand the sexual attraction on this one) There's a high class lady girl, and there;s even a maid! (Sorry but no props to the class president)\\n\r\nAnd the head of all this girls is the harem boss himself, Haru a.k.a \"He Who Definitely Never Watched Porn Before In His Life Thus He Doesnt Know How To Lock Doors But How Come He Knows All Those Sex Positions!\" \\n\r\nWow thats a mouthful.\\n\r\nHaru as all male harem leads is a kind boy who haven't seen his sister for a very long time and thus use that an excuse to have incestuous relationship with her. Damn, that was genius, I wish I would have known that excuse a long time ago!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nSorry but I would have given a higher rating if it weren't for all those sex scene that ruined the rewatch value. Trust me, if you wanna fap I suggest you do it with REAL hentai, not this anime. Its ECCHI but not HENTAI\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nI dont think any of the female anime viewers would enjoy watching this anime. Even some male viewers are dissing it. I mean c'mon. Tachibana from Amagami SS needed 4 episodes to even kiss a girl (Well some are slightly earlier) but Haru here just needs 1 episode to get laid with her? \\n\r\nAnyways Im not here to judge on your anime preference. If you like fanservice, then by all mean GO WATCH IT!\\n\r\nIf you love loli figures, then by all mean ONLY WATCH SORA'S ARC\\n\r\nBut if you wanna touch yourself at night, go grab a decent hentai, will you?\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\nWhen I started this I was expecting something average , truly, since I did not know anything about the anime, not even the fact that it was a harem, and even less the fact that it was based on a porn game, but when I learned that, it did not stop me from at least giving this anime a chance, and sadly, I did. It turned out to be a major waste of time and being seriously nothing more than your average soft-core hentai harem. \r\nstory(3/10): I know it is quite controversial to give such a low score on something like thatbut I was frankly expecting more from the story. The story itself can be resumed to basically some guy with an awful lot of sex appeal (like any other harem hero) who nails girls one after another in a village (lets not forget the part which was based on the game, which gives us some kind of alternate ending for each girl...). I'm not criticizing the actual story that much but rather its content, it was generic, repetitive, clich\u00e9d and destroyed the very essence of the ''romance'' genre it was suppose to be.\\n\\n\r\nart (5/10): The art wasn't that bad actually and would merit a better score than 5, but the forced 3d animation inserted was obviously done by some amateur or had very little budget associated to its production, thus lowering the score.\\n\\n\r\nsound (3/10): The voice acting itself was not that horrible, though some voices did tend to get on my nerve (the sisters voice for instance). The real downside to the sound was the repetitive background with a range of 3 or 4  instruments maximum (and an excessive use of the piano/violin). \\n\\n\r\ncharacters (5/10): The characters wouldn't have been half bad if it would have been another style of anime and not a romance one, which focuses the whole plot around the actual character development and the interaction of one with another. That part of the anime was actually pretty boring since the characters were all passing the same developments almost in the same order (likes the main character, relationship, problem, reconciliation , sex).\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment (2/10): I can't say i have enjoyed this anime at all. It was long, repetitive and boring, but I must say i have laughed hard in the eleventh episode when i actually saw the overly incestuous couple get caught... and the incest kinda did not help to the enjoyment factor, if your into that kind of stuff, i suggest you watch episode 10/11/12... what you do while watching that is your own damn thing.\\n\\n\r\noverall: 3/10 Overall, this was a pretty bad anime, it was nothing but soft core hentai, and if your really into hentai then its not even for you since its too censored. either way, i don't think this will please people who like romance, since its a harem and they are commonly known to massacre the genre with each episode. plus i don't even think it will satisfy the hentai lovers since its too censored. in the end, this is only something for the pure hardcore lovers of the genre...",

            "content": "Who is to say who we can and can not love?\r\nNormally I never really feel the pull to review a series, but not even finishing the series less then 10 minutes ago, I really felt I should write a review. Please note this is my first review, so either negative or positive feedback is greatly appreciated.\r\nNow, I'm not going to lie, the first thing that pulled me into Yosuga no Sora was the fact there were twins and incest involved. Incest in anime and manga has always been one of my guilty pleasures so I really couldn't help but watch it. I came into thisanime not expecting a lot and boy, did it surprise me. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the art and animation. It just seemed so real. The characters moved.. swiftly. The characters and the background had such a real feel to me that I could have thought it was a live action show. Of course, that is very much an exaggeration but I was really pleased by the animation. Everything was also so pretty too, I couldn't help but be mesmerized. It really is better then most I see nowadays. I mean, Yosuga isn't perfect, it has its faults here and there but nothing really stood out to me to make me complain. Even the softcore hentai scenes were played out nice, I think. \\n\\n\r\nI was really pleased with the music as well. I thought the opening theme was really catchy and it set the mood for the anime nicely. It was a really mellow tune. The ending theme was really nice too. Both of those songs are songs I could catch myself listening to out of pure entertainment. And the background music to the anime was really clean. Other words to describe it would be beautiful.. gentle.. and never a touch out of place. None of it annoyed me and I found it to be quite a joy to listen to!  The voice actors I really enjoyed too. I thought each voice fit its' character perfectly. Really, I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you could say that the girls were kind of stereotyped. But again, each character turned out real. They each had their own stories and feelings and personalities. The girls mostly stayed the same with each different arc I thought, except Sora of course. I definitely felt Sora's feelings were growing stronger and stronger within each arc but I always sort of felt that she knew what she wanted. I was actually very satisfied with Haruka. He was totally cute ( >.> ;; ) and he was really kind. Somehow I couldn't help but think of Makoto Itou... Oh Makoto.. Anyways, Haru was kind and responsible, always caring for Sora. I guess he really isn't your typical guy, but he kind of is. He's really perfect on the surface, but he has his own faults as well. Sora.. wasn't how I expected her to be. Going into the series I didn't read any character descriptions or anything, I kind of just jumped right in. From her looks, I thought she would be shy and sweet.. but she really can be quite selfish and rude. But she does have her sweet side! So I couldn't help but love her though.. Again, I really enjoyed most of the characters, granted Nao-chan got kind of annoying for me..\\n\\n\r\nThe story was kind of typical too. Watching it, I couldn't help but think of School Days. But this anime was definitely not School Days, especially the ending. Looking at this anime I thought almost instantly of harem. Normally, I don't really like harems. I'm more of a reverse harem kind of person, but because of my incest fetish.. I couldn't help but watch. Yosuga seemed to me.. so much more then a harem. Each girl got her own arc, so to speak, and each were very meaningful. Yes, Haru does have sex with most of these girls, but I found them to be truly touching and not just meaningless sex. This really was kind of softcore hentai, I was actually surprised. More pleased actually, since I admit I do watch my fair share of hentai...  I thought it was nice to have a real series that showed some of those parts and not just skipped ahead and such.. but that just may be the pervert inside of me... > .> ;; But again, this is not a hentai. Again, with the repeating story and the repeating festival that happened, my mind could not help but think of Higurashi.. That Wataganashi Festival will be forever branded in my mind... O_O Unfortunately, we weren't blessed with any murder here! Well.. I don't think my heart would've taken it if any of the characters died.. I liked them.. > .> ;;\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this anime. I hope I don't seemed too biased as it seems to me I was just praising this series from the beginning. Yosuga does have its faults. I mean, it can be looked at as a typical harem.. and not to mention the controversial topic of incest, or more so twincest. Frankly, I was very pleased with the ending, since it was the one I was rooting for all along. And again, normally I'm not a fan of harems. I usually just have one or two girls I like and the rest of the girls I just find to be an annoyance.. But I found myself liking basically every one of these characters, granted Nao-chan. ( Okay I admit, Nao-chan wasn't even that bad... ^.^ ) \\n\\n\r\nSo for you \"deciding to watch\" people, if you really like a bit of touching stories, with a little bit of harem, and a dash of incest, ( Okay, more like a scoop? ) then you might as well give Yosuga no Sora a chance. I think this series will definitely be on my re-watch list. But if you don't like romance, harems, ecchi, or incest, then maybe you should shy away. But I think if you give Yosuga no Sora a chance, you might even be a little surprised!\\n\\n\r\n( Again, this is my first review! Any feedback would be appreciated~ )\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Yosuga no Sora' ('Sora the Blood Relative') is an anime adaptation for an eroge. Like any sane person, I don't support incest nor particularly have an infatuation with sister characters (although I find it funny when sisters get raped in hentai), but decided to check this out because I have seen an extremely moving and thought-provoking Japanese incest movie before: 'Boku wa Imoto ni Koi wo Suru' (2007)\r\nUnfortunately, this was an extremely shallow series in comparison.\r\nI'm sure we're all wondering what those insect antennas are doing on almost every character's hair in this series. It must have surpassed 'Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto' asseries with dumbest ahoge in history. But other than that, the characters are very visually attractive, and hands and feet are drawn with more detail and better proportion than most anime series around.\\n\\n\r\nI must commend the art in this series, not because of its detail or style, but because of its revolutionary distribution of animation budget. A typical show goes like this: 1:00 flashback, 1:30 OP, 17:30 content, 1:30 ED1, 2:00 side story, 1:30ED2 for 25-minute ad-free air time. The side story has super-simplistic backgrounds with chibi-form characters, which is a lot easier to draw and saves money/time. What this and having two EDs per episode has allowed, is only 17:30 of actual content per show instead of standard 22:00. The shorter actual content in combined with heavy recycling of backgrounds has enabled very beautiful character appearance and animation despite the apparent small budget.\\n\\n\r\nThis is damaging to the art consistency and content, but fortunately this series didn't have much material to begin with, and leaves much better impression than average quality overall.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was pretty good, everyone sounded like they should.\\n\r\nBGM was also pretty good with nostalgic, gentle pieces that complimented the visuals in creating a peaceful countryside atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe theme songs were extremely weak, I would've expected more from Eufonius, but the song sounded tiring as Riya was trying and failing to hit the high keys. Two EDs were very forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe opening act was the worst episode 1 I've ever seen. It served as an introduction to the main couple's relationship and other girls he would eventually tap, but it presented itself as a shallow harem right off the bat. All the girls basically fall in love at first sight without apparent reasons. It's also difficult to imagine countryside girls would dig a bishounen type.\\n\r\nOther girls back off after that though, and the main character goes after them one by one. The story in this series has a eroge-like save function where the protagonist chooses different paths and play out what would've happened had he chosen differently. It's kind of interesting, but unfortunately, the whole concept tumbled when heroines acted completely different in each arc. For example, Sora accepts Haruka and Nao's relationship in one arc, but in the following one, she becomes so mentally unstable that the previous arc's ending could've never happened.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also difficult to see why the protagonist would go after each girl. In 'Amagami SS', they at least attempt to explain this by who the protagonist walks into immediately after a life-altering event. Here, the main character seemed to just go after them because he had to (the scriptwriter forced him to).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are of course the typical harem archetypes, and there's nothing wrong with that, but they never grew out of their cardboard cutout existence. Every girl would suddenly share a devastating past trauma to the main character, and then make out with him after he somehow solve their problems. Character development here just seemed to be manufactured to get us to sympathize with heroines, and feels like we're just supposed to go along with it. This is a blatant sign of poor story writing, because such issues should be uncovered natural enough or the story should be so engaging that we won't even notice such details if done right.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the main couple were seen in other heroine's arcs, and it's somewhat understandable that they would eventually commit incestuous act given their mutual feelings and couple of awkward events between the two. However, issues such as morality and love surrounding incest was never explored in this series, and in the end, it just seemed like lust, and they even make up a half-assed excuse that this is okay because they have been apart for so long that they see each other as strangers rather than siblings. This defeats the whole point of this series being incest themed, and whatever point they made after that seemed to be superfluous.\\n\\n\\n\r\n'Yosuga no Sora', unlike 'Amagami SS', presented itself as a thought-provoking and controversial incest themed series with foreshadowing of the main couple's relationship with all the \"restarts\". But in the end, it failed to fulfill its own promise, and turned into yet another shallow romance anime more suited for hentai. If you're looking for a deep incest drama, you won't find it here. Less than average series, less than hentai.",

            "content": "Ok, before I start making my review on Yosuga no Sora, I like to point out that this is indeed my first review on an anime. Hopefully my review about this anime will have an effect on whether you watch it or not; and hopefully you don't, because believe me; you\u0081fre just wasting your time. Also, I recommend those who actually \"liked\" this anime to not read this review, it'll probably just turn your day upside down. Overall, this anime is one of the worse anime I have ever seen, only topped by School Days.\r\nI personally feel sorry for the producer who released and airedthis anime. They must have either been drunk and got tricked into airing/releasing this, or must have run out of ideas and had no other choice but to summit this.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nNow if you've read the synopsis you get a little summary of it, but that doesn't really explain much, because this anime doesn't even have a story. The twins, which are the 2 main characters, lost their parents in an accident. First of all, it was never revealed to how the parents died. And later they apparently moved in with their grandfather\u0081 who never even made a screen appearance.\\n\r\nDuring the first half or maybe a little further into the anime, it was more of an arc anime. Each and every girl Haru bangs gets a little side story, but when it got to the Nao arc\u0081c ohh man... I just felt as if they gave up on this anime.\\n\r\nOk... now I know very well that this is rated \u0081gR+ - Mild Nudity\u0081h, but damn, did they have to add in a sex scenes for every episodes? I thought this was a TV series, not a hentai. They practically turned this anime into a hentai OVA series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the only damn thing good about this anime. Personally I have no problem with the art... There was actually some nice scenery; I really think they did a good job on the backgrounds and locations. But as for the nude shots... ugh... I got sick of seeing it after a few times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nNow the sounds weren't too bad. The OP was by eufonius, which I happen to listen to from time to time. As for EDs.. I can't even remember them, and I probably wouldn't want to. As for the sex sounds, I\u0081fm glad they restrained themselves from letting out to many groans and moans, because this is a TV series and not a hentai. As for the voice acting, I didn't have a problem with that. Most of the characters voices were to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nOh god... I don't even want to mention the characters. Personally, the only character I liked was the stuffed rabbit that Sora carried around. It just goes to show how much I hated the characters from this anime.\\n\r\nHaruka ? The main male lead of the whole series. He\u0081fs not worthy to mention because all he does is go around having sex with girls.\\n\r\nSora ? Haruka\u0081fs twin sister. She wasn't bad at all during the first half of the series, but then the Nao arc came along which changed my whole opinion on her.\\n\r\nAkira - It was revealed in her arc that she was the daughter of the Migiwa head family, which makes her Kazuha half older sister. I actually thought she was pretty cute\u0081c until, Haruka showed up in her life\u0081c -.-\\n\r\nKazuha - Daughter of the Migiwa head family. Not much was really mentioned about her. Except the fact that she met Haruka on first day he moved back.\\n\r\nNao - Oh god... I hated her most in this series. not much about her was likable.. matter of fact, there was none.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nYou really think I can enjoy this? Well, I'm not saying I\u0081fm not the type to watch soft hentai or ecchi, but to have every episode include a sex scene is somewhat pushing it. Personally, I really hated this anime. I didn't feel the slightest bit of enjoyment and it was honestly bad. My friends and I could probably make a better anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nFinally, here\u0081fs what I think overall:\\n\r\nCrap + Waste of time + Shitty Plot = Yosuga no Sora",

            "content": "I was first drawn to Yosuga no Sora by its poster. It stood out in the Fall 2010 anime preview, where every other series used every color of the rainbow to grab the audience's attention, this series had a rather simple depicting of Haru and Sora under a blue sky. \r\nThe expressions of the characters reminded me a bit of \"ef - a tale of memories\", \"True Tears\" and other romantic anime that weren't also part comedy. My favorite genre is romance and I had high hopes going into this series. Unfortunately in this case, the old axiom of 'never judge a book by itscover' proved itself true.\\n\\n\\n\r\n====== Story ======\\n\r\nWhen I read the series synopsis, I came in expecting a serious story, perhaps even tragic in its setup. In contrast, the problems the characters dealt with in the series felt very trivial, adolescent even in importance. Only in Sora's arc did I feel that the characters were ever dealing with a true issue, not one so easily solved in an afternoon's worth under the sheets. Ultimately, I would describe the storyline as shallow at best, but perhaps this is what was intended. Those looking for a deeper storyline as was alluded to in the synopsis will only find disappointment here.\\n\\n\\n\r\n===== Art =====\\n\r\nThe character designs in the anime were well drawn out, with proportions that closely resembled real people. There were varying levels in consistency from episode to episode in how the characters were drawn; it seemed that as the series wore on, some scenes revealed poor animation. Expressions were not as detailed or varied as one would have hoped, given the anime relies so strongly on character interaction. The backgrounds were weak to average at best. They looked very 2D to me, with low attention to detail. It seems as if the artists did just enough each scene to make it work, but nothing to make it stand out. \\n\\n\r\n===== Sound =====\\n\r\nOne constant throughout the series was the great soundtrack that helped to set the mood. Especially in the more serious scenes, the music felt very appropriate to what was happening on-screen and really helped convey whatever emotions the characters were feeling. Beyond simply setting the mood, the music was beautiful to listen to, I found myself listening more to the music in certain scenes than the voices. Both the OP and initial ED were well done, fitting the series quite well. \\n\\n\r\n===== Characters =====\\n\r\nPerhaps it was due to only having a 13 episode season, but outside of Sora and Haru, the relationships between characters were not convincing at all. Characters felt very static, as they changed little throughout their respective arcs.\\n\\n\r\n===== Conclusion =====\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this series is the amount of skin that is shown. The story of the show is very weak, especially in earlier arcs and there is little redemption to be found in the characters; I would go so far as to say some of them were even annoying in how often they changed their moods or worried about problems that weren't really problems at all. If the promise of incest is enough to keep you watching despite these problems, then I would cautiously recommend Yosuga no Sora.\\n",

            "content": "I just want to start off by saying that \"YES, this anime does contain mild sex scenes and incestuous themes\", but if you're comfortable enough with your own insecurities and own ideals, you should still find this to be an enjoyable anime. After all, this is not the first nor the last anime that will contain such said themes. As a person with a little sister, I do get uncomfortable with themes like incest because I love my sister, but I'm not physically attracted to her at all. Anyway, now that I've got THAT out of the way, I'll keep thisreview short and simple. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n      The main story is told through the perspective of Haruka Kasugano, a male high school student whose parents have deceased. Now all alone with his twin sister, he deals with a series of different relationships with different girls. Honestly, not the most insanely interesting story, but pretty good and engaging. The story is told at a rather fast pace for a romance/drama and I think that really helps keep the audience engaged. The ending was rather satisfying, but it was also rather predictable and almost borderline boring. I kind of wanted more drama towards the end and not the bittersweet ending the anime presented itself with. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n    Not really much to say here. The art was extremely beautiful. Each character had unique facial features and no one character looked alike for the most part. However, there wasn't anything special enough for me to say this was \"Jaw-dropping\" or anything like that. Pretty nice art nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n   Pretty nice music throughout the whole anime. Nothing totally special, but good enough for me to notice. Opening and closing songs were ok and maybe worth downloading. Decent music for Romance/Drama though. Definitely helped hype up emotion in many of the scenes throughout the entire series. As far as voice acting goes, pretty good, but keep in mind I don't speak Japanese so I can't say it's perfect for sure. There were never any awkward out of sync problems or glitches either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n     Maybe It's just me, but judging characters in harem anime is typically hard because you can't focus on one character for too long or be completely satisfied with the amount of screen time your favorite character gets. However, this anime does a good job of splitting up screen time and character development evenly. Unfortunately, that also means it's hard to get attached to a single character. I also found some characters annoying and a bit extraneous. For example, the class rep and other male lead felt like they didn't need to be there. The male protagonist was also a bit boring and stereotypical. On the other hand, his twin sister was a pretty interesting character, but just didn't have enough screen time to develop properly. Decent characters in general. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n     This is all based on my own personal taste so don't hate me if I enjoyed this anime more or less than you. I don't think it's a bad anime, but it is sort of boring at times. I've been on a Romance/Drama/Comedy anime roll lately so I might be judging this anime harshly. I did enjoy it overall, but it's definitely not anime I'd go crazy over. Is it worth watching? Yeah, sure. It's pretty short and has a pretty fast pace so it's pretty easy to get into it. I think I would've enjoyed it more if the some characters weren't so bland and stereotypical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n   Good, but not great. Worth investing time into, but not anything to rush for. I would put this anime just a little above average. I had a decent time watching and hope to find more like it.",

            "content": "This review is based on the first three episodes of Yosuga no Sora. I repeat: Everything in this review is based off the first three episodes of the anime! My opinion may change, either a minor change or a drastic/significant change. \r\nStory 8/10  - The story certainly is intriguing and unique to the anime. Unlike major, well-loved animes, the plot of this anime doesn't really make you think \"This anime is awesome! I gotta watch the next episode!\" It's more of the feeling of, \"Why are the characters doing that? Maybe the answer will be in the next episode.\". The main difference, I feel,is that they intentionally leave out some important details in a matter that we become interested so that we try to figure it out (the only way is to continue on). Now, I think that in some areas of the anime, things become slightly rushed, and sometimes things are too slow, so it doesn't have good consistency with plot development.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - I especially like the artwork in this anime. The details are made clear, the animation is smooth, and the characters are \"KAWAII!\". Anywho, this is not an anime for loli fans. The characters are more refined, and it gives some mixed feelings, whereas the story has a mix of seriousness and... uh... care-free-ness (is that even a word?) while the art makes it look like it's an anime fit for adults (technically, it's rated R+ for mild nudity, so even though I doubt this'll make a difference, KIDS, STAY AWAY FROM IT).\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/0 - The soundtracks match the scenery and situations very nicely, although I feel that during some significant parts of this anime, they should change the soundtrack. An emotional scene being backed up by a \"cheery\" soundtrack sometimes doesn't fit in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - This is part of the flaw of the storyline. The characters aren't the average generic anime characters. They all have their own unique personality, and you get to like them. The main problem, though, is the character development. It's the main part that is too slow in development. At the end of the first two episodes, I felt as though I still had no clue about the characters, though I knew the directly announced details. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - So far, I like this anime. Though it could use some improvements, it takes a different approach at catching the audience, the art is VERY nice (comparable with anime movies), and it stands out from most copy-and-paste-stories-from-other-animes-and-otherstuff animes.",

            "content": "Incest without guilt would be like sausages without mustard. If you like incest romance, it\u2019s definitely worth watching.\r\nI watched the show then read the visual novel so I\u2019ll include some comparison in here for those who are interested.\r\nPremise:\r\nBoy and girl twins, Haruka and Sora; their parents died. They move into their gandpa\u2019s house in the countryside(granpa is dead). They used to visit Granpa a lot. Lots of girls in this town like Haruka because he is pretty. Omnibus romance ensues. Haruka and Sora try to keep a tight lid on what\u2019s going on between them, but the opening kinda gives it away.\r\nCharacters:\r\nAkira is an energeticand really nice and sociable shrine maiden with family issues, which she is an orphan so\u2026 In the visual novel she\u2019s a much bigger presence to be honest. No matter which route you take, she strongly empathizes with all the characters and tries to help them no matter what they\u2019re going through. Here, she's... energetic and nice and has family issues. She also has giant boobs in this. Boobs generally are a lot bigger in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKazuha is rich and pretty. And she plays the violin. I guess she\u2019s nice.\\n\\n\r\nNao, I think, actually calls herself Haruka\u2019s big sister from time to time. She\u2019s really just his childhood friend. She\u2019s supportive and relatively mature.  And when her arc comes around, I admire her. She has a boyfriend who is deeply obsessed with his twin sister, and Nao is just like, \u201cWell, I knew what I was getting myself into.\u201d It\u2019s not that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, but she\u2019s known Haru and Sora for so long she\u2019s on their side no matter what. Though Sora utterly hates her guts.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka, in the anime, is a fairly normal pretty boy aside from his relationship with his twin sister. The visual novel focused a lot more on Haru simply trying to learn to live on his own with Sora, sort out their household, and integrate both himself and Sora into this town. The anime focuses a lot more on the romances which leaves Haru with not much character development and not much to do aside from tending on his girlfriend of the week. I think Sora\u2019s arc works much better because dealing with her brings out a lot more of Haru's past. Also, how a man deals with his incestuous desires is really a test of character. \\n\\n\r\nKnowing Haru as I do from the VN, he\u2019s really just as messed up by his parents' deaths as Sora is, but he feels like he needs to keep it together for Sora\u2019s sake. In the anime they make it seem as if he enjoys Sora\u2019s relying in him, but in the VN we see that after the funeral, Sora kinda freaked out and put everything on his shoulders. He didn\u2019t have much of a choice, and he\u2019s really not sure what he\u2019s doing trying to run a household.  Deep down, he wants someone else to make these decisions or at least show him what to do and he resents Sora always putting everything on him while she tales it easy. Well, we don\u2019t get too much of that in the anime, but we do get to see him nearly lose his mind and cry big hot man-tears over Sora, which is about as good.\\n\\n\r\nSora is quiet, reclusive, haughty, and dismissive. The only person she ever listens to even sometimes is her brother Haru. She spent half her life in a hospital and Haru was the only person who visited her on a regular basis. She\u2019s developed a strong attachment to Haru , though she normally never leaves her room. She\u2019s gotten very used to sitting alone in her bed and surfing the internet. I lover her line when Haru tells her he\u2019s not sure they can get internet and she says, \u201cI cannot live without it.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nFor me, Sora is the one who makes this anime. I even like her better here than in the visual novel. The little scenes where she mocks the other girls behind their backs, the little fantasies of hers we see every so often; it adds something to her character that really wasn\u2019t in the visual novel. Honestly, in the VN I couldn\u2019t tell if she was really in love with Haru or just insanely jealous of Nao. She actually comes off a little more mature and, well, sane in this version. Her voice, here, is also a slightly lower register and doesn\u2019t sound so ridiculously cutesy. That helps.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion/Opinion:\\n\r\nHonestly, I enjoy this anime a lot more than I should. I do so by ignoring episodes 4-9 and focusing on the relationship between Haru and Sora. Other people seem to think the Kazuha, Akira, and Nao romances are worthwhile, and you might like them. Plotwise, however, they are pretty thin. The show tries to involve us by giving the girls back stories,  but the conflict involved is a pale shadow compared to what\u2019s going on between Haru and Sora in the first episode. This was not a good candidate for the omnibus romance structure.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, Haru is mostly characterized in the VN by his attempts to manage his household and deal with Sora. The anime doesn\u2019t have time for household details because they need to make room for four different romance stories, and his romantic interests don\u2019t really tell us much about Haru. This makes it hard to care about Haru\u2019s relationships since we don\u2019t really know much about him. \\n\\n\r\nI think they would have done better to give this a merged structure like the Kanon and Clannad animes. We could even have kept some of the sex scenes too. All we\u2019d have to do is say Haru is one pretty son of a gun and he needs to distract himself from his sister by involving himself in the problems of all these other girls. I mean that\u2019s basically what they did with Nao in the final arc anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really like here are the parts dealing with Haru and Sora\u2019s relationship. I love this one scene in the first episode where Haru and Sora are sitting across the table from eachother and we see an imaginary scene of Haru walking over an kissing his sister. But who imagined it? I\u2019ve seen people argue it both ways and honestly, I don\u2019t see why both of them shouldn\u2019t be imagining it. Its definitely on both their minds. \\n\\n\r\nI love the tension which arises from seeing that Haru and Sora are clearly obsessed with eachother from the beginning but that they keep a very tight lid on it. I remember when this first came out, someone stated just how smart it was to make it clear from the beginning that there would be sex in this anime.  This allows the first episode to clearly pose the question, \u201cAre these two going to have sex?\u201d without there necessarily being a clear answer. Though the Omnibus romance structure kinda promises Haru\u2019s gonna have sex with everybody at some point, I think it was a smart move to put the Sora arc at the end to give time for the tension to rise. It would have been even smarter if the structure were merged but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly love Haru\u2019s decent into insanity. I\u2019ve gone insane before and, yeah, this is pretty much what it\u2019s like. Zegapain kinda has a similar thing but it\u2019s a little more drawn out here. And I should let you know, this part isn\u2019t in the VN, it just wouldn\u2019t work. In the VN, Haru goes crazy in other ways, becoming as detached with reality as Sora is. But here, we get to see Haru\u2019s face as he cries big man-tears, and we get to see him try to make his relationship with  Nao work out. We get to see him desperately reach out for help and get rejected. That\u2019s some powerful cinema.\\n\\n\r\nOther nice bits include seeing Haru and Sora constantly texting eachother on their smart phones.  That was a lot of fun to see in action. The scenery, which is based on an actual small town in the Japanese countryside, is also very different from the VN. Its not really better or worse. I like the character designs better in the VN, where the art in general has a much softer feel and uses less vivid colors so that everything looks a little faded. But the vivid colors of the anime work much better for the environment. \\n\\n\r\nI also love how Kozue gets a name in this. In the VN even her dialogue box is labeled \u201cClass Prez\u201d. She\u2019s not really any more important here but I like how she freaks out and gets all judgmental at the end. Everyone is way too okay with all this in the VN, but Kozue in the anime knows how to lay on the guilt and social rejection like a boss. I used to hate her in this anime. Reading the VN made me realize just how much she adds to the story. Incest without guilt really is like sausages without mustard.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I love how Haru is voicedby the same guy who did Katsuragi Keima in TWGOK and Kamina Ayato in RahXephon. Shimono Hiro is just awesome at screaming like a madman. Plus now I can imagine this show is really about Kami-niisama playing through the VN.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this as a 7 because fully half of the show is not worth rewatching. The art isn\u2019t too remarkable and the music while appropriate can get a little clich\u00e9. The plot isn\u2019t exactly Count of Monte Cristo genius, but is succeeds in raising the tension and bringing out some of the characters. I thoroughly however enjoy rewatching the final arc and the first few episodes. I recommend it to anyone who can put up with incest and the omnibus structure.\\n",

            "content": "I think a more appropriate name for this series, to try to avoid being profane, would be \"The Screwing Haru Show\" considering how this show is set. Pretty much, the series is set up in several arcs that involve male lead Haruka hooking up with one of several girls, resolving some sort of dramatic element with them and then inevitably having intercourse with them at the end of the arc with events reset afterward to feature the cycle repeating with another girl acquainted with Haruka. The series is pretty much an excuse to have Haruka engage in softcore sexual action with the \"girl of thearc\" as the personalities of each gal are pretty archetypal and plot scenarios being anything you would see done to death from an eroge game. The show is so ignorant of providing enough fleshing out and development of its characters, especially with its \"resets\" after each arc, that the series will have you caring more for the sex in it than whatever convoluted drama the series cooks up for the relationships that Haruka gets into.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst of these arcs was with the final one involving Sora as, regrettably, the show features an arc where Haruka commits to an incestuous fling with his twin sister. This combines the two normal issues to be expected with featuring incest in an anime title as it features melodramatic trappings and a cheap excuse to feature perverted/ sexual rompings with the twin fraternal siblings. Don't even think this is as tasteful and sensible as Koi Kaze in believably exploring incest.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also includes a dull attempt at comedy with an omake mini-episode at the end of each episode to Yosuga no Sora featuring some older maid trying to hook up with Haruka. The fact we see maid gal masturbating in the first mini-episode of the series didn't have my hopes up of even caring for what would take place in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can generally praise with Yosuga no Sora would be its visuals as they featured well-detailed character designs, beautiful shots of scenery and vibrant colors, which are only downturned by the title's subpar frame rate within a number of animated shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yosuga no Sora is just another cheap ecchi title for the otaku crowd to go googly-eyed for. Anyone expecting anything more tasteful, in-depth and sensible with their content should avoid this dud like the plague.",

            "content": "At first sight, many people might turn away in disgust when finding out the anime includes incest and softcore, while disregarding all other aspects of the story. However Yosuga no Sora is a genuinely enticing drama that, when looked at with an unbiased and thoughtful perspective, displays a heartwarming drama (One of the best in my opinion, challenging Clannad).\r\n     The story separates into four arcs, where Haruka, the main character, courts one for each main female character: Episode 1,2,3,4 for Migiwa; Episodes 1,2,5,6 for Akira; Episodes 1,2,7,8,9 for Nao; and the main storyline 1,2,7,10,11,12 forSora. This is not just some typical harem where the main character is just simply infatuated by each girl in their respective arc. There is a deep, thorough and complex story and personality behind each character, and it makes the characters feel realistic. The only flaw I see in the series is its short length. Not enough time is given for each arc to progress. Though it doesn't feel rushed, more details could be put between each arc to enchance the story. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n     I have to admit, this series have perhaps one of the best artwork and music I have ever seen in an anime. The characters are all designed beautifully, and the animation was smooth. This will really please any modern viewers like me. 10/10. Now the music is also beautiful. The BGM really brings out the emotion in each episodes and sets the mood perfectly. If you don't believe me, just watch the first episode. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n     The anime is filled with suspense and drama, so brace yourselves. Now the controversial parts. As the story progressives to the end of each arc, there is generally one or possibly more softcore sex scene. HOWEVER, this was not forced and has the motive of moving the story forward. It gives more to the plot rather than a cheap sex scene. People will also question the incest (twincest) in the story. I garuntee you potential viewers, watch the anime to the end, consider the character's feelings, WHY would they want to be together, and think about if you are to take the character's places, how much would you give to love. Morality is overall governed by yourself. \\n\\n\r\nConsider these points and dive in for an epitome of romance anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime was truly a work of art, and helped my out with a tough time in my life. I was in a dark place, with school pressing down on me, and depression setting in, i was unable to be the person i wanted to be. However, this anime was a shining beacon of hope for me. This passionate story, about a brother and sister, really helped me pull through, and enabled me to become the person whoi wanted to be, and do well at school. Episode 11 was the turning point for me really, especially the end, i felt at that point that i had to get off my ass, and do something in my life, just like the two twins in this anime. So i started to study really hard, and pulled my life out of a downward spiral. I believe this anime will change anyone's life if they watch it, and will really help you with tough times in your life. I owe so much to this, and i wish i could give a bit more back to it than just this review, as it has given so much to me. If it can pull one person from the verge of suicide, then it can pull anyone away, so i would really recommend watching it a few times, and especially watching episode 11 many times, just as i have. Make sure you share this with your family, friends, teachers, and aged community, so they can all have a refreshing, and invigorating experience will watching this passionate and life changing story about these two amazing courageous twins, who don't stay bound by the rules of others, and dare to break the boundaries of modern society. This si a truly inspirational story, and i will use it for reference material in the future for my own kids and students.",

For this show, it was probably the minor hentai. Because this anime already had an aspect to keep its viewers glued to the screen, it didn't have to rely on some obvious and stupid fanservice, nor did it have to try to put in a plot twist just to keep it interesting.\r\nBecause the life of a hentai isits art, the art of the whole show was great. The sound was also splendid, and I'm sure anyone who's watched this show would at least agree on that point. These two plus the countryside setting make the atmosphere of this show one of the best in the anime genre, ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for new viewers and those who dropped this show, I want you to see this show not for its story, but for its atmosphere. The characters, art, sound, and setting would grab your heart in the first minutes of the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, the anime is a minor hentai. It wouldn't grab everyone's heart. There is incest, a bit of yuri, and some obvious sex scenes. But for me, the anime just felt so nostalgic that I didn't really mind them. So go on, watch this show. Don't drop it before watching it just because it's a hentai. There's a reason it's so popular.",

As anime watcher it might be slight worser.\r\nFirst of all: *This is my review what i think of this anime, your's could be different in all perspectives*\r\nWhat's yosuga no Sora about? * NO SPOILERS *\r\nA boy and a girl lost their parents and they go back to their old home and start living there again meeting old friends and finding love and gettingback their old habbits and such.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThere is not a big storyline but that's not really needed in this anime. pretty much what i said: A boy and a girl lost their parents and they go back to their old home and start living there again. that's the story and that's all you need to know to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is so good in this anime. just wow!. pretty much on of the greater artworks i've seen in my anime's. It matches perfectly with the theme, and has great work in the finer work, like shadows. pumped to see more of this kind of art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nMusic fitting in greatly wouldn't say much about that. but the finer work like raindrops and other small details in things in the forst is kinda lacking my expectations. but still did a more then fine job i would say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI have never seen such great work out in charecter's ever. all are unique and it's just wow how that never changed in to whole anime. also the perfection's in hair and even clothing is worked out so that i should be screaming GG! for an hour after this anime. Thing's like clothing style of girls and boys are worked out good togheter in a lot of situations where they did even match each other. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nCouldn't stop watching that's all you need. because this is for everyone different :).\\n\\n\r\nOverall a great anime with a detail on the small things and focussing on the romance part of this anime.\\n\r\nGreat job Yosuga no Sora. i loved you!\\n\\n\r\nscore 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nRecomended to: Romance lovers, people with not feeling bad about sex scenes. and people who want to watch a serious anime. Because this anime isn't this anime: like oww i want to have a anime that fills my time, but an anime thats just beautifull in many ways.",

            "content": "Yosuga no sora seems to be an anime built like some kind of Eroge , I don't know if it's an eroge adaptation , I suppose it might be because  so far the arcs of the series seems to revolve with the main protagonist  going out with each girl and in the last episode of that arc ''unlocking'' the ecchi scene .\r\nThat's why it makes me think a lot about an eroge .\r\nThe art is pretty nice , I think it's not the best I've seen but however the chara design is still very likeable. The soundtracks are also really nice and that'swhat caught my attention more than the plot which seems a bit  clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nHowever , the plot REALLY is clich\u00e9 , not even the sad scenes involving some of the character's past  manages to make me think otherwise. We have really clich\u00e9 characters overall , including the tsundere imouto , the cool/prefect big brother , the hyper girl , the busty shy girl and other stereotypes. Not to mention the Maid that act like a frickin' sex addict... -___-'\\n\\n\r\nThough I was a bit afraid of the story revolving too much about Sora's incestuous love for Haru but so far it stayed pretty decent . But I expect they'll make an arc with SoraXHaru as the main couple....\\n\r\nEcchi scenes and more ecchi scenes , that's mostly  the only thing this anime has to offer even if it tries to disguise itself in a somewhat serious plot , we see it comming. \\n\\n\r\nTo finish I'll say that Yosuga no sora is far from being the best anime I've seen , but it's not the worst either , if you don't really need a nice plot and just want some romance and fanservice well there you go . \\n\r\nI'd give it a 6 because I've seen many other ecchi anime and it's a bit better than  expected but it's still not really interesting , I'm hesitating on watching it entierly.",

            "content": "Okay, so what's up with the subpar overall rating, and the reviews that suggest the exact opposite? It's as if the viewership's feelings towards this show fluctuate like the energy levels of a 12-year-old kid running on nothing but Monster and Red Bull. Yosuga no Sora is a controversial anime show, but it's no reason to lay down heavy artillery fire and bring all sorts of Hell on it.\r\nLet's get one thing crystal clear. I am NOT a fan of incest, WINcest, or TWINcest. I am not even remotely sure why a writer will go out of his right mind and write a show whilehe's high off acid, because any of the three I mentioned above end up becoming the byproduct of the writer while he's stuck in his \"zone\". But I'm an opportunist. Once I've started a show, I won't stop until I've finished (and yes, I've heard of a break, but I watch a show the whole way through to make sure I have a good grip on it). This is why, 12 episodes later, I am writing a review about a controversial series, to deliver a message that I think is important to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that message would hopefully convince you to throw your biases aside and watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The thought of incest makes my stomach knot up in the most painful way imaginable. Mention it once in a show and I will bat an eyelid and turn in the opposite direction. I know, I'm a biased person, but what can I say?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I am a stone cold sucker for a good storyline. Do everything else absolutely wrong, from the art all the way down to the characters. As long as you do the storyline right, I may like it very much. You can say that the storyline for Yosuga no Sora is what drew me in.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't run like a normal harem show. If you've ever watched the ending to a movie, bought the media, and watched the bonus footage with all the alternate endings, this is basically what Yosuga no Sora is pursuing, only, all that bonus footage plays a hand in the storyline. This translates to four possible endings, like an eroge or a visual novel. The protagonist, Haruka, can end up with one of four people: Akira, Kazuha, Nao, and Sora. This is what will confuse a good mess of viewers: the story is connected, but what applies in one arc will NOT translate into another; if Haruka ends up with Akira in one arc, the same does NOT apply in an arc that focuses on Kazuha. If I didn't explain it well enough, there's a whole section for it on Wikipedia.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, down to the actual story. In the same fashion as a visual novel, the guy meets the girl, who has an issue that needs to be resolved. They resolve the issue, and end up together. We know that will happen, that's a given. It's Haruka being the nice guy, doing all the right things, and finally when everything comes together, they officially become a couple. That's how it is with all the arcs, but the events that lead up to that point differ from character to character. In some arcs, we see the true colors of those characters involved brought to light, while some offer a background story with a great amount of depth.\\n\\n\r\nAs some would like to reveal outright, there are sex scenes in this show, but even if you aren't a fan of fan service, stick around. There's a reason for these scenes. It's not just \"random ecchi\", unlike other shows that take advantage of their genre and perform a nip slip every other episode. Yosuga no Sora knows very well what its genre is, and it doesn't try to push its true nature into every slot it sees fit. The sex scenes are integrated with the storyline. Their connection has an impact on the progression of events, and that's what makes this show unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: If you're into ecchi or hentai for that reason, don't walk into Yosuga no Sora expecting any of that. In fact, if you're reading this right now, pull your pants up and fix your belt. Please. I don't want to think about the strange things you're doing at home by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nPeople that read the reviews expect this show to be on the verge of hentai and expect to use this as their \"material\", only to get thoroughly disappointed at how the reviews online lied, therefore, this show sucks. But the fan service, the ecchi scenes, and the \"weak hentai\" for that matter are all easier comparable to typical ecchi shows that go overboard with fan service. Think about an ecchi show that heavily emphasizes fan service. There are shows like that which are not afraid to exercise nipple exposure and an outrageous array of sexual references. Here's where their first obstacle appears: in which one of those shows do these ecchi scenes have ANYTHING to do with the story? Even if you're a fan of ecchi and you've been around long enough to have seen each and every one of them, you won't be able to name a whole lot. This is what makes Yosuga no Sora's fan service unique; it's not there to be there and give the fans something to swoon over. It's there to shed light on certain situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's still ecchi. This is certainly a double-edged sword that fights and fulfills my preferences.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is mostly reminiscent of a drama. That lack of upbeat music gives Yosuga no Sora a dramatic mood, but at the same time, the notes are not deep enough to drop your heart at every stroke of the key. It doesn't play out that mood all the time. There are some pieces of music in higher spirits, but don't expect to watch this show with a smile on your face the whole time, the way you watch with that perverted look every time you come across an ecchi. I don't even know how to explain it. Whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is why Yosuga no Sora is a unique harem. How often do the characters of a harem get their own screen time? Think about that for a second. Have you ever seen a harem so predictable that you saw the ending and thought, \"yeah, I knew it\"? It happens all the time, and the reason for that would be the lack of development for the other \"protagonists\", if we can even give them that name. Harem shows tend to place emphasis on one character that the writer determines will be with the protagonist no matter what; their development comes first while the other participants get a noticeable lack of screen time, therefore, only one route is ever truly open to the protagonist. It's annoying, and that is why I believe harems aren't as widely accepted as other genres.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora is different. They may be separate arcs which revolve around alternate endings, but we get to see firsthand things such as personality, past events, and the true nature of certain characters instead of having to be told by someone that this is who they are and we have to take their word for it. These characters' ideals and personalities will stay constant throughout the series regardless of the events they are situated in, so as we progress through the arcs, we will continue to learn more and more about the character at the center of each arc, plus a little more about the other supporting characters. Maybe there's a better way to write it so we still get the same level of detail from the characters without having to deal with the storyline ending four times, but hey, it sure beats knowing next to nothing about the other so-called \"protagonists\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I hate incest, as I mentioned above. I hate it very much. But by the end of Yosuga no Sora, for whatever reason that may be, I was backing my full support behind the twins. Maybe something is wrong with me, or maybe I need to see a professional about this issue, but whatever reason it may be, I liked watching this. I find it especially strange because I don't like ecchi, I don't like incest, and I have mixed feelings about harems, but mix all of that together and it equates to a show that is otherwise pretty solid all-around. At this point, I'm not even debating the reasons why I like this show. I'm already at a loss for words.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you can't get over the incest, you are missing out on a very good show. Don't be biased, because I already made that mistake and I'm here trying to convince you to watch this show, as ironic as that sounds.\\n\\n\r\nA solid storyline (if you can just keep in mind that the arcs are all alternate endings), characters with more dimension than a 3D movie, and an enjoyment factor that generally improves as you continue to watch. If you aren't a fan of incest and are so biased that you don't want to touch this series, I can understand that. But don't rate this series down on the basis that it's an incest show, which most people have the tendency to do anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI'm no incest, ecchi, or harem fan. I loved this show. Just throw aside all of your previous reservations about this show being bad for pushing incest, and if you still don't like it, I won't blame you. But I guarantee that this show is not a bad show, and the average rating it holds does not truly reflect the quality of this show.",

            "content": "What is right and wrong? Who decides this anyway? When the time comes, will you do things based on what you think is right, or what other people say is?\r\nWhen I first started watching this, it was some form of a \"guilty pleasure\" decision, while I thought it was going to be just another under-developed hentai (or half-hentai, as I used to call it). I was very pleasantly surprised.\r\nBelieve me, this is NOT a hentai. Yes, the main character does have sex with multiple girls over the course of the series, but these scenes have a meaning. More important thing is how they got toit, the story behind each girl, more than just the act of having sex.\\n\\n\r\nThis was made after a visual novel, so it's reasonable that every girl gets a story. Still, in this anime, stories are seperated from each other and only in the last arc, some of the elements from other ones come together. It is obvious that every story, a lot of things change related to each other, but I think it would be more correct to say that the only thing that's really changed is one: the main character.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons why I started watching this anime, was the art. Everything was done fluid and crisp; I equally enjoyed watching the nature and surroundings, and... hmm... body parts. (lol) The people seem real, and the girls are differently built (I really hate it when in anime, all girls look the same). The endings of each episode are made using chibi art, with normal one only used during a ecchi scene. I thought Akira's enourmous chibi head was hilarious, though xD\\n\\n\r\nSound is great too, both voice actors and music. The background music was done nicely, and it didn't feel weird in any part.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, the characters seem chiched and boring: tsundere girl, meganekko slut, awkward class president, childish/mature girl convo... but at the end almost every character has depth.\\n\r\nDuring the different timelines, as Haruka's personality changes for a little, girls' personalities change a little too. Maybe out of jealousy, the non-main girls become much less likeable than they are in their own arc, even though it is made that the personalities are believable: they didn't change the essence, only circumstances.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka is a main character out of the cliche from the very beginning. Even though he isn't one of the typical male harem leads, he seems a little too perfect; nice and charming, so much that all the girls love him. Though, he is a \"Prince Charming\" only on the surface; when the time comes for it, he becomes undecisive and weak. The thing changing over the acrs isn't only the girl he likes, it's his personality as well. Even though, in the end, he always stays the same.\\n\\n\r\nSora is a troubled girl, so much that you can't actually hate her, even if you try. She is clingy, moody, dishonest and insecure, maybe because of the time spent at a hospital that made her delicate like a doll. But, unlike Haru, she knows exactly what she wants and doesn't care what others'll think about it. And it is, being with Haru.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the main arc's, the other timelines' heroines were likeable too: at the start, Nao seems annoying for some reason, but every time there is a need, whichever timeline, she is there to help like an older sister of some sort. Akira reminds me of those theather masks that only have smile on them: regardless the situation, she will mask everything with a smile. Kazuha tries and tries to be like a strict older sister, despite her real gentle personality.\\n\\n\r\nThe order of arcs was the backwards one of my enjoyment as well. I liked the Kazuha one the least, Akira a little more, and so. Motoka chibis in the ending were hilarious, too.\\n\\n\r\nIf insecure, try to make the best decision possible. At the end, at least one person must be hurt, and that is the natural course of things. When loving someone, you shouldn't care what other people think or say. That's what I think, at least!\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this \"half-hentai\" a lot more than I previously thought. :)",

            "content": "First of all, lets make things clear. THERE ARE SEX SCENES WITHIN THIS SERIES!! and this component usually makes people want to simply watch this series as a hentai. If you are planning on doing so, you will be trading a GREAT anime with a HORRIBLE hentai because those scenes are short and not very exciting. Instead, the sex scenes create an unique mood for the story development.\r\nStory 9/10 Yosuga no sora was originally a PC visual novel, this means that the story cannot possibly lack content. The story is very unique, instead of having a million girls liking the main character at the sametime, the story focuses on one heroine for a few episodes then goes back to a \"save point\" and starts a new story with the next one. \\n\\n\r\nI have to split the art part into two.\\n\\n\r\nGeneral art (how the characters look) 8/10\\n\r\nMood art (what makes the current situation or story more interesting)10/10    The art of this anime is capable of completely expressing the character's feelings. The artist is not simply making the characters blush and changing the eyes and eyebrows to express a character's emotions. Instead, the artist uses the body language of the characters. ( the way a character is standing, sitting, lying down, getting f**ked) \\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10 The voice acting for most characters is very satisfying.\\n\r\nThe background music and sounds were generally good. ( with a few scenes that have great background music and sounds) The opening is one of my favorite anime openings. The op song beautifully expresses the general feeling of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 In general (because I might flood the review with my own opinions and lower the quality since i have too much to say\uff09The character portrayal is great, partially thanks to the art; each character has a very unique and attractive personality which also makes the individuality of the characters extremely strong. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10 The only thing holding me back from giving this series a 10/10 for enjoyment is the intense conflicts made one episode seem very long and made me want to take a break. Which is also the reason this anime is enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI would suggest this series to everyone, especially people who likes interesting conflicts and romance.\\n\\n\r\nPS: The visual novel is still much better so why not give the VN a chance while you're at it. Both the art and music are amazing and the stories are more developed in the VN :D\\n\\n",

            "content": "Normally I don't review series, even if I really love them, but one very negative review on this series that I bumped into prompted me to want to give it as much credit as possible. \r\nI am a 18 year old girl. I love anime, but I'm not anti-social or any other stereotype that really fits otaku. I have plenty of friends who think anime in general is weird. And I, possibly the most 'normal' out of all my otaku friends, LOVED this anime.\r\nThe art is amazing. especially when contrasted with the characters. I adored how they made the lead male a bishi without havinghis character be a total soft-hearted pussy, like they do in almost every harem anime I've ever seen!\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, normally I don't even go for harem anime, but this one was very... sincere? I think that's a good way to put it. It really made the best of each arch, so that I felt good and satisfied when the happy ending was reached for each pairing. Even the twincest arch, which I'd never have pinned myself as being a particular fan of.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of all this, the voice acting is very high quality. A lot of the time, what I find in more obscure anime, especially ones like this, is that they supplement their budget by having crappy voice actors. Not Yosuga no Sora. The voice acting was actually very noticeably better than even some mainstream stuff out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say the rating should depend on what you're looking for. When I try to rate anime, I do it based on how someone looking for that genre would rate it. Like, I wouldn't grade Code Geass by the same criteria I would grade Princess Princess. So, that being taken into account, this is an awesome series for those who can go into it with an open mind, and look at the good qualities. The soft-core porn is just a bonus XP\\n",

            "content": "I am at lost for words for this anime.. Hmm.. Give me a moment. Ok now, I  was expecting this to be a harem themed anime but unfortunately, the whole \"Give each girl a seperate arc\" theme that Amagami SS brought in ruined the whole harem genre. However, at least this new style killed many \"THIS IS GOING TO END LIKE SCHOOL DAYS!\" trolls along with it.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nBelieve it or not this actually have a story to it! And a pretty decent one too! However if you're a pacifist then Im sure you'll enjoy it because it deals with a lot of negative emotionssurrounding the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnd did I mention Incest? Yes, like many Autumn line up this year, this one is incest themed, but only for the final arc. Most probably if you read the other reviews, they would have given a low rating due to \"promoting incestuous relationship\"\\n\r\nHey, Im ok with incest, Im ok with homosexuality, but I am definetely not ok with Incestuous homosexuals! (Luckily for me, this anime has none)\\n\\n\r\nBack to the story, every important girl in this anime is given the arc, even the maid in her little amusing chibi skit. (Except for the class president. WHY DOESN'T ANYONE LIKE HER!) And in each arc, Haru here, a.k.a Mr I Dont Know How To Lock Doors When Having Sex, will get down (No not that geddan spastic dance) with each girl. I think that's another reason why most people (including me) gave it a bad review. The sex scene was so unexpected an really... REALLY.. not needed. But does make up for a good fanservice and I know a lot of you pervert out there ain't complaining.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nLike any visual novel adapted into an anime, art is one important aspect. Basically, I would even watch an anime with cruddy story plot if the art is outstanding (Which reminds me of Shukufu no Campbella) Nevertheless, the art is one of the positive side about this anime. It is exceptionally well done.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nBesides the sound of girls moaning and Haru having sex, the choice of BGM for each scene is quite melancholic. I definitely would be adding this anime OST to my list.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nLike every harem, each girl has their own unique set of.. Urmm.. racks...\\n\r\nForget about that. Each girl portrays one of the many fetishes modern day otakus have. There's a gothic like lolicon. There's a cheerful miko. There's a glasses girl (Seriously, glasses? I still dont understand the sexual attraction on this one) There's a high class lady girl, and there;s even a maid! (Sorry but no props to the class president)\\n\r\nAnd the head of all this girls is the harem boss himself, Haru a.k.a \"He Who Definitely Never Watched Porn Before In His Life Thus He Doesnt Know How To Lock Doors But How Come He Knows All Those Sex Positions!\" \\n\r\nWow thats a mouthful.\\n\r\nHaru as all male harem leads is a kind boy who haven't seen his sister for a very long time and thus use that an excuse to have incestuous relationship with her. Damn, that was genius, I wish I would have known that excuse a long time ago!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\nSorry but I would have given a higher rating if it weren't for all those sex scene that ruined the rewatch value. Trust me, if you wanna fap I suggest you do it with REAL hentai, not this anime. Its ECCHI but not HENTAI\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10\\n\r\nI dont think any of the female anime viewers would enjoy watching this anime. Even some male viewers are dissing it. I mean c'mon. Tachibana from Amagami SS needed 4 episodes to even kiss a girl (Well some are slightly earlier) but Haru here just needs 1 episode to get laid with her? \\n\r\nAnyways Im not here to judge on your anime preference. If you like fanservice, then by all mean GO WATCH IT!\\n\r\nIf you love loli figures, then by all mean ONLY WATCH SORA'S ARC\\n\r\nBut if you wanna touch yourself at night, go grab a decent hentai, will you?\\n\\n\r\nHaremu Kingu,\\n\r\nSigning off!",

            "content": "This review contains spoilers.\r\nWhen I started this I was expecting something average , truly, since I did not know anything about the anime, not even the fact that it was a harem, and even less the fact that it was based on a porn game, but when I learned that, it did not stop me from at least giving this anime a chance, and sadly, I did. It turned out to be a major waste of time and being seriously nothing more than your average soft-core hentai harem. \r\nstory(3/10): I know it is quite controversial to give such a low score on something like thatbut I was frankly expecting more from the story. The story itself can be resumed to basically some guy with an awful lot of sex appeal (like any other harem hero) who nails girls one after another in a village (lets not forget the part which was based on the game, which gives us some kind of alternate ending for each girl...). I'm not criticizing the actual story that much but rather its content, it was generic, repetitive, clich\u00e9d and destroyed the very essence of the ''romance'' genre it was suppose to be.\\n\\n\r\nart (5/10): The art wasn't that bad actually and would merit a better score than 5, but the forced 3d animation inserted was obviously done by some amateur or had very little budget associated to its production, thus lowering the score.\\n\\n\r\nsound (3/10): The voice acting itself was not that horrible, though some voices did tend to get on my nerve (the sisters voice for instance). The real downside to the sound was the repetitive background with a range of 3 or 4  instruments maximum (and an excessive use of the piano/violin). \\n\\n\r\ncharacters (5/10): The characters wouldn't have been half bad if it would have been another style of anime and not a romance one, which focuses the whole plot around the actual character development and the interaction of one with another. That part of the anime was actually pretty boring since the characters were all passing the same developments almost in the same order (likes the main character, relationship, problem, reconciliation , sex).\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment (2/10): I can't say i have enjoyed this anime at all. It was long, repetitive and boring, but I must say i have laughed hard in the eleventh episode when i actually saw the overly incestuous couple get caught... and the incest kinda did not help to the enjoyment factor, if your into that kind of stuff, i suggest you watch episode 10/11/12... what you do while watching that is your own damn thing.\\n\\n\r\noverall: 3/10 Overall, this was a pretty bad anime, it was nothing but soft core hentai, and if your really into hentai then its not even for you since its too censored. either way, i don't think this will please people who like romance, since its a harem and they are commonly known to massacre the genre with each episode. plus i don't even think it will satisfy the hentai lovers since its too censored. in the end, this is only something for the pure hardcore lovers of the genre...",

            "content": "Who is to say who we can and can not love?\r\nNormally I never really feel the pull to review a series, but not even finishing the series less then 10 minutes ago, I really felt I should write a review. Please note this is my first review, so either negative or positive feedback is greatly appreciated.\r\nNow, I'm not going to lie, the first thing that pulled me into Yosuga no Sora was the fact there were twins and incest involved. Incest in anime and manga has always been one of my guilty pleasures so I really couldn't help but watch it. I came into thisanime not expecting a lot and boy, did it surprise me. \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the art and animation. It just seemed so real. The characters moved.. swiftly. The characters and the background had such a real feel to me that I could have thought it was a live action show. Of course, that is very much an exaggeration but I was really pleased by the animation. Everything was also so pretty too, I couldn't help but be mesmerized. It really is better then most I see nowadays. I mean, Yosuga isn't perfect, it has its faults here and there but nothing really stood out to me to make me complain. Even the softcore hentai scenes were played out nice, I think. \\n\\n\r\nI was really pleased with the music as well. I thought the opening theme was really catchy and it set the mood for the anime nicely. It was a really mellow tune. The ending theme was really nice too. Both of those songs are songs I could catch myself listening to out of pure entertainment. And the background music to the anime was really clean. Other words to describe it would be beautiful.. gentle.. and never a touch out of place. None of it annoyed me and I found it to be quite a joy to listen to!  The voice actors I really enjoyed too. I thought each voice fit its' character perfectly. Really, I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\n\r\nNow, you could say that the girls were kind of stereotyped. But again, each character turned out real. They each had their own stories and feelings and personalities. The girls mostly stayed the same with each different arc I thought, except Sora of course. I definitely felt Sora's feelings were growing stronger and stronger within each arc but I always sort of felt that she knew what she wanted. I was actually very satisfied with Haruka. He was totally cute ( >.> ;; ) and he was really kind. Somehow I couldn't help but think of Makoto Itou... Oh Makoto.. Anyways, Haru was kind and responsible, always caring for Sora. I guess he really isn't your typical guy, but he kind of is. He's really perfect on the surface, but he has his own faults as well. Sora.. wasn't how I expected her to be. Going into the series I didn't read any character descriptions or anything, I kind of just jumped right in. From her looks, I thought she would be shy and sweet.. but she really can be quite selfish and rude. But she does have her sweet side! So I couldn't help but love her though.. Again, I really enjoyed most of the characters, granted Nao-chan got kind of annoying for me..\\n\\n\r\nThe story was kind of typical too. Watching it, I couldn't help but think of School Days. But this anime was definitely not School Days, especially the ending. Looking at this anime I thought almost instantly of harem. Normally, I don't really like harems. I'm more of a reverse harem kind of person, but because of my incest fetish.. I couldn't help but watch. Yosuga seemed to me.. so much more then a harem. Each girl got her own arc, so to speak, and each were very meaningful. Yes, Haru does have sex with most of these girls, but I found them to be truly touching and not just meaningless sex. This really was kind of softcore hentai, I was actually surprised. More pleased actually, since I admit I do watch my fair share of hentai...  I thought it was nice to have a real series that showed some of those parts and not just skipped ahead and such.. but that just may be the pervert inside of me... > .> ;; But again, this is not a hentai. Again, with the repeating story and the repeating festival that happened, my mind could not help but think of Higurashi.. That Wataganashi Festival will be forever branded in my mind... O_O Unfortunately, we weren't blessed with any murder here! Well.. I don't think my heart would've taken it if any of the characters died.. I liked them.. > .> ;;\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this anime. I hope I don't seemed too biased as it seems to me I was just praising this series from the beginning. Yosuga does have its faults. I mean, it can be looked at as a typical harem.. and not to mention the controversial topic of incest, or more so twincest. Frankly, I was very pleased with the ending, since it was the one I was rooting for all along. And again, normally I'm not a fan of harems. I usually just have one or two girls I like and the rest of the girls I just find to be an annoyance.. But I found myself liking basically every one of these characters, granted Nao-chan. ( Okay I admit, Nao-chan wasn't even that bad... ^.^ ) \\n\\n\r\nSo for you \"deciding to watch\" people, if you really like a bit of touching stories, with a little bit of harem, and a dash of incest, ( Okay, more like a scoop? ) then you might as well give Yosuga no Sora a chance. I think this series will definitely be on my re-watch list. But if you don't like romance, harems, ecchi, or incest, then maybe you should shy away. But I think if you give Yosuga no Sora a chance, you might even be a little surprised!\\n\\n\r\n( Again, this is my first review! Any feedback would be appreciated~ )\\n\\n",

            "content": "'Yosuga no Sora' ('Sora the Blood Relative') is an anime adaptation for an eroge. Like any sane person, I don't support incest nor particularly have an infatuation with sister characters (although I find it funny when sisters get raped in hentai), but decided to check this out because I have seen an extremely moving and thought-provoking Japanese incest movie before: 'Boku wa Imoto ni Koi wo Suru' (2007)\r\nUnfortunately, this was an extremely shallow series in comparison.\r\nI'm sure we're all wondering what those insect antennas are doing on almost every character's hair in this series. It must have surpassed 'Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto' asseries with dumbest ahoge in history. But other than that, the characters are very visually attractive, and hands and feet are drawn with more detail and better proportion than most anime series around.\\n\\n\r\nI must commend the art in this series, not because of its detail or style, but because of its revolutionary distribution of animation budget. A typical show goes like this: 1:00 flashback, 1:30 OP, 17:30 content, 1:30 ED1, 2:00 side story, 1:30ED2 for 25-minute ad-free air time. The side story has super-simplistic backgrounds with chibi-form characters, which is a lot easier to draw and saves money/time. What this and having two EDs per episode has allowed, is only 17:30 of actual content per show instead of standard 22:00. The shorter actual content in combined with heavy recycling of backgrounds has enabled very beautiful character appearance and animation despite the apparent small budget.\\n\\n\r\nThis is damaging to the art consistency and content, but fortunately this series didn't have much material to begin with, and leaves much better impression than average quality overall.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was pretty good, everyone sounded like they should.\\n\r\nBGM was also pretty good with nostalgic, gentle pieces that complimented the visuals in creating a peaceful countryside atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe theme songs were extremely weak, I would've expected more from Eufonius, but the song sounded tiring as Riya was trying and failing to hit the high keys. Two EDs were very forgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe opening act was the worst episode 1 I've ever seen. It served as an introduction to the main couple's relationship and other girls he would eventually tap, but it presented itself as a shallow harem right off the bat. All the girls basically fall in love at first sight without apparent reasons. It's also difficult to imagine countryside girls would dig a bishounen type.\\n\r\nOther girls back off after that though, and the main character goes after them one by one. The story in this series has a eroge-like save function where the protagonist chooses different paths and play out what would've happened had he chosen differently. It's kind of interesting, but unfortunately, the whole concept tumbled when heroines acted completely different in each arc. For example, Sora accepts Haruka and Nao's relationship in one arc, but in the following one, she becomes so mentally unstable that the previous arc's ending could've never happened.\\n\\n\r\nIt was also difficult to see why the protagonist would go after each girl. In 'Amagami SS', they at least attempt to explain this by who the protagonist walks into immediately after a life-altering event. Here, the main character seemed to just go after them because he had to (the scriptwriter forced him to).\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are of course the typical harem archetypes, and there's nothing wrong with that, but they never grew out of their cardboard cutout existence. Every girl would suddenly share a devastating past trauma to the main character, and then make out with him after he somehow solve their problems. Character development here just seemed to be manufactured to get us to sympathize with heroines, and feels like we're just supposed to go along with it. This is a blatant sign of poor story writing, because such issues should be uncovered natural enough or the story should be so engaging that we won't even notice such details if done right.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between the main couple were seen in other heroine's arcs, and it's somewhat understandable that they would eventually commit incestuous act given their mutual feelings and couple of awkward events between the two. However, issues such as morality and love surrounding incest was never explored in this series, and in the end, it just seemed like lust, and they even make up a half-assed excuse that this is okay because they have been apart for so long that they see each other as strangers rather than siblings. This defeats the whole point of this series being incest themed, and whatever point they made after that seemed to be superfluous.\\n\\n\\n\r\n'Yosuga no Sora', unlike 'Amagami SS', presented itself as a thought-provoking and controversial incest themed series with foreshadowing of the main couple's relationship with all the \"restarts\". But in the end, it failed to fulfill its own promise, and turned into yet another shallow romance anime more suited for hentai. If you're looking for a deep incest drama, you won't find it here. Less than average series, less than hentai.",

Hopefully my review about this anime will have an effect on whether you watch it or not; and hopefully you don't, because believe me; you\u0081fre just wasting your time. Also, I recommend those who actually \"liked\" this anime to not read this review, it'll probably just turn your day upside down. Overall, this anime is one of the worse anime I have ever seen, only topped by School Days.\r\nI personally feel sorry for the producer who released and airedthis anime. They must have either been drunk and got tricked into airing/releasing this, or must have run out of ideas and had no other choice but to summit this.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nNow if you've read the synopsis you get a little summary of it, but that doesn't really explain much, because this anime doesn't even have a story. The twins, which are the 2 main characters, lost their parents in an accident. First of all, it was never revealed to how the parents died. And later they apparently moved in with their grandfather\u0081 who never even made a screen appearance.\\n\r\nDuring the first half or maybe a little further into the anime, it was more of an arc anime. Each and every girl Haru bangs gets a little side story, but when it got to the Nao arc\u0081c ohh man... I just felt as if they gave up on this anime.\\n\r\nOk... now I know very well that this is rated \u0081gR+ - Mild Nudity\u0081h, but damn, did they have to add in a sex scenes for every episodes? I thought this was a TV series, not a hentai. They practically turned this anime into a hentai OVA series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThis is probably the only damn thing good about this anime. Personally I have no problem with the art... There was actually some nice scenery; I really think they did a good job on the backgrounds and locations. But as for the nude shots... ugh... I got sick of seeing it after a few times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nNow the sounds weren't too bad. The OP was by eufonius, which I happen to listen to from time to time. As for EDs.. I can't even remember them, and I probably wouldn't want to. As for the sex sounds, I\u0081fm glad they restrained themselves from letting out to many groans and moans, because this is a TV series and not a hentai. As for the voice acting, I didn't have a problem with that. Most of the characters voices were to my liking.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nOh god... I don't even want to mention the characters. Personally, the only character I liked was the stuffed rabbit that Sora carried around. It just goes to show how much I hated the characters from this anime.\\n\r\nHaruka ? The main male lead of the whole series. He\u0081fs not worthy to mention because all he does is go around having sex with girls.\\n\r\nSora ? Haruka\u0081fs twin sister. She wasn't bad at all during the first half of the series, but then the Nao arc came along which changed my whole opinion on her.\\n\r\nAkira - It was revealed in her arc that she was the daughter of the Migiwa head family, which makes her Kazuha half older sister. I actually thought she was pretty cute\u0081c until, Haruka showed up in her life\u0081c -.-\\n\r\nKazuha - Daughter of the Migiwa head family. Not much was really mentioned about her. Except the fact that she met Haruka on first day he moved back.\\n\r\nNao - Oh god... I hated her most in this series. not much about her was likable.. matter of fact, there was none.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nYou really think I can enjoy this? Well, I'm not saying I\u0081fm not the type to watch soft hentai or ecchi, but to have every episode include a sex scene is somewhat pushing it. Personally, I really hated this anime. I didn't feel the slightest bit of enjoyment and it was honestly bad. My friends and I could probably make a better anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nFinally, here\u0081fs what I think overall:\\n\r\nCrap + Waste of time + Shitty Plot = Yosuga no Sora",

            "content": "I was first drawn to Yosuga no Sora by its poster. It stood out in the Fall 2010 anime preview, where every other series used every color of the rainbow to grab the audience's attention, this series had a rather simple depicting of Haru and Sora under a blue sky. \r\nThe expressions of the characters reminded me a bit of \"ef - a tale of memories\", \"True Tears\" and other romantic anime that weren't also part comedy. My favorite genre is romance and I had high hopes going into this series. Unfortunately in this case, the old axiom of 'never judge a book by itscover' proved itself true.\\n\\n\\n\r\n====== Story ======\\n\r\nWhen I read the series synopsis, I came in expecting a serious story, perhaps even tragic in its setup. In contrast, the problems the characters dealt with in the series felt very trivial, adolescent even in importance. Only in Sora's arc did I feel that the characters were ever dealing with a true issue, not one so easily solved in an afternoon's worth under the sheets. Ultimately, I would describe the storyline as shallow at best, but perhaps this is what was intended. Those looking for a deeper storyline as was alluded to in the synopsis will only find disappointment here.\\n\\n\\n\r\n===== Art =====\\n\r\nThe character designs in the anime were well drawn out, with proportions that closely resembled real people. There were varying levels in consistency from episode to episode in how the characters were drawn; it seemed that as the series wore on, some scenes revealed poor animation. Expressions were not as detailed or varied as one would have hoped, given the anime relies so strongly on character interaction. The backgrounds were weak to average at best. They looked very 2D to me, with low attention to detail. It seems as if the artists did just enough each scene to make it work, but nothing to make it stand out. \\n\\n\r\n===== Sound =====\\n\r\nOne constant throughout the series was the great soundtrack that helped to set the mood. Especially in the more serious scenes, the music felt very appropriate to what was happening on-screen and really helped convey whatever emotions the characters were feeling. Beyond simply setting the mood, the music was beautiful to listen to, I found myself listening more to the music in certain scenes than the voices. Both the OP and initial ED were well done, fitting the series quite well. \\n\\n\r\n===== Characters =====\\n\r\nPerhaps it was due to only having a 13 episode season, but outside of Sora and Haru, the relationships between characters were not convincing at all. Characters felt very static, as they changed little throughout their respective arcs.\\n\\n\r\n===== Conclusion =====\\n\r\nThe main selling point of this series is the amount of skin that is shown. The story of the show is very weak, especially in earlier arcs and there is little redemption to be found in the characters; I would go so far as to say some of them were even annoying in how often they changed their moods or worried about problems that weren't really problems at all. If the promise of incest is enough to keep you watching despite these problems, then I would cautiously recommend Yosuga no Sora.\\n",

            "content": "I just want to start off by saying that \"YES, this anime does contain mild sex scenes and incestuous themes\", but if you're comfortable enough with your own insecurities and own ideals, you should still find this to be an enjoyable anime. After all, this is not the first nor the last anime that will contain such said themes. As a person with a little sister, I do get uncomfortable with themes like incest because I love my sister, but I'm not physically attracted to her at all. Anyway, now that I've got THAT out of the way, I'll keep thisreview short and simple. \\n\\n\r\nStory (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n      The main story is told through the perspective of Haruka Kasugano, a male high school student whose parents have deceased. Now all alone with his twin sister, he deals with a series of different relationships with different girls. Honestly, not the most insanely interesting story, but pretty good and engaging. The story is told at a rather fast pace for a romance/drama and I think that really helps keep the audience engaged. The ending was rather satisfying, but it was also rather predictable and almost borderline boring. I kind of wanted more drama towards the end and not the bittersweet ending the anime presented itself with. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n    Not really much to say here. The art was extremely beautiful. Each character had unique facial features and no one character looked alike for the most part. However, there wasn't anything special enough for me to say this was \"Jaw-dropping\" or anything like that. Pretty nice art nonetheless. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n   Pretty nice music throughout the whole anime. Nothing totally special, but good enough for me to notice. Opening and closing songs were ok and maybe worth downloading. Decent music for Romance/Drama though. Definitely helped hype up emotion in many of the scenes throughout the entire series. As far as voice acting goes, pretty good, but keep in mind I don't speak Japanese so I can't say it's perfect for sure. There were never any awkward out of sync problems or glitches either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n     Maybe It's just me, but judging characters in harem anime is typically hard because you can't focus on one character for too long or be completely satisfied with the amount of screen time your favorite character gets. However, this anime does a good job of splitting up screen time and character development evenly. Unfortunately, that also means it's hard to get attached to a single character. I also found some characters annoying and a bit extraneous. For example, the class rep and other male lead felt like they didn't need to be there. The male protagonist was also a bit boring and stereotypical. On the other hand, his twin sister was a pretty interesting character, but just didn't have enough screen time to develop properly. Decent characters in general. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n     This is all based on my own personal taste so don't hate me if I enjoyed this anime more or less than you. I don't think it's a bad anime, but it is sort of boring at times. I've been on a Romance/Drama/Comedy anime roll lately so I might be judging this anime harshly. I did enjoy it overall, but it's definitely not anime I'd go crazy over. Is it worth watching? Yeah, sure. It's pretty short and has a pretty fast pace so it's pretty easy to get into it. I think I would've enjoyed it more if the some characters weren't so bland and stereotypical. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\\n\r\n   Good, but not great. Worth investing time into, but not anything to rush for. I would put this anime just a little above average. I had a decent time watching and hope to find more like it.",

            "content": "This review is based on the first three episodes of Yosuga no Sora. I repeat: Everything in this review is based off the first three episodes of the anime! My opinion may change, either a minor change or a drastic/significant change. \r\nStory 8/10  - The story certainly is intriguing and unique to the anime. Unlike major, well-loved animes, the plot of this anime doesn't really make you think \"This anime is awesome! I gotta watch the next episode!\" It's more of the feeling of, \"Why are the characters doing that? Maybe the answer will be in the next episode.\". The main difference, I feel,is that they intentionally leave out some important details in a matter that we become interested so that we try to figure it out (the only way is to continue on). Now, I think that in some areas of the anime, things become slightly rushed, and sometimes things are too slow, so it doesn't have good consistency with plot development.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10 - I especially like the artwork in this anime. The details are made clear, the animation is smooth, and the characters are \"KAWAII!\". Anywho, this is not an anime for loli fans. The characters are more refined, and it gives some mixed feelings, whereas the story has a mix of seriousness and... uh... care-free-ness (is that even a word?) while the art makes it look like it's an anime fit for adults (technically, it's rated R+ for mild nudity, so even though I doubt this'll make a difference, KIDS, STAY AWAY FROM IT).\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/0 - The soundtracks match the scenery and situations very nicely, although I feel that during some significant parts of this anime, they should change the soundtrack. An emotional scene being backed up by a \"cheery\" soundtrack sometimes doesn't fit in.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 - This is part of the flaw of the storyline. The characters aren't the average generic anime characters. They all have their own unique personality, and you get to like them. The main problem, though, is the character development. It's the main part that is too slow in development. At the end of the first two episodes, I felt as though I still had no clue about the characters, though I knew the directly announced details. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10 - So far, I like this anime. Though it could use some improvements, it takes a different approach at catching the audience, the art is VERY nice (comparable with anime movies), and it stands out from most copy-and-paste-stories-from-other-animes-and-otherstuff animes.",

            "content": "Incest without guilt would be like sausages without mustard. If you like incest romance, it\u2019s definitely worth watching.\r\nI watched the show then read the visual novel so I\u2019ll include some comparison in here for those who are interested.\r\nPremise:\r\nBoy and girl twins, Haruka and Sora; their parents died. They move into their gandpa\u2019s house in the countryside(granpa is dead). They used to visit Granpa a lot. Lots of girls in this town like Haruka because he is pretty. Omnibus romance ensues. Haruka and Sora try to keep a tight lid on what\u2019s going on between them, but the opening kinda gives it away.\r\nCharacters:\r\nAkira is an energeticand really nice and sociable shrine maiden with family issues, which she is an orphan so\u2026 In the visual novel she\u2019s a much bigger presence to be honest. No matter which route you take, she strongly empathizes with all the characters and tries to help them no matter what they\u2019re going through. Here, she's... energetic and nice and has family issues. She also has giant boobs in this. Boobs generally are a lot bigger in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nKazuha is rich and pretty. And she plays the violin. I guess she\u2019s nice.\\n\\n\r\nNao, I think, actually calls herself Haruka\u2019s big sister from time to time. She\u2019s really just his childhood friend. She\u2019s supportive and relatively mature.  And when her arc comes around, I admire her. She has a boyfriend who is deeply obsessed with his twin sister, and Nao is just like, \u201cWell, I knew what I was getting myself into.\u201d It\u2019s not that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t have a problem with it, but she\u2019s known Haru and Sora for so long she\u2019s on their side no matter what. Though Sora utterly hates her guts.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka, in the anime, is a fairly normal pretty boy aside from his relationship with his twin sister. The visual novel focused a lot more on Haru simply trying to learn to live on his own with Sora, sort out their household, and integrate both himself and Sora into this town. The anime focuses a lot more on the romances which leaves Haru with not much character development and not much to do aside from tending on his girlfriend of the week. I think Sora\u2019s arc works much better because dealing with her brings out a lot more of Haru's past. Also, how a man deals with his incestuous desires is really a test of character. \\n\\n\r\nKnowing Haru as I do from the VN, he\u2019s really just as messed up by his parents' deaths as Sora is, but he feels like he needs to keep it together for Sora\u2019s sake. In the anime they make it seem as if he enjoys Sora\u2019s relying in him, but in the VN we see that after the funeral, Sora kinda freaked out and put everything on his shoulders. He didn\u2019t have much of a choice, and he\u2019s really not sure what he\u2019s doing trying to run a household.  Deep down, he wants someone else to make these decisions or at least show him what to do and he resents Sora always putting everything on him while she tales it easy. Well, we don\u2019t get too much of that in the anime, but we do get to see him nearly lose his mind and cry big hot man-tears over Sora, which is about as good.\\n\\n\r\nSora is quiet, reclusive, haughty, and dismissive. The only person she ever listens to even sometimes is her brother Haru. She spent half her life in a hospital and Haru was the only person who visited her on a regular basis. She\u2019s developed a strong attachment to Haru , though she normally never leaves her room. She\u2019s gotten very used to sitting alone in her bed and surfing the internet. I lover her line when Haru tells her he\u2019s not sure they can get internet and she says, \u201cI cannot live without it.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nFor me, Sora is the one who makes this anime. I even like her better here than in the visual novel. The little scenes where she mocks the other girls behind their backs, the little fantasies of hers we see every so often; it adds something to her character that really wasn\u2019t in the visual novel. Honestly, in the VN I couldn\u2019t tell if she was really in love with Haru or just insanely jealous of Nao. She actually comes off a little more mature and, well, sane in this version. Her voice, here, is also a slightly lower register and doesn\u2019t sound so ridiculously cutesy. That helps.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion/Opinion:\\n\r\nHonestly, I enjoy this anime a lot more than I should. I do so by ignoring episodes 4-9 and focusing on the relationship between Haru and Sora. Other people seem to think the Kazuha, Akira, and Nao romances are worthwhile, and you might like them. Plotwise, however, they are pretty thin. The show tries to involve us by giving the girls back stories,  but the conflict involved is a pale shadow compared to what\u2019s going on between Haru and Sora in the first episode. This was not a good candidate for the omnibus romance structure.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, Haru is mostly characterized in the VN by his attempts to manage his household and deal with Sora. The anime doesn\u2019t have time for household details because they need to make room for four different romance stories, and his romantic interests don\u2019t really tell us much about Haru. This makes it hard to care about Haru\u2019s relationships since we don\u2019t really know much about him. \\n\\n\r\nI think they would have done better to give this a merged structure like the Kanon and Clannad animes. We could even have kept some of the sex scenes too. All we\u2019d have to do is say Haru is one pretty son of a gun and he needs to distract himself from his sister by involving himself in the problems of all these other girls. I mean that\u2019s basically what they did with Nao in the final arc anyway.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I really like here are the parts dealing with Haru and Sora\u2019s relationship. I love this one scene in the first episode where Haru and Sora are sitting across the table from eachother and we see an imaginary scene of Haru walking over an kissing his sister. But who imagined it? I\u2019ve seen people argue it both ways and honestly, I don\u2019t see why both of them shouldn\u2019t be imagining it. Its definitely on both their minds. \\n\\n\r\nI love the tension which arises from seeing that Haru and Sora are clearly obsessed with eachother from the beginning but that they keep a very tight lid on it. I remember when this first came out, someone stated just how smart it was to make it clear from the beginning that there would be sex in this anime.  This allows the first episode to clearly pose the question, \u201cAre these two going to have sex?\u201d without there necessarily being a clear answer. Though the Omnibus romance structure kinda promises Haru\u2019s gonna have sex with everybody at some point, I think it was a smart move to put the Sora arc at the end to give time for the tension to rise. It would have been even smarter if the structure were merged but oh well.\\n\\n\r\nI particularly love Haru\u2019s decent into insanity. I\u2019ve gone insane before and, yeah, this is pretty much what it\u2019s like. Zegapain kinda has a similar thing but it\u2019s a little more drawn out here. And I should let you know, this part isn\u2019t in the VN, it just wouldn\u2019t work. In the VN, Haru goes crazy in other ways, becoming as detached with reality as Sora is. But here, we get to see Haru\u2019s face as he cries big man-tears, and we get to see him try to make his relationship with  Nao work out. We get to see him desperately reach out for help and get rejected. That\u2019s some powerful cinema.\\n\\n\r\nOther nice bits include seeing Haru and Sora constantly texting eachother on their smart phones.  That was a lot of fun to see in action. The scenery, which is based on an actual small town in the Japanese countryside, is also very different from the VN. Its not really better or worse. I like the character designs better in the VN, where the art in general has a much softer feel and uses less vivid colors so that everything looks a little faded. But the vivid colors of the anime work much better for the environment. \\n\\n\r\nI also love how Kozue gets a name in this. In the VN even her dialogue box is labeled \u201cClass Prez\u201d. She\u2019s not really any more important here but I like how she freaks out and gets all judgmental at the end. Everyone is way too okay with all this in the VN, but Kozue in the anime knows how to lay on the guilt and social rejection like a boss. I used to hate her in this anime. Reading the VN made me realize just how much she adds to the story. Incest without guilt really is like sausages without mustard.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, I love how Haru is voicedby the same guy who did Katsuragi Keima in TWGOK and Kamina Ayato in RahXephon. Shimono Hiro is just awesome at screaming like a madman. Plus now I can imagine this show is really about Kami-niisama playing through the VN.\\n\\n\r\nI rate this as a 7 because fully half of the show is not worth rewatching. The art isn\u2019t too remarkable and the music while appropriate can get a little clich\u00e9. The plot isn\u2019t exactly Count of Monte Cristo genius, but is succeeds in raising the tension and bringing out some of the characters. I thoroughly however enjoy rewatching the final arc and the first few episodes. I recommend it to anyone who can put up with incest and the omnibus structure.\\n",

            "content": "I think a more appropriate name for this series, to try to avoid being profane, would be \"The Screwing Haru Show\" considering how this show is set. Pretty much, the series is set up in several arcs that involve male lead Haruka hooking up with one of several girls, resolving some sort of dramatic element with them and then inevitably having intercourse with them at the end of the arc with events reset afterward to feature the cycle repeating with another girl acquainted with Haruka. The series is pretty much an excuse to have Haruka engage in softcore sexual action with the \"girl of thearc\" as the personalities of each gal are pretty archetypal and plot scenarios being anything you would see done to death from an eroge game. The show is so ignorant of providing enough fleshing out and development of its characters, especially with its \"resets\" after each arc, that the series will have you caring more for the sex in it than whatever convoluted drama the series cooks up for the relationships that Haruka gets into.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst of these arcs was with the final one involving Sora as, regrettably, the show features an arc where Haruka commits to an incestuous fling with his twin sister. This combines the two normal issues to be expected with featuring incest in an anime title as it features melodramatic trappings and a cheap excuse to feature perverted/ sexual rompings with the twin fraternal siblings. Don't even think this is as tasteful and sensible as Koi Kaze in believably exploring incest.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also includes a dull attempt at comedy with an omake mini-episode at the end of each episode to Yosuga no Sora featuring some older maid trying to hook up with Haruka. The fact we see maid gal masturbating in the first mini-episode of the series didn't have my hopes up of even caring for what would take place in it.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I can generally praise with Yosuga no Sora would be its visuals as they featured well-detailed character designs, beautiful shots of scenery and vibrant colors, which are only downturned by the title's subpar frame rate within a number of animated shots.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yosuga no Sora is just another cheap ecchi title for the otaku crowd to go googly-eyed for. Anyone expecting anything more tasteful, in-depth and sensible with their content should avoid this dud like the plague.",

            "content": "At first sight, many people might turn away in disgust when finding out the anime includes incest and softcore, while disregarding all other aspects of the story. However Yosuga no Sora is a genuinely enticing drama that, when looked at with an unbiased and thoughtful perspective, displays a heartwarming drama (One of the best in my opinion, challenging Clannad).\r\n     The story separates into four arcs, where Haruka, the main character, courts one for each main female character: Episode 1,2,3,4 for Migiwa; Episodes 1,2,5,6 for Akira; Episodes 1,2,7,8,9 for Nao; and the main storyline 1,2,7,10,11,12 forSora. This is not just some typical harem where the main character is just simply infatuated by each girl in their respective arc. There is a deep, thorough and complex story and personality behind each character, and it makes the characters feel realistic. The only flaw I see in the series is its short length. Not enough time is given for each arc to progress. Though it doesn't feel rushed, more details could be put between each arc to enchance the story. 9/10\\n\\n\r\n     I have to admit, this series have perhaps one of the best artwork and music I have ever seen in an anime. The characters are all designed beautifully, and the animation was smooth. This will really please any modern viewers like me. 10/10. Now the music is also beautiful. The BGM really brings out the emotion in each episodes and sets the mood perfectly. If you don't believe me, just watch the first episode. 10/10\\n\\n\r\n     The anime is filled with suspense and drama, so brace yourselves. Now the controversial parts. As the story progressives to the end of each arc, there is generally one or possibly more softcore sex scene. HOWEVER, this was not forced and has the motive of moving the story forward. It gives more to the plot rather than a cheap sex scene. People will also question the incest (twincest) in the story. I garuntee you potential viewers, watch the anime to the end, consider the character's feelings, WHY would they want to be together, and think about if you are to take the character's places, how much would you give to love. Morality is overall governed by yourself. \\n\\n\r\nConsider these points and dive in for an epitome of romance anime. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

This anime was truly a work of art, and helped my out with a tough time in my life. I was in a dark place, with school pressing down on me, and depression setting in, i was unable to be the person i wanted to be. However, this anime was a shining beacon of hope for me. This passionate story, about a brother and sister, really helped me pull through, and enabled me to become the person whoi wanted to be, and do well at school. Episode 11 was the turning point for me really, especially the end, i felt at that point that i had to get off my ass, and do something in my life, just like the two twins in this anime. So i started to study really hard, and pulled my life out of a downward spiral. I believe this anime will change anyone's life if they watch it, and will really help you with tough times in your life. I owe so much to this, and i wish i could give a bit more back to it than just this review, as it has given so much to me. If it can pull one person from the verge of suicide, then it can pull anyone away, so i would really recommend watching it a few times, and especially watching episode 11 many times, just as i have. Make sure you share this with your family, friends, teachers, and aged community, so they can all have a refreshing, and invigorating experience will watching this passionate and life changing story about these two amazing courageous twins, who don't stay bound by the rules of others, and dare to break the boundaries of modern society. This si a truly inspirational story, and i will use it for reference material in the future for my own kids and students.",

And that could not have been done without the minor hentai.\r\nAll anime need to have its audience keep watching the show. For some anime, it's the story. For others, 'ecchi.'  For this show, it was probably the minor hentai. Because this anime already had an aspect to keep its viewers glued to the screen, it didn't have to rely on some obvious and stupid fanservice, nor did it have to try to put in a plot twist just to keep it interesting.\r\nBecause the life of a hentai isits art, the art of the whole show was great. The sound was also splendid, and I'm sure anyone who's watched this show would at least agree on that point. These two plus the countryside setting make the atmosphere of this show one of the best in the anime genre, ever.\\n\\n\r\nSo, for new viewers and those who dropped this show, I want you to see this show not for its story, but for its atmosphere. The characters, art, sound, and setting would grab your heart in the first minutes of the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut in the end, the anime is a minor hentai. It wouldn't grab everyone's heart. There is incest, a bit of yuri, and some obvious sex scenes. But for me, the anime just felt so nostalgic that I didn't really mind them. So go on, watch this show. Don't drop it before watching it just because it's a hentai. There's a reason it's so popular.",

As anime watcher it might be slight worser.\r\nFirst of all: *This is my review what i think of this anime, your's could be different in all perspectives*\r\nWhat's yosuga no Sora about? * NO SPOILERS *\r\nA boy and a girl lost their parents and they go back to their old home and start living there again meeting old friends and finding love and gettingback their old habbits and such.\\n\\n\r\nStory: \\n\r\nThere is not a big storyline but that's not really needed in this anime. pretty much what i said: A boy and a girl lost their parents and they go back to their old home and start living there again. that's the story and that's all you need to know to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is so good in this anime. just wow!. pretty much on of the greater artworks i've seen in my anime's. It matches perfectly with the theme, and has great work in the finer work, like shadows. pumped to see more of this kind of art. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nMusic fitting in greatly wouldn't say much about that. but the finer work like raindrops and other small details in things in the forst is kinda lacking my expectations. but still did a more then fine job i would say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI have never seen such great work out in charecter's ever. all are unique and it's just wow how that never changed in to whole anime. also the perfection's in hair and even clothing is worked out so that i should be screaming GG! for an hour after this anime. Thing's like clothing style of girls and boys are worked out good togheter in a lot of situations where they did even match each other. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nCouldn't stop watching that's all you need. because this is for everyone different :).\\n\\n\r\nOverall a great anime with a detail on the small things and focussing on the romance part of this anime.\\n\r\nGreat job Yosuga no Sora. i loved you!\\n\\n\r\nscore 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nRecomended to: Romance lovers, people with not feeling bad about sex scenes. and people who want to watch a serious anime. Because this anime isn't this anime: like oww i want to have a anime that fills my time, but an anime thats just beautifull in many ways.",

            "content": "Yosuga no sora seems to be an anime built like some kind of Eroge , I don't know if it's an eroge adaptation , I suppose it might be because  so far the arcs of the series seems to revolve with the main protagonist  going out with each girl and in the last episode of that arc ''unlocking'' the ecchi scene .\r\nThat's why it makes me think a lot about an eroge .\r\nThe art is pretty nice , I think it's not the best I've seen but however the chara design is still very likeable. The soundtracks are also really nice and that'swhat caught my attention more than the plot which seems a bit  clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nHowever , the plot REALLY is clich\u00e9 , not even the sad scenes involving some of the character's past  manages to make me think otherwise. We have really clich\u00e9 characters overall , including the tsundere imouto , the cool/prefect big brother , the hyper girl , the busty shy girl and other stereotypes. Not to mention the Maid that act like a frickin' sex addict... -___-'\\n\\n\r\nThough I was a bit afraid of the story revolving too much about Sora's incestuous love for Haru but so far it stayed pretty decent . But I expect they'll make an arc with SoraXHaru as the main couple....\\n\r\nEcchi scenes and more ecchi scenes , that's mostly  the only thing this anime has to offer even if it tries to disguise itself in a somewhat serious plot , we see it comming. \\n\\n\r\nTo finish I'll say that Yosuga no sora is far from being the best anime I've seen , but it's not the worst either , if you don't really need a nice plot and just want some romance and fanservice well there you go . \\n\r\nI'd give it a 6 because I've seen many other ecchi anime and it's a bit better than  expected but it's still not really interesting , I'm hesitating on watching it entierly.",

            "content": "Okay, so what's up with the subpar overall rating, and the reviews that suggest the exact opposite? It's as if the viewership's feelings towards this show fluctuate like the energy levels of a 12-year-old kid running on nothing but Monster and Red Bull. Yosuga no Sora is a controversial anime show, but it's no reason to lay down heavy artillery fire and bring all sorts of Hell on it.\r\nLet's get one thing crystal clear. I am NOT a fan of incest, WINcest, or TWINcest. I am not even remotely sure why a writer will go out of his right mind and write a show whilehe's high off acid, because any of the three I mentioned above end up becoming the byproduct of the writer while he's stuck in his \"zone\". But I'm an opportunist. Once I've started a show, I won't stop until I've finished (and yes, I've heard of a break, but I watch a show the whole way through to make sure I have a good grip on it). This is why, 12 episodes later, I am writing a review about a controversial series, to deliver a message that I think is important to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that message would hopefully convince you to throw your biases aside and watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: The thought of incest makes my stomach knot up in the most painful way imaginable. Mention it once in a show and I will bat an eyelid and turn in the opposite direction. I know, I'm a biased person, but what can I say?\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I am a stone cold sucker for a good storyline. Do everything else absolutely wrong, from the art all the way down to the characters. As long as you do the storyline right, I may like it very much. You can say that the storyline for Yosuga no Sora is what drew me in.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't run like a normal harem show. If you've ever watched the ending to a movie, bought the media, and watched the bonus footage with all the alternate endings, this is basically what Yosuga no Sora is pursuing, only, all that bonus footage plays a hand in the storyline. This translates to four possible endings, like an eroge or a visual novel. The protagonist, Haruka, can end up with one of four people: Akira, Kazuha, Nao, and Sora. This is what will confuse a good mess of viewers: the story is connected, but what applies in one arc will NOT translate into another; if Haruka ends up with Akira in one arc, the same does NOT apply in an arc that focuses on Kazuha. If I didn't explain it well enough, there's a whole section for it on Wikipedia.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, down to the actual story. In the same fashion as a visual novel, the guy meets the girl, who has an issue that needs to be resolved. They resolve the issue, and end up together. We know that will happen, that's a given. It's Haruka being the nice guy, doing all the right things, and finally when everything comes together, they officially become a couple. That's how it is with all the arcs, but the events that lead up to that point differ from character to character. In some arcs, we see the true colors of those characters involved brought to light, while some offer a background story with a great amount of depth.\\n\\n\r\nAs some would like to reveal outright, there are sex scenes in this show, but even if you aren't a fan of fan service, stick around. There's a reason for these scenes. It's not just \"random ecchi\", unlike other shows that take advantage of their genre and perform a nip slip every other episode. Yosuga no Sora knows very well what its genre is, and it doesn't try to push its true nature into every slot it sees fit. The sex scenes are integrated with the storyline. Their connection has an impact on the progression of events, and that's what makes this show unique.\\n\\n\r\nArt: If you're into ecchi or hentai for that reason, don't walk into Yosuga no Sora expecting any of that. In fact, if you're reading this right now, pull your pants up and fix your belt. Please. I don't want to think about the strange things you're doing at home by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nPeople that read the reviews expect this show to be on the verge of hentai and expect to use this as their \"material\", only to get thoroughly disappointed at how the reviews online lied, therefore, this show sucks. But the fan service, the ecchi scenes, and the \"weak hentai\" for that matter are all easier comparable to typical ecchi shows that go overboard with fan service. Think about an ecchi show that heavily emphasizes fan service. There are shows like that which are not afraid to exercise nipple exposure and an outrageous array of sexual references. Here's where their first obstacle appears: in which one of those shows do these ecchi scenes have ANYTHING to do with the story? Even if you're a fan of ecchi and you've been around long enough to have seen each and every one of them, you won't be able to name a whole lot. This is what makes Yosuga no Sora's fan service unique; it's not there to be there and give the fans something to swoon over. It's there to shed light on certain situations.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's still ecchi. This is certainly a double-edged sword that fights and fulfills my preferences.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The music is mostly reminiscent of a drama. That lack of upbeat music gives Yosuga no Sora a dramatic mood, but at the same time, the notes are not deep enough to drop your heart at every stroke of the key. It doesn't play out that mood all the time. There are some pieces of music in higher spirits, but don't expect to watch this show with a smile on your face the whole time, the way you watch with that perverted look every time you come across an ecchi. I don't even know how to explain it. Whatever.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This is why Yosuga no Sora is a unique harem. How often do the characters of a harem get their own screen time? Think about that for a second. Have you ever seen a harem so predictable that you saw the ending and thought, \"yeah, I knew it\"? It happens all the time, and the reason for that would be the lack of development for the other \"protagonists\", if we can even give them that name. Harem shows tend to place emphasis on one character that the writer determines will be with the protagonist no matter what; their development comes first while the other participants get a noticeable lack of screen time, therefore, only one route is ever truly open to the protagonist. It's annoying, and that is why I believe harems aren't as widely accepted as other genres.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora is different. They may be separate arcs which revolve around alternate endings, but we get to see firsthand things such as personality, past events, and the true nature of certain characters instead of having to be told by someone that this is who they are and we have to take their word for it. These characters' ideals and personalities will stay constant throughout the series regardless of the events they are situated in, so as we progress through the arcs, we will continue to learn more and more about the character at the center of each arc, plus a little more about the other supporting characters. Maybe there's a better way to write it so we still get the same level of detail from the characters without having to deal with the storyline ending four times, but hey, it sure beats knowing next to nothing about the other so-called \"protagonists\".\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I hate incest, as I mentioned above. I hate it very much. But by the end of Yosuga no Sora, for whatever reason that may be, I was backing my full support behind the twins. Maybe something is wrong with me, or maybe I need to see a professional about this issue, but whatever reason it may be, I liked watching this. I find it especially strange because I don't like ecchi, I don't like incest, and I have mixed feelings about harems, but mix all of that together and it equates to a show that is otherwise pretty solid all-around. At this point, I'm not even debating the reasons why I like this show. I'm already at a loss for words.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: If you can't get over the incest, you are missing out on a very good show. Don't be biased, because I already made that mistake and I'm here trying to convince you to watch this show, as ironic as that sounds.\\n\\n\r\nA solid storyline (if you can just keep in mind that the arcs are all alternate endings), characters with more dimension than a 3D movie, and an enjoyment factor that generally improves as you continue to watch. If you aren't a fan of incest and are so biased that you don't want to touch this series, I can understand that. But don't rate this series down on the basis that it's an incest show, which most people have the tendency to do anyways.\\n\\n\r\nI'm no incest, ecchi, or harem fan. I loved this show. Just throw aside all of your previous reservations about this show being bad for pushing incest, and if you still don't like it, I won't blame you. But I guarantee that this show is not a bad show, and the average rating it holds does not truly reflect the quality of this show.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is the story of a brother and a sister, who are twins, who move to a village to live alone after their parents die. The brother Haru is your typical male lead who is handsome, kind, and self-sacrificial. His sister, Sora, is bratty, cold, and seemingly uncaring. Of course, that changes over time, typical to any tsundere girl we'd encounter in anime.\r\nThis story seems like a harem at first. Multiple girls falling in love with our MC. But it's not traditional. He doesn't just pick the obvious female lead counterpart, but the story has multiple arcs in which Haru has relationships with4 different girls. I like the way they did this, fleshing out the characters Haru was involved with at the time. The way they did this was by going back and doing a what if idea, instead of him dumping one girl and moving onto the next. \\n\\n\r\nThe music used in the opening and endings are amazing and the art style is quite beautiful. I am unable to speak objectively about the two, but I find them pleasing to both the ears and the eyes, and I feel like anyone could. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were surprisingly deep, despite the fact that each of the girls arcs were 2-3 episodes long. You were able to learn the backstory and problems each of these girls faced, seeing how their relationship with Haru developed as a result and how they came to grips with their problems and overcame them. My only complaint was that there was no arc for the class president, spoilers ahead, as it was revealed in Sora's arc that she too had fallen in love with him.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of each episode, there is a tiny Motoka arc, drawn almost exclusively in a chibi style, that gives you a little backstory on her character as well. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this series was very enjoyable. Of course, there were various problems, length, the fact that the show had 2 endings, no Kozue Kuranaga arc, but they are all fairly minor when you look at how well the series stood despite that.",

I mean it would be one thing if the show was similar to Negima were the guy is clueless and the girls all love him but no, the guy is actually serious when he kisses the girls or, as a previous review commented, the hentai scene.\r\nWhat gets me most about thisshow, is the music, it's all serious which makes me think that this guy is a player, so I'm not bothering with the rest of this anime.  If the creators would have just stuck with the initial summary that I read on this series it may have been good.\\n\\n\r\nI would love to watch this show, the art is great and everything else is outstanding but the story and enjoyment factor fails when we get to the guy kissing every girl in the show.  To me it's like a high school drama type thing, so if you like that kind of thing, then watch the show, but my overall rating of this is at best a 3 even though I gave other categorizes such high ratings which would normally make me watch the show, I'm not going to bother with it.",

The anime was obviously made from a visual novel, considering it switches who the protagonist is courting halfway into the series without telling you. I can see a lot of ignorant weeabos looking at this like it's some kind of masterpiece. The story lines are not thought out, and it seems like the only thing they focused on were the sex scenes. This might appeal to you if you are around the age of 13, or a fucking creep. The series ran extremely fast, and all of the scenes jumped from onething to the next with ill-fitting transition, sort of like the mentality of a bipolar otaku female who's in heat. This is a good example of what shouldn't become an anime.",

I am so angry with this anime and it probably has to be one of the worst ones i have watched yet and reading all those reviews with good grades pissed me off even more.What grades did they give the anime ... oh i hope you are ready for this shit ... prepare to laugh they gave it an8-9 .. you have to be kidding me and as i will explain why this anime barely deserves a 4 ..\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Story(2/10)\\n\r\nLets take a look at the story . \\n\r\nThe story is based on a Visual Novel/Eroge and as it goes when you make an anime you put other routes the main character has to take also.. The story was so bad i can't even put it into words .. it doesn't even have a story basically .. i mean if the story is the MC bangs a chick and then the story resets and then he moves on to the other chick and that is the story of this anime in a nutshell. It isn't a quality story by all means of story lines go if you ask me .. as i could compare it with other romances .. heck even other incest anime this anime doesn't deserve an 8-9 in any sense of the grades. \\n\\n\r\n~Art(10/10)\\n\r\nHonestly the art and the music were the only things that kept me watching this anime. The character design was beautiful and the art was also beautiful followed by really fluent animation.. i am sad that so much effort is wasted on this anime.. I could pick out a lot of scenes where the animation and art were so beautifully done i was left speechless after the scene had been over.\\n\\n\r\n~Sound(9/10)\\n\r\nThe sound was also really good and it was music to my ears listening to this anime litteraly. Also so much effort was wasted that it makes me sad .. The soundtrack followed by that beautiful art and fluent animation made the art and the animation stand out even more that it was eye candy.\\n\\n\r\n~Characters(3/10)\\n\r\nNow that i have gotten past the two good parts about the show it is time to get to the bad parts.. I'll start with the MC.The MC reminds you a lot of Makoto from School Days except he is not a douchebag. I mean if you take a look at it you have an MC who is totally uninteresting and also i don't even know what girls see in him just like in school days he is boring and dull and chances are if this anime wasn't based on a dating sim and the story doesn't restart every time he bangs a girl, he would probably end up the same as Makoto.But you also have your one-dimensional characters and there is no character development what so ever cuz honestly there is no time to develop them or the relationship between him and the girl cuz it only lasts for 1-2 episodes and then it starts all over again. \\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment(1/10)\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy this anime in the slightest despite its glorious and beautiful art and animation. I was pissed the entire time i was watching it (don't get me wrong i am not writing this out of anger everything i stated in this review is pretty much true and if you think otherwise then by all means watch the anime and get pissed).\\n\\n\r\n~Overall(2/10)\\n\r\nI give it a 2 mainly because of the animation and sound. it was a pretty boring anime to watch and it will probably get you pissed like school days if anything.. The characters were boring no development at all I am honestly saying you are better off watching this as a 12 ep more or less decent hentai than watching it with expectations. Cuz they probably won't be met .. as i can even compare it to 15 times better incest romances or romances in general and by that i can't give it a five yet alone a 8-9.",

            "content": "Alright so this is my first review guys, I'll give it my best shot. Yosuga no Sora seems to have two very different views. There are some who find the underlying themes in this series to be quite thought-provoking while others just drop it after seeing how sexual this anime can get. It has sex scenes, lots of them (the most I've seen in an anime). It is not hentai, but it is as close as you can get without having that label slapped onto it. Be prepared for this. If you can't handle it, this might not be the anime for you. The seriesis in omnibus format. For those who don't know, this means that each heroine has an \"arc\". This means that each one will have 2-3 episodes dedicated to them, with the others acting as supporting characters. After each arc the universe will \"reset\". This means that its as if the other arcs didn't happen. You're starting off with a clean slate. Now, I'll try to keep this short and sweet...\\n\\n\r\nStory-7\\n\r\nI thought the story was good. It was nice and simple without being too cliche. Two twins cope with their new lives as they move to the country. I will consider each arc as a separate story. Each of the heroines have a problem of some sort that needs to be solved, which is resolved in 2-3 episodes by our protagonist, Haruka. It's pretty straightforward, except for the final heroine, his own sister. This was easily the most intense of the stories as it dealt with the most controversial aspect of this series: incest. There were a few moments that left me gasping. Easily bumping this score from a 6 to a 7. Its worth looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nArt-8\\n\r\nThe art was solid. The backgrounds were colorful when they needed to be and dark when they needed to be. They seemed to be on par with some of the best animations out there. The characters were also drawn very well, possibly even more stunning then the backgrounds. It is made very clear that Haruka is the pretty boy. Only nit picking thing I have here is that the models are kind of cliche. This is not the first time I see a rich girl with long, black hair or a class president with glasses and braided twin tails. Looks good though.\\n\\n\r\nSound-7\\n\r\nThe sound held its own. I thought overall it was very good at conveying the atmosphere. Only problems I had were repetitive tracks and the ed. The tracks were good, but they lacked variation. I started to get sick of the track that depicted a tense atmosphere when a good chunk of the latter half of this anime was tense. The ed was good but... out of place. It is very light and  peppy which totally contradicted the end of a lot of the episodes (this is a pretty dreary series at times). If they had changed the ed and thrown in some extra tracks I could have given this an 8.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-5\\n\r\nThe weakest part of the anime in my opinion. Was it bad for what they had to go with? Most certainly not. However, I would like to judge this series as a whole. Each character had two opportunities to stand out. The first few introductory episodes and the arcs. In one heroine's arc, we wouldn't see any characterization for anyone but Haruka and that heroine. With two episodes for each girl I didn't really get a good grasp of their character, with the exception of Sora (Haruka's sister). It's not that they did this poorly, but it's effectiveness took an extreme hit from the constraint of 12 episodes. Trying to do 4 heroines in that amount of time cuts down on each one. This could have been remedied by having a 24 episodes anime but unfortunately that is not the case. It also made the heroines feel kind of loose on their morals when they are willing to have sex with Haruka after 40 minutes of screen time. But bare in mind this was compressed quite a bit. Most likely much more happened between each of them that wasn't included.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6\\n\r\nI'm in the middle on this. Did I enjoy the sex scenes? Not really. They were a bit too intense for my liking. Did they have a purpose? Yes. They were there to basically score the winning goal in the game that was that heroine's story. You knew they were together from that point on (in that universe). It's not there JUST for kinky pleasure (although I do believe that had some impact). The themes are quite deep in this anime. This takes incest to a level not many anime will do. It also incorporates themes of teenage romance, betrayal, and friendship. It is not at all a shallow anime. That part I picked up on and enjoyed quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-7\\n\r\nThis anime is not for those who can't stand sexual content. It's there. But this anime is not for those who want to watch a hentai either. The story and themes are far too fleshed out to be a simple hentai (plus it's not a hentai, it's hardcore ecchi). If you can get through the sex scenes, you will find a very profound story that focuses on many deep and sometimes taboo aspects of life.",

            "content": "I really have one word for this anime: weaksauce. Now before discredit my review, and though as high as they are, I will explain to you how I got that conclusion.\r\n1 - The main character is pathetic. This is one bothers me greatly. A lot of the new crop of harem/ecchi style anime seems like to archetype as the main character. He says nice things, but when it comes down to it he can't bring the hammer to the nail. Maybe my standards are high but in a harem I expect a main character to be of essence. Our protagonist in Yosugo no Sora isall words no action.\\n\\n\r\n2 - It is neither funny nor dramatic. Four episodes in, and that's about 1/3 of the storyline this series is not funny at all, yet contains no drama. You need one or the other to draw interest in such a slice of life/harem styled anime. Romance is fairly one sided because all of the girls like the main character... for no real reason. If our protagonist exhibited great bravery, selfless kindness, or any real reason other being a sweet talker I would let their romance pass - however that is not the case. What we get are introduced situations but no real conflict. \\n\\n\r\n3 - Ecchi without the ecchi. So far the series exhibited weak romance and drama, no real comedy... so then viewers can enjoy the ecchi right? Nope. Ecchi is relatively weak in this series except for one scene in episode 4. And by ecchi I mean it should be prominent and considered a proportional part of the series. Some people do enjoy the ecchi genre but this anime brings a very mellow tone and atmosphere - making it hard to enjoy the nude scenes and ecchi moment it does have. The atmosphere is way too melodramatic to accompany the nudity or panty shots.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning technicalities, Yosugo no Sora is a wonderful anime. It is well animated. However art alone does generate interest. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion - It is one of those animes where you'd watch to waste time, otherwise it's not worth it.",

            "content": "So, the first thing you probably think when you take a look at the reviews is that this show is all about sex and incest. There is quite a bit of that in this particular anime, so let it be known that if you can't handle anything like that, this isn't the right anime for you. But, I encourage you to look past those 2 particular things and watch it. I'm not really one to talk because I don't really have a problem between those particular things, so this show doesn't phase me in the slightest, but the story is so good that you'd becrazy not to watch it. But let it be known before you watch it, this is NOT hentai, it's echii.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said a second ago, the story is amazing. I won't lie, I think it is a little bit wrong to say that underage sex and incest makes up a good story, but for one thing, that ties into the story well, it tells you just what the 2 characters are feeling towards one another, and the relationship that the brother and sister have with one another. But one of the things that made me fall in love with the story was the fact that it had multiple stories in it, and I don't mean like \"this happened after the previous story\", I mean like visual novel style, like \"okay, so since I did this and got put on this route, I'll do this and go down this route\", so you get to see what would have happened if he had started dating someone else. That's what made me love the show the most.\\n\\n\r\nBut then there's the artwork, which also plays a major role in how I fell in love with Yosuga no Sora. The first scene is the 2 main characters on a train, which is passing by splendid scenery, expertly drawn, that takes them to a town, which is expertly drawn as well, it feels real, like there might actually be a place in Japan that looks exactly like that area. Then it comes to the characters... at first I didn't believe that Hakura and Sora were twins at first, because Hakura was a skyscraper compared to Sora, but looking past that, they definitely got that \"twin vibe\" shooting out from them, and you don't see many good-looking twins these days in anime... then there are his lovers. Easily told apart from, so I don't get confused with any of them, like, \"which one is ___?\".\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting, well done. In a lot of the scenes I watched, the character's voices were filled with emotion and realism... however, I didn't particularly like one of the voice actors... it's nothing personal, but he's done some acting jobs that I never really loved, so I was a little disappointed to see he got one of the roles in the anime, but I pushed that aside and focused on the main characters in the story and not as much on the minor ones.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters... characters, characters, characters... I think there was 1 out of the entire character list that I didn't like, and that just happened to be the role of the actor that I am not very fond of... but luckily he wasn't in a lot of the show, and when he was, it was for a few minutes at maximum. As for the main characters, Sora is my favorite. I have no idea why really, she just grips me as a favorite character for some reason... as for Haruka, he is what all girls want as a boyfriend. He's nice, funny, and he isn't perverted like most characters can be in echii animes. All his lovers had unique personalities, I really liked how hyperactive Akira was, she was one of my favorites as well.\\n\\n\r\nAs for enjoying this anime, I'm just going to say it, it may be a little hard to enjoy Yosuga no Sora. There are some fairly funny scenes, and I like seeing Haruka get together with whichever girl the story is focusing on, one of those, \"Finally!\" moments... but it was depressing about 3/4 through it. I felt really bad for some of the characters, the experiences they had to go through, it was really sad to watch... but in the end, most of the characters ended up happy, so that was what I was hoping for in the end.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously, this was actually really, really good. I'm surprised this isn't higher ranked on MAL. I know a lot of people enjoyed this. So as I was saying before, even if you don't do well with sex and stuff, give it a shot. It may surprise you in the end and you'll enjoy it!",

            "content": "First, there is incest in this show. I hope that doesn't turn you away, because I loved this series, but if it does I would understand why. I suppose that's your fair warning; you have to go into this show with an open mind to that sort of thing. \r\nThe story is divided into arcs, and not the way you are used to. This is my biggest complaint about this show: the scatter-brained mess of separate timelines jumping here to there in an incredibly non-coherent approach at adapting a visual novel... However! There is a remedy to this! Getting an ordered list of what episodesto watch for each arc, so you aren't a victim of the horrible pacing and can simply enjoy the 4 stories separately. (I will post the list at the bottom of my review).\\n\\n\r\nThe Sora arc was my favourite by far, and the only reason I consider this show phenomenal. The rest of this show is still enjoyable though. My rating of 9 comes almost entirely from the Sora arc. That, and the ost, which I will talk about below. \\n\\n\r\nThere was also some stupid as all-get-out chibi skit at the end of each episode that I didn't even watch... >.>\\n\\n\r\nFor characters (ordered by my liking, favourites being at top, least favourites at bottom):\\n\r\n-Haru: The nice guy harem lead who happens to be very indecisive.\\n\r\n-Sora: The cute goth twin sister; tsundere.\\n\r\n-Akira: The cute, hyper, ditsy girl.\\n\r\n-Ryouhei: The pervy best friend. \\n\r\n-Kazuha: The classy rich girl.\\n\r\n-Kozue: The normal girl nobody cares about... \\n\r\n-Motoka: The maid featured in the chibi skits.\\n\r\n-Nao: The big busted girl with glasses. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is a huge success in this anime, it's absolutely wonderful, I loved the character designs and the array of pretty scenery (particularly when they would show the clouds in the sky). \\n\\n\r\nThe ost is my favourite ost by far! Even if you never watch this show I would still strongly recommend listening to the ost! It uses a lot of piano and violin. There's a specific track that I love with piano, violin, and a steel stringed guitar \"I think\". I don't know the name of that track, since it's in japanese, but I know it is track 5 on the anime ost (the vn ost isn't as good).\\n\\n\r\nTo sum up what I think of this show in a nutshell: It's a great dark, sad, drama. Great art and ost. I didn't mind the incest, but I know some people will. The sex scenes were a bit much, but did set a mood and aren't just for fan service. The timeline thing sucks, so use the list I'm posting below. The chibi skits seemed annoying, but i only watched 2 of them. I wouldn't recommend this show to everyone, but it was certainly a favourite of mine. I tried really really hard not to sound like an obsessed fan X.x , but I really am... \\n\\n\r\nHere is the episode arcs order list I promised above (My favourite arc at the top and least favourite at the bottom). I would strongly suggest watching the episodes in these orders:\\n\r\n-Sora: 1,7,10,11,12\\n\r\n-Akira: 1,2,5,6\\n\r\n-Kazuha: 1,2,3,4\\n\r\n-Nao: 1,7,8,9\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nThe above review is my second attempt at reviewing the Yosuga no Sora anime. My first attempt (that has already been up for awhile) is below. \\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nyou see a lot of people call this anime out on being a hentai with a sh*ty story to go with it; of course there is always that taboo problem with incest that turns people off.\\n\\n\r\n*showing to a friend of mine, first episode, everything going good until...*\\n\r\n\"ewww! they kissed that's nasty! they're siblings! what are you showing me?!\"\\n\\n\r\ni might feel this way because i don't have any sibling and could just \"not understand\" the nasty-ness here. BUT i will say that regardless on your opinion on incest, it makes one hell of a romance drama! \\n\\n\r\ni liked this anime, i liked it a lot; as much as people will think i watch it to \"get off\" i can honestly say *though of course there are some hottish scenes* that YES i did infact watch it for the story >.>\\n\\n\r\nnow that i am on the topic of the story, lets talk about it some... simply i'll just say i liked it, i don't think it's necessary to get into the whole emotional/romance/psychological thing so i will skip straight to my complaints about it. my big complaint was how there are plenty of separate time-lines in the show. * basically, sense this has roots in visual novels, each time frame is about how haru gets with each girl* so there will be some story, then wham!: back to the end of episode 2 where it shows a sort of \"what would have happen IF\" ...the story i liked the most was the sora arc, yeah that's right, the incestuous story. if you feel like taking my word for it the sora timeline takes place with episodes \"1,7,10,11,12\" but if you're guna watch it i would suggest just watching the whole thing. its not all phenomenal but is all watchable.\\n\\n\r\none last note before i end the review; the soundtrack is wonderful! if i remember right there were a few tracks i thought were weird, but most of it is very pretty. there is a particular track i remember loving *track 5 on the ANIME ost; the vn ost isn't very good* that uses \"i think\" a steel string guitar, piano, and violin. if you never watch the anime i still suggest listening to this song ^.^ i also think it represents the anime pretty well so i will link it *regarding i can link things in reviews, have never tried before o.O* -\\n\\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy95lu5WaPg",

            "content": "After losing their parents, twins Haruka and Sora travel to the countryside to start a new life. The two soon meet new friends in the shrine maiden Akira, wealthy Kazuha and well-endowed Nao, amongst others. As the days go by, Haruka learns more and more about the new ladies in his life, all the while being a patient confidante and good friend, leading him into their hearts, as well as their loins. Meanwhile, Sora can't help but have a recurring memory of her brother kissing her as a child\u2026\r\nNow on to the review and I hope you enjoy reading this review and hope its helpfulin anyway:\\n\\n\r\nStory & Characters (6/10)\\n\r\nThis anime was based on a visual novel developed by Sphere. It contains a short 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI've watched this anime a few months back and if I can recall it is basically about a guy and his twin sister going back to their old town in which they once spent their childhood there. The protagonist is not your average looking guy, he and his sister stands out in the town because he is a pretty boy and his sister is like an angelic doll. They both came from the city and traveled by train. As soon as they arrive at the town he was soon noticed by the girls there and some they knew from way back. His sister Sora has a condition in which prevented her from being Independent and relies on Haruka (the protagonist) to take care of her all the time. Haruka is surrounded by girls who will eventually fall for Haruka as each girl had their own story to tell and is separated by different arcs throughout the series. This is the first anime I know that had the arc separated as most would just merge them into a single story.\\n\\n\r\nSome people might get put off in the series as the characters are viewed from a paralleled universe after a certain episode but you will find it probably worth it to continue towards the end. The best drama is saved to the last. You will find in the first few episodes that Haruka and Sora shows signs of being attracted to each other and that the narrator has certainly left an obvious clue there for you to catch on.\\n\\n\r\nYour main character, Haruka, is a nice, considerate, and extremely kind pretty boy and his sister is very much a cute delicate doll that lies around and does absolutely nothing besides letting her brother take care of her and being extremely lazy and apathetic. She will be her brother\u2019s secret crush and vise versa.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and very eye-catching but the other girls beside Sora are blend and plain looking especially Nao. I love the country side landscape and it surely compliments the anime. Surely an anime based on adapting to the visual novel art and graphics are expected to be good. Unfortunately some of the girls deserve some improvement to their appearance in order to not look plain. The image shown after the opening music when both Haruka and Sora are riding together is very appealing and adds a touch of finesse to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10)\\n\r\nThe opening music is truly magnificent as it gives off an atmosphere of serenity and beauty. Totally compliment the anime. I love the voice of the opening theme music as I think all Japanese voices are amazing and very touching. The voice acting is normal like any other anime but the cheerfulness and fun character of Akira will surely lift you. There is no complaint about the voice acting. The ending theme song is also pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nOpening theme music\\n\r\nSong: \"Hiyoku no Hane\"\\n\r\nBy: \"Eufonius\"\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10)\\n\r\n\u201cYosuga no Sora\u201d does not stand out much in the romance and drama genre and can be regarded as boring sometimes but it is nonetheless interesting to watch depending on your taste. When you first watch this series you will get an immediate impression that this might be your Clannad kind of anime with well-polished animation and good story focusing more on the plot instead of fanservice but you be wrong. Although the animation is eye-catching and the two main characters are attractive by comparison to the rest of the cast, it contains incest, some fanservice and sex scenes. Sort of borders on eroge and soft-core hentai. The incest part is a taboo and may lead you to feel disgusted but most people still watches it though because you want to know how it all ends and it will be dramatic.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I find it really stupid in this series is that when Haruka first arrived in town all the girls are attracted to him just by appearance alone and I bet that if he comes around to greet them they might fall over him. The story seems one-sided and two dimensional for me in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems somewhat predictable but still good for those who want to watch a decent anime and are interested in the element of the story minus the hentai.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora. Hahah. I get a stupid smile on my face whenever I think about this anime. \r\nTo be honest and to put it bluntly, I'd have to call this series \"a Hentai with a very good story\". It's because in Yosuga no Sora the story and sexual scenes go hand in hand. They're inseparable. Actually now that I think of it, it's probably what the makers wanted to do. I suppose that was the point of the story, to show us sexual relationships between one guy and a lot of girls and what the consequences of that could be. At the same timehowever the story doesn't tell us what's right or wrong. Instead, we're left with the saying \"love knows no boundaries\" which basically means that as long as two people really love each other, no one has the right to say if their relationship is right or wrong. \\n\\n\r\nWell but what if that relationship concerned a brother and a sister? Worse yet, what if they were twins!? That brings me to the characters and as in any anime, there are quite a few of them but the two main ones are the twins: Kasugano Haruka and Kasugano Sora. Haruka is a guy with an unbelievable charisma. He's a chick magnet unlike any you'll ever see. He literally has some kinda of a sexual force field surrounding him which can attract any female within a 500 yard radius. He's energetic, bold and most of all he has that one trait which all guys dream about - he's not afraid of women. Needless to say, with all of those traits combined, for him getting a girl is as easy as turning on the TV. However, there is one girl he's afraid to confess to... or maybe he's just hiding the fact. \"So, what's the deal?\" you ask. Well, it's his twin sister Kasugano Sora. Apart from their strikingly similar appearances they are actually opposites. Sora is lazy, apathetic and just generally doesn't care about anything or anyone besides of her beloved brother. The story explains why the twins have feelings for each other and how it all started. The story also involves other girls but I will not expand on that to avoid spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in Yosuga no Sora is something so beautiful that it cannot be even described. Think epic violin music taken from gloomy dramas and \"end of the world\" movies. I'll be certainly grabbing the original soundtrack. \\n\\n\r\nArt is extremely good and precise. In fact it's so good that you can distinguish the characters not only by the color of their eyes or their hairstyle but by small things like nail length and hip width (not kidding). The scenes where characters are outside walking around in forests or wheat fields are absolutely breathtaking. Top notch quality, you can see that the design team spent a lot time and effort in making this anime. \\n\\n\r\nWell to sum it all up, Yosuga no Sora is one of those few rare stories that present us with unsolvable issues. When it comes to such complex things as love, the sense of right or wrong no longer has any meaning. It is up to the two people in love to decide their future and that's exactly what this anime is about. The ending is kinda open but it's good instead of depressive, not the \"School Days\" kinda ending. \\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora gets 9 points from me.\\n",

            "content": "Before we start, I should say that this anime DOES have sexual scenes, female frontal nudity (top half only, not below the [Frontal area] waist).....and an incestuous relationship so it might be a complete turn off for a lot of people. BUT it is NOT a Hentai! But I say that you overlook these particular things because if you don't, you might miss out on a pretty good anime.\r\n\"You can't stop yourself from falling in love with someone...\"\r\nFirst off, Yosuga no Sora is set when the main character - Haruka - and his twin sister Sora - both move back to a town they usedto be in when they were younger. They are orphans so they live together in a house. At first this seems like your generic harem with pretty much every female falling for Haruka at the first glance they get of him but a 'Photokano' is pulled off here. What I mean by that is its basically a Visual Novel-like setting. You work your way through the story and when you complete that route, you go back to a 'save point' and go for another route for another ending. So for Haruka he ends up with a different girl after each arc which is just like a Visual Novel.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as ecchi and fan service goes, it is a little overused in some particular areas like cliche water splashing all over a girl and her shirt becomes see-through etc but still its easily overlooked. If I'm honest the first couple of episodes got me rather bored since it was kind of predictable but after that I started to get 'attached' to SOME of the characters and I still wanted to know what would happen next.\\n\\n\r\nBut the more larger portions of ecchi such as the sexual scenes I think are not there for the fans to enjoy. It's more meaningful than what you'd normally see in hentai (as in that you'd usually see 2 people doing it in a lustful way but in Yosuga no Sora, they each have a meaning towards it such as they love each other enough to do so).\\n\\n\r\nStory 7/10:\\n\r\nThe story was a little slow to start I admit, but for me going from 1 route to the next in like 2-3 episodes instead of focusing on a particular couple for the entire/more than half of the episodes of the anime doesn't cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nBut hey that's my opinion remember - I just prefer episodes that last a little longer for each arc such as anime made by Key (Clannad, Kanon etc).\\n\\n\r\nBut I think each arc was told rather well. I feel a little 'bad' in saying so but I actually liked the final arc the most and I wanted those two to be together the most...don't get me wrong, I just liked their coupling the most because of their story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was pretty bland and rather predictable for the first 3-4 episodes but that changed, especially around the later episodes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 7/10:\\n\r\nThe characters again at first seemed like hopeless girls just waiting to get some of Haruka but I was a little wrong on some of them. They all have interesting backgrounds, as in what their family was like in their childhood for example, except for Nao (I might have missed it or something I guess). Anyway I think Akira was the character I felt connected to and sympathized with the most but again that's my opinion. Haruka is your generic good guy I guess. He doesn't really have anything outstanding about him other than his hair colour. As for the others, I think their appearances are quite unique and I like that quite a lot.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound 10/10:\\n\r\nIf there's anything I liked about this anime its definitely the music. It just sounds amazing. I can't really describe it well enough unless you hear it for yourselves.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nI quite liked the art on here and some of the character designs. Especially Sora. I liked her appearance the most. Namely her hairstyle and costume while at her house. The backgrounds were 'okay' I guess but nothing I can really recall as memorable except for the Shrine. It would have been a 9 if the backgrounds were worked on a little more but still I think its pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Final Verdict 8/10:\\n\r\nThis anime in my opinion has shocked me in quite a few situations but nonetheless, the majority of it was enjoyable. In a way this anime made me think of what is considered 'right' or 'wrong', what love is and what you, as a person, would think about yourself. Honestly, I would rather follow what my heart tells me than lie to myself and bring myself grief. This anime makes you think about your own views on love and what society would think about you based on the decisions you make. Its not just a fanservice anime, it is very meaningful and watching every episode was worth it completely.\\n\r\nI would recommend you watch this, IF you can overlook all of the sexual content.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSorry if it was a little long, but yeah thanks for reading this~ :D",

            "content": "First of all lets make it clear that 95% of these reviews about this show are bullshit hate towards incest thing and no one is writting about show itself, so everyone gets turned off and rate it badly without even watching the show. Read my whole review before commenting anything.\r\nI serously got mad after reading all these nonsense reviews where people talk only about \" OH NO INCEST \" thing and i had urge to write one. People literally can't see good thing in this show cause of others spamming everywhere. \r\n\" OH IT HAS INCEST \" and other \" bad \" things. Let's firsttalk about incest, what is wrong with you guys? You see sibling fu*king ( cause you blindly watch the show ) and i see supportive relationship beetween siblings that only have each other since their parents death.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Well story is predictable but still Sora arc ( Episodes 1,7,10,11,12 ) is lifting story up a bit, of course people would start to spam \" OH NO INCEST \" or enjoy show untill the scene where they kiss ( on first episode as i remember ). As one guy said about his friend in his review, his friends was enjoying untill they kissed, i mean guys do you serously drop anime cause of just \" sibling kiss \" ? \\n\\n\r\nStory is divided in different arc's and when you add incest thing here people start saying \" oh it's bad story \" without even considering feelings in show,relationship beetween the characters and them enjoying before that moment. \\n\\n\r\nStory was unique and breath taking and if you only have to complain about incest thing than i think something is wrong with you or you aren't really anime fan.\\n\\n\r\nStory is about loyalship, support through life, don't listening to society opinion about what's good and what's bad and youth and if you can't see that than just go away and don't say thing about this show cause most of them only throw pure hate about incest and nothing else, they don't have argument.\\n\\n\r\nAlso to other peoples that say \" oh they just fucking in there nothing else \" i need to ask what show did you watch? From episode which is 24 minute long you see 30 seconds on softcore and just talk about that. Story was amazing, full of deep feels, you could actually feel empathy with characters.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Only word that could describe this animation is \" Amazing \". Every single detail, character look, enviroment, every single building and facial expressions are golden in this show. I still think 200+ shows later this was one of the most amazing animations.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Voice acting is amazing in this show, every single expression ( scene when Sora get's slapped by Haruka ) is just right on the place. I simply can't imagine other voice actors ( not even Kugimiya Rie and Daisuke Ono ) voicing those two, it was amazing. Also OST is one of the best i ever heard in a show, especially having a lot time later stuck with two songs from YnS OST ( Kioku piano and guitar version and Toui sora he ). It was amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Their relationship with enviroment and how they two interact is everything in this show and once again not \" INCEST THING \". How would you feel if you were left alone with only one support in your life, and that support is left to you too?\\n\\n\r\nSora is Haruka's sibling, her body is weak, she's psychicaly hurted ever since. She is acting like a tsundere while begging to being noticed by someone ( not only her brother but others too ) \\n\\n\r\nShe also has introvert persona and is kinda depressive. You didn't notice that too right? you only saw fucking. Most of her memory about her brother is how they were in love cause she probably didn't feel nothing else since she was kid and that's why she saw him as support in her life.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka is young handsome boy which easily take lady's hearth, he was enjoyfull whole life, he is the one that does everything in their lifes. At first glance he is ignoring Sora cause they booth had different memories about each others. He is basically oposite of Sora.\\n\\n\r\nI would talk about other characters but review is way too long and probably no one will ever read it cause reviews where incest is called out gets attention more than explanation of whole show and why it's amazing...\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This was amazing, unique, breat taking show. This show was like a gift from God ( thank you Takashi Mikaze ) even after i finished it long time ago, it left me good memories about this, feelings ( I wish i could have thing to remove my memory of this show like in Man in Black, so i could feel it again ) and definetly it's masterpiece to me. \\n\r\nPS suck on this Jack",

Why not become one with a sibling?; They know you better than anyone, they love you regaurdless, and they are God's gift to you. These are the precise reasons why sex betwean siblings...or betwean mother/father and offspringis so morally disgusting, because you are abusing God's gift to you; But isn't it you gift? to use as you please, this is the premise this anime explores.\\n\\n\r\nTwo orphan >twins< move into the mountains, enjoying they're slice-of-life-life; with the costant sexual tension betwean them. Both characters have a deep, deep love for eachother that is obviously further than obviously love, but is pretended to be such.  But what happends when one of them starts dating, and starts having sex withother women? \\n\\n\r\n*Sigh* I'm sorry, I'm terrible with reviews. If you HATE fanservice, and can't get past it, then this anime is not for you; I, myself understand that ALLL anime, both good and bad will have a massive amount of fanservice (sucks..:P) If you can't get past the idea of incest, then this is also, not a good anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many sex scenes in this anime, 87% of which are relative to the storyline. This anime deals with the topic of right and wrong, on incest.\\n\r\nI personally believe if you love someone, then sex is fine; However, the moment we stop frowning on incest is the moment horndog teenagers, who have NO feelings for each other start fucking.",

There was actually a plot to the random sex, and the plot was actually pretty interesting. The idea of incest was really disturbing and repulsive to me, but the anime made it work and actually made me question it. \r\nStory: Sora loves her twin brother Haruka, yet they are siblings and theidea of it is repulsive to outsiders. Haruka dates many girls in an attempt to replace his true love. \\n\r\nThat's all I can say without spoiling the anime.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime? Well if you're interested in Ecchi/Hentai then yes I would, harem not so much. I had very little expectations of this anime based on it's rating, but I was very surprised with the outcome. It also made me change my ideas on incest, if both individuals are in love then it's not my business to say what's wrong and right. \\n\r\nThe opening song is really good, and the art's not bad for this type of film. I watched the entire anime in one day, it's one of those anime where you can just sit down and finish the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nThe rating I gave is based on the genre of the anime, compared to other anime of the same genre I think this anime succeeded and deserved a 8. The anime fulfilled its intentional goal.\\n",

            "content": "A flawed yet decent romance.\r\nCharacters: To say the least about the characters in Yosuga no Sora, they are clich\u00e9. To start, we have the main character Haruka Kasugano. His terrible script and personality quickly took me out of the show. He constantly spits out cringe worthy, cheesy lines that are common in a romance, and I really expected more. His character is also quite the player! From what we are told, Haruka is a very sweet and kind guy who cares about everyone in his town. Then we see him have sex with a girl, which is fine. From what we know about him, heloves this girl and shows it. But then, he goes and has sex with another girl! And another, and another, and another, each time seeming to not care about the last girl and saying that he loves the new girl! He can't be looked at as an anti-hero because the show tries to paint him as the best guy in the world. Yet, what is shown completely contrasts that image! At the end of it all, I started to really hate him. Yet the shows script wanted me to like him, which started to get annoying! His character is more inconsistent than troubled to me. Sora Kasugano, however, is one of the better characters in the show. She boasts a very subtle yet unique costume design that I will give some props for. Her character was likeable for some parts of the show, and seemed to bring some sense into the show's situations. Although she does fall into some of the badly written lines and odd actions that most of the characters do, she says the least of them. Often times she would find the wrong in the whole situation and try to fix it. But again, the script fills her mouth with some awful lines of dialog. She failed to seem realistic to me, and seemed a little too perfect for my tastes. She did bring some realness by being able to see a weird situation for what it is, but she doesn't bring enough to make me like her to the point that the show wanted me to.  Now, there are more characters in Yosuga no Sora: Akira Amatsume, Kazuha Migiwa, and others. Sadly, it would be a waste of time to talk about them. To say the least, they are generic. They take the worst of ecchi, harem, and romance and mash them together into characters. Most of them are quite generic: the rich girl, the shy girl, the cute and small girl, the friend that's obsessed with girls, it's all here. Which is disappointing, to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nStory: Incest, ecchi, hentai, harem, romance, and more. That's the genres that Yosuga no Sora spans, which could be a great thing! Yet, the show does most of them either decently, or with a lack of originality. For the most part, Yosuga no Sora tries to be deep. Yet, relationships are spur-of-the-moment, the script is sometimes laughably bad, and the ending is unsatisfying. it seems that almost no time was spent to make the relationships, the core of a romance, deeper, and more personal to the audience. Instead, you are rushed right into a sex scene for absolutely no reason after the first date! This happens way too much in the show, to a point where it becomes painfully predictable, but can give a good laugh if not taken seriously. However, the biggest and most controversial subject in Yosuga no Sora is the incest. If a story is to touch on this subject, I would like for the story to look at it more psychologically. What I mean by this is that I want the subject of incest to be on a deeper level. Instead of just \u201cshe's beautiful\u201d or \u201cI must protect her\u201d as the reason for incest. They don't take into account peer pressure, family, moral battles, and personal hurt very often. Yet, when they do, I get intrigued! It gives a human side to the characters and the story. Yet it comes up and leaves way to quickly for me to appreciate it. The pacing is also annoying. The story leading up to the incest is slow and drawn out, then smacked at the viewer for the last episode. What's more, the solving of their problems also annoys me. At the end, the biggest conflict, the climax of the whole show, is solved with the line \u201cbut we love each other\". Seriously!? They just forget everything that has happened for the fact that they love each other?! I refuse to believe that all conflicts in the romance have to be solved this way. It's unoriginal and lazy. If I wanted that as a conclusion I could go watch plenty of other shows in the same genre.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack was...odd...for the most part. The main problem with the soundtrack is the overuse of it. I could swear that the same three songs were played over and over again for sad scenes, happy scenes, tense scenes, sex scenes, and others. The soundtrack tries to be a \u201cmultitasker\u201d by using, for example, the sad songs for the tense scenes and vice versa, which starts to get annoying. It's not that the songs were bad, they could have added more atmosphere to the scenes for my tastes, but it's not bad for what it does.  It's the \u201csoundtrack loop\u201d that the show seemed to be in that is the problem. Now, I do realize that there are more than three tracks to the soundtrack, but those other tracks were used very rarely. If they used those unique tracks more and the overused tracks less, it wouldn't have been so odd.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Hmmmm...the art was quite...average. Nothing too beautiful or unique with a few nice and detailed backgrounds that are worth noting. Sometimes the art could have used more detail and more atmosphere, but it's not too bad. The colors are nice and the character designs are decent. The problem is that the art takes no risks, which could have spiced things up for me. Because the art is so tame, I can't give it more points for the art. However, because the art is not bad, I can't subtract points from the overall rating. Just don't expect much from the art.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it: Yosuga no Sora is extremely explicit at times so, first off, if you get squeamish by sex scenes, do not watch this show! However, if you can handle it, Yosuga no Sora can either be laughably bad or extremely emotional to you. It's hard to recommend it for the lack of a really good story and characters that I expect from such a fierce genre. But, you may like it! If you can get past some of the shows problems and explicitness, you'll find a flawed yet decent romance.",

Too many people rate down this anime because of how in each arc Haru is with a different girl. That's because its based on an eroge. Also because of the incestuous themes that come along with it but to me it adds to the drama and puts you through quite the rush. Well this is just a reveiw but I believe this anime is excellent so please give it a chance.",

            "content": "NOTE: Again, this review is only based on the anime. I haven't read the manga or played the visual novel.\r\nI got curious about this anime for its sex scenes actually (like most others). So I asked my friend for a (downloaded) copy of the anime and watched it. But that view of mine eventually changed.\r\nWhen I watched it, what I saw wasn't much of the sex scenes. Really, there aren't even a lot of sex scenes here, and they don't even last long. Heck, some sex scenes make use of still frames. What I saw instead was the various scenarios and dilemmas the pair (Harukaand one from Kazuha, Akira, Nao and Sora) has to go through before their happy ending. By the way, the anime shows all the possible  endings in the visual novel, and by doing such, the anime gives a sense of discontinuity in the story. It's quite a \"love it or hate it\" thing actually, but as for me, I have no qualms about it.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the art is similar to the ones found in visual novel (this anime being adapted from a visual novel itself), it looks nice and fresh. Meanwhile, the soft and dramatic music (except for the ending song used after the special) suits the nature of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe special (omake) episodes after the main ending song serves to lighten the mood after the drama and the romance in the episode, and yes, it does its purpose well. It also has some nudity like the anime, but like the anime, the nudity isn't too much.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint about this anime is that the inconsistent production values, with the animation going from smooth to obviously flaky (I'm looking at you episode 10). Besides that, there isn't anything major to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nIf you - the reader of my review - got curious about Yosuga no Sora just because of the porn scenes in it, then think again. Watching this just for the sake of the half-baked porn scenes would mean throwing away the plot, the drama, and the romance to waste, which is a sad thing, really. This is an anime that should be watched with attention given to the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough its dramatic scenes will not reduce you to tears, this anime's a must watch if you're looking for a worthwhile drama series that could take your breath away. As long as you don't mind the \"objectionable content\" here and there, that is.",

            "content": "So, I finally finished it! I don't think I'm gonna give a review on this anime, but then I decided that I have to.\r\nI never thought that this anime would turned out to be something like this. I did saw the Ecchi genre. But, I never would've thought that the Ecchi parts are kinda or sorta (how do I say this..? Hmm.. Half-hentai??) I really think they should come out with a new genre to categorize this kind of anime. It is definitely not Hentai and Ecchi is kinda too general. I did watched some of other Ecchi+Comedy anime but they're not this ecchi. AndI'm not really a fan of this kind of genre (I'm serious! It disgusting!)\\n\\n\r\nAlso the synopsis. WTH?? The synopsis is completely misleading. Let say for example, the synopsis said \"going to the village to visit their grandfather\".. WTF? They moved back to the village just the two of them. Not even mentioned about the grandfather. In the story, it said that  the grandmother is dead, but nothing about the grandfather and he never even make any appearance in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnother example \"secret promise that the twins made with each other long ago\". What is it? No one mention about any secret they make before. The reason why they return is because the sister doesn't want to be separated with the male lead. That's all. Nothing about a promise or anything.\\n\\n\r\nOkay. Now back to the storyline. At first, I kinda confused how come the male character suddenly in love with the other girls instead of he already having sex with another girl. But then, I understand that the male character is the only character that doesn't change. The storyline is like \"What if the male character is with this girl? How the story should be if he fall in love with this girl instead of that girl? \". So, don't get confused by thinking that \"How come he can date and have sex with so many girl at the same time.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd, if you want my opinion, I don't think all the sex scenes were really necessary. The story is just fine without those. Except the incest part. How can there be incest if no sex is involve, right? LOL.\\n\\n\r\nAs conclusion, I don't really enjoy watching this. For those who like ecchi anime, yeah, you should try watching this. But, you won't get enough of 'that'. So, just watch hentai instead. Period.",

            "content": "Okay, I think a lot of people get confused by the fact that there are four different AU stories here. I'm not experienced with visual novels or their adaptations, but right off the bat I can say that it's important to know that, going into the series.\r\nSo, I'm a 24 year old girl that loves harem anime, and just moved from ecchi to seinen; this might be a little heavy, right? Wrong. \r\nStory:\r\nI wound up caring what happened to each of the characters. You ever watch an anime, and just wish you could see a short AU clip of the MC with [favouriteshipX] ? Inthe end, there was one result I wanted, but I didn't want any of the characters to go unfulfilled. The multiple arc format of the show was the answer to that. \\n\\n\r\nI liked the unpretentious nature of plot devices. Plot devices are usually something I just let an anime get away with, but here they fit. You go in knowing that it's a story, I went in knowing that it had multiple character arcs. It's expected, if you read up on it prior to watching it.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI didn't particularly like the traditional art. That said, There was never a costume, face, background, or prop I couldn't identify immediately. The art was a little too light at times (I'm a fan of using big lines to draw different objects, and this used small ones). That said, if I had known the animators are the same that had done Kiss x Sis, I would have never had a problem with it(loved that anime). In the end, the art was different enough for each character, that I had no trouble identifying exactly who was in any scene, no matter how quickly they were or weren't shown. \\n\\n\r\nLike others have noted, the animators use body language to communicate a lot of what a character is feeling, be it ecstasy, frustration, lust, boredom, or contriteness. I like that, because as humans we use the same thing a lot in our languages. It's true that most of communication is body language. This captures that beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI'm not big on the music for this one. The best things I have to say for this are: the music never intrudes on the viewer, it always fits. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects were clear enough for me to hear what was going on at all times, as was the speech.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI like how no one was unimportant to this series. Everyone's feelings were very well explored(even if they were only shallow feelings), and I knew, as a viewer, just why everything that was said and done, was said and done.\\n\\n\r\nEveryone has their history, everyone has done things they are and aren't proud of, and with few exceptions, everyone is just trying to be the best person they can be. Which in no way makes a floor mat out of any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I hate the pervy guy at school character. This time, I liked him enough to want him with someone(even if it's beyond the scope of the story, which I have no qualm with). That should say something right there, about the characterization in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nWhile I did get frustrated a bit by the unresolved sexual tension early on, I didn't let it get to me. And while I did get frustrated, I'm happy it happened. Multiple interpretations to a story make for the best stories.\\n\\n\r\nNormally, I don't like episodic approaches. I was apprehensive of this when I started the series, but the flow seems to have been done well enough to get past that trap. I didn't experience the annoyance of having to convince myself to watch another episode, to advance my own understanding of the plot. It seems that the 'come back next week, to find out what happens to our brave hero' plot device wasn't present. Which I'm sure something to that effect was felt by a good many viewers, hence the negative reviews of this all over the web. \\n\\n\r\n I felt an actual need to love the characters, and let them have their days of happiness(individual erotic arcs), while I waited patiently for the end that would tie all their feelings together.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked that this series, for all the fact that is about highschoolers(and the tomfoolery that goes with them),  asked adult questions. Not everyone knew exactly what they wanted all the time, but everyone knew they wanted all the other characters to be happy. In most of the anime I see, this leads to drawing emotions out over 12 or 13 episodes, and then you feel like watching episodes 7 - 10 were a waste of time, and the MC deserves no pity for all the heartache brought on by indecision.  This is most likely because the characters important to the story have little to no contact with their parents(seen in the anime, anyways), or adults are parts of why each character is important. No middle ground, nothing lost there.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis series doesn't deserve it's near universal bad rap. Nudity doesn't make something bad, nor does it make something good. While it is inevitably about highschool, no one is 'just a dumb kid'. And while the characters are (seemingly) self-sufficient, they're not superhuman. I think this series deserves a serious watch, from anyone.\\n\\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "WARNING: There's profanity\r\nMain selling point: 10\r\nThis anime deserves a fucking grammy. You want to know why? The main character is NOT a pussy. I repeat, the main character is NOT a pussy. Ecchi Harems are fun and all, but I get sick of seeing the beta as hell MC be too scared to make a move on a girl. You know what this anime does? Completely shatters the mold of ecchi/harems everywhere. This dude simply gives no fucks. I gave it a perfect 10 even though its not even close to perfect. Know why? BECAUSE THE MAIN CHARACTER ISN'T ALWAYS COCKBLOCKING HIMSELF AT EVERY OPPORTUNITYHE GETS.\\n\r\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nHaruka, the main character, takes turns being with different girls. Nothing too special considering what genre it is. I think the story is the weakest part, as it is, as I said earlier, generic. Despite that, it's still a fairly good story, with some very emotional scenes and memorable moments scattered about. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation/Soundtrack: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis anime looks fantastic. Very smooth animation with breathtaking backgrounds. The reason I picked this anime up was because I thought the art and animation looked top notch. The soundtrack had a lot of beautiful piano and string pieces that fit the overall mood of the anime. Like most other shows, there were no stand out tracks, and the OP and ED were mediocre in my opinion. But the OST fits what's happening in the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6 \\n\\n\r\nLike I already said, Haruka is a 10/10 because he's not a gigantic pussy and actually DOES something with the harem, instead of chickening out every time. The rest of the girl main characters all have their own respective arcs that last about 3 episode, while Sora, Harukas sister, gets 4 episode in her arc. The girls are generic as hell for the most part, but they are entertaining and likable in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: 10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said before, this anime destroys any cliche bullshit that you expect to happen in an ecchi harem anime. Instead of random shit stopping the MC from getting with a girl,l (someone walks in, MC pussies out, any other stupid distraction). So overall, this anime gets a 10/10, would watch with my family, if not only for the fact that the MC isn't the same ole harem lead that makes you want to bask your fucking head in because he's so stupid.\\n",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is a incest anime, and at least i found this one good (at least considering that it is a incest anime). \r\nIncest is a hard subject to talk about .. or you accept it and it's okay, no problem watching this stuff, or for instance if you have a brother/sister, watching this kind of stuff may be weird and even uneasy for you. About me .. well i deal pretty well with this, i've seen a lot of incest animes already, and this one was the best. \r\nUntil now every incest anime was also an Ecchi anime (it contains nudity and sex),so for young ages this is not the anime that you are looking for. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10. This anime has a unique division .. it is divided in 4 arcs, and in every arc our main Character Haruka ends up with a different girl. One of those arcs, he ends up with his twin sister, Sora. The story in every arc is not bad but it is not good either .. Personally i loved the last 2 arcs, while the first 2 are boring. The story looks like every romance anime actually, but we see some action here (sex). It only has 12 eps, so 3 eps for each arc more less, so don\u00b4t expect any deep development. We only have that kind of development on Haruka and Sora, because throughout the 4 arcs, they are developed along with the action. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The art is quite good, i loved the character design, especially Sora's design, one of the best i've ever seen actually.. The background is nothing awesome but the character design makes up for it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10. The drama has some nice OST, but i think they were miss placed. The action didn\u00b4t matched up with the sound in my opinion at certain parts of the anime. The rest is pretty weak.. the opening nothing great, so as the ending. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Since the first episode, when i saw Sora, i immediately got in love for her. She just looks great. Brilliant design.. this feeling is nice. We want her to have development and she has development, so when it comes to talk about her, it just looks great!. The other characters are pretty much the usual that we see in other animes .. I loved the last arc, when the \"main action\" takes place and is also were we can find more Sora development, that's why i loved the last arc. We also have a nice development on Haruka. We get to know every feeling that he has, and how he feels about incest. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10. Small histories with the same as big stories have .. well this anime made it. Every arc is like a resume of a normal romance story, but without all of that shit talk. Ofc it loses some quality due to the lack of development but still it's nice. It could even be better if the first 2 arcs weren\u00b4t so boring.. The end is reasonable, personally i enjoyed it. Ah don\u00b4t forget, every arc has an end, so we have 4 different ends. You can pick the end that you liked more :D. They may seem similiar, but if we consider the all story behind it, we realize that they are different from each other. So 4 reasonable ends in just 1 anime .. it's amazing xD. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. This anime is one of those that i think you don\u00b4t need to see , because if you are looking for romance, there are better animes out there. However, if you like incest, or if you wanna try and you don\u00b4t have problem with nudity and sex, give it a try.",

I think you know where this is going...\r\nStory: The story starts out with Haruka and his little sister, Sora as they go back to their childhood village due to their parent's deaths. Along the way they meet with three girls, Nao, Akira, and Kazuha, all of whom know Haruka from childhood. Throughout the series it shows how Haruka and Sora settle into the village and thefour girl's lust for Haruka, since he is, of course, the main character.\\n\r\nAs you can see, the story is typical harem fodder, but this show likes to take it the extra mile by having only one other male character and he gets virtually no screen time. Also, get used to hearing how much they make Haruka look like he's the King of the Womanizers, his SWAG puts Yu Narukami to shame.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound's pretty good, and by sound I mean the same freaking song being played every 5 seconds and the terrible OP. Other than that, it has pretty decent voice work.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Haruka = emotionless bland lead, Sora = Loli - tsundere with a brother complex, Nao = Booby lady (Sorry Litchi!), Akira = Bubbly girl with dark past and Kazuha = Rich girl who hates her rich parents due to rich reasons. Also Ryouhei = BROSEPH, and Kozue = Just There.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: If I'm being perfectly honest, I only get enjoyment when I see the end credits. EVERYONE in this show is stupid and the fact that some people actually think this show is credible astounds me.\\n\\n\r\nPeople, don't waste your time with this, you'll only stay for the sex. Go watch something like Kobato. or Jojo's Bizarre Adventure instead, at least they weren't pure softcore hentai.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Something to know before you watch this anime is that \"Yosuga no Sora: In solitude, where we are least alone\" is an eroge(or erotic game), which is a visual novel that contains H scenes.  \r\nIf you started this anime looking for an harem or some romance, this anime wouldn't satisfy you at all...  If you are against hentai, than it'll probably ruin the moments for you.\r\nStory\r\nThe story starts out with Haruka and Sora returning to their hometown.  It isn't the most creative idea out there, but Haruka and Sora are siblings who lost their parents in an accident and has to liveout their lives on their own.  Pretty cheesy, but the way this anime carried it out was simply great.\\n\\n\r\nLike all harem animes, all these other girls start to make their appearance and shows interest in Haruka.  However, the reason why this anime shouldn't be seen as a harem is because unlike all the other harem where they move the story with the main couple as the center and have the other girls trying to grab the guy's attention.  In Yosuga no Sora, a separate time and space is given to each and every one of the girls.  The reason why this much respect is given to each arc is because this anime is intended to copy the eroge's storyline exactly.  \\n\\n\r\nIn an eroge, you click throughout the game as you read the conversations and understand the plot.  Every now and than, they give you couple of choices in the game so that you may choose your own ending with the girl you like.  Yosuga no Sora simply shows the guy falls in love with one girl... and they just move on to the next girl.  The funny thing is that they simply rewind the whole story as if you are loading your saved data in a game.  The anime had no flaws in copying the eroge's plot, with all the H scenes for each girl, plus that \"Fin.\" in the end, which you also get in every end of an eroge's arc.  But if you asked me was the story itself great?  As a guy, I thought that the emotions and thought the guy had was painted clearly.  The struggles and stress that he and the other girls had was shown in many ways where as a viewer, you can really feel what they're going through.\\n\\n\r\nJust one more thing to add about the story...  It's really, and VERY, odd to see the guy sharing H scenes with every one of the girls...  but it doesn't matter cause it's anime.  They pull back the story every time with each girl...\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound\\n\r\nThe motions of the characters, syncing and mouthing the words, opening/ ending music, and even musics that were played during crucial moments when they had to emphasize it with a tiny push with some piano notes.  I would say the music was overall very good and the arts, with character design were very eye catching.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nThe character-build in this story is very good.  Cheerful and hard working, daughter of the wealthy, the very understanding senior neighbor, and the  twintail loli twin sister.  Just the best thing about this anime is probably the protagonist, Haruka.  He seems very simple minded, but he strongly represent reality.  The very \"innocent\" and \"trying-hard\" with \"never giving up\" kind of fake guys in a harem story really never exists.  Haruka knows when to push further with a girl and he gets straight to the point if he loves them.  I've never liked indecisive guys.  Like we could all see, the main intentions in this story is the forbidden love between a brother and a sister.  Like how the whole world didn't know, Sora is the very last arc of the story.  They went pretty hard core on the porn on her arc... but i was really amused by the storyline.  The whole \"sharing love\" scenes are not only fan-service intended, but it reall hardens the emotions and later on, it can really break over you as their love gets really twisted.  Even though the tape might rewind several times, the characters never lose their build.  They don't suddenly go changing their personalities on you.\\n\\n\r\nThe maid's little comedy life in the end of every episode is classic too.  She's a very well made character with no exception that she's only a side character.  :)\\n\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora wasn't the typical harem, but rather a very enjoyable slice of life.  Don't get too caught up with the H scenes... they actually help the story move on.  I really couldn't understand the low ratings.  I enjoyed it so much that I watched the whole series in one shot.",

            "content": "I wasn't going to write a review on account of the rating I gave it. But I think I should at least get my thoughts out there.  Now before pressing the \"Not Helpful\" button, I'm just going to point out that the rating above is my own personal opinion, because I'm up and down with this anime. \r\nOkay, first things first, before I start, I just want to point out the \"Mild Nudity\" beside the rating on the bar is underrated. There is more than you realize. That is all. \r\nStory/Setting: \r\nOh boy, where I even start. I feel like I just re-watched Amnesiawith porn and the main character swapping as a male. Where was the story though? I saw no plot in this anime. Sure it was simple and kind-of-not-really cliche, but I found it repeating itself over and over every single episode. It left me in a state where I was sitting at my computer predicting exactly what would happen and me being right. It was just too predicable. However, in-spit of all of the plot holes and everything, the emotion was pretty alright. Though the guy seemed a bit too happy at times and the main girl seemed depressed and at times wanted to die, the atmosphere of the setting was lovely. It captured the outdoors/rural area of Japan very well. I also found the little shorts at the end of each episode a bit amusing. Let out a laugh or two, I'll admit. \\n\\n\r\nArt: \\n\\n\r\nNo words except LOVED IT! \\n\\n\r\nI think the art was what saved me from dropping the anime. The amount of detail the animators and drawers used in this...the cumulonimbus clouds, the rain, the landscape and location of this...my goodness, it makes me want to visit the area. I think the character design was the only problem I had about the art. They were too....cliche looking.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nAlright, I guess.The voices made me want to cover my ears and scream. They sounded way to young. Either get older voice actors or get them to not speak in a high pitched voice where they sound like they're ten years old. The background noises such as rain, thunder, etc where very nice. I always love hearing those natural sounds in anime. Makes it more real. The music was pretty nice as well. The opening and closing songs were pretty catchy, but I did skip them out of boredom. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nI'm almost tempted to just put: \"Worst characters ever\" and be done with it. But no, I won't. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a thing called \"age limit\" and clearly the person who wrote this or animated the characters didn't have it it in their thick skull that characters who look as young as them shouldn't be making love. Period! And yet here I was, watching two characters, who look as young as twelve, doing it. Really? Really? I know they're around sixteen, but still. It was a bit strange. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, lets start with Sora. Lovely, dear Sora who I wanted to punch in the face every time I saw her. If I ever pictured a brat or a snobby, princessy type, she would be who I picture. She gets what she wants when she wants it. She likes to win. End of story. And when she doesn't get her way...well...stuff happens. She is nothing but a immature child. I didn't relate to her at all, didn't feel sorry for her, and outright hated her. Not a likeable character. \\n\\n\r\nNext is Sora's dear brother, the man of the show, Haruka. I'm tempted to place him at a corner with platform boots and a mini skirt and see what happens, because man oh man did this guy ever go for it. The thing about this character is he seems a bit too happy for my taste. He as no weaknesses and would be considered a \"Gary-stu\".  \\n\\n\r\nWith two of the main characters being unlikable, I wasn't very keen on keeping up with the other characters. They all did the same thing and acted the same and it just got to the point were I found I couldn't stand either of them. It was just...pathetic. I'm sorry. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\\n\r\nYou might all be very surprised at my enjoyment level on this anime. Yes, the story was filled with plot holes and the characters made me want to throw my computer across the room, but I'm going to say...it was pretty enjoyable to watch. But it also might be the fact that I am, indeed, a sucker for romances, especially forbidden ones. I might not be one for hentai though and I think that's where I cross the line for romance. \\n\\n\r\nIt's really up to you, the watcher, whether or not you want to watch this. You like forbidden hentai romances, go right ahead. I doubt my review will stop anyone from watching this, but whatever, I wanted to put my thoughts out there. And to me, that's the important part. \\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to say my rating for this. Just look at the numbers and you'll see where I stand with this show.",

            "content": "Well, I don't know why I watched Yosuga No Sora. I didn't know much about it, not even that it was a soft-core hentai. Needless to say, I did not enjoy this anime and do not recommend anyone to watch it.\r\nStory(2/10) The story is composed of arcs for each girl. The first few episodes are to introduce the setting, characters, etc., etc. After that, you get a couple episodes for each girl, all set in a different universe where no actions affect another. The story is bland, boring, and predictable. Not one bit of the drama made me feel any emotion whatsoever.\r\nArt(6/10) The art isone part about this anime that isn't too bad. Just like you would expect from a newer anime, the artwork is easy on the eye. Some of the animations aren't too bad either. However, I can't say the same about some of the 3D animation. Also, you will see plenty of fan service.\\n\\n\r\nSound(4/10) Well, you pretty much hear one melody played over and over with different instruments. I liked it at first, but after hearing it every time the show tried to be dramatic, I got sick of it. The opening isn't that bad, but I dislike the ending songs a lot.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(1/10) Seriously, I didn't see any of these characters develop (besides Sora becoming more and more obsessive/annoying). Also, none of them are likable. Haru is your typical harem protagonist. He's good looking, kind, and of course all the girls want him. I hated Sora. All you see her do is sit in the house obsessing over Haru or flipping out when Haru doesn't do what she wants. Kazuha is forgettable. Akira seems like the only character you can come close to liking because she is your typical cute girl. All I remember Nao doing is helping Haru be incestuous with Sora.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (2/10) The only reason this isn't a 1 is because some of the earlier scenes almost made me smirk. Also, the comedy in the shorts after episodes was mediocre. One part that did make me laugh was when Haru and Sora were caught. Overall, the series is boring, and I didn't enjoy it.",

            "content": "If you have a certain hatred for long reviews, here is a short summary of the review:\r\nYosuga No Sora is a surprisingly good anime, despite its sexual, and incestful themes. (Best watched alone though)\r\nNow for the actual review (disclaimer: this is also my first ever):\r\nNow, when you have a brother just around your age in real life, and you watch an incest anime such as Yosuga No Sora, that would be weird wouldn't it?\r\nWell yeah, imagine how I felt when we blindingly watched the first episode together, not knowing it was such. (It was awkward...really awkward)\r\nWe decided to finish it, separately of course, and Iactually, quite surprisingly, found the anime enjoyable. This is my very first review, since its an anime that I felt was destined for me to hate, and yet I didn't, which amazes me.\\n\\n\r\nNow a few reasons that SHOULD have forced you to hate this anime:\\n\r\n1.) Its Incest(but if you like that sort of thing, then that's fine with me)\\n\\n\r\n2.) Its like || this close to being Hentai, but it still isn't, which could piss you off sometimes\\n\\n\r\n3.) The best girl(in my opinion), didn't get an arc, which is one of the few things I hate about omnibus format animes.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm going to point out, why it didn't actually make me hate it.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the incest was... well... u-um... executed beautifully? \\n\\n\r\nYeah, well not sure how I can explain it. I was having doubts whether I should watch Sora(the sister)'s arc or not. But surprisingly her arc was the best in the series, the chemistry, and character development kind of made me forget all about the incest, and I kind of viewed it as a standard arc.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the almost H, but not really H, scenes help make the arcs feel a lot more intimate.\\n\\n\r\nSurely, you didn't watch this anime for them sex scenes did you?\\n\r\nWell if you did, then I have bad news for you, because the scenes are not your standard Hentai material. In fact, it goes so close to being one, that its frustrating. \\n\r\nThe entire point of the sex scene is to well, end an arc in a very, um,\\n\r\ni-intimate fashion.  \\n\r\nIt does its job well, and practically sends every viewer finishing an arc, directly to Fakku to fulfill those voids in their hearts. \\n\r\n(Not that I did that, and I totally didn't...totally...maybe...)\\n\\n\r\nNow I was going to write about the third thing, but Kozue deserved an arc damnit!\\n\\n\r\nAlso worth noting, each episode ends with a light hearted mini-episode after the credits, which are actually quite hilarious, if I must say.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I'm not going to completely recommend this anime for you to watch immediately, but if you do, once you get past all the incest, underwhelming sex scenes, and Kozue not getting a freaking arc (WHY), Hopefully you would find Yosuga No Sora to your liking.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's face it. Despite how unrealistic its the story, we still watch in nonetheless because of the sex scenes. You may disagree with this, but deep down I can tell. I'm an average guy so that's why I said it. Anyway, here's my review on Yosuga no Sora. Be aware that this review may contain spoilers so read at your own risk... or if you're just interested.\r\nSTORY: 8/10\r\nYosuga no Sora centers around Haruka Kasugano and his twin sister, Sora trying to adjust themselves and live a new life in a rural place after the sudden loss of both of their parents. After some time, Harukagot himself involved with the lives of the ones he met while trying to balance his time with them and his clingy sister.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is unlike any anime series that I've watched thus far; it doesn't only provide one linear story, but four. The show's concept mimics that of its original media - visual novels - and takes on different realities or scenarios depending on what action or decision to take. But what's common is that all 4 stories or arcs, is that it ends in softcore love making. That being said, nudity is present but only until chest area of course.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways I like the show's concept of bringing different scenarios as it felt almost interactive that if you want to change this scene and let the main character do something else then you can do so in this show. And if you're expecting what you've expected from the start of the first episode, you'll definitely have it later on. \\n\\n\r\nThere are moments that can either be funny, romantic, arousing, and sometimes traumatic or embarrassing for your part. With all these mixed emotions, I can already say that the story or stories in a general sense, had lead to have a positive impression on the show. The overall story's not perfect but it still one of a kind. \"Memorable\" is what I can describe it as whole and plot twist that come with it greatly contribute for this.\\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the show was really amusing of adding omakes every after episode.\\n\\n\r\nVISUAL AND AUDIO QUALITY: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art and the audio aren't getting much attention as its story counterpart. The visuals are good yet familiar. It's a \"what you see is what you get\" kinda thing. You won't find anything new from the way the world of this show is drawn and animated. It's very much on par with the other anime shows during its time of release but it still won't leave you disappointed since the creators did a fine job of making everything come to life.\\n\\n\r\nAudio's the same; voice acting is decent, soundtrack is average, and SFX are good to say the least. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\r\nThe characters of Yosuga no Sora is an element that makes up the show. With it's set of characters, you can immediately assume that this is a harem, but the show's protagonist, Haruka, take up one girl at time. Character development also depends one each scenarios, whether they improve are just stay constant from the beginning. Each character has its own trait that makes them different from the whole cast, even Sora is much different from his outgoing twin brother. And to me, Haruka's inability to swim sounds refreshing to me since I can't swim also, and also proves that he is not the perfect dream guy that the girls in the show have to expect from him. This goes the same for other characters also, as they also have problems on their own that is in need of fixing which at the same time defines there character. Each character are born from different situations and cannot always side with the other character's mindset. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the characters here are a colorful set of people that isn't always synonym with the other. While their personalities can change if pushed to the breaking point.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 8/10\\n\r\nIf some consider this bland because of the story having already many iterations on the anime ecosystem, Yosuga no Sora nonetheless is worth to watch and will keep you from watching it once you started it. It's not an overall masterpiece but the show in still far from being a complete waste of time. Yes, it contains nudity but it won't only be the reason why you've watched it. But also because on its story and presentation. But it'll all depend on the one watching.\\n",

            "content": "Story:\r\nSora and Haruka Kasugano are a pair of twins who are forced to move to their empty grandparent's house out in the country when their parents die. Episode 1 is introductory while the remaining episodes are comprised of 2-3 episode \"route's\" of the 4 main girls, which always start at a specific spot in the anime, resetting what happened with the previous girl. I felt that the first 9 episodes were an absolute drag to watch, because the first 3 girls are completely generic and uninteresting in every way, and their routes are full of cliches and unintelligent plot devices. This anime would have beenbest if it had concentrated solely on Haruka and Sora's relationship, which is done in episodes 10-12, the only episodes in the anime that are enjoyable and engaging to watch. The anime does have incest in it, as well as sex scenes with each girl, and both are done fairly realistically. Haruka does face moral dilemma in his relationship with Sora, and his hesitance throughout the whole anime seemed quite realistic and well-done. One scene I really liked was the end of episode 9 or 10, where Haruka cracks open the door to Sora's room and sees something rather unexpected inside. I felt his reaction to that was done very well, and I could practically feel his emotions as he watched what Sora was doing. The rest of the series after that is just as engaging to watch, and the conclusion is satisfying, though I felt a bit more insight into their future could have been shown.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe series comprises of Haruka, the male lead, 4 main girls (an energetic shrine maiden, a serious and over-worrying rich girl, a glasses girl, and Haruka's twin sister Sora), and one or two unimportant minor character classmates. The first 3 girls are truly generic and not much can be said about them other than what I typed in parenthesis. Haruka is the typical overly-nice protagonist, but his struggles with Sora are very realistic and enjoyable to watch. Sora, for most of the anime, is a lazy hikikomori who relies on Haruka, and gets very jealous whenever he's with another girl. Some may find her to be too much like a dependent child, but I personally found her to be a sympathetic and enjoyable character whose jealousy is completely natural.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Music:\\n\\n\r\nThe art is very well done, and the backgrounds are gorgeous. Characters are drawn nicely, too - even the generic girls are nice to look at if nothing else. The music is quite mesmerizing, as well.. I found a few of the most-played background music pieces playing in my head while I wasn't watching the series. They both come together to create a perfect atmosphere for the final three episodes, while being wasted on the first 3 girls' routes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nBeing a fan of \"forbidden relationships,\" I watched this series for the twincest, and it delivered, albeit taking 9 episodes to get there. My final rating is a 6, because the first 3 route's are truly a bore to watch, though the final 3 episodes are worth an 8 or 9 alone.",

            "content": "Well, now that I've seen every episode I am weirded out. I'll try to be as helpful with this review as possible, so here it goes.\r\n(I've got an important warning for those of you that have a sister at the bottom of my review, please see that if you want to completely finish this anime.)\r\n[Story]\r\n(A reason there really isn't much sory to look for, is that this anime is basically \"half-hentai\", watch out)\r\nIf you want a good story, this anime will most likely not provide as much as you want. So I've heard it's a \"sim\" based anime, so it's a lot of rewinding andit shows that one little thing can change what happens for the next few days/weeks/months. For an example, Someone showing up sooner rather than later, your decision to listen on something rather than keeping it private etc. That's the kind of anime you've got here. So the outcome depends on whether or not you like these rewinding type of stories. \\n\r\nThis type of story is for those of you who want to see the many possible outcomes. If you want a progressive story that goes on without reconsidering possibilities, this may not satisfy you.\\n\r\nOnly out of personal opinion, I'd give it a ---6---.\\n\r\nIf I were recommending this to people who like this kind of anime, I'd give it an ---8---.\\n\\n\r\n[Art]\\n\r\nI've watched my share of animes and overall I did like the art.\\n\r\nOn a rating scale, I give it an ---8---.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound]\\n\r\nSound went pretty well throughout the anime, I was pretty satisfied. Those of you pervs like me out there, yes although this is sorta half-hentai, you might be like \"Oh crap\" when you here the main character moan. Yes I don't like having guy moans in there either LOL. Unfortunately you won't get your share of yuri in there.\\n\r\nSound: ---7---\\n\\n\r\n[Character]\\n\r\nI honestly got annoyed with the characters. With the consistent \"sims\" rewinding you get a lot of personality changes. To me, it's like no ones personality stays the same.\\n\r\n I give it a harsh ---4---.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]\\n\r\nMy outcome kinda varies on the personal level. I enjoyed it quite well til episode 10, but when you read what I have to say lastly you'll see why I give these ratings LOL.\\n\r\nMy personal rating would be a ---6---.\\n\r\nMy reccomend-to-a-friend rating would be an ---8---.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall]\\n\r\n---6---\\n\\n\r\n-------------\\n\r\nNow here's why I was so bothered by this anime and why it'll probably bother those of you like me who have a little sister, I will try my best not to give out spoilers.\\n\r\nBut trust me, those of you with a sister will care LOL\\n\r\nThe site I watched this anime on put in description the type of anime it was. It labeled\\n\r\n\"Ecchi, Incest\"\\n\r\nI lost my sense of Ecchi-ness when it hit Episodes 11 and 12. \\n\r\nExcuse my language, but you experience one word during those episodes. Kids, if you hate bad language please scroll past me.\\n\r\nThe word is\\n\r\nl\\n\r\nl\\n\r\nl\\n\r\nl\\n\r\nMINDFUCK.\\n\r\nAnd yes, thats all I can express with words. Haha\\n\r\nbut for those of you sickos that can handle it, good luck I hope you enjoy the anime.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\" If you've ever watched The Twilight Zone, you know what this statement means. And no, The Twilight Zone has nothing to do with the Twilight series. \r\nWhat this statement is implying is that YOU are the one who decides what is beautiful. The statement also branches off into implying a lot of other things like, \"Who decides what is wrong and right?\" Really, it's up to you. If you think incest is disgusting, then so be it. If you think killing a ton of bad guys with the Death Note is wrong, then that's according to yourown sense of justice. Really, this anime deals a lot with deep questions people have in their everyday lives. What is wrong, and what is right? I believe you decide that for yourself. If you believe that incest is wrong, then I suggest not watching the last 3 episodes. Other than those last 3 episodes, you're going to see some lovely romance as well as some nice sex scenes mixed in.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora starts off with us learning that a pair of twins are moving to the countryside after their parents death. Mind you, they'd lived there before. You learn that our Protagonist is \"super cute\" and all the girls fawn over him. Honestly, I like those kind of protagonists. However, what you expect when you have a protagonist like that is a harem. In this anime, that's not the case. Yosuga no Sora is in what's called a \"multi-arc branching\" format. What this means is that there are 4 arcs given to each of the main girl protagonists. After each ark you go back in time to before any romance has started and you switch girls. Each ark usually ends with a nice sex scene and a happy ending. In my opinion, the arks go from worst to best. Now if you don't like incest, this might might not be the case.\\n\\n\r\nFrom what I've told you, you can already kind of expect what this anime is going to be like. 4 short little romances. Good romances, mind you. If you're into the romance genre and can handle a little soft sex scene here and there, Yosuga no Sora is the anime for you. Some people will be turned away by the multi-arc branching format, but this is still a great love story. A lot of romance anime have trouble with the ending, but Yosuga no Sora has a beautiful and tear-jerking ending. Give it a try!",

The story has a very heart hitting and sad plot, Again diffrent than other harems the exprision of who the guy is going for is very apparent. The anime is more like a game with diffrent senarios (which makes sense because they did make a game). Supriseingly, dispite the diffrence of this harem and the many others, this anime is the not only the best harem i have ever seen, but also the bestanime i have seen. The music i must say is the best part of the anime, also the story is just a masterpiece. Allthough there are R rated scenes, and many people may say that it is the worst and insest is a abomantion against nature, but i must disagree. Love is love, no matter what people think and this anime expresses that the most. This anime I will share with everyone mature enough and let them enjoy the love between a couple.",

When two are in love, why should anything else stop them? It's the same that goes with gays/lesbians. Why can't they be together? Because society won't accept it? So their feelings must be constricted and covered by a blanket of lies in order for society to accept them? Haruka tried exactly that with Nao; trying change himself in order for society to accept him, but deepdown he knew he loved Sora.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was amazing, consisting of mainly piano pieces. The voice acting was also straight on. I really felt the emotions through them.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was also beautiful. The characters were drawn beautifully. The only real grip with me is that the nipples looked a little awkward for some reason. \\n\\n\r\nI loved the emotional states of each character and Haruka tends to them all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I say watch it if you want a story that teaches about personal moral and how society affects one's love for another.",

            "content": "This is my first ever review, so it probably won't be amazing but here we go.\r\nThis is an anime that is overlooked by many people due to the fact that it contains incest and nudity. Sadly, many people pass this off as some \"fetish hentai\". Well, to put it simply, they could not be any more wrong. I admit that I had doubts for this anime, but by the end of it, I was extremely glad I watched all of it, one of the best decisions of my life and really opened my mind up.\r\nThis anime is based off the visual novel, which is AMAZING.Due to the limited amount of episodes, the anime simply doesn't match up to the VN, but it does it's best with what it has to work with. The anime definitely captured the dramatic yet beautiful nature of the VN.\\n\\n\r\nIt provided some pretty good character development despite the short number of episodes each character had for their \"arc\". Personally, my favourite arc has to be Sora's (both in the anime and the VN). The whole backstory of her bond with Haru almost makes me not see it as incest (I won't go into details though, as it can be spoilerish). On first impressions, she may come off as an ignorant bratty childish girl, but she is FAR from it. In fact, she's one of my favourite characters ever. The other characters are very likeable too, and have interesting backstories. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is absolutely stunning, especially the character designs and scenery in general. The creators have done the best they can here to replicate the absolutely beautiful artwork of the VN.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is simply one of the most beautiful scores I have ever heard in anything. I'd even go as far as it so it surprassed the amazing music of the VN. Tracks like \"Old Memory\" and \"Toui Sora He\", despite being used repetitively, are absolutely amazing and really add to the beautiful and dramatic nature of this show. Furthermore, the voice acting was brilliant, Haru captured the gentle personality of himself from the VN, whilst Sora's captured the fragile personality of herself.\\n\\n\r\nVery few anime have pulled my heart strings as much as this one, it's up there with Clannad AS and White Album 2 in terms of emotional impact, in my opinion. I've wrote this review simply to get off my chest how much this anime means to me, it will always have a special place in my heart, and it honestly saddens me to see it have such low ratings. My advice to anyone who may watch this: Open your mind and heart, and just see the scenes of sexual nature as a form of art and embrace it as part of the story. This is NOT a hentai, nor a typical ecchi anime, despite it having ecchi as a tag. \\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this, and I HIGHLY recommend checking the VN out (As of 23/05/2015, Sora and Kazuha's routes have been translated to English).\\n",

            "content": "This review is late and way pass the airing date so I don't expect many people to turn to this. After going on anime hiatus for school work for a few months, I started only recently to catch up on things. After finishing Yosuga no Sora last night, I felt I was obligated to write a review for it. And rest assured, it is relatively unfair and impotent to compare this with... let's say Highschool of the Dead since they can't possibly be judged on the same basis, I will rate it on an impartial scale for romance/harem types.\r\nYosuga no Sora is an anime basedoff a h- game. The anime is \"autobussed\" which means that the episodes are divided so each female protagonist gets their own arc. Now at this stage I'm convinced half of the people reading this review who haven't watched it yet are going to stop reading and not watch this simply because it's \"another one of those cheap knock-off harem animes based off some game that no one's heard about\". I suppose it wouldn't really matter if I told those people that what they think can't possibly be any further than the truth. Yes Yosuga no Sora is based off something, but that doesn't diminish the value of it. I found the story very detailed, thought out and with massive amounts of emphasize on questioning human morality and feelings. I hate lovey mushy crap relationship animes, but even so, the exquisite nature which this anime was presented left me speechless when the last moments of episode 12 ticked away. \\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10)\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora starts with two twins, Haruto and Sora riding a silent train back to a rural town. After the death of their parents in a car accident, Haru, the older brother, in order to care for his fragile little sister, Sora, decides it would be best for them to move back to the town where their grandparents lived, where they experienced so many reminiscent childhood memories hidden away in their conscience. After introducing the female characters, all of who are Haruto's classmates, the story continues to each person's arc, detailing the events that would lead Haruto to end up falling in love (and \"love in the flesh\") that particular character. Although it should be noted that each arc was very detailed and filled with background story, this failed to leave a deep impression on me. I was so bored with some of the arcs and their overemphasis on feelings and emotion that I even skipped through some parts. I felt bad about it but, hell, I did it anyways. What really made me appreciate the story was Sora's arc at the very end (sorry. only spoiler). The presentation of this arc was what really made it worthwhile to watch to the end. It's common knowledge that incestuous relationships are social taboos; yet, Sora and Haru shared such a close bond that I even wanted them to be together, above all other characters. Haru's dedication to protect Sora's weak body, Sora's determination to be with Haru, her only family left, really challenges the viewer to think about the rules imposed by society- What is right? what is wrong? Even though Haru's once close friends become bitter and angry at his defiance of morality, he perseveres and is willing to face the consequences of his actions. This spur of radiance at the end is what pulled the story up to a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt (10/10)\\n\r\nThe style and quality of the art is top tier. Since most of the anime is plagued by tragedies, suspense and melancholy; the art reflects this personality. The characters are drawn with the perfect blend of reality and anime. There are no cases of art that contradict the mood. The entire anime flows with perfect synchronization between story and style. But to mitigate the hunger for chibi of some artists and viewers, this anime even devotes an entire short part at the end of each episodes. Drawn. Simply. Chibi.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10)\\n\r\nIt is rare for a section to be devoted to sound, but I feel that a large part of what made Yosuga no Sora so successful was the harmonic flow of the musical composition. Some animes nowadays fail to understand the importance of music in the animation process. Music decides the magnitude of the impact a feeling conveyed in the story can have. Music makes one smile, laugh or cry and the music producers of Yosuga no Sora deserve grand kudos for grasping and using this concept. Yosuga doesn't have special endings or a wide vary of compositions like other animes, but, it doesn't need them. Quality, not quantity is what matters. What Yosuga no Sora does have is one particularly stirring and elegant piece of melancholy composition that plays in the thoughtful and sorrowful scenes. The melody invites the viewer to imagine, to dream, and to picture the sunset sky like the characters in the anime would in order too feel their burdens and emotions. Such a unique experience is simply rare to find in the fast-paced anime evolution of today.\\n\\n\r\n*Note: if you don't believe me that sound is important, turn off the sound in Yosuga and play deathmetal or some random vocaloid song. You won't get the same experience.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8/10)\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora's greatest achievement in terms of characters is its deviation from mundane precedents. When someone thinks of the lead male protagonist of a harem/romance type, he/she immediately thinks about some pathetic, backboneless sorry excuse for a man who's constantly beaten around by an arrogant tsundere female. I applaud those people for believe that because they are right. However, Yosuga no Sora does not have this annoying characterization. Haru is nice but he isn't backboneless. He does what he believes is best but once a line is crossed, he stands his ground. At the same time, Sora is a bit tsundere, but she's not to the level of tsundere that makes me headwall so hard I fall unconscious. Deeper in the story, I find that Sora's tsundereness (epic new word?) leaves relatively quickly, leaving the personality of a taciturn and cute girl who wants to be together with Haru. Later in the anime, she even attempts to take care of Haru by doing cooking and cleaning- a development that no tsundere girl will ever take in any other anime. With this being said, I believe that Haru and Sora were the starlets in this anime. They represent how characters in romance animes should be, not the uber \"YOU PERVERT UGLY PIG GOING TO BEAT YOU SENSELESS but I secretly love you\" tsundere girl (seriously, anime girls nowadays are climbing to ridiculous levels of tsundere). Unfortunately, the rest of the cast in the anime fall short Sora's and Haru's level. I found those characters relatively boring and with mediocre design. I was disappointed in the arcs of the other characters and the cheesiness in some of their conversation scenes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\r\nAs seriously one of the best and few romance types I've watched, Yosuga no Sora deserves the widespread acclamation. From innovative personality developments, to detailed plot presentations, to musical pieces that tempt me to pull out my violin in order to practice and play it, Yosuga no Sora epitomizes how a romance anime should be. If the producers were to make the other arcs and characters more interesting, I believe that Yosuga no Sora would well define the next generation of harem/romance anime.\\n",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora, while it is a harem, it is not a goofy comedy like most harems are. The show does have a few moments that you may find funny but it is, over all, incredibly serious in nature. This anime touched me on an emotional level like no other anime (or any other media for that matter) has before. Split into a few different alternate timeline arcs, it shows the viewer that what couldn't really be there, is. The story centers primarily around Haruka Kasugano and the relationships he forges in his life. The story begins with Haruka and his twin sister Sora movingto their late grandfather's house in a small town, after their parents die in an accident.\\n\\n\r\nIn four alternate timelines, Haruka falls in love with four different girls. Each of them having their own personal problems. Since Haruka is such a kind and caring person, he does everything in his power to make each of them happy. Because Yosuga no Sora is a mature drama, it should come as no surprise that there are several scenes portraying sex (though no gentitalia is shown). While I found the sex a little off putting, it is presented in a way that actually works well to progress the story and the character development. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and sound used set a mood for the story that, while not perfect on their own, fit the show splendidly. The art is very crisp and clean, but I found it to be mediocre at times (this is the only thing keeping me from rating a full ten). The music used shines above the art greatly. The music that is often used during emotionally charged scenes never failed to stir up an emotional response from me. \\n\\n\r\nWhere Yosuga no Sora stands above the rest is in its story and characters. While superficially the characters seem to be the stereotypical harem characters; a meganekko, a moe, a tsundere and so forth, each of them develops well and far beyond these cookie-cutter character types. Each character is well thought out, has a story of their own, and is developed into a believable person. Though Haruka isn\u2019t developed as much as the girls, he does get developed quite a bit. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are truly at the forefront of the show, and while I loved the story, it can at times seem little more than a means to further character development. That\u2019s not to say that the story isn\u2019t engaging and interesting. The story can be hard to follow, though, as It splits several times at a few important plot points, with little to no explanation on what is happening, showing what would happen if just a specific event were changed. For example If a character had walked away from an event thirty second earlier, they would fall in love with a completely different person. Yosuga no Sora doesn\u2019t just show you what happens, it shows you the repercussions of each and every action the characters make. A common theme that plays out several times is that someone will get hurt no matter what you do.\\n\\n\r\nThe story and characters are crafted in a way that gets you invested in what happens on an emotional scale. Over all I would recommend Yosuga no Sora to anyone who values character development and storytelling above everything else.",

            "content": "Gun to my head, if someone asked me to answer the question \"Did you like Yosuga no Sora?\" truthfully to live, I would say \"NO.\"\r\n*BOOM*\r\nThat was the sound of my head exploding. In spite of everything, I actually really liked Yosuga no Sora. Sure, there was too much sex in it for me to feel comfortable watching it. Sure, the incest was too strong that it was very uncomfortable. But, if you got past all that (and it took a lot out of me to get past all that), you would find that this is one of the more well written romance anime I've everwatched.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I've gotta commend the decision to go to the omnibus format for this adaptation against the usual integration of the other heroine's routes into the main heroine's routes. In most visual novel to anime adaptations, this integration usually destroys the flow and the narrative. More importantly though, doing it in an omnibus format would let the respective heroines shine in their own route and give them the ending that they each respectively deserve. Sure, the characters were of the generic variety, each falling into usual character types (hime-sama, imouto, osananajimi, etc.) the show was able to make us care about how their story will turn out.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing, this show has nice music. From the OP and ED (of both the main show and the extra part at the end), to the BGMs used within the show, they complemented the story really well. The music really helped create and accentuate the mood of the anime while the insert sounds (BGMs, SFXs) within the episode was timed well making the audio of the show something to commend it for.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I really enjoyed watching Yosuga no Sora. Although I wished that they at least toned down the sex scenes because some were just awkward, I'll honestly (and begrudgingly) say that I enjoyed my time with it. \\n\\n\r\nWill I recommend it to my friends who do not watch anime? No. Heck, I won't even recommend it to my friends who do watch anime. But, if you want to watch a great romance anime, is open-minded enough to understand the story and willing to watch it in a very private place, then, by all means, watch this show. It's really good.\\n\\n\r\n*BOOM*\\n\\n\r\nJust had to shoot myself in the head because I hate myself that I admitted all that.",

Jump-cuts to the next summer every 4 episodes, and they act like it never even happened.\r\nArt: Great! It all looked wonderful!\r\nSounds: Well done. Very well done.\r\nCharacter: Mostly underdeveloped characters, except for his sister. She's probably the best character in the whole show, as she's the best written, most realistically behaving girl in the show. Untill the last 4 episodes, things get out of hand.Fast. Read my last paragraph for an explanation of why.\\n\\n\r\nI rate my enjoyment a 3, but I loved some of the characters in the show, and the story lines given for a few of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 1. Pathetic. The constant jump cuts in story, to people acting like morons, and so on...\\n\\n\r\nMy final review: Not worth watching. It takes one of my all-time favorites anyway.\\n\r\nBecause some of the characters where just so good. But come on. It's basically hentai, with the lower halves of people's bodies cut out of the frame, and it hardly ties in half the time, ruining the story. Also, it kinda kills the story in the first place. Ohai! You're a childhood friend! Sex? Never met you before. Sex? Every few episodes...\\n\\n\r\nFind something else... \\n\\n\\n\r\n--------SPOILER ALERT.----------- Spoiler, yes. But I really need to put this out there before someone else watches this... The last 4 episodes cover incest! As this is based on a game, his sister is the last character they cover. Avoid the last 4 eps, unless that's the only reason you're watching it. So I wound up getting angry with the story, jump-cuts, random sex, and I find this anime not worth watching.",

One problem right off the bat is that this branching storyline can be quite confusing for an anime watcher who was not aware of the VN, and it makes scenes repeat themselves. The fact this is done without note, or possibly a brief VN-style choice screen in the anime to show that this was a different branch, makes this aspect of it poorly executed.\r\nAdditionally, I personally felt that the first three routes/arcs explored were lackluster. Thedrama felt forced, and as if the story for them was merely thrown together for the sake of having a story. This may actually have been the case, as they are not the \"true route\" of the VN. The \"true route\" explored in the final few episodes has a far more dynamic plot than the others, and feels more natural in its execution. It is actually the only route I enjoyed watching in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are where the anime truly shines. Even though the art is nothing spectacular, it's good enough to carry the somewhat heavy (albeit often overdramatic) tones of the anime\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were, for the most part, weak. I feel that rushing four routes into one anime caused all the girls except Sora to come across as generic characters made to fall in love with Haruka far faster than need be. Not a single girl seems to deny having feelings for Haruka, making me see that while most anime play the tsundere card up way too high, this one would have greatly benefited from one.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, with only one route holding my interest (as well as the quite comedic aftershow the anime has), it feels like 70% of Yosuga no Sora merely existed for the sake of having multiple routes. The good parts of it were great, but the majority was dull, and without the final route this anime would likely recieve a 3 instead of a 5",

The reason is that it contains sex scenes.\r\nNow that I made myself clear, I can continue with my review.\r\nYosuga No Sora involves four different stories in 12 episodes. Haru being the main character guy has 3 \"what if\" stories but in the end, he ends up with Sora--his twin sister. At first, I hated Haru's character because I thought he was a \"player\", soon enough (after the second story) I realized the first one has nothing to do with thesecond story (that's why in every girl that he had sex with, there's always a \"Fin\" or \"End\"). Eventually, after finishing the whole episode, I think it is a \"what if\" stories (what if he has relationship with that girl or the other) maybe the creator is trying to not disappoint the viewer (if in case they like the other girl). However, that's just my own judgement, I don't know the real reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnother clarification is whether it is hentai or not. Well for me, it is not. It has a good story. It has good points in explaining why do they end up like that, twincest I mean. I don't agree with incest though, I just thought that the creator wanted to explain something, that this is not just an anime to feed you with lustful thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nArt was great, very fantasy like. I also dealt with other characters's stories, not only the twin.\\n\\n\r\nOthers might like this only because of the fact that it contains such erotic scenes but for others, they might enjoy this one because after all, there is a lesson to be learned.",

            "content": "When watching an adaptation of something, especially of something like a visual novel, the outcomes, as far as I've seen, are rather decent to watch, as for the most part, we have the anime focusing on one specific female for the main protagonist to go after, and fall in love, while having proper development and character growth along the way.  But, Yosuga no Sora, is a special case where...we get something, \"more\" than that.  \r\nWARNING: This is a review of a dropped series.  \r\nStory (5.21/10) for first story.  (7.21/10) for the short: To be honest, I thought the story would beat least somewhat interesting for this series when I picked it up, and I was sort of right.\\n\\n\r\nThe story of Yosuga no Sora is about two twins, Sora, and Haruka, who, after their parents death, move to the countryside in order to \"get away\" from what happened, and start a new life as two children, living alone.  \\n\\n\r\nOh, how innocent the synopsis is.  Little did we all know, how messed up and strange it would all turn out.  From the first episode, it was apparent to me that this would all end up in a downward spiral that would throw me into a fit of rage and disgust, reminding me of an anime that shall never be named again.  From the first episode, all of the main females that the anime featured, instantly saw our main protagonist Haruka, and immediately fell for him like a spell was cast on them, thus sparking our \"story\".\\n\\n\r\nAside from the anime's mess of an idea, the real killer I felt, was the structure that the anime was presented in.  Through and through, the anime felt just like a visual novel.  It didn't have a nice, easy, progressive story like a normal anime has, it was completely 100% a visual novel.  All of the main females were given separate \"endings\" where they ended up with our main protagonist, followed by an explicit sex scene that was not censored completely (basically making this hentai).  Not only that, some of the female's arcs were basically stem offs from the arc before it, adding into just how visual novel-esque the show was.  \\n\\n\r\nFocusing on the actual episodes themselves, the entirety of a single episode could be seen as a series of \"flags\", where the main protagonist improves their relationship with a singular female.  The reason why this is bad, is because there was no cohesion between one scene and another.  They didn't flow together well, and that upset me because I was confused about what was going on, since there was one scene where it was a beach scene, and the next was one that was apparently ONE WEEK LATER.  The lack of this scene cohesion led me to feel even more confused about what was going on, considering the fact that the characters leave the audience in the dark a lot.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story telling and execution for this series was very monotone.  Everything was the same, it followed a specific path that it didn't divert, and it felt all around monotonous, boring, and just plain terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThat was just one of the two stories that the anime features.  Unlike most anime, the show actually has a short at the end of every episode, featuring the maid Motoka, and her crazy fantasies in this chibi oriented version of the original story.  Without going into too much detail, I find these shorts to be quite funny and enjoyable, as the characters are portrayed quite differently and hilariously at the same time.  However, it should be noted that the anime still does go into its normal artstyle occasionally, as well as showing those, \"explicit\" scenes like I mentioned before.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (2.43/10): Don't even get me started with these people.  Our main protagonist Haruka, or the \"knight in shining armor with the silver hair\", is just so, idiot.  He's extremely generic to the point of having zero personality, seeing as how the whole time, he's just been helping these hoards of girls, before sleeping with them at the end of their arcs.  That's it.  He doesn't get mad much at anything, and I don't really see him as a good character at all.  Sure, he has a good character design, but honestly, he's just a cardboard cutout that has less personality than a brick.\\n\\n\r\nHis twin sister Sora has more characteristics, but is just as dull.  From birth, she is shown to have a weak body, and for the most part of the series, stays at home, texting to his older brother, when he'll come home to comfort her.  Considering the circumstances for this series, it's understandable that she's the main female protagonist, as she is the closest one to our main male, and is the first one shown.  But, what makes her bad character-wise, is the small amount of screen time she gets.  Apart from the first few episodes, she's rarely seen, as there's always one long shot where Haruka is talking to one of the other girls, and then there's a small one with Sora, and then switch back, rinse and repeat.  She was never really explored, and it just added to how terrible this cast really was.\\n\\n\r\nThe other \"main females\" I feel are very forced and fabricated.  They all have this trait and story that makes them \"unique\" and different.  While I will admit that the girls themselves are different and interesting with the circumstances that they are given, they don't really get out of that area of characteristics that they're given, making them somewhat dull and unsatisfying to watch.  Coupled with the terrible storytelling and rushed plot line, as well as the arcic setup that plagues this anime, they weren't really all that interesting to watch, and I felt nothing when watching them cry out their feelings.  \\n\\n\r\nThe background characters are very arc oriented as well, and just as terrible as their main character counterparts.  This cast is very disappointing and dull in the least.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.21/10): The art and sound is a quite redeeming factor for this series.  The art is quite fluid and crisp-looking, using both a darker palette and a whiter palette for the different moods of the show.  The eye detail isn't overly complex, and the characters look rather simple and good.  \\n\\n\r\nAhem, one thing though.  The art towards the end of any given arc, is explicit.  As I have mentioned before, this show does have sex scenes in it, and it seems that the creators are proud of it, revealing the girls' nipples, and through any angle except a direct, in your face one, will show you that the characters are in fact, having sex.  Also, the nonstop fanservice was just so moronic and pointless to boot.  Didn't help the series at all.\\n\\n\r\nOn that disturbing note, let's talk about the music.  The music is actually pretty decent.  It's very calming and beautifully orchestrated, using a variety of string and light sounding instruments to make this series soothing.  The ED and the OP both have this nice feel.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the short, the short actually does have an ED itself, having an energetic slice-of-life feel to it, completely contrasting what the actual, original series has.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (1.14/10): (I'm going to have fun with this one.)  When I saw the overall score on MAL, and saw the top reviews, I was puzzled on why this series was so back and forth.  Naturally, I went and watched it, only to find out that Yosuga was a mess of epic proportions.  As a fan of the harem genre, I have not seen ANYTHING so terribly executed before.  The story itself made far too many small time skips, as well as stupid character developments that felt so fake and fabricated.  \\n\\n\r\nThere was no proper transition from one scene to another, terrible character development, and a plot that made me cringe and face palm so much, that I stopped watching, and read the rest of the series on wikipedia in order to know what happened, because I didn't feel like torturing myself to watch a plot that I didn't enjoy.  \\n\\n\r\nI would not recommend anyone to watch this.  Stay away.  Aside from its above-average aesthetics, Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where we are Least Alone, has no other redeeming factors, as the exposition is hardly what I would call good, the actual story was just screaming for better writing, and a completely pointless and stupid ending from what I've read.  I mean, come on.  They even tell you when the arc is over, by putting the words \"THE END\" on the screen after it's over.  So, just like the series, I will be doing that too.\\n\\n\r\nTHE END\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 4.83/10",

It has ecchi scenes, nudity(duh) and incest. If you don't have an open mind, you won't like it.\r\nThe best thing about this anime was the animation, I thought it was really clear and crisp.  The main characters, Haruka and Sora do look like they were taken out of a different era they have a victorian feel to them, because of their hair/skin color and poses. But that's were it ends.\r\nTheplot is what I'm not sure how I feel about it, not because of the brother and sister relationship but because I can't help but dislike Haruka and his promiscuity with all the girls in this anime. Also the girls themselves were too nice borderline stupid  in my opinion. The way the episodes were set up I felt confused as to who he was interested in, or if he even was interested in anyone. He was only true to himself when he admitted his own feelings.\\n\\n\r\nNow the incest, some might hate it but it's the only thing that makes this anime stand out, and that's sad on it's own.  If you take that way all that's left is a nice animation of a horny high school boy who is confused about who he wants to screw first. Yeah that's very original. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hi! Robert's Too Late Reviews here for you, to guide you through another interesting anime series with another two thousand plus word review! This time we're going to be talking about the very interesting 'Yosuga no Sora'. This is a series that eschews some more mainstream conventions in the way it presents its story, which gives is a bit of a somewhat unique flavor. The quick of it is I would recommend this anime as long as taboo relationships and sexual content was not an issue for the viewer. Will this translate to a space on the coveted RTLR wall of awkwardness? Read on!\r\nStory: 8\r\nThereis a bit of a spoiler that *must* be taken in context when talking about the show, that being the inclusion of a incestuous relationship between a pair of fraternal twins. This is the taboo relationship I mentioned there in the opener. Now to break down what we have. This series is listed as a 'harem' style, but it doesn't fit that bill in the more traditional sense. We do have the guy twin pursuing and having sexual and romantic relationships with multiple girls, but they are not presented, for the most part, as running concurrent to each other. Instead what we have is two of the four girls that he romances are presented as differing branches of the plot line. After romancing the first girl, the series resets to a moment before that relationship started, and with a slight variation on the scene, the guy develops a relationship with a different girl. After that arc completes, the series resets again to an earlier point, and a third girl is up to bat. This arc, the third girl, appears to be the 'true ending' arc, and her reset point is not before the relationship began, but instead mid way through it, when the guy twin changes speed and romances his twin sister. \\n\\n\r\nSo what we have here is a story that diverges basically three times, and then it cuts halfway back into the third to form the fourth and final story line. Think of this as branching paths, with a good bit of resemblance to the Fate series, where small alterations lead to big changes in the way the story plays out. Because we see that with every girl the story changes, the guy twin is not a 'harem king' playing a group of women. He may seem like quite the ladies man but that's only because we, as the audience, see him with each girl. In the timeline, if you want to go at it with a Star Trek bend, he only has one romantic partner per mirror 'universe'. So he's not rocking a hottie on one arm and another on her knees, this isn't Highschool DxD or anything. It's an interesting variation on the harem genre. Also of note, in the end he does pick a final girl to be with, instead of juggling several. \\n\\n\r\nThere are elements in each romance that engage in some world building. We learn about the individual stories of the different girls, and how they relate to each other. We learn about a couple of the girls' parents, and while the reset may erase the romantic encounter of each girl with the guy twin, the information gained about the lives of these girls appears to remain valid, enriching our view of their lives. \\n\\n\r\nMoving forward, the series does feature a good bit of sexuality. The guy twin has sex scenes with each of the four girls, and while they are a little gratuitous, they are nevertheless important to the character building. If you're thinking hentai or something that is good for *ahem* self stimulation, you're barking up the wrong tree here. This is not Kissxsis by any stretch. In fact I would say that the story could not be properly told without at least the final two girls having their sex scenes, as they are integral to the overall plot. So, yeah, likely this isn't something you want to take in while in public places, or with kids around. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the sexual pieces of the plot we do see surprisingly well laid out side stories to add to the overall experience. The first two girls share an interesting secret together and as the situation is worked through, the series makes a strong point on considering one's perception vs a 'God's eye view' of the world. Judgments passed and assumptions made are shown to be premature and limiting. The anime makes a very good point about the old saying \"There are two sides to every story\". The exploration of this theme runs throughout the series, and I think was very good at catching the proper notes to engage the viewer. When we are presented a view from one character's perspective, it's easy to agree with her and her judgment of another character, only for us to find out that she, and by extension we, were wrong about what we thought was the truth, because things are usually more complex than they may appear from just one person's point of view. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is filled with asking who's right and who's wrong, and who gets to make that judgment to start with? These questions bring the anime to rise above the 'omg sex!' and 'twincest = wincest' tropes, if my perspective is considered. And if you've made it this far, seems as though that point of view is being sought!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI find the art in this anime to be really great. I love twin girl Sora's entire appearance, with the long silver/white hair, and the rest of the girls are all well drawn too. The girls are easy to identify which is important because there are several, with a couple girls tossed in that aren't part of the 'harem'. The lines flow well. The only knock I would have is that the colors are a bit subdued for my liking, I like a bit more vibrancy, that's just my perspective however. My other only knock is the overdrawn sex bits. The girls' breasts seem to explode into blimps whenever they remove their tops. This isn't terribly surprising, but a little annoying when it happens.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nAbsolutely loved the music. There is a great deal of wonderful piano work throughout the series that served to illustrate every bit of the scene on the screen. The music moved through and helped pull emotions out of me without being overly noticeable. The goal of good soundtrack music is to facilitate the flow of emotions without overly complicating or becoming too overbearing. Many times I would feel myself swept into a moment by the music as I was focusing on it for this review. Wonderful music. The opening and closing songs are just as fitting, and worth a listen. I especially loved the upbeat music at the 'specials' as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is well done also. I really enjoyed twin girl Sora's voice actress, and the rest of the girls have similarly well matched voices to their personas on screen. The only other guy in the series is the guy twin's buddy, and his voice is hilarious. Overall just loving the music and sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are all likeable and well represented. The rich girl is aloof without being inaccessible, the shrine maiden is exceptionally kind and good hearted, and the girl twin is powerfully, and awesomely, bitchy most of the time. The guy twin might seem too well versed in getting laid, but like I said that's a perspective issue we have as viewers. He's not a total ladies man, we only think so because we see the different romance arcs as viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe girl twin is very sickly and frail, triggering the guy twin to be protective of her, and this leads to the eventual, predictable ending. She has a powerful hatred of the third girl the guy dates, and the feeling seems pretty mutual, though the girlfriend does try to reach out to the twin. \\n\\n\r\nThe first girl romanced, the rich girl, has a maid who falls for the guy twin, and in the 'specials' that were included at the end of each episode (at least from the source I watched) spends most of the specials trying to sex the twin guy up, with hilarious results for her delusions. They harpoon the most dramatic elements of the series in these little add-ons, and made me laugh out loud more than once. I guess this means the guy twin sort of romances five girls instead of four, though the maid's romance is purely in her own at times perverted mind. \\n\\n\r\nThe only major kicker character wise that really threw me for a loop is when the incest comes to be known by the third girlfriend and another girl. They tell the guy twin that they will not reveal the secret of the incest to others, no matter how disappointed and disgusted they were. Now to me as an American, this seemed odd. Over here, if you have juicy gossip on someone, *especially* during one's high school ages, that info would be shouted from the rooftops. Perhaps that's a cultural thing, that the Eastern viewpoint is much more subdued and less likely to feature rumor mongering when compared to us more crass Westerners. Maybe its just a story decision. I know where I'm from, if one was caught in an incestuous act, within an hour the entirety of the high school would know, and by two the entirety of the city would as well. I won't say that's a complaint per se, just a bit of characterization that doesn't match my experiences with teen aged scandals. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nEven with the rather taboo subject, and the abundance of sexual situations, I found that I still enjoyed the series a great deal, especially those moments that made me stop and think on the old principle of \"judge not, lest ye be judged\". I found it thought provoking to show the flaws in the characters' perceptions as they learned the whole truth and had to deal with the fallout of such knowledge. I'm not one to shy away from taboo subject matter such as the incest found in this anime, and I will say that outside a few kind of fanservicey scenes, the relationship is handled fairly maturely. Instead of relying solely on the titillation inherent in such a pairing, they developed the characters where their interdependence allowed for them to question the concept of what their relationship could or could not be. They were a family of only two, all that each other had left, and who can say how they move through the world? Who gets to make that judgment call? \\n\\n\r\nI of course do not support the idea of incest or anything like it. The point is, that this anime is asking us to challenge our perceptions and ideas, to review them and find assurances that our decisions are based on as whole of a truth as we can discover from our viewpoints. In light of this, my judgment dictates that I do not support incestuous relationships, but the point of the series I think, was not to delight in the incest, but instead to search ourselves for our own truths. To ask the question, who can decide who we love? Is the heart free to do what it wills? What boundaries exist? Who decides them? Can we force those boundaries on others? Very thought provoking questions, even if my answer did not change after searching my feelings for the truth. The journey of asking these questions is where the enjoyment of the series comes from. For the RTLR wall, girl twin Sora scores a spot, because I have an overwhelming soft spot for mean girls. Tsundere perhaps, is the term? If I can't call my partner 'Devil Woman' then I'm not likely to allow them to be a partner in the first place! If you're looking for hentai-like material, then move on along. If you are down for a mature look at these deeper questions, I think you might agree with me that this series deserves a thumbs up.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora(YnS) starts strong, a solid premise filled with controversy that promises to deliver the drama aspect, set the tone for romance, but very quickly goes downhill in every aspect it could.\r\nThis review will contain mild spoilers, as it would be very hard to explain how the show falls flat without doing so.\r\nYnS's first \"flaw\" comes from it's episodic nature. By eliminating an overarching plot, you need to lay great foundations for a show to work, you will need to pull out all the stops with art, you will need to have a great cast, and mostly, good writing so as to keep theepisodic nature in check.\\n\r\nYnS fails to do so.\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\n The story and entire plot of YnS revolves around our two twins, and how they will adapt to their new environment, more specifically, the show will show various alternative timelines/universes/wathever floats your boat about what could have happened to the twins in the town.\\n\\n\r\nThe short timelines last between 4 to 2 episodes. And unfortunately, will not be unique, cliche will be a word very present in most of these short timelines. Except for one of them, who, will, for the most part, be the product of what I believe to be, poor writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe overused \"ideas\" and the \"bland\" writing of the these mini arcs land the show a poor 3 story wise.\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nHere is where the show will fall flat on it'is face right away. The art, is bland, boring and non-appealing, nothing in it will feel rememberable, as the show chooses to use extremely undetailed rough backgrounds, or showing long and akward still shots.\\n\\n\r\nWhen animation comes into play, the keyword here is, inconsistency. For the most part, the show barely animates characters, speaks will move to a mostly still frame, and cameras will be paned to force an angle where you may only see movement from the speaker, thus trying to cover it's flaws.\\n\\n\r\nBut I did mention inconsistency, so, as you'd expect, there are moments of great animation, let me break it to you, the show will have sex scenes. And here is where they will be beautifully animated, all the budget went here, the movements look fluid, and most of the time natural, hell, I've seen hentai with worser animation than these scenes. These scenes manage to scrap the art to an average of 5.\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSimilar to the art, but not on such extreme levels, the soundtrack the show uses is fitting, but unmemorable, I finished it 30 minutes ago, and I couldn't tell if a song played in the show if I listened to it right now, the OP works, the soundtrack works, and the ED fits, but where the show does show good work, is on character voicing, yet again, these sex scenes blew the budget, with really adequate voice for the cast.\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nOh boy, here we go. You know this would happen when you saw Harem in the tags right?\\n\r\nIt is here that the show's flaws really start to drag it down, 90% of the cast, are cliche tropes we are used to seeing. The MC is a self-insert , he has no hobbies, passions or dreams, all he seems to care about his wathever girl the mini arc in question chooses to focus. His twin sister, perfectly matches the standarts of younger sisters, a dash of tsundere, a little touch of loli, some shyness, and voulla, bland imouto is born. The same is true for the rest of the cast, we have the \"perfect\" rich girl, the good old glasses oppai-neechan, the clumsy energetic girl, hell, we even have the comedic relief only other male in the group.\\n\\n\r\nAlly bland base characters, with lazy and unrealistic character progression and interaction, and you have what we call, a dreadful cast.\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe show is unwatchable with critical thought present. 16 year olds keep breaking into awkward sex scenes and tongue kisses. We are talking rural teenagers, whose ideal relationship seems to turn into sex every half minute. Don't get me wrong, the sex scenes while well animated and voiced, completely break suspension of disbelief, as they will not be what you'd expect from teenagers, first timers, such and such.\\n\\n\r\nTo name one, and this sentence will spoil a bit, you will get to see a 12 year old girl, rape a 12 year old boy because of emotional instability.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, see what I mean by poorly written interaction?\\n\\n\r\n____\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nYnS had everything it needed to suceed, but awkward writing that looks to have been made by a horny teenager or some very... unreliable adult ultimately bring it to it's demise. A show without a plot per say cannot afford to have terrible and unoriginal cast, and worse, horrendous writing.\\n\r\nWe get it, the message covered in the last arc about love transcending all barriers bla bla. Good intentions don't make a good show. YnS would have been far more sucessfull add it' author decided to simply write adult works instead of shoving a hollow show full of sex scenes and cringeworthy interactions.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora may get way more hate than it may deserve, but I'm genuinely surprised that people are going so far as to give the show 9 and 10/10s, or even 7 and 8/10s. I wouldn't give the show anything above a 5/10, as I believe Yosuga no Sora doesn't have anything innovative or genuinely interesting going for it other than its handle on taboo relationships.\r\nStory: 6/10. The show is basically split into arcs that focus on Haruka's relationship with a specific 'girl-of-the-week', and over the course of 3 or so episodes we see the relationship between the two develop in its entirety. Theserelationships usually ending in an explicit love-making scene btw, so if you don't want to see anything like that definitely don't watch this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe arcs themselves aren't really memorable, but they're not as bad as I expected. The show attempts to give background and context to the girl's situation and perspectives, and we see how Haruka is introduced to and fits into this girl's own world. While you'll probably forget what happened in an arc once it finishes and the next one rolls in, I'd say each arc is at least made so that you want to see where things end up.\\n\\n\r\nThe final arc of the show is what makes Yosuga no Sora infamous, and therefore I believe it's the most memorable one of the show. It showcases a taboo relationship and, while I still don't buy the romance that occurs or think the characters have chemistry at all, I think it's at least not in overwhelming BAD taste, which I expected it to be. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound: Nothing bad but nothing outstandingly great either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10. The characters in Yosuga no Sora can be classified into three categories: useless, useless until an arc calls for them to be a romantic interest, or Haruka. When a character is in the second category, there's a fair amount of characterization and development to be had. Otherwise, the character is forgettable or just a bland agent through which the romance can proceed. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10. I came into the show thinking it would be pretty horrible, but the story-lines for each arc have some meat to them and there are genuinely interesting plot-threads and character developments that occur. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10. This show isn't something I would recommend people to watch, as I believe it's at best a forgettable romance and at worst a show that can make others uncomfortable. It wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but it only manages to scratch the surface on how to do romance right and, in the bigger picture, comes off as an unmemorable show with forgettable characters.",

            "content": "I was genuinely shocked when I finished this anime for the first time. Upon looking at it and the genres it entailed, I thought that it would be a bit strange and that it wasn't any different from another harem/ecchi anime, but that couldn't be further from the truth. For only having 12 episodes,  the character development in this show is fantastic, you really get a backstory and a lot of detail about each girl and Haru as well. The music is what kept me on the hook, the song Kioku is one of the most beautiful pieces I've ever come across in ananime and have since learned it on guitar and piano. A lot of people bash this anime for having incest, but if you watch it with an open mind and look at the messages behind it, the true beauty lies within. You can't help who you fall in love with, and that love is universal. The story was very sweet and left me with an instant want for more content, so I purchased the Blu-Ray Box set and the visual novels for a more in-depth story. The sex scenes added to the story, in my opinion, because they really fit the mood and the character's feelings at the time. A lot of stories these days stray away from a \"happily ever after\" ending because it's too cliche, but I was beyond happy this story ended happily between the two siblings. It was a beautiful change of pace from other romance anime I've seen and this has jumped straight to my #1 favorite. Fantastic work. 10/10.",

            "content": "Now looking at the general rating of this show, it's obvious that it's pretty low, mainly because of the h-scenes and dark concepts but it's definitely an entertaining watch.\r\nThe story is split into 4 arcs, each arc consisting of a different character for our main protagonist Haruka to end up with. Each character arc has its own little message and problem that is quick but easy to follow. It doesn't go to deep since they can't contain a ton of development in 2 episode per character but it's a pretty interesting watch.\r\nNow what I mean by dark concepts, I mean an arc involving incest, nowdon't judge me but this is, in my opinion, the best arc in the anime. It goes pretty deep in its concept and should get some of you to think about it.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, this show isn't really character driven, each character (except a couple) get their own minor backstory but in general its not like the characters are completely generic but their not the most detailed either. But either way, most likely you'll find a character to get attached to and love the arc that they get.\\n\\n\r\nArt is beautiful, I love the visuals of the scenic backgrounds and the characters. Compared to the visual novel however, I prefer some characters (specifically my waifu Sora) in it rather than the anime\\n\\n\r\nSound...Jesus I wish there was an 11 on this rating. The music is gold. Absolute gold, mainly focusing on the soft and sweet piano, guitar and violin type stuff and it gets me, EVERYTIME. It really contrasts the scene as well! You can literally download the song and play it when you're having a relaxing day and just fall asleep to it. It's beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this a lot. Not for the h-scenes (or maybe the h-scenes) but for the short and pleasant conflicts with each character and beautiful music and art. This show deserves a chance so give it one and if you don't like the h-scenes, you have many choices. Skip the scene, watch it censored, or stop being a wuss and live with it, you aren't 5 anymore buddy.\\n\\n\r\nBut yeah this show is awesome, and Sora will always be my guilty pleasure.",

But.... after  all, just to be like that\r\nAnyway, i love the behavior of the character. \r\nLike Sora,she is indifferent, spoiled, and perhaps a bit arrogant. \r\nthereare some things that I think makes people wonder of this anime after seeing it. like, ehmm ... after the main character solve a problem, he will be invited to sex. and worse, instead of rejecting it in fact do so. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps this is what makes me love this anime. but I also kinda hates the properties and behavior of the main character. \\n\\n\r\nAt first I really liked and strongly agree towards this sora attitude.

            "content": "Brief Description: YOUR HAPPINESS IS OVER SOCIETIY'S PREJUDICES.\r\nThis is my first review, and I actually registered because I wanted to leave an opinion on this marvelous anime. (bare with me)\r\nStory (10/10): I usually like when visual novels are adapted to anime as if they where visual novels, with many different arcs.Why? because (for example in yosuga no sora) each girl has the opportunity of getting to be with the character, so we've got many possibilities to choose instead of asking ourselves what would have happened if?. I think that this kind of anime gave the opportunity for the viewer to choose their own \"happy ending\"and I liked the way they develop each arc bearing in mind the few chapters each one of this arcs had. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10): Good art, I actually liked the design of Sora and Haruka, because in many animes that treat incest, none of the brothers/sisters are similar in any way so it makes it much more cute to watch if the brothers are actually blood related. (yes, I think incest is alright)\\n\\n\r\nSound(8/10): I liked the soundtrack of the series, I think it actually gave an extra touch to the mood of the story and I think the Soundtrack fitted into the scene it was alright for me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10): The reason for me to enjoy the series that much is, because for the first time ever I saw a half hentai/almost hentai series, in where I felt a love mood in the characters when the H scenes appeared. The characters really where showing love to each other rather than just having sex and that made me love the anime more than I would usually do with a normal ecchi anime from this kind. (kiss x sis)\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10): This anime had a great plot, good animations, good sound and I enjoyed it very much. Every episode was way better than the last one and I would recommend it to anybody who isn't against any taboo. I gave it a 9 because for the first time in my history as an otaku I've seen an anime character who have sex with the females because he loves them and really cares for their sake, and because the process for having sex has a good development rather than an accident followed by \"mutual comprehension of why we both want pleasure\". \\n\\n\r\nI also liked the dilemma that comes up with the series \u00a1what is more important, your happiness or what society believes? and \u00bfare you really willing to sacrifice your image towards society for your happiness?\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, the reason for which i didn't give the series a 10/10 was because although it was beautiful, it was not realistic, in life not everything can come up as you planned it and I think that the drama in the series wasn't well developed enough for me to believe that the main event in the series (final arc) was believable. But at the same time enjoyed this surrealism that permited several possibilities in the series, that permitted the many arcs in the series to be.   \\n\\n\r\nFeedback is accepted ;)\\n\\n\\n",

Yosuga no Sora is the anime for you!\r\nWhen I watched this anime for the first time, I thought it would be another typical romance anime with different arcs, but it wasn't. It actually took me by surprise, especially the ero scenes (I was not expecting that). And like the visual novel, it starts and ends at where you make the critical decisions.\r\nProbably what shocked me the most was the topic of incest. It was not just a topic that you can blurt out, but this anime wasbrave enough to bring out it up. And ending a story that started with incest is really difficult. Some would've ended it with suicide or some other depressing ending. But this anime was able to end it happily, although not perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed the anime. I recommend this to people who want to fap and cry at the same time. Kidding! But really, if you enjoy romance anime, you'll enjoy it.",

It's incest.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story was pretty cliche when it comes down to the fact that it's basically a harem where a cool city boy gets all the girls in the country. Even his sister. haha. Anyway, the reason why the story is so weak is because practically all the arcs are repeating themselves.  Yeah sure they're in different situations, but I felt like I was watching the same thing over and over again.  By the third arc it just gotplain ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 4\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art is what caught my attention in the first place and made me want to watch it.  The characters are well designed and everything looks pretty realistic. The angles are well thought out, too.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound is also good.  The voices match the characters very well and they even caught the sounds of breathing and the chirping of the cicadas.  The soundtrack is catchy and the music is played at the right times. The music also fits the scenes well.\\n\\n\r\nScore:8\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nCharacters are average.  You have your basic cliche characters included in this anime.  However, the development of the characters was pretty decent because of the fact that most of them were able to solve their past problems with the help of the MC. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 6\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nI went into this anime knowing that it was going to involve incest.  I didn't mind it, I just felt like the ending was kind of a cop out. Not going to say anymore to spoil it.  And, like I said before, I felt like the arcs were repeating themselves so I found myself skipping the boring parts in the episodes which I typically do not do.\\n\\n\r\nScore:5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\r\nIt was not a bad series.  It's worth the try.",

            "content": "If you're a person who is tired of watching a 25+ episode anime full of awkward misunderstandings and embarrassing events with a romance that is as slow as molasses, then this anime is for you.\r\nThis anime also has incest and sex scenes, but don't let this stop you from watching it.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe only thing that's wrong with the stories is that they don't really have very many episodes, so they can't explore each character and each relationship as much as I'd like them too. However, I believe they were still very well done considering each arc only had 4 episodes to work with.\r\nThe romance isvery fast paced compared to other anime, but even so, I didn't feel like any of the arcs were rushed. They were all satisfying short stories.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved this show's art. Everything from the intimate scenes, to the backgrounds were well done. Really beautiful for (what I assume) is a standard budget show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. The staff did a good job picking the right songs for the right moment for maximum impact, plus the music itself is beautiful on its own.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not someone who is qualified to judge voice actors, but the voices all seemed natural to me and the emotion was flawlessly conveyed. I am speaking of the Japanese voice actors here. I haven't heard it in any other language.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nEach character has their own story that gets explored, but not in a lot of detail. They did well developing each character with the time they were allotted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was like a breath of fresh air to me. It has an MC with a pair of balls, fast paced; yet well done romance, and it also has tastefully done H-scenes that depict the intimacy and affection the characters have for eachother.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nIf the sex scenes are what is holding you back from starting this show, then I understand, but they are not your typical tacky sex scenes that are depicted in hentai. You can feel the emotions the characters have for eachother.\\n\\n\r\nIf the incest is what's holding you back, I have to say that it is very well done too imo, because in this anime, it has consequences, and is dealt with seriously. The MC has a realistic internal struggle with himself over whether it is right, or wrong, and how his peers will perceive him if/once they find out.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are 100% unable to watch incest, then I think you're missing out on the rest of this show, and I suggest that you watch it but skip the last 4 episodes (the incest arc).\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.",

            "content": "Lately, there appears to be no end to shows that wink at incest. This show is an adaptation of a PC adult game, with a relationship between siblings as its central point. These two facts automatically mean there are certain things to expect and to not expect from Yosuga no Sora.\r\nWell, let's face it. You decide to watch Yosuga no Sora. Chances are, you're here to see how different this particular approach on this taboo of a relationship will be. Yosuga no Sora is not Kiss x Sis. And I'm not talking about the blood relation. You don't have this constant, mindless jumping into smut.Yosuga no Sora is no Koi Kaze either. Here, fan service is an important ingredient of the show, and the psychological approach of the matter isn't as deep, apart from some meager attempts of the male protagonist to resist his urges.\\n\\n\r\nSo what is there to expect of Yosuga no Sora? Expect..Highly polished graphics. Nicely drawn, attractive characters -it's a 2010 production after all. Expect some nice opening and ending themes. In fact, I enjoyed their visual aspect more than the actual songs, but still. While watching them expect some recurring visions of symbolisms like...trains. The world outside the window. Pure white. The feeling of being sick.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the nature of these games, expect four different arcs, where all the different \"paths\" for Haru, the male protagonist, are explored. Expect some voice acting by Sora's seiyu. I can't find the right words to express it right now. She's lazy, needy, clingy, spoiled. This fever she's running, it's in her voice too. The rest of the voice acting was indifferent to me. Expect...To be honest, I didn't expect the OST to be this good. These piano pieces can be very sentimental. It was the music, and the direction at times too, that created this constant feeling that..something wicked this way comes. It's a feverish condition, that they're bound to give in to in the end. Of course, expect lots of sexual tension through out; And some funny comedy clips at the end of the episodes, which are being honest about this too. \\n\r\nNow, what is there not to expect. The sexual tension to be there all the time. And I don't mean this in a good way. \\n\\n\r\nThree episodes for each arc keep things short, which can be good and bad at the same time. Paths you don't find interesting don't last long. But it doesn't leave enough space for development. Sora is meant to be the star of this show though, and the Haru-Sora arc progress through out, with the little things we learn about them.\\n\r\nThe first arc kept my interest, since I wasn't aware of this \"path\" structure of the show. Still, can't miss the weaknesses. They've drawn an attractive girl. They made her rich, so she's that stereotype, who is bound to have family issues too. But she needs something more to be special. Oh, I know. Why not just..throw a violin in there.\\n\r\nThen we have the second arc. Which, to me, was more like a chore, than the work of chemistry. The feeling I got was \"Alright, we have to try this pairing too. Let's get this over with\". That's how shallow it was. But it was during the third arc that this show shone...as a comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not easy to be so funny. I don't know where to start. From this \"Ohai. I'm a preteen. I'm sad. What do I do about it..! I know! I rape another preteen!\" attitude? From these ridiculous smiling sex faces, which destroy any intentions of sensuality? The part where the girl is supposedly devastated afterwards, walking away in a slow, dramatic way - which resembles watching a retarted zombie walking instead? And how can I not find it hilarious, how can I not pause to laugh, when Nao and Haru decide to search for Sora? Aren't you going overboard when you have the GIRL looking MANLY when she runs, and the MAN running with his hands going left and right, in this famous girlish depicting of running?\\n\\n\r\nAm I being too harsh? Actually, I'm being too lenient. I wondered whether I'm exaggerating over small things, that others wouldn't notice. But no. This is not a child's show; It shouldn't be at least, with a thematology like this. Haru is sky(=Sora)-bound, but people uninterested in some specific themes are unlikely to be captured by this one.",

Incest was the only word use the describe this series so even thou I intended to watch it to see what all the talk was about, I put it off for a while as I expected it to be a series a incest one through and through. \r\nBoy was I wrong. This show was NOT what I was expecting. OK, being made from a visual novel, the series has content. Alot and even more could of gone in it but that's something else. \r\nThere are several girlsand one main male protagonist. The series is divided into arcs and as you can guess, each arc focus on one girl in terms of romantic relation wise. If you have seen Amagami SS then its like that but with sex between the pair. Sex scenes are in it but its not hardcore hentai. Soft-hentai it you must. These sex scenes happen mostly towards the end of the arc. This makes up and give significant meaning towards the story arc. The two last episode are questionable as it threatens our morality of whats right and whats wrong when it comes to these things but I believe that you should be your own judge of that. \\n\\n\r\nDon't expecting \"forbidden love\" throughout the series like I did base on hearsay.",

            "content": "First off, think the concept of turning an adult (ish) romance visual novel into anime is somewhat wrong. That being said, this one turned out great as far as i think.\r\nThe different stories are clearly marked, so you know when one ends and another unrelated one starts. The characters are mostly well made and thought out, the emotional parts are well made and integrated with the music (the music is good.. but very repetitive, so it gets a bit of annoying). Each arc progresses quickly and feels complete (even though they are so short). There is some comedy involved that helps lighten the sad partsand prevent it from getting depressing. The adult scenes integrate almost perfectly with the normal ones, and feel right and not forced or fan servicy. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, i'd say the rank of 7/10 or slightly more is well deserved for this anime. As a romance anime however, i'd say it deserves around 9 / 10, as it feels much more complete in that aspect than most romance anime i watched as the most of them have pretty much no closure to them. It is a bit hard to switch and follow the different arcs separately, and that is what ruins it a bit for me, but i'd still recommend this to anyone looking for a romance anime.",

            "content": "Right, it's been a while since I wrote a review but I literally just finished watching this series so it's fresh in my head.\r\nYosuga no Sora is another anime based on a visual novel that has followed the Amagami SS way of doing things. Every girl gets a short arc and timeline where they get their spotlight. Personally I really like this concept as it stops people complaining about who the protaganist winds up with. My own personal complaints being with Clannad for example. However I digress.\r\nStory: 7\r\nThe story begins like pretty much any other anime of the genre where the protaganist (Haruka) and hissister (Sora) move to a place they used to live as kids minus any parents/guardians. There are a few interlinking features between stories and the final arc with Sora is wonderfully provocative. The thing is though, I have never seen an anime with the Twincest twist to it and never thought I would ship it but when you see for yourself, I'm pretty sure you will feel the same as they do about it all as they fight with morality. The story would score higher but the other arcs are fairly cliche, the saving grace being that Haruka isnt a gibbering idiot and can actually get somewhere with the girl in question.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is very crisp, especially during Ecchentai (kinda half and half) scenes. It would be quite hard not to look at Sora in a lustful way if she looked like she does in her scenes. Even the ending ministories which are drawn mostly in a chibi style have a distinct cuteness to them which makes them appealing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe OP was fairly average as I only listened to it for the first 2 episodes. However the ED is a bit more catchy and will probably be on my download list soon. The music is fairly atmospheric and captures the mood well and of course the VA's in both ecchi and non ecchi scenes perform admirably. Crap VA's would probably have ruined this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nThere is a character for everyone in here depending on what tickles your fancy. Tsundere, the Big Boobed Childhood friend with added glasses, a Miko, a Maid, a rich girl and even a prude in the background. Whichever your preference is, I guarantee at least 1 arc will appeal to you. In my case I had 3.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\\n\r\nScenes were executed really well and some things made me cringe whereas others made me laugh. The miniseries that is tacked on to the end adds a light heartedness to what could be considered a mostly serious romance. The Huge head on Akira never ceases to make me laugh. One of the funniest things I've seen in ages.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall I score this a solid 8 as there was room for improvement, perhaps an arc with the class president would have been possible. I feel a more conclusive ending would have been a nice thing to add as well.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all I view this anime as more than just a fapfest, its actually a close up view of morals and standards in todays society, at least from the last arc. That's what I take from this anyway.",

First when I started watching it was because I thought that it will be ecchi anime with mediocre story but it's story was really good and executed very nicely but the anime are too short... the ending was fine but somewhere in the middle the anime had not enough material... The director could have done better job by extending the story with other girl in one episode the hero is with one girl and in the other episode with another we don't know what happened in between... other wise it is pretty close to hentai but not hentai but don'twatch it as hentai but as anime you'll definately enjoy it much more this way..",

            "content": "I absolutely ADORE Yosuga no Sora. My dirty-ass mind went straight to this gem once I heard it was full of taboos and sex. What can I say, I\u2019m a hot blooded woman. And boy, did it live up to the hype and then some!\r\nBefore I delve deeper into my personal feelings, let\u2019s take a gander at the hot names involved with the show and other projects they\u2019ve worked on, just to get an idea about the quality.\r\nDirector: Takahashi Takeo \u2013 Spice and Wolf, Love Hina, and Citrus.\r\nProducer: Yamanaka Takahiro \u2013 Toradora and Kokoro Connect \r\nSound Director: Iwanami Yoshikazu \u2013 Ghost in the Shell, JOJO,and Kill La Kill, and One Punch Man Season 2. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, Yosuga no Sora isn\u2019t just some run-of-the-mill Harem, as I\u2019m sure most of us expected. It offers a complex peek into forbidden love and the trauma\u2019s that follow. It\u2019s more than just T&A (which is still offered, abundantly).  \\n\\n\r\nStory: Normally I don\u2019t like episodic plots. Not to say Yosuga no Sora is episodic, but it\u2019s also not completely linear. Based on an ecchi video game, the show mimics the \u201cone guy bangs multiple girls\u201d plotline. Every 3 or 4 episodes the story resets, each time featuring a new girl for our main protagonist to date. Here\u2019s the hook, the last arch features his twin sister as his lover. INCEST ALERT! I enjoyed the last arch the most. These episodes are the steamiest, darkest, and most fascinating to watch. Do I condone insect? Not particularly. Yet, I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t hope to see them get together. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I was immediately blown away by the musical score. My initial reaction was HOLY SHIT THE MUSIC IS SO GOOD. I still listen to the main melody all the time. The sombre score fits perfectly with the grim theme and tormented characters. As a stand-alone soundtrack, you can\u2019t get much better than this. If you\u2019re unsure, go to YouTube and have a listen. You won\u2019t be disappointed.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Two words describe the animation: absolutely gorgeous. Set in rural Japan, the art captures the tranquil majesty of nature. Every episode feels comfy and serene. The calm setting wonderfully offsets the intense drama. I loved the character designs and the overall quality of the art. You will not find girls with breasts larger than physically possible or chibi versions of the characters.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Although the show classifies as an Ecchi, it doesn\u2019t avoid darkness and despair. I appreciate when the plot explores the psychological depth of young love/lust. Each character brings some sort of mental turmoil to the plot without coming off as whiny. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Overall, I extremely enjoyed Yosuga no Sora. The show not only met my expectations, it surpassed them. Is the show a high brow contender for mass commercial consumption? Hell no. It's still an ecchi, but it is the best ecchi you can find. Supurb!\\n",

I really liked this Anime because it is unique, has a build-up multidrama and... it's pushing limits.\r\nI think the reason it has such a low score, is because of the ecchi stuff and the.... Scenes...\r\nBut that shouldn't matter because the story needed that, and would have been weird without it.\r\nThe first Anime I ever watched was Aki-Sora (in 9th grade lol). A friend showed me.\r\nI watched it because it was weird and we never see that kind of content on the Northside of Europe. But this anime is way better, and actually have a good story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Anime needs more excitement which will catch people to watch more. The drama wasn't always that intense, and I feel like it needs more of that.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the ending and the decisions. It was unexpected (for such a unique story) and it felt natural. Only thing being the fast build-up towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9):\\n\r\nThe story is unique but could have had a bit more intense drama.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8):\\n\r\nThe art is good, and doesn't stand out in a good or bad way. Some scenes are more detailed than others, eg. when feelings are expressed with body language, and a few emotional scenes.\\n\r\nArt in general is about right.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10):\\n\r\nAs expected. Feelings are also expressed with the tone and variation in the voices and music of course.\\n\r\nI also like the Music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8):\\n\r\nThere are always characters we like and don't like, and I think it should have been a bit less drama and focus around a few.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8):\\n\r\nAs said, the build-up in the end was too quick, but the unique story and drama makes it good anyways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a 9.\\n\r\nThis is not Hentai, it's a love story.",

It gives a fresh take on incest, which is impressive.\r\nStory 6/10\r\nYosuga no Sora stemmed from a VN which explains why the structure of the anime seems so disjointed. I especially disliked this aspect, as each arc is set in an alternate timeline, causing the relationships to lose significance.\r\nAnother frustrating issue was how the characters were mating like dogs in heat at every turn. It made the romance feel diluted and superficial.\r\nOn a good note, however, the plot was decent and how Haru fought against his moralobligations was impressive.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was superb, detailed and how a mellow colour palette was used to complement the music and story was top notch.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe OP was nice and the ED was pretty decent too. The OST, however, was the most impressive feature of the whole anime. It was fantastic, and matched perfectly with what was happening on the screen. Easily one of the best I've heard.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nDue to the fact that the structure of this series could be compared with that of a \"save point\" in a game, there was little continuous progression and development of the characters. Despite that, I think both Haru and Sora had surprising amounts of development. How their love for each other surpassed that of siblings was drawn out neatly. The moral aspect of their incestuous relationship was actually played out really well, as we see the characters fighting with their consciences.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10\\n\r\nIt is a rather slow anime and the structure may be difficult to get used to, but it really was enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nYes, the format could have been improved but the production value was first class. To wrap things up, an interesting watch and I would recommend it.",

            "content": "Warning: this review may contain spoilers.\r\nFirst impressions: So another anime based off of a hentai game again. I really need to stop watching these. Now I would like to add that I liked this anime and it's pretty hard to review an anime with this much controversy surrounding it, but I will try my best to review it.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story begins with our two main characters Haruka and his twin sister who have decided to move to a rural town where they once spent the summers as kids because both of their parents died in accident. And that's pretty much it- they meet old friendsand what not. \\n\\n\r\nIt's pretty much like most rom-com anime. It's based around a high school in a small town and there are some girls that like the main protagonist. So probably judging from what I have said so far you will probably think this show is generic and it kind of is in a way. But I would like to add that Yosuga no Sora does add something I little different from what most rom-com normally do, whether this is a good or a bad thing I don't really know.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things that this show does a bit differently which I am going to mention now. One thing is the narrative of this show. Now most anime based of a hentai game will generally adapt one routes of the game with parts of other routes in between. This is what this show does a little differently. It follows a ground hog day narrative formula and goes through all the girls\u2019 routes.\\n\r\nWhat I liked about this approach is that I was able to see all these routes play out and I got to see all the characters in a different way in every route because I also got a bit of drama with each route surrounding the girl who is the main girl in that route. Even though the drama was generic and the routes have pretty much the same plot beats.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the main character meets a girl, she has problems, and then the problem is solved by the main character\u2019s dick. Now even though it does boil down to that, the only routes that I personally thought where interesting was the Nao route and the Sora route. These were the only routes that actually did something that was actually serious and took their selves seriously enough.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing the show does a bit different, is the fact that it has a lot of off NSFW scenes that pretty much go into soft core porn territory. If you think I am joking I am not I am very serious. This show has sex scenes in it and if you have watched some hentai, then I am pretty sure you will know what to expect. Now at first I was a little shocked at first because I hadn't seen something like this in an anime before and I didn't really expect this at the time. But I didn't really mind this because at least they are kind of staying true to the source material.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, one thing that I would like to add is that the story can be very controversial in how it handles this kind of content.  For example, in one of the routes the main character goes into a relationship with his twin sister. There is also a part where they show the main character getting raped as a kid. Which at that point, I am thinking to myself wtf. And I can see why people would find this very off putting. Now as for me personally, I didn't really care. But to be honest I was kind of on the fence about the whole rape and incest plot point. But it does handle itself with a bit of maturity. So I give that a pass.\\n\\n\r\nAnother down side to this style of narrative is that the routes were really rushed so if you want to see the same story but slower then you should probably play the game.  And also the fact it went so fast that it really doesn't leave any actual impact. But even though they were rushed it wouldn't of helped the show that much anyway because of how generic the story telling was.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe main character Haruka is pretty generic over all. One thing that is different about him is that he makes some very questionable choices which made him a little fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe side characters are pretty much one note. But they do try to add a bit depth- I guess-  to the characters but overall it doesn't really work because of how rushed and generic the story was. Also this is a harem story I am talking about. All the characters fit in to certain fetish types so , to be fair, the characters were going to be one note any way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10 \\n\r\nThe animation was pretty average by the books, meaning there was nothing really bad or good about it as a whole. It uses a very bright color scheme that goes well with the summer time kind of weather and setting that the show takes place in. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it has a very clear cut style to it. The character design are also generic and kind of sexualize a lot. But hey, why I am complaining?\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe OST fits with the tone of the show pretty well. The OST isn't the best but it did an okay job. The OST was composed by manabu miwa who has also done the OST for little busters and nyan koi.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was ok, nothing too amazing, but they do a decent job. This show only has a sub, probably because of the nature of this show. But as far as a sub goes it not that bad \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\r\nSo what I liked about the show is that it was trying to be a little different, which isn't bad. Another thing I like is that it follows the actual source material to a point. Plus I also enjoyed the fact that these relationships went all the way. And that's something we don't see much especially for a show that aired on public television.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora is pretty much one of those anime where if you like it you going to like and if you hate then you are going to want to destroy every trace of it from the world hoping it never sees the light of day never again.",

            "content": "This is a very difficult anime to review; I went in knowing nothing other than there was potential incest vibes a-la No Game No Life, what I didn't know was that it was an ecchi drama  with borderline hentai scenes.\r\nThat being said; It effectively has no story.\r\nIt is a sequence of alternative scenarios where the protagonist Haruka socializes and eventually ..... I hesitate to say 'seduces', more like, enamorates a different girl in each sequence. It is all done very tastefully and respectfully, though there is a LOT of fanservice, it never feels gratuitous or sleazy.\r\nFor those that insist on calling it porn;\r\nThis isthe classiest, most emotionally deep (softcore) porn you will ever see.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characterization;\\n\r\nEach character is given very clear characterization, from the ultra energetic Amatsume, the elegant Ojousama Migiwa to the titular Tsundere Sora... the motivations and actions are well established and clear.  The dialogue and actions are very believable, unlike harem anime where the girls are just absurdly attracted to the male lead and eager to get penetrated, they are gradually more and more attracted as their emotional bond grows.\\n\\n\r\nSora herself is an amazingly written character, she is one of two tsundere characters that I can actually believe would exist in real life with the other one being Asuka Langley Soryu from Evangelion, except Evangelion exists in a post-apocalyptic setting whereas Yosuga no Sora exists in  a modern setting giving it even greater legitimacy. Sora's reasons for being tsundere and her behavior as a tsundere are 100% believable and justified, this is not only rare but completely unique in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, it's extremely well written.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE: The show has almost zero levity, it is a very heavy show without comic relief. It has some omakes at the end to lessen the absurd intensity of the show but that does very little to diminish the hardcore emotional/sexual weight of the proceedings themselves.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of art and animation;\\n\r\nIt is very well animated, I saw no evidence of animation shortcuts or slip-ups for the purposes of 'bottle episodes', it was all very well done and clearly great effort was placed to make each girl look and move uniquely. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the best looking shows of its type, but on top of this, the direction is flawless, some of the 'camera angles' are magnificent (You'll know what I mean when you see it).\\n\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to name one objective flaw;\\n\r\nThe pacing is very slightly off, there are a few scenes that drag on a bit too long and other scenes  that are a bit too short. It's a strange combination of \"Too rushed\" and (Especially) \"Too slow\" at times, but this is very rare and only an issue for the pickiest of the picky types.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nALL OF THAT BEING SAID;\\n\r\nHere is the real problem with the show. This show has no audience; IT HAS NO AUDIENCE. I cannot recommend it to almost anyone. I cannot stress it enough how it has no audience.\\n\\n\r\n- It's structured like a hentai game / ero game, so the story is tremendously disjointed.\\n\r\n- It's too fanservice-y for women.\\n\r\n- It's not fanservice-y enough for men.\\n\r\n- If you want material to jerk off to, it is not for you, there is way better spank material out there.\\n\r\n- If you want emotional depth , you can get that without the fanservice.\\n\r\n- If you want beautiful art style and animation, you can get it without pacing issues, disjointed story and fanservice.\\n\r\n- If you want a good story, this has none.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nI have no idea who would want to watch this show... and yet it is one of my favorites, but I would never recommend it to anyone. It just doesn't fit the bill for any kind of show someone would want to see.\\n",

            "content": "Per usual my review is based on story, character and enjoyment alone.\r\nPlease comment on my page your reasons for not finding this helpful, I welcome criticism and will improve/change on what you say, Thanks ^^\r\nBefore I start let me state, I really didn't enjoy this anime because of the incest in it. However that is my opinion alone. I hope you do not decide to watch or not based on that. This is just an explanation for my enjoyment rating.\r\nStory:\r\nAs far as the story goes we have 4 main arcs. It's set out like Majora's mask in the way that he has a relationship withone girl, then time reverses and we experience the story differently. The story arcs and well executed. They're pretty typical but none the less most parts are enjoyable. There is soft-hentai in this but that doesn't spoil the anime unless you're afraid of seeing breasts or hearing sexual noises. I did enjoy 3 out of the 4 arcs in the anime and would happily watch them again. The drama surprised me a little, because it was definitely well done. Although I didn't find myself making an indoor swimming pool at the sad moments, I did feel compelled into sadness or anger along with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: \\n\r\nThe characters in my opinion are very limited. There isn't much character development as the relationships are squeezed into roughly 3 episode arcs. This isn't a horrible deterrent though, the characters themselves don't need much development. Think of it as a colouring book which is 90% completed when handed to you. Don't misunderstand though, that isn't a negative point, I just mean to say that it's more focused on the story rather than the characters. The characters are fun and likeable though.\\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend it?\\n\r\nIf I was going to recommend it based on my preferences then I wouldn't due to the incest- but that's not what i'm here to do. The anime itself was enjoyable if you're not me, and it definitely would of been high up on my list if the idea of sexual family relationships didn't deter me. So in the end, I think the anime is enjoyable if you like romance, drama and elements of comedy. However, if you are 100% innocent to the point where you blush if someone mentions the word sex then it's probably not for you. \\n\\n\r\n-MrCallum",

            "content": "Yosuga no sora has been criticized by many people as a mild porno. I completed this series an found that I would like to differ. \r\nLets take a step back and take a look at everything.............\r\nThe main characters the Kasugano siblings move to a town where they spent time in their childhood after their parents' death from there on their lives begin to change each day.\r\nWell that was the basic plot summary, now for the working of this anime.... \r\nThe characters are good, the art is top notch and detailed and the visuals are nice to watch as far as I am concerned it alllooks beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks suit the stories progress and are good to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the story, because this is in an omnibus format and only 12 episodes long a the character development did take a hit but still even in that short span the animators did make a good effort to make the characters as likeable as possible. the characters are colorful though I cannot say they lack depth I will still say could have been better.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators tried to pull off a hardcore romantic series they did do a pretty good job but it fell short because at times it does feel like the story was kept from being more elaborate also the per episode length of the series is too short we have the opening sequence of 1 1/2 minutes along with the ending of same length and also a short unrelated quickie of about 2 mins. and yet another closing theme of about 1 1/2 minutes in all this the effective story time is about 18 minutes in a 25 minute long episode.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNow coming to the nudity and incest....... It really doesn't make a difference the series tries to depict different types of romance stories and well if we do take a look at some other series there are echhi series that are rated higher than this and have nudity without meaning but here the sex scenes feel in place, as for the incest its just a part of the story as an arc and is in the final 3 episodes if you don't like it skip.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the impression of this series is Really good and i'd recommend it to all here. \\n\\n\r\nAnd also for people who don't have a good impression of this series please take a step back and reconsider. \\n\\n\r\nI personally think this series deserves a better ranking in the above 7 category.",

            "content": "Although the plot is that of 2 orphans moving back to they're home town, the deeper plot has to do with the male orphan and his many relationships.  This anime deals with morality and incest, as many discriptions hint.  The main story is of a twinmale's sickley sister having to stay home, while he makes friends, has fun, and creates relationships. All awhile the female twin experiences thoughts of lust for her brother, him being obliviouse...this is the story set up from episode 1-3.  I really like the way this anime dealed with the way the other characters saw incest.  Mostanimes having to do with incest either hold two views. 1) the other characters don't care. 2) the other characters are disgusted and can't stand it.  \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime worth watching.  If the storyline pulls you in, but you hate fanservice (Which this has very much of), I recommend the manga.  it has the same storyline with NO fanservice at all. \\n\\n",

At first glance, your automatic response is to assume that this will either be a sister/brother love story (since the lead towards that, including in the intro, during the first few episodes. Also you might think it's going to be a School Comedy, where the events will unfold during school, just like so many other ero/comedies. \r\nSo what is this then? Just an bunch of arcs. You'll have an arkwhere our main character hariko will fall in love with all of them, while developing the involved character a lot during it's scenario then later on building on it. \\n\\n\r\nIt's quite sad though, since after episode 2 or 3, I thought that it would develop into a much better story line, and not cut it off in the middle all the time. Actually the only thing that follows some sort of time line is the little story at the end. \\n\\n\r\nThis is still a good anime, just ruined a little with making it a pure Ero, but it could have been worst. I feel this story had much more potential, and I think you will feel the same way as I do.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to comment on art etc, since with today's technology, everyone feels differently. I am just going to say, don't be misled, it's not going to be a touching series.",

Its really.......I don't know, real?\r\nThe sound actors really performed the characters well.\r\nThe characters was great.They have greatexpressions and feelings. It really make me want to watch further.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I think its a good anime :)",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is quite the original show, the base story however isn't all that new and is become more popular these days (shiki, higurashi.) The lead character returns to a village that he once lived with his twin sister, this village is an out of town mountain village, from this point Haruka the protagonist meets a variety of people including a childhood friend.\r\nThe set up is quite original, after each arc it gets reset back to the end of episode 2. The first arc follows Kazuha and how she has a few family issues including having a step sister which she believe her Fathershuns and how Haruka helps her and they fall in love. Second arc follows Akira the sister mention earlier and follows the same story but from her side and how she and Haruka fall in love. The third arc goes right through to the end and is a joint between Nao the childhood friend and Sora the twin, lost of drama because of an incident in the past and of course the issue of incest and whether true love will is more important than what people will think of them. There is also a nice little extra arc that follows the ending theme song that follows a different girls arc but takes up a much more comedic theme using chibi character designs and slapstick gags.\\n\\n\r\nDuring each arc there is a lot of sex, while all this is shown to the viewer, there's no discretion shots here, you never actually see the 'lower half tools' but you get plenty of boob, this puts it just behind becoming a hentai but is extremely ecchi.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is a nice song that fits with the feel of show but at the same is quite an up beat tune contrasting with the heavy drama to come, ending song is a nice ballad accompanied by a nice piano track and most certaintly fits nicely. The extra specials at the end even has its own ending theme which uses an upbeat song to highlight the comedyness of the extra. Background music is beutiful, it uses piano as a main focus and adds in string instruments to give it a really nice feeling to add to the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is fabulous, everything about it is great, the characters are well drawn with only a few slight mistakes when they moved but is very rare, backgrounds play quite a big part in the art as a lot of foliage surrounds the village and fields in the distant. Each characters outfits are pretty, especially Soras clothes. Animation is smooth and you don't get any unnecesary still shots or repeated actions, even during certain sex scenes. CG is used slightly, sometimes its not needed like using it with the fan but its not off putting or out of place.\\n\\n\r\nHaruka our protagonist is the type who is able to create friendships easily, he during each arc helps out the concerning female being both dependant and caring, though he isn't perfect as the story goes he gets more and more confused and does show weakness. Sora the twin is reclusive and tends to be quite, she suffered from an illness and is quite delicate and lacks all forms of social grace and can be rather lazy, as long as shes with her brother she cares for non. Migiwa Kazuha is the daughter of an important figure in the village but still retains modesty. Amatsume Akira live alone in the shirne and practices the traditions, she's the bubbly one of the group and is always the one to try and lighten the mood. Nao is the childhood friend to the twins but due to an incident in the past Sora now hates her, she is also rather mature compared to some characters. Motoka is the lead female in the specials and likes the get drunk and in the main story is the Migiwa maid. All other characters are simple, the best friends who is a little perverted, a candy store owner who is rather lazy but acts as a mature adult who you can talk to. Genrally all characters are a decent bunch that has some stereotypes but they don't cling to them giving all a sense of individuality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall if you enjoy romance dramas its likely this is a show for you, though towards the end its filled with drama because of some characters and there designs it keeps a bit of the comedy, and some might get put off by its extreme ecchiness its still got plenty of content but is aimed towards the fanservice and romance fans and because of its reset nature is definitely enjoyable.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is an anime adaptation of the adult visual novel of the same name and it tells the story of the Kasugano twins, namely Haruka Kasugano and his sister Sora, who move to the countryside after losing their parents in a tragic accident. After making new friends, Haruka turns out to be highly appealing to the girls around his newfound home and must make several decisions between pursuing love and protecting his younger sister.\r\nNot much stands out between Yosuga no Sora and every other romance anime, except for the fact that this one boasts a surprisingly potent amount (see what I did there?)of ecchi \u2013almost borderline hentai\u2014and also some incest. Much like the other popular romance anime of this year, Amagami SS, with which it shares quite a few similarities, Yosuga no Sora is separated into several story arcs, each arc following a different path as Haruka gets involved with the female characters of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative in Yosuga no Sora is not as linear as it appears to be at first. As a testament to this are the various story arcs that are unbalanced in length, with some taking more than others to conclude a path in the story. Furthermore, some episodes don\u2019t belong to any arc whatsoever and are only there to serve as a build-up for the things to come. An example of this are the first two episodes, with the first one containing mostly exposition and an introduction to the story, while the second one sets things up for two story arcs that follow after it. Don\u2019t bother overanalyzing this anime\u2019s structure, for it will only lead to confusion and possibly even degrade your impression of it.\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Yosuga no Sora feels like a harem anime, with Haruka being the \u2018prince charming\u2019 and almost every girl he meets of his age falls for him, sooner or later (usually instantly). However, the story arcs that go on to develop each character make the anime feel special in its own way, and even though some of them aren\u2019t as interesting as others, they still are worth sitting through just to see how it plays out.\\n\\n\r\nNudity is not uncommon in Yosuga no Sora, so be prepared for some graphic sex scenes and other stuff. What makes this anime the most controversial, however, is the incest relationship between Haruka and his sister Sora, which makes for a good amount of graphic scenes in the last story arc. If this does not sound like your cup of tea, then I suggest you skip it, for it is pretty much exactly as it sounds.\\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, some story arcs are more interesting than others, which leads to an unfortunate imbalance that may turn some viewers off. I\u2019ll say a couple of words about each arc in particular without trying to spoil too much, just so you know what you\u2019re getting into. From the anime\u2019s opening credits, one can deduce that Yosuga no Sora deals with six different girls, though that is not entirely true.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two girls that don\u2019t have their own arcs (although some extra content may be included in the DVDs/Blu-rays): Motoka Nogisaka, who plays a maiden, gets most of her screen time after every episode ends in a series of mini-events that portray her growing relationship with main character Haruka, so it could be argued that she does have her own story arc in an unconventional manner. The second one is Kozue Kuranaga, chairman of the Student Body. In the first episodes, it seems that she will play a role similar in size to the other girls and she will probably get her own story arc, but that never happened and she was pretty much ignored in the story until the final episodes, where she started playing a bigger role again. It is likely that Kozue will get her own story arc in the DVDs and/or Blu-rays.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of Yosuga no Sora deals with two girls, Kazuha Migiwa and Akira Amatsume, who are quite close to each other and it is left for Haruka to discover the truth about their relationship as he gets to know each of them more and more. While Kazuha comes from a very wealthy family and is surprisingly mature for her age, Akira is exactly her opposite, being more of an immature and energetic nature. She\u2019s also a shrine maiden in the village and lives in a small shrine near the mountains. My reaction to both Kazuha\u2019s and Akira\u2019s story arcs was relatively lukewarm. On the one hand, I found the story revolving around them to be somewhat interesting, but ultimately it seemed to underdeveloped for me to enjoy it. Furthermore, their romantic relationship with Haruka felt mostly rushed and unnatural, especially Akira\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nThe latter half of the anime is dedicated to Nao Yorihime and Haruka\u2019s twin sister, Sora. First I\u2019ll start with Nao, who is a childhood friend of Haruka and their relationship seems to go back a long time ago. My only gripe with Nao\u2019s story arc is that it does not allow the viewer to learn more about her character and her past and instead focuses for the most part on her and Haruka trying to make Sora accept the relationship between them. Plus, Nao played quite a significant role in Sora\u2019s story arc as well, which led some viewers to dislike the character completely because of her coming in between Haruka and his sister.\\n\\n\r\nLast but most certainly not least, the story concludes with Sora Kasugano\u2019s story arc, which is one episode longer than the rest (or so it appeared to me). Despite the controversy regarding the incest, I found this arc to be the most enjoyable and interesting, with the relationship between Haruka and Sora developing in a smooth manner. The feelings for each other are also not unfounded, but rather genuine and collected. The ending wasn\u2019t exactly a happy one, but it did not feel depressing either. The arc, along with the anime, was concluded in a satisfying manner and it was definitely a step up from the way that it started.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora did not turn out the way some may have wanted it to, and I cannot help but feel that if it had pursued a single narrative line that focused more on the relationship between Haruka and Sora, it would have been much better. As it is now, Yosuga no Sora is not too different from the typical harem romance anime, though it is still worth a watch, especially for the last story arc, which was really special and definitely stood out from the rest. It\u2019s also quite an enjoyable and entertaining anime, so there\u2019s really not much to lose. For those of you who decide to give Yosuga no Sora a watch, be prepared to see some skin, for gratuitous nudity is not a stranger in this anime.",

            "content": "*Warning - Review probably contains spoilers. I can't really remember.*\r\nIf you stopped viewing Yosuga no Sora after the first four episodes, your impression of the show probably wouldn't be very high. Let's be fair, at face value it looks like another raunchy high-school drama starring another perfect male lead, another meganekko neighbour, another creepy tsundere girl...However, what sets this apart (and I never thought I'd say this about an ecchi) is it's way of storytelling, and while the Amagami SS style parallel arcs may seem rather gimmicky at first, I thought the show came together in a rather compelling way.\r\nFirst of all, the animation hereis stellar. While the countryside / highschool setting has definitely been seen before, Yosuga no Sora feels somehow fresh in its approach. It really hit me in the scene from the opening episode when the car just brushes past Sora just how sweeping the landscapes are. While most of the show has a classy, muted colour scheme (mainly black, white, brown and green), suddenly you'll be hit with these intense sunsets and colossal cloud shots. On top of that, the music is incredible and always well chosen to suit the scene - something ecchis seem to have a problem doing. There are some real tear-jerkers in this. Not to mention the opening and closing themes are fantastic, and the omake segments flip all of this completely with hilarious chibi art and a cute as heck closing tune.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the anime deals with sexual matters - which no doubt drew in its audience in the first place - is surprisingly mature. Although in terms of explicitness it seems to stray into hentai-land, Haru's encounters are never meaningless. They almost work as payoff for having seen him develop a strong relationship with each girl. While Kazuha is a close second, the incestuous relationship at the end was probably the most intriguing of all. At the end of the first episode Sora's intentions are made clear to the viewer, so throughout the first two arcs Sora has an almost menacing presence with constant cut-aways. But even when her arc takes off, it comes across as more like animal desire than romantic love (they have sex a lot earlier than the other couples as well). You can really see the life being sucked out of Haru. I personally didn't find it arousing in any way, and I heavily doubt that that was the creators' intention.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the multiple story arcs are incredibly well integrated. Each girl turns out to be more than a surface level stereotype, and are fleshed out with more quirks and personal information than 4 episodes each would suggest. I never thought I would find the family drama of Akira, say, so compelling. Some of the smaller characters, such as Kozue, were cleverly incorporated too; while I originally wrote her off as a badly developed supporting character, in Sora's arc her role of catching the twins having sex and later confessing to Haru was cleverly played out. Like, in the other arcs she would have just been watching from afar, hoping Haru is happy with his partner, but this last scenario is enough to bring her forwards about her feelings.\\n\\n\r\nI only had a few problems with this series. Most notably, it being an ecchi there just had to be some pointless boob jiggling and wet t-shirt moments. These just felt really out of place because after the first episode I really stopped seeing the characters in that way (came for the incest - stayed for the character development). There were also some characters that seemed a bit bland. I would have loved to delve into Haru's psyche, especially to explain how his mind could accommodate sexual relations with so many girls. I feel like a critique of male lust is just waiting to be explored here. Yahiro and Ryouhei also didn't bring much to the story in terms of plot that couldn't have been introduced otherwise, though Ryouhei did bring a fair amount of unexpected comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're feeling randy but like your porn to make you cry, then this anime may just surprise you",

            "content": "I believe that this was a very... ahem, romantic anime with a very good character build up. Almost TOO much romance and character build up at the last two episodes. Keep in mind, it was my first incest anime -- I was quite disturbed, both for watching it and sub-conciously waiting for it to happen (because I didn't know when I started the series, but could tell half way through).\r\nUsually, I don't care if there is a little incest in movies or shows. This particular one showed so much emotion between each character though, I guess it's not like looking at a title of aporno and watching the video of two twins getting in on though. No, here it's like you can feel what the guy's going through.\\n\r\nAnyways, over all rating is 8/10. My enjoyment rating shot down to 6/10 after watching the incest though. I believe the ending, from a non-biased PoV was fairly decent aswell.",

I watched the anime and well listen\r\nStory 8:\r\nThe story is about a twin brother named Haruka and his twin sister named Sora who move to their grandparents summer house in a rural village. Episode 1 shows all of the characters who are going to be in their story arcs. Each girls has about 3 or 4 episodes dedicated to them. The story is something I have never heard of before and the execution is great.\r\nArt 9:\r\nThere are twoways to explain the art. Background and character models. The background looked beautiful. The sunset looked as if it was there and sunrise looked as if it was there. Character models were well done too. When the characters had emotion their body language showed that emotion.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9:\\n\\n\r\nOne word to describe the music: unbelievable. There are no two scenes with the same exact music. Serious scenes have serious music and happy scenes have happy music. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7:\\n\\n\r\nWhile Haruka and Sora are both unique characters the rest are generic. One girl is the overly happy girl, another is the mysterious girl who never explains her past and the other is the shy girl who wears glasses. The other character is a maid but I didn't pay much attention to her. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8:\\n\\n\r\nI thought the anime started out slow at first, but the more I watched it the more I got the story. Haruka falls in love with the girls in different ways for each story arc and frankly I liked Haruka all together. I think Haruka was a great character and this anime should not be hated.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9:\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime was great. While I liked the story, art, and sound better than the character I still find this anime a great experience that you just might enjoy.",

            "content": "Before I start writing this review, I would like to tell you that this is my first review I've ever done in this site. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.\r\nStory\r\nSo far I've watched 11 episodes of Yosuga no Sora, and I could say I honestly enjoyed it for a while. The first episodes are quite subtle and less intense than the upcoming ones, but personally I prefer them better than all of the other episodes. Why? I thought this show would be more into drama the two siblings experienced and all the new challenges they got into in their new lives. Instead, I got ananime about an almost-perfect good-looking guy who gets all the ladies (even his own sister, there's incest at later parts of the anime) and have sex with all of them. Sure, I would be fine if there were a few parts where he and one girl would kiss under the moonlight or hug each other passionately, yet I can't really help but feel awkward (not to mention a bit disgusted) when seeing H-scenes in every episode. I don't get why did the producers put so much effort on explaining the story behind each girl if they only wanted to have sex in the end with the main character? That feels way out of place with the whole drama building up in each arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nI would say the art is very good. When you watch Yosuga no Sora, you'll see many details on the surroundings and even on the characters themselves. The effects do really match the enviroment as I really enjoyed seeing the whole background flow seamlessly while watching. From the small waves I saw in the schoolyard pool to the breezing trees up on the temple, the art works dynamically to put more 'setting' into the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nVoice acting is excellent. I couldn't sense any hint of cheesy lines (even though some of the subtitles are quite cheesy themselves) in the intense scenes. You could feel the emotion the voice actors put in because Yosuga no Sora can really pull you into the story as you further watch it. Soundtracks are really good and BGMs blend with the scenes, although some were less matching at certain parts of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nIn Yosuga no Sora, all the main girl characters are given a decent story of their own. Viewers could easily understand the relationship of each girl with Haru (male lead) and what are their personalities. The thing that was lacking is the fact that Haru and Sora (female lead) both do not have a clear story where did they come from and so forth. All we know is that they moved into their grandfather's house since their parents died and have been living there ever since.  More detail could be given to those two as they fill the main roles of the story. Other than that, side characters are quite developed enough to be more interesting in their respective arcs.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis anime was definitely worth my time, but there were some parts I realized Yosuga no Sora could be too 'perfect' and rather 'unrealistic' for anyone who's looking for pure enjoyment. Could it be that the Haru is a flawless character who is handsome and attracts all the females? Or maybe there were too much underdeveloped romance which eventually lead to H-scenes? I like both harem and ecchi, yet this was over the tip of my usual scale. So much that I felt uncomfortable watching Yosuga no Sora. There was just too many ecchi in this series and not enough drama.\\n\\n\r\nEDIT:\\n\r\nAfter watching the final episode of the series (I was at the eleventh when I wrote this review), I realized Yosuga no Sora did a good job on capturing the audience's attention in those drama parts. It makes you aware of what it feels like to go against people's opinion; go against what the world has to say to you; go against your own morals even. The story arcs (especially Sora's at the end) are quite progressive enough to make you let go of the love scenes for a while and focus back on the romance the anime offers.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nDecent anime in my opinion, yet it lacks consistency in development since the viewers' attention is always being obstructed by constant H-scenes and excessive ecchi. If you like casual anime which are less serious, I wouldn't recommend watching Yosuga no Sora because it deals around intricate plotlines and you need to think quite hard to understand the whole concept of the story. But if you prefer watching drama series with a lot of romance, or perhaps you are a softcore hentai fan, go ahead and watch Yosuga no Sora.",

Spoiler, incest. Hot steamy incest that blossoms into hot steamy love. I support this, because of my own filthy mind. And the filthy minds that made this. Glad I watched it.\r\nThe story is okay, not mind blowing but very sad and depressing in ways. The music and art compliment it, which is why Igot emotionally connected to the characters and the way they did things. The only thing I didn't like is the big breasted girl with the glasses. Her character was so bland it wasn't very interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime along with the other one I can't remember the name of are quite borderline hentai.\\n\r\nIn a way, I'm glad that this anime exists. Incest is as much taboo as its a mind's desire. Exploring the incest through a safe way, through an anime with actors is one of the safest ways to explore the depths of darkness. Nothing wrong with that IMO. \\n\\n\r\nBut do take that in mind when watching this. If your mind isn't open enough, you will just judge this great story for its taboo, and not for its story and exploration spirit.\\n\\n\r\nStill freedom to you.

            "content": "\"Anime is for kids\" is a statement i hear quite often. It is a statement made out of ignorance.\r\nYosuga no Sora is definitely not an anime made for kids. With sex scenes and mature themes featuring molestation, incest, and suicide, the last thing I think the producers were marketing this anime toward were kids. \r\nWhy do we act the way we do? Because society tells us to? Are feelings all that matters in love? Or should we let society tell our hearts who and who not to love?\r\nKeep in mind that this show is a visual novel adaptation of the same game by the companySphere. FEEL, the studio that animated the novel, did so in omnibus format (meaning that they animated four out of the five possible routes in the game). Thus, the show is split up into four \"arcs\", each focusing on a different heroine. Such a format proves detrimental in the case of Yosuga no Sora, though I enjoyed it nevertheless.\\n\\n\r\nThe first two arcs, in my opinion, were not really needed. I am not Japanese, nor can I speak the language, and thus I did not play the game. So to me, the first two arcs bore no significance. I saw them as a method of satisfying the denomination of fans who did not like Sora or Nao's route, but I disgress. The first two arcs are nothing to write home about. One of them using the typical \"childhood friend\" cliche, while the other using the \"princess/rich girl\" cliche. So in short, they are nothing stellar. If you don't really want to bother with them, you can skip them. They bare no real significance in the other two arcs.\\n\\n\r\nThe last two arcs, which begin around episode 7, are actually intertwined with one another. Due to a fight that occurred between two years prior, Sora's and Nao's relationship is a hate/love relationship, respectively. The former despises Nao as a result of what she had done to Haru in the past, and the latter wishes to rekindle the very strong friendship the two had. It should also be noted that Nao is the only character that goes to great lengths to support the twins' relationship in the second arc of the series, showing just how much she trusts and wishes for the twins' happiness, at the cost of her own.\\n\\n\r\nGiven her pivotal role in the lives of our two main characters, it should be no surprise that her arc is linked to Sora's. Unfortunately, I feel as though her arc is the weakest of all, focusing more on Sora and Haru's current relationship and feelings and their past with Nao. It is not recommended to skip this arc if you simply want to see Sora's end. Sora's arc officially starts around episode 10; however, the \"branching point\", or the point in which the series \"restarts\" (keep in mind it is based off of a visual novel) is actually episode 7, or the beginning of Nao's arc. Viewers who simply skip to episode 10 will be left confused and miss out on important background information explaining exactly why Sora treats Nao the way she does.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'll focus the most on Sora's arc. Given her petite, doll-like appearance, Sora immediately catches the eye of every boy in her new school; however, beneath this facade is a girl who is selfish, lazy, and uncompromising of her feelings toward her brother. For potential viewers, Sora is the twin sister of Haru, the main character. Her arc has caused much controversy not only in the West, but also in Japan itself. Her arc is as powerful as it is controversial. Unlike many other series of anime, manga, and eroge that patronize the act of sleeping with one's sister, Yosuga no Sora challenges the very romanticization of love, while depicting the realistic repercussions of starting a romantic relationship with a relative. Do we truly love our family? To what limits should our love for them go? Should we follow our feelings despite what society says? Or should we simply hide them away beneath lock and key simply because it is deemed \"wrong\" by the masses.\\n\\n\r\nWe are told, ever since we are young, that incest is wrong. It is taboo. It is unholy. Merely bringing up the topic in a conversation yields strong replies of \"that's gross\" or \"that's immoral\". Yet, Yosuga no Sora challenges these responses. WHY is it gross? WHY is it wrong? Funny enough, there aren't any right answers to these questions.\\n\\n\r\nIf based solely on the last arc, I will have to say that this anime is probably one of the best in its genre; unfortunately, I had to sit through about ten episodes of mediocrity before reaching this gem, which is why the overall score is much lower. \\n\\n\r\nStill a good watch, nevertheless.",

When Amagami SS came out it was pretty clear on giving each girl a different ending resulting in short unrelated arcs and the synopsis reflects this by not inferring to an overarching storyline.  The fact that Yosuga no Sora seems to be going for this setup is, in my opinion,a bad move because on the synopsis page it states, \"All seems peaceful and familiar. However, beneath the surface is a secret promise that the twins made with each other long ago, the whereabouts of an important lost item, and the real reason they chose to come back here.\"  pretty heavy right?  This seems like a pretty cool 12 episode anime premise but by going the each heroine gets a separate arc way they will be forced to cram what I think could have been a cool series into an arc. \\n\\n\r\nThis could all be proven wrong with the coming episodes, this is just my opinion.\\n\\n\r\n-aHuman\\n\\n",

Separating each story allows a new and different light on the character Haruka as he grew differently with each. \r\nThe animation and colours of this anime was smooth. \r\nThe sound track was very fitting for the story and was somehow soothing. \r\nThis was a story that did touch ona taboo subject (incest) that I personally found it off putting but continued through to see what happens at the end.\\n\\n\r\nNot much needs to be said when the words Harem and Ecchi are part of the animes genres.

They are in fakt inextractable parts of the story itself.\r\nYosuga No Sora -  might just be an example of my concept of ideal anime -  totaly mature anime that evenly balances great story with a mature and honest depiction of sexual realations, instead of silly funservice panty flashing and opai brushingof other series. \\n\\n\r\nIll just be focusing on the main pros and cons of the series to keep this review as short as possible\\n\\n\r\n++ AMAZING Backbround Music and 3 good songs make for totaly memorable experience, IMHO the single best aspect of the series\\n\r\n+ Stunning enviroment\\n\r\n+ Beatiful Characters and decent to good animation\\n\r\n+ Protagonist isnt a retard (though he could be a bit more manly)\\n\r\n+ great atmosphere - the feeling of nostalgia makes you think about your own adolescence\\n\r\n+ mature and belivable\\n\\n\r\n- due to plot inconsistency, and breaking the series into several Character Arcs there is not enought time spend on each individual case. I Guess it will always be a matter with VN adaptations. It is at least better than protagonist making it out with all the heroines in single \"playthrough\"\\n\r\n- mistreat of some characters in most of the episodes\\n\r\n- this series should be pushed a bit farther and actualy show erotic scenes without stupid restrictions to keep it \"just\" Echii.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7\\n\r\nArt 8\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nCharacters 7\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8\\n\r\nOverall 8\\n\\n\r\nSo in summarition I can totaly recomend watching this one. Visualy appealing good in story, and a bit diffrent from usuall harem it is a nice anime. I dont know if I will remember it forewer, but I am definetly glad I watched it.It greatest weekness beeing inferiority to VN, but I cant imagine a better way to adaptate Harem VN without reducing importance of evry but main heroine, which would made it less intresting (not to mention inffurating for other charactrers fans).\\n\\n\r\nSo if you dont want to Play VN or you just want to watch a good Echi anime dont hessitate and try Yosuga no Sora. Just for mature audiences only :)\\n\\n\r\nPS. I hope my review will be helpfull. Sorry for many mistakes I make, hopefully they dont make this review unreadable. I intend to get better with more experience :) Most of all enjoy the show !\\n\\n\r\nomatase",

I have watched anime of the Ecchi genre for a few years now, mostly just for fun and giggles and the obligated little cringe. I did not expect a lot of this anime, but once I finished it I was still thinking about it days later. This is a clear sign for me that this is something special. Like when you fall in love and keep babbling about him/her and they are your only thought. Well, kinda like that, but let's just say it really pleasantly surprised me. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nThis is anadaption of the light novel so naturally, the story starts and is then separated into different arcs for the different girls which each arc starting at a \"safe point\". YES, this show contains nudity and softcore, but the story is not neglected and neither are the H scenes portrayed in a cheap way. The story is well developed and definitely also makes you feel something, from sadness to anger and pure happiness. Another point would be the topic of questioning your own morals, do you just agree with something because you feel like it is the right thing or because others say so? \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nWhat can I say, this is beautifully animated. I like the country side setting and the character designs were also done tastefully. This is just a very subjective plus, but I really really enjoyed the design of the twins, not only because of their gray/white hair color but also Sora's clothes really fit her character. She is this delicate petite girl and her doll like dresses make her look even more like a china doll.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nI am not complaining here, the background music was soft and fitting and never felt out of place. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nMost of the characters are very likable and unique in their own ways, however there was one character I just could not get myself to like. Like so many others, I can't put my finger on why exactly I was having such a hard time with Nao, but it could have also been the intention of the makers of the show (but I will not assume anything here).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall Score: 9/10",

NOW to address the elephant in the room; \r\n[spoiler]\r\nIT IS WHAT YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT, AND IT DOES GO THERE!\r\n[/spoiler]\r\n Having said that, if you can get beyond that this anime should  be enjoyable for you. That's pretty much all the positive I shall mention here as I repeat, if you can get past the elephant in the room, you should enjoy it. So let me mention what didn't work here. It's 12 episodes, but it seems likeseven episodes of plot stretched out to 12. There's a bit of flashing back to events we (as the viewer) have already seen. All the characters have little more depth and personality than the plot requires, so if you're looking for a strong female lead; I suggest watching something else. Also, if you're looking for a morality tale here prepare for disappointment. But this isn't the kind of anime one watches for plot and substance (in fact when I watched it I am grateful to watch something this simple), which is why I gave it a four out of five.",

            "content": "I was first introduced to Yosuga No Sora during an ecchi panel at AnimeBoston several years ago. Me, being your run-of-the-mill otaku, thought the incest subplot was AWESOME and I threw the series onto my watchlist immediately. I mean, anyone who says they don't ship brother/sister pairings in anime literally all of the time is a liar. Unfortunately, that part of the series doesn't show up in full force until the last four episodes of 'FOUR DISTINCT STORY ARCS'. The rest of the series is just Haruka trying to bang other girls that he is less compatible with. There's the oujo-sama, the shrine maiden, thenext-door neighbor, and even the archetypical class president who's love is never reciprocated! Now that we've got the building blocks for our harem, the only thing we need is an incredibly dense and mundane protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nQueue Haruka Kasugano. In the beginning of Yosuga No Sora (Aptly named after the indisputable best girl), Haruka and Sora move to some random town in the country to cope with the recent death of their parents. Fortunately, they don't seem to care about this tragic event in the slightest and worry about more first-world concerns like, \"Where are we going to buy groceries?\" or \"Why don't our cell phones have any reception?\" The biggest problem for Sora, however, is that she is so sexually attracted to her twin brother that she comes off as a friggin' stalker half of the time. Being stricken with mysterious health issues that she's had since birth (I think?), Sora is a bit of a roadblock for the other girls that want to jump on Haruka's yaoi stick simply due to the fact that he has white hair -- or something. I don't know what anyone sees in this guy. He's essentially Makoto from School Days with an IQ slightly higher than 10.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga No Sora follows that confused formula many visual novel adaptations suffer from where they try to animate every single arc instead of focusing on a unified 'true' route. As is customary, this results in plot that feels detached from any form of realism as Haruka spends three episodes with each girl trying to get into their pants and one episode of patting himself on the back for doing it. It isn't until the second half of disc two where Sora finally halls the balls to just try and bang her brother and, what do you know, they become sexually obsessed. In fact, they become so obsessed with one another that, even when one of the other girls walks in on them boning literally at their front door, they don't even stop. What's even less believable is that ten minutes later, no one even cares anymore. Now, I know Japan has different standards than America when it comes to certain familial relationships, but this is still totally not normal. The only girl who seems to understand this is the class president -- IE: The only one that never gets to bang Haruka in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this is a story about three unlikable, uneducated girls falling in love with an equally unlikable, uneducated protagonist. The only character that edges over that 'more than meets the eye' marker is Sora who, depending on the way you look at things, is a narcissistic weirdo with forced, plot-induced health issues. Hell, Yosuga No Sora spends literally 50% of its duration retelling the story about how Kazuha and Akira might(?) be sisters but literally none of that even matters once we pass the halfway point.\\n\\n\r\nNow, even with its many shortcomings, Yosuga No Sora is still kind of enjoyable. I mean, it's pretty much a softcore hentai series with actual downtime between sex scenes. And while that downtime is incredibly stiff (Pun not intended) and boring, it still exists. Yosuga No Sora is daring -- that I give it props for. It's a slightly less mainstream series that actually dared to animate a brother and sister getting it on, remaining true to the roots of the game. I just wish that those periods of downtime were filled with something a little more than static characters trying to figure out how to take their pants off.\\n\\n\r\nIn Summary:\\n\r\nThe only reason you want to watch this show is the incest. Don't lie to me- I know you. I am you. Fortunately, I bit the bullet for everyone and can safely say that you only need to watch the last four episodes of this series to get what you came for. Everything before that point is just a forced reiteration of the nonsensical romance you've already seen in the many harems before this. The only bonus is that Yosuga No Sora has a load of fanservice and actual softcore sex scenes. The downside is that 75% of those sex scenes would be exactly the same if Haruka was boning a body pillow.",

Personal opinion of this is one of those \"Dating Sim\" games turned into an anime.\r\nAtleast that is my overall opinion on this, its not horrible, and its not perfect, but in its own respect i still find it entertaining even with the riske scenes that have been shown thusfar.

I always say that i natural rebuke the idea that i enjoy any of that stuff. However, there is plenty of plot to this so don't worry.\r\nAsa matter of fact, the first few episodes felt like a clean show, and the plot was not exactly predictable and actually interesting. Yet, as time went on the focus seemed to gradual shift from a real storyline to one revolving around who Haruka is having intercourse with. Yes, while the first two arcs try to please you with twists as he tries to solve the girls family issues, all of a sudden they turn to having other characters walk in on him at bad moments. While at first it was somewhat hilarious to just go to the forums and say along with everyone else, \"lol things just hit the fan / did you see that?\" in hindsight the entertainment detracted from my impression of the story. \\n\\n\r\nNeither did this help me with the impression of his character. Despite they use an omnibus format, welcome the new age of romance anime, it affected me to the extent i could not like the main character. Did he do anything wrong? No, but seeing hentei service with each girl every arc did not mix well in my head even if there was a reset button hit, and at times he can be somewhat fustrating as well. The rest of the cast isn't that bad, at least they are not really one dimensional. They do get a lot of development within their respective arcs, and all except one are likable as well. \\n\\n\r\nIn sum, i think what makes people see this as anything more than average is due to its inappropriate content being aired on TV as an official anime. There is also the group of others all for the incest. For me, i will say i gave in partially to both of those, but otherwise the story nor characters were nothing truly special.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is a Bishoujo Game based anime that follows the story of a boy named Haruka Kasugano and his sister Sora. Not to mention a number of other bodacious female characters. Bodacious. The anime starts off with Haruka and Sora moving back to their old home out in the boonies after the death of their parents. Upon returning, Haruka is greeted by the previously stated bodacious ladies, who are all more than over-joyed to see him again.\r\nCharacters present a cast of more than nine people, each with their own back-story, personality and infatuation with Haruka. The characters are, without a doubt, one ofthe anime's strongest qualities. While some, at first may seem over done in the genre, they later show a depth that stretches through a couple episodes. This depth, however, while it does slow the pace a little, doesn't much impede the show's entertainment value. Jokes are often presented in the form of the most heart-warming crap I've seen in a while. Sora also cracks the occasional smart-allac line that will, no doubt, get you to fall in love with her. Unfortunately she's got a thing for -\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is also some of the best I've seen. Characters, backgrounds and animations are detailed terrifically and you'll often find yourself getting aroused by just the scenery. I know I did. Speaking of arousal, this show is anything but for children. While suggestive themes don't lurk around every corner (Kiss x Sis), the show makes it crystal clear that its target demographic is for those who know to never do it in public. Well, maybe in church, if you're careful. But rest assured, this is probably the main reason you'll be coming back for more of Yosuga No Sora, and I sure as hell don't blame you.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime's story is arc-based, like the game. Each girl in the show has her own arc with Haruka and a few episodes to go along with it. How it works is is sort of like a Tarantino film. You'll see a girl give \"it\" up to Haruka, and then there'll be a time warp type-o-thing in the next episode where the next arc will start. The first time it happens, you may ask yourself, \"Wait... What just happened?\" but you'll quickly get used to it. And when the final arc comes, you'll be glad you stuck around.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you're interested in a nice anime that you can watch one handed, give Yosuga No Sora a look.",

            "content": "Ok, since this anime has only about 4 more episode to go,so,I thought, I write my review for this anime. So, the following are in order:\r\nStory- some say that the plot of this anime  is \"CLICHE,\" I say, cliche or not, it's good, so at first I thought that something will happen between Sora and Haru on the 2nd (or is that the 3rd?) episode when Sora strips in front of Haru in her lingerie . I guess for the author to put something unexpected kinda makes it interesting to watch from beginning to end. For one thing,  every episode has a extrashort episode that appears  after the main episode, which includes Nogisaka Motoka in a starring role and her naughty adventures with Haru . Another thing about it is that this anime is too hardcore to be classified as encchi but to subtle to be tag as hentai, this is probably the only anime which can be call  a \"SOFT PORN\" which is a kind of erotic thing that has some nudity in it with a soft kind of banging.  \\n\\n\r\nArt- No comment on the art, but I do wonder as to why the two main characters ( Sora and Haru) of this anime sports white hair which should only be for old folks.\\n\\n\r\nSounds- Generally speaking, \"NOT BAD!\" But, if you're referring to the opening theme - I'd say it's fair 6.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-  I like the way the characters were drawn, but, I have some reservations about the front external anatomy (boobs) of the female characters particularly those who are still in their early teens who happen to have big boobies.......and, I'm referring to Migiwa Kozuha and Yorihime Nao - I mean, aren't they too young to have big boobs? Then again, since the anime has an encchi tag in it and if it makes it good, then who cares? So, I give it fair number 6.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Let's see.................................... The drama side really touches my emotional side, but the scene were Haru is banging the girls adds some spice in it, and the way I look at it , well, I think is safe to say that Sora will be his - what you called it...  \"FRENCH LES RESISTANCE.\" But I could be wrong since like I said there are 4 more episodes to go. So, a good rating number 8 is in order. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - Ok so it's enjoyable so an 8 will be ok.\\n\\n\r\nTrivia: Casanova, the famous European womanizer was said to use sheep's intestine (usually the tip end is tied with a knot), whenever he goes on a fling with the lady.\\n\\n\r\nEarly usage of condoms can be trace back to the ancient Egyptians, it is usually either made up of sheep's skin wrap around... you know what, or sheep's intestines.",

There are lot of sex scenes and the plot speak about a taboo in our society: Incest.\r\nI can understand why some people doesn't like this anime.

It is an original way to make a love story without fall in stereotypes.\r\nThe sex scenes aren't useless and they're coherent with the story.\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nThe chara-design is beautiful even if it is not very original.

            "content": "\"Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone\" Is a twelve episode long anime, but do not let it fool you, it is a very good anime. \r\nBefore I start i'd like to inform the reader that this anime follows several arcs, each arc about a certain girl that pertains to the story. There are also some lewd sex scenes, and incest ideals. I worn the viewer about the arcs, because I was so confused at first.\r\nStory: (9) For \"Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone\" to have so many arcs, one would not think much of a story wouldevolve. Also, with their being lewd scenes one might think it is a simple ecchi, and if one did, they would be mistaken. All of the arcs play a special part in showing the viewer more back-story to the main characters old life, and old relationships. Overall, the story (or storys) are very interesting and very vibrant. I highly recommend watching the anime one arc at a time and stretching it out.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (9) Everything was very detailed and the aspect of nature was absolutely amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8) Very detailed sounds of nature along with wonderful music, highly enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (9) The characters in this story were detailed extremely and each had their own unique romance with the main protagonist. Not only did they have relationship issues, but family/friend issues from the past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (9) This anime is good for anyone not wanted to get bored with a long drawn out series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, \"Yosuga no Sora: In Solitude, Where We Are Least Alone\" was a wonderful anime that ended well and left a good feeling with every arc.\\n\\n\r\nIf you have already watched this series then you should try \"Amagami SS\". It has the same multiple arc plot setting. \\n\\n\r\nAll that is expressed in this review is my opinions and not a thing more. If you enjoyed it please hit the \"Helpful\" button.  -Thanks.",

Given that I didn't really expect a good story to really come from it I, just picked it up out of boredom, I'm seriously surprised regardless of the ridiculous amount of sex scenes which don't really bother me thoughin this case I feel they really add to the story in terms of telling you how the MC feels. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of that it somehow managed to tell a pretty sweet/cutesy type story despite involving so much sex which I don't even know how it managed that to be honest but I seriously hope there are other anime out there like that, that have the same affect (which btw if you're reading this recommend me some). \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I give way too high reviews for anything so this isn't really a review from a critic so to speak just someone expressing how much they enjoyed. That said, I personally think it's worth the watch it's most definitely not a masterpiece in my books but It's just a nice little story that isn't too sad/happy or anything but it manages to tell a pretty profound story that touches yo heart :').",

            "content": "What a ride, really don't know how to start this review, I haven't played the game in which this anime was adapted from but there are clear arcs to this, 4 to be exact, each arcs goes through a specific storyline in terms of the main character interaction with a particular female (the last being the MOST interesting and intriguing) \r\nThe first three episodes seems pretty lacking  in terms of any significant drama, but goes through nicely each personality traits and background for the females that Haru (the main guy in all this) meets and interacts with.\r\neach arc you get through your typical genericinteraction as one would expect between your standard boy and girl and school relationships and Haru efforts to solve issues that arise as they come or existing issues that's been lingering, its done well, and as you go from one arc to the next, the arcs themselves become more interesting, more complex in terms of morality, character interactions and ultimately more gripping ... which had me laughing in the final one as it really let itself take a huge but possible realistic risk.\\n\r\nI'm going to analyse the last arc as this is the most interesting, through out the whole anime from the first arc to the third arc you are always given a sense of something else in the background, and this sense is the twin sister of Haru aka Sora who is a recluse like character with a personality similar to Asuka soryou from evangelion, her intense infatuation towards her brother, and you feel if Haru wanted he could easily have gone towards her as the signs where present early on ... but alas he never delve in those feelings for too long and in one way or another kept with the other female in the story BUT in the final arc we get it ... the possible moment where he feels something for his sister ... \\n\r\nthe interesting thing is how this feeling effects his current relationship he has with another his childhood love aka Nao, and also the change in relationship between normal siblings to lovers is viewed by others and also changes in the household itself where sibling interaction change to lovers ... THIS is amazing folks ... sora clearly does not care what others think but haru is more open minded and clearly had a feeling of a moral dilemma ... you can clearly see tricks saru is pulling on haru to try and get him closer to her ... on top of haru past and current feeling just being multiplied by her infatuation towards him as you will see in the final arc as he tries but fails to change his feelings ... \\n\r\nthis Is not for kids clearly, and for adults who view it the amazing bits are where you get this oddity in society, where siblings are being lovers, how this affects the relationship of the siblings themselves and what excuses they are trying to bring up to explain to others their own closeness which fails miserably and comically of course ... clearly a lack of parents is a factor, time spend apart and sora illness herself making her almost a needy character and she shows this clearly how much she needs Haru and how much she wants to do for him ... I can go on but go ahead and watch the last three episodes alone is worth it ...\\n\r\np.s. why did I give it an overall 7 out of ten ... well the first three arcs where kind of generic and nothing I haven't seen done before but it was done well, also we don't get as much depth as one would usually get in these kind of romantic scenarios in terms of character development, I would have liked to see more comedic encounters with Ryouhei and the gang to feel a little closer or delve more on how they know each other. The issues that happened in the first three arcs where not anything mind blowing or anything you would care for to much, a lost pendant that was from your mom or relationship with your dad and step sister or past relationship and encounters ... nothing really mind blowing ... Apart for the last arc!! yes I will say it again that was mind blowing and yes it was awkward and uncomfortable and so real and intense ... I only wished they cut out the other arcs and only put this one and make this arc play out longer because lets be honest ... if your heart isn't racing due to the taboo and everything that goes with it ... with everyone else, your family, neighbour, friends and so on involved ... then really life will get boring quick ... and watching others do stupid stuff like this is very entertaining for myself ...\\n",

Any time I hear some of the songs play, it makes me want to cry. \r\nEven though it seems I have only good things to say, I wouldn't recommend this for a lot of people. It contains A LOT of sexual content, and *Spoils* contains incest. A lot of people are really bothered by this subject, and it ruins the entire experience for them,but if you're like me, and you aren't really phased by much, I really do recommend this anime.

Don't hesitate to take some time and give this show a shot. At the end, you'll realize that its worth it. Make sure to thank me later when you realized  I was right the minute you finished watching this anime. \r\n        \"Yosuga no Sora\" has a deep storyline that has tons of twists of your leastexpectations. If you put all the nudity and half hentai scenes to the side, you get to feel and strongly react to self situations that each character faces, which connects to events that happen later throughout the series. Haruka Kasugano faces REALLY tough decisions that puts him in a VERY confusing spot that leads him to no answers, which is something he disparately needs in his current life situation. But he's also a cheerful, determined, helpful, kind-hearted, hardcore, and infact, a somewhat guilty/innocent type of guy living the high school life, unaware of what is yet to come and finding the answer to overcome it. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this show to anybody who's mature enough to ignore the half hentai parts, and really just have an open mind to whats happening in a character's life. If you choose to watch this show, then keep one thing in mind......assuming is not the best kind of thinking when it comes down to this school life type, romantic anime. Think ahead about what might happen the opposite way! Other than that, I hope you enjoy the show the same way I did.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                                                                                   ~ObitosSharingan Out!~",

            "content": "To me atleast, it seems that Yosuga no Sora is trying too hard to look serious. Art and music compliment eachother well to give off a more weighty tone. But it's all ruined by a few things. One is that the anime has a lot of stupid sex scenes. I'm not saying that sex scenes alltogether are bad but the way they were handeled in this anime really ruined it for me. Really makes the unhumorous atmosphere feel much more awkward when every sex scene is a guy with his clothes on fucking every girl without any clothes in the same way he fucked othergirls.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing that ruined this anime was the idea to make a different plot for each girl. The characters felt kind of one dimentional and boring and didn't really deserve to have a story for each one of them. The only way I see this kind of plot working out is if it had more episodes than 12. Then each character for their own plot would get more episodes focused on them, thus making them way more intresting and enjoyeble. But since this is a 12 episode series, they really just needed to focus on one of them.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the incest part.. \"raises the questions of morality and social acceptance\"... Yeah, no. Smearing some taboo sex on screen doesn't really ask any questions. In reality it's just some controversial imagery for shock value. Maybe the author's intent was to break the incest taboo but it never worked because they spent too much time making the artstyle, music and atmosphere serious that they forgot to make the story serious.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime really just reminds me of a weaker attempt to be Koi Kaze. It wants to be serious, it wants to have a thoughtful atmosphere, but it doesn't write itself as genuinely. I still think you can watch it though. It does have good music and art going on. And if you enjoy sex in anime, then this will be a nice extra.",

            "content": "This review may contain SOME SPOILERS, mostly regarding the general theme of the story(s), avoid if a 100% blind viewing experience is desired.\r\nHowever, if you're like me and many others, who have stumbled upon this anime based on recommendations, comments from other ecchi/harem anime, or the reputation Yosuga no Sora has garnered...\r\nYou would know that this anime is brought up often when it comes to the topic of incest in anime, and usually in a negative light. Like many others before me, having sat through this anime has prompted me to try and dispel some of these views of what turned out to be avery underrated piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nPreface: I was led to Yosuga no Sora via comments after being terribly disappointed by OreImo. I was fully aware that incest was expected to happen at some point in the story. However...\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nAs soon as the opening, \"Hiyoku no Hane\", hit, the mood was instantly set. The title of this anime is epitomized very well in the OP. It represents the setting very well - a rural town tucked away in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but blue sky and open spaces. The distant and isolated feel I got from listening to the OP led me to believe that anything could indeed happen.\\n\\n\r\n\"Tsunagukizuna\", the ED, is similar, but with a little bit of a foreboding vibe to it - especially with the images of their past. Personally, it helped build up the last arc for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe background music, while not being a very diverse selection, complements the setting appropriately when it is played, particularly that one signature piano piece.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a separate ED for the omake at the end of each episode, which helps lighten the mood a little by providing a bit of contrast - as the anime is meant to have ecchi and harem elements as well.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora aired in 2010, which, admittedly, does make it fairly dated. As such, some of its art did suffer. Specifically, the character art. Being used to current standards, especially in terms of romance and harem genres, where the characters are drawn to be as attractive as possible, I found the girls a little underwhelming. Additionally, the combination of most of them being almost too busty, and the nudity involved, almost turned me off finishing this anime during the first arc. In fact, I found Sora and Akira the most visually appealing; the more mature girls like Nao, not so much.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art is another story, however. The animators' depiction of rural Japan is exceptional. The beautifully drawn backdrop of the sky, clouds and distant mountains drew me in. It had a particularly bigger impact on me, who wasn't used to such sights. It felt like I was watching events unfold in a 1940s town except with modern fittings like cellphones.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora plays out like the visual novel it's based on. The story revolves around 4 girls (5 if you count the omake side story), each getting their separate routes. While the endings vary as expected of the VN style, certain characters share the same backstory sequence, allowing for a little bit of build-up and continuity. Each arc has its own drama and feel-good moments, and of course, the sex scenes, which I felt were tasteful enough as they didn't have an overbearing effect on the overall presentation. In other words, the scenes weren't shamelessly thrown in for the sake of ecchi purposes - they had their place.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the main attraction is Sora's arc. When it comes to discussing Yosuga no Sora, this is the arc draws the most critique - it receives both praise and heat, stemming from its incestuous theme. Fortunately, it was the manner in which they decided to have the story play out - it won me over with how impressively they handled such a taboo subject. There is no joking around in Yosuga no Sora; the tone to which their sibling relationship was portrayed is to be commended, as what followed was a heartwarming story, though a tad short, that resonated with me as being a well thought out counterpart to the other imouto series I had previously seen. As a result, this was a very memorable anime for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nIn order to create a satisfying harem route, as a rule of thumb of mine, the development of their relationship (aka romance) has be explored adequately. No matter how likeable/unlikeable the characters are, at the very least, as long as their reasons of attraction towards the protagonist are thoroughly answered and within reason, I have no choice but to accept it. Yosuga no Sora scores full marks in this respect - no Zero no Tsukaima vibes here. Each girl had sufficient qualities for me to never feel like the protagonist ever made a wrong decision no matter who he ended up with. As for the protagonist himself, while he usually didn't get much time to showcase it, he had enough personality and development in each of the arcs to warrant him deserving of the endings he got.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus also did their jobs well. No complaints here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nThe fact that my thoughts of this anime have been nagging me over the few weeks since I'd watched it to come back to try to write a review for it should be proof enough. The OST is now one of my favourites. The ending left me contemplating in silence for a while. Even the omakes got a fair few laughs out of me.\\n\\n\r\nIn spite of the character art bothering me a little, and one of the arcs not being all that interesting in my opinion, there was more than enough of everything else to keep me going.\\n\\n\r\nAs implied before, most of my attention was fixated on watching Sora's story unravel - her deep love for her brother spiraling into lust, and the pair finally coming to terms with it. The art, the music, the setting - everything comes together in the end to create an incest story that is believable. Because of what they've endured - the loss of their parents, because of the fact that Haruka is essentially Sora's replacement for them, because they've had to move to such a place, where it's possible for them to dare to explore their relationship past the point of what is morally accepted...\\n\\n\r\nThey essentially only have each other (this is where I felt the isolated, rural town played very well into the circumstances) - and while I did not come to conclusions as enlightening as others have described - it did lead me to heavily sympathise with Sora's plight. Her brother obviously cares deeply for her. If her affection for her brother was that strong, even to the point where it is shown to be almost justifiable, was it possible to condemn her for having such feelings? That was where the level of the anime's execution was fully realised for me. That was the true pay-off that I came to enjoy. Had this review only been about Sora's arc, I would've rated Yosuga no Sora a 9 easily.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nAs someone that was curious enough to delve into such a topic (face it, fair amount of incest anime/eroge out there), I greatly appreciated Yosuga no Sora's take on what is either considered taboo or disappointingly treated as a subject of ridicule among anime fans. In my mind, this anime definitely stands out among its peers with a story that succeeded where many others have failed.\\n\\n\r\nNot a bad experience by any means.",

Some of the themes in it are probably uncomfortable for a lot of people and so I understand why a lot of people would dislike it. However I feel the show's strong point is making you consider your own beliefs on controversial themes, the Sora arc definitely doesn't come as a shock after watching the first few episodes. The topic of incest is really controversial because no one can clearly state on a case by case incident what the right answer is, because of this it's really interesting to see how theother characters react to this and how the twins react to it themselves.\\n\\n\r\nObviously the incest section is only the final part of the show and the rest of the anime has some really good character and well-placed drama so if you wished you could just skip the Sora arc and still enjoy the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed it because it gives you a chance to see things through a different perspective and how different things can look in different circumstances. Overall I give the show a strong 7/10",

            "content": "Yosuga no sora is the classic anime that people watch in \"ignorance\" where everyone wants to speak ill of only one thing, but they can not speak problems that justify their notes, sometimes they just say that the ecchi is exaggerated and everything is an excuse for ecchi, but have monogatari in favorites or like the same, is not strange and even a level of \"hypocrisy\"? But that is not the case, what I want to say is the affection I have for the same.\r\nYosuga no sora, adaptation of a visual novel of the same, are based on routes (that is, which protagonist has aromance with each girl in one of them), which is very well executed and shows essence of the games of the famous routes \"you must make such a route first to play the other, \"you see this when the first route adds information to the first, second, and last (and vice versa), which has not been done just like certain games -Fate- that only do it to make a profit.\\n\r\nFollowing the story of Haru, Sora's brother gem, we see the circumstances and memories that make him fall in love with each of the girls, along with some social criticism and philosophy\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack is concerned, the anime stands out a lot, it makes you feel what it is to feel (not excitement), add a lot to the drama and gives you a certain void in some scenes (this is subjective)\\n\r\nThere is nothing to complain about, it is very well animated, obviously for a slice of Life anime and romance with \"nothing\" supernatural, and scenarios represent the \"city of the road\" very well. In summary the anime is very good visually, enjoying very well of its color palette what it attributes in the drama.\\n\r\nHistoria de Yosuga no sora is very plausible, which is very important in my judgment, showing the reasons or actions for which he would fall in love with each girl there, and not forcing a feeling in each of them or anything of the genre, The story of the two of them throughout the anime is very beautiful, and you can feel so close to her, it's simply incredible beyond the anime to have shown that the relationship that even being forbidden by society, when the subject is morality, they did what most of us would do, flee, even if it left an existential void in them.\\n\r\nDirection did a great job on this anime, it may even be simplistic and so on, but they did their best to make the anime the best it could.\\n\r\nCharacters had little screen time and the anime also did not claim their development, being the anime more \"focused\" between Haru and Sora, obviously not forgetting the cast in which it is very easy to sympathize with you to know them a little more each time.\\n\r\nIn summary is a fantastic anime that does not deserve the one that the staff gives and without having reasons yet, criticizing the incest of yosuga no sora is not an option since it is one of the best that have ever been made. Ecchi of yosuga no sora is neither defect nor anything, they have their importance and adds in the plot.\\n",

            "content": "\"Why there is so much hate?\"\r\nRainy day is the best time for writing review. There is no doubt. Since I like romance animes I'm going to make review of Yosuga no Sora - anime which has mixed feelings. Some people hates that anime because of explict sex and mostly for incest. Others are sure that is good romance.\r\nI'm of the opinion that Yosuga no Sora is one of the most tragic anime. In this review I'll try to tell you about mine theory. Stay tuned!\r\n\"The days that never come\"\r\nFirst of all, main characters are alone. They don't have parents, becuse they died in a accident.\r\nThissentence speaks by itself. No one would live with awareness that we're alone without parents.\\n\r\nBut Haruka and Sora Kasugano have to live on their own. It's hard and sad even for us. In the most of cases uncle and aunt of children would got them in their house, but not in this case. The sibling must live at their own for a long time. That situation can make weird feeling with each other, but about it in the next paragaph.\\n\\n\r\n\"Kiss me Oniisan!\"\\n\r\nThere is landmark in that anime. Everything begin when Sora is in hospital. She played with her brother, when suddenly something were going to fall at Sora's head. Fortunately Haruka rescued his sister and kissed her unconsciously. That moment has stayed in Sora's mind, even now when they're alone. She knows that only person who can help her is Haruka, so it leads to weird and heartbreaking moments. Her jealousy of her brother make difficult for Haruka to find a girlfriend.\\n\r\nAt the begining everything is OK, but in the second part of plot things are complicated.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost every girl that wanted to be with Haruka had problem in their life. For example Kazuha Migiwa has problem with her father, Akira Amatsume with her mother. Haruka as he is helpful man try to solve their problem and he gets their love as the award. But in every case their relationship is destroyed because of Sora. We can't blame only Sora, because if only Haruka didn't kissed Sora it wouldn't be any trouble. But what happened is done.\\n\\n\r\n\"Affair on the side\" \\n\r\nI hope that my theory is simple for us. I'm going to tell about soundtrack and graphic design.\\n\r\nI must say that I almost cried on openning and it doesn't happen very often. This make that anime more tragic than I thought it would be. Graphic design is nice, colors are bearable. Characters are the most tragic characters that I've ever seen. Group of teenagers try to help the sibling, but it's hard to do it when younger sister is jealous about her brother. They are making that anime more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIn a nutshell Yosuga no Sora is tragic anime and I said about it in two paragraphs and a little more on the last paragraph. I hope that I won't have to say more about it, but If you want to know more, just write a comment under this review or on my site. We can discuss ^^\\n\\n\r\nAlmost cried at the beginning and end\\n\r\nWatashizashi",

            "content": "I wanted to review this show after realizing that I've been thinking about this show for days after I finished watching it. So let me start off by saying this, you should watch this anime. \r\nI'll try to keep things short, so I won't give a synopsis but I will give you some non-spoiler info that can help you decide whether or not to watch it. \r\nFirst, it's not really a Harem show. To me, a Harem show is when more then two girls chase after the same guy, and the interactions that follow. A love story about a bunch of girls, often but notalways, fighting over one guy. This show, because of timeline non-sense, never has that dynamic. It's not a single love story about four girls and one guy, it's four love stories featuring four relationships that just so happen to share a character. \\n\\n\r\nThat doesn't end up mattering though, as the love stories are awesome. They are well thought out, intense, and sexy. It's a bit of an emotional roller coaster. Each \"arc\" is capped off with a really well done sex scene that doesn't feel gratuitous, but rather shows the intensity of the relationship we followed. To those of you who are dumb enough to call this porn, I have nothing to say. You must have fast forwarded through 95% of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I want you to take away from this review is, this show is a romance anime with a semi-serious tone. When it's Echii, it doesn't hold back, but it rarely feels like fan-service. You can stop here if you don't want to be informed of a minor (and super obvious) spoiler.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the subject matter, especially near the end, is pretty controversial. They actually try and tackle what would happen in an incestuous relationship. I know that's not too rare in anime, but in this case they take it seriously. What would you do if your younger sister loved you? What if you noticed your best friend and his/her sibling getting too close. How would you react? What advice would you give if you caught them? It's worth a watch, for real.",

            "content": "Before we proceed to the review I want to point out 3 important things:\r\n1) This show does have mild(uncensored) sex scenes\r\n2) This show does have incest\r\n3) This show is in omnibus format\r\nIf you can not handle or approach either of those 3 points mentally than I suggest you turn around now because you will be questioning the show and your motives for not turning off said show quite a few times.\r\nStory Arc Lineup per girl(no spoilers):\r\nEp 1: No girl it's just basic introduction/setup\r\nEp 2: The first half of the episode will be used as the reset point for two story arcs and the last halfof that episode will be used as the reset point for the other two story arcs\\n\r\nEp 3-4: Girl 1\\n\r\nEp 5-6: Girl 2\\n\r\nEp 7-9: Girl 3\\n\r\nEp 10-12: Girl 4\\n\\n\r\nReview:\\n\r\nAll four story arcs are really short, the first two arcs are only two episodes each and the last two arcs are three episodes a piece so it felt like a whirlwind romance. The sex scenes are soft-core hentai and I like many of you was afraid that I would wind up regretting wasting my time watching this show instead of an actual hentai but in the end I found that the sex scenes really melded well and helped the story overall, with the exception of one story arc were it really diminished the emotion of the story at the end. So for all you guys out there just ignore the hard on because the romance and the story are actually worth it. The first story arc's plot was relatively cliche and uninteresting. The second arc's plot was interesting but because it was only 2 episodes long it felt very rushed which made it feel not that much more different than the first arc. The third arc was much better, one of the main themes that lingers is molestation and even though the issue was dealt in a predictable manner, also the hostility and negativity that the main love interest faces is very refreshing to see in an anime. The fourth arc is definitely the most interesting, it addresses a few very delicate and ugly ideas but I loved it. Half way through the arc the male protagonist goes through a shocking realization and the way he finds out made me shudder a little mentally. One thing I will note here is that the amount of sex scenes increases per story arc but in my opinion the scenes don't hinder the story and kind of really makes the last arc feel very sinful thus helping the viewer to better understand the apprehension that characters feel in that arc. I do have one gripe and that is that during the first episode one love interest is introduced and was never given a story arc. I speculate due to the short length of the show that they just weren't able to fit her in, unfortunately they do bring her up again in the last arc in a manner that was befitting but also made me just that much saltier about her not having an arc.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to take a moment to address how I watch omnibus style anime. I find it to be more enjoyable to watch the show one story arc at a time by spacing out when I watch each story arc at least one day apart. I find that this helps me derive more meaning and emotions from each love story. I would really suggest that method of watching for this series, especially with the amount of sex scenes in this series. If you watch them back to back I have a feeling this show will feel more like a hentai than a show.\\n\\n\r\nRant:(Spoilers and explicit language used)\\n\r\nI'm really glad that this show didn't bitch out on the whole incest thing like a certain other show I know.(Looking at you Oreimo!) Also I'm so salty about Kozue not getting an arc!! I'm also kind of upset that for Nao's arc that they ended the scene with her moaning and fire works going off, because ending a show with a hard-on in my opinion is really annoying!!!",

I don't know if it's because of that beautiful OST but, i'm about to say that's sweet.\r\nEven for this \"forbidden\" relationship, it's soft. It's not likea big slap in the face and you're totally KO by what you're watching. There is much worse than this one. Of course, that's a little \"err... Ooook.\" feeling but, you're the only one who can judge by yourself.",

            "content": "(This review will only help people how are planing or have watch this anime, and is just to help them understand the format/style of this anime series.)\r\nLove and romance two words that come together and makes anime like Yosuga no Sora. Like some anime this one is based on a game which if you ask two people they ether like it or not. Personally I haven't played it yet but I am reading the manga. So lets see whats good about this anime.\r\nYosuga no Sora is not harem anime but it is ecchi. Its still on going so I will not give this series abad rating. But so far it kinda confusing because the first few episodes is about the build up/ meeting of the characters. Then after that the story flow to one of the main heroins of the story the more build up with her the sex the end. Then the next episode returns to the moment of the first build up then flows to the other heroin then they build up her romance with the main character then sex then end. (really theirs to much sex to go around.)\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\\n\r\nAt first I thought that this anime was like school life and koi kaze, but as the story goes it then reminds me like amagami ss. But the flow kinda want bad for this series. If you don't watch this carefully like me will be confused with the flow/build up moments of the series. I didn't like about this anime is that its to sex heavy yes me like sex just like the next guy. But if this is just what can be offered by this series I'd rather watch hentai instead.(you cant buy anime fans with sex!!!) \\n\\n\r\nFor those looking for anime like koi kaze,Boku wa Imouto ni Koi wo Suru, aki sora etc. I will not recommend this because of the format of the anime it self that is similar to amgami ss. Hope that this helps and see you guys next time.",

As everything else is lackluster or gives in to heinously cliche tropes of \"Refusing to accept true feelings\" and easily misinterpreted situations. But it all handles this maturely by the end and wraps up in a rather enjoyable fashion.\r\nThat being because the studio that animated it didn't trysome cop-out shenanigans and subdue or change the ending. They kept it true, and it's done rather well. They say the ending makes the series worth while, and in this case, depending on your personal tolerances, can leave you happy or incredibly butthurt because your OTP in a 12-episode anime was crushed by the anime's reality.",

This series had a lot of potential and if they could properly use that potential then anime could have been one of my favourites.\r\nWell for starters Yosuga no Sora is not your typical anime as it follows and arc pattern in which the main protagonist ends up with every girl which is pretty common in visual novels. For me it was good because it actually tells you about every characters and their back story and yosuga no sora does it pretty  well but notperfectly as there are many plot holes in it. For the Animation it was good enough but the sound was amazing and has one of my favourite sound track of all time. At last i think that it was a pretty good anime and you should watch it just ignore the incest part.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is not all that it seems. I'm not saying that it's bad; it's just not all that it seems and that is the best I can describe it.\r\nAt first glance, it's slightly appealing because some of us out there like the incest stories. Immediately, we're ready to see how the main character and his sister develop an intimate relationship. Here's the catch, though: this anime adaptation goes along the lines of the \"arc\" or \"route\" structure. It's good and bad, enjoyment wise. My rating for story, a 7, goes for the final arc.\r\nI believe in this adaptation, the arc structure is placedso that we can get to know the characters. In the end, all of the characters have some significance. You can skip to the end if you really want to, but otherwise, Yosuga no Sora would have been an OVA.\\n\\n\r\nNow, we move on to the general atmosphere of the show. It will involve humor, melodramatic subplots, and soft-core hentai scenes which will leave you stunned in surprise at times because of how they fit in the subplots/plot. Not all people can bear with the subplot content so they drop it altogether. The branching routes are hardly memorable, especially when focusing on the latter parts of the series and eventually, the goal of the entire adaptation: the incest. And with this show, the production staff did not hold back on the taboo nor the intimacy. Keep that in mind as you watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the art represents the show quite well. A pair of siblings that lost their parents and have to move out to a town they vaguely remember. It's one of those realistic yet colorful types of anime art. It reflects the seriousness and also the lighter parts. The images are sharp enough for me and create a good ambiance.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is the same as the art -- highly representative of the story when the situation calls for it. The opening is fitting for the seriousness and the ending sequence is fitting for the lighter side of Yosuga no Sora.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Yosuga no Sora is a good anime if you want to see a bluntly put incestuous relationship but at the same time build anticipation for it by watching arcs. If you're looking for light humor in it also, it's there and once again -- be aware that most of this is the arc structure!",

There's really not enough time for any proper build up or development. Frankly I'd recommend just waiting for the VN to get translated and playing that or doing so right now if you can read runic. I also think they should've just adapted Sora's route cause I feel that would've made for the best drama. Overall, it's just overly sentimental tripe. It's not even written very well. It's basically just a poorly done harem anime with sex. If youwant sex scenes, this show has you covered, otherwise I wouldn't bother. Those scenes are basically the only highlight of the series. Frankly I enjoyed the dumb little gag extras with the paedophile maid more than the main show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an actually good incest anime, watch Koi Kaze. That is how you do drama right.

            "content": "Would it be bad to say that I was introduced to this anime from my friend who thought it was some hentai? No? Oh good. Yosuga no Sora depicts of a set of Fraternal twins moving into their old childhood hang out in the summer. Hidden pasts, family issues, oh and above all, incest. If you were turned down from any of these words, pklease step away.\r\nThe way this story unfolds is as if it was an H game. Oh wait, it is an H game. Yosuga no Sora was originally an H game released back in December 2008.\r\nNow, the story is told in arcs,like the anime and if you didn't wiki search the episode guide, you would probably be lost because at the end of each arc (noted with a black scene saying fin) it goes back to the events after episode 1, ignoring what has happened in the past arc. This type of story telling has its ups and downs. Its good that you can just watch the first episode and skip to the episode of your favorite girl without worry but this causes a lot of confusion and a few key scenes won't be understood if you haven't  seen the last arc.\\n\r\nThe bonus segments after each episode are focus more on humor and are less serious.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation, as you can tell, looks nothing like the animation from the game. So if you're watching this because you liked the cover art for the game, you will be in for some disappointment.\\n\r\nAs for the animation, it seems choppy and sometimes even lazy. A few scenes look as if the characters are dead and apparently no one likes to wear a different cloth style except the ones they've worn since episode 1. Its a bumpy road from wear some scenes seem top notch where others fall flat on their face.'\\n\r\nWhat really will make your eyes orgasm is how detailed the scenery is. The trees look fantastic and the water looks as if you could drink it. But now and then trees will look horridly grainy and the water will look like pudding.\\n\r\nThe bonus segments are animated in a chibi-ish manor and is very cute.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast for Yosuga no Sora is quite a handful.\\n\r\nOur main male protagonist is Kasugana Haruka. Out of most male protagonists from other anime, he seems to get the ladies too easy and does it without effort. He has little depth for being the lead and his personality doesn't back him up for it. One thing to touch on him is that most of his interations with the girls in a serious scene are just down weird and comepltely random.\\n\r\nThe main heroine of the anime is Kasugano Sora. Her personality is very tsun, like most heroines out there. She gives off a childish personality and goes through the most character change throughout the anime.\\n\r\nThe other handful of the heroines are really plain and very similiar in character build up. They all have similar personalities with differences here and there, and all their problems are solved through the same means as the last. The only reason to watch their arcs, excluding Soras's, would be for their looks. for the hentai scene, or out of boredom.\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are probably the most unimportant characters you'll see. They will interact with the main cast on few occasions and then disappear for about 2 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very melancholic soothing. Enfonius does a great job for the opening and Iwanami Yoshikazu's background music could make you fall asleep. A sad note would be that the same melody for the music is that it repeats the melody a lot and just changes the tempo and instruments. It seems lazy but it works to some degree.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment of this anime comes through repetition. Each arc consists of Haruka's interactions between the the chosen girl and the arcs seem to follow the same path. Sora's arc differs alittle only because a girl from a past arc is third wheeling Haruka's romance and that its pure incest. This arc also has the most episodes containing 5 where others contain about 3 to 4.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime is mediocre. Theres better anime like this out there and they won't make you feel dirty after watching it. If your curious about this anime then go ahead and watch it because from my view Sora's arc was actually pretty good. Because for an anime that borders hentai it was fairly decent.",

Haha, pretty sick, but Haru's character made it seem ok.\r\nThe story revolves mainly around Haru who has relationships with different girls told in different versions of the story. Althoug I didn't get the part why the plot had to be told that way, I liked how Haru's character turned out. \r\nThe animation, the colors and the way the anime was drawn fit my kind of anime. The music was played nicely too. \r\nDefinitely a goodwatch. :)",

All I can say, without giving much away, is that Iam deeply impressed with the message being portrayed in the episodes, and that I felt a myriad of emotions, including sadness, happiness, and comfort. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough one may think this is just an under-developed series of hentai scenes, the story and message portrayed are simply beautiful, and I appreciate every aspect of this anime's construct.

I generally love the sound tracks to most anime, and I still like to listen to the OP music... too bad it only carries as much weight as the art lol\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10\\n\r\nFor the most part, just shallow... I guess the whole Hentai theme kinda makes it that way... Amatsume Akira was my favorite, probably because I found her most attractive in attitude... she was least depressing and most upbeat ... Haruka and Sora both tie for least favorite... I know they are probably out there, and sometimes the idea is entertaining in other anime... but theres no way I can take a *serious* incestual relationship seriously... I just cant imagine it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6/10\\n\r\n6 is pretty low for me... it wasnt all bad... but I feel the hentai-ness was not necessary, but I wasnt annoyed really until the Sora arc...\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5/10\\n\r\nNo more comments really... the art levels dont really count for much in this one... Pretty much I just recommend this anime if you wanna do some fapping because it seems like that was the intended audience lol",

And just to tell you the protagonist sister is also part of his harem so this has a really incest storyline... I have no comment about that as i hate incest... But, the reason why i liked this anime is because of the character development that occurs in the story and thecharacters are really nicely shown... There isn't a twist in it but it has good romance although some scenes have TOO MUCH romance.... But i warn you, there are scenes where it just makes you like HUH? DAFUQ DID I JUST SEE?...",

But i'd like to state that when i watched the first ep i was a bit shocked and lost of what his sister was thinking about. So intrigued by this i wanted to watch the next ep and i became kinda addicted to the animation and the soundtrack of yosuga no sora. And after i found something about the series that i love everything else came naturally. Yosuga no sora has quite an interesting story i might add, the only thing wrong with thestory is that it follows different paths of the game( yosuga no sora is from an eroge game i found out later and it's because the anime wants to let the audience experience all de endings that its been divided into separate arcs. I hope my review was useful this was my first review btw",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nPretty much the message of this anime is if you help out a girl who is in a big situation she will reward you with sex, like that makes any goddamn sense.\r\nThe story begins with Haruka and Sora Kasugano who have returned to their home in the countryside try to make a new life after their parents tragic accident, while trying to build a new life they encounter old and new friends that eventually make a big impact on their lives.\r\nNow this anime decides to tell it's stories in 4 different arcs with each one focusing on a different female character and howHaruka solves a situation for them that pretty much ends with him having sex with them.\\n\r\nThe first arc is about Kazuha and her relationship with Akira which eventually shows us she is actually Kazuha's secret sister and how this secret ends up changing their friendship until Haruka comes in to help the day.\\n\r\nThe second arc is about Akira and pretty much expands upon the whole secret sister situation that she had with Kazuha in the first arc except there isn't as much fighting between the two and there is more mystery instead of drama.\\n\r\nThe third arc is about Nao who used to have a complex relationship with Haruka in the past and his sister knows about this so when Nao and Haruka start dating Sora starts to resent Nao until they eventually come to an agreement with each other.\\n\r\nThe final arc is pretty much to me the incest arc as it concentrates on the relationship between Haruka and Sora, but when they are discovered having sex by Nao and her friend they start having moral disagreements until they both accept that they are in love with each other and decide to move away.\\n\r\nThe fact they decided to do different arcs was interesting, but it just weirded me out how that helping a girl with a big situation ends up leading to sex just completely blew my mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were in some case quite complex as their feelings would change a lot over the course of the different arcs along with the actions and decisions they made would often make the characters think about their morals about whether it is right or not especially during the final arc considering Haruka and Sora were brother and sister and in a relationship made the others question them if this was really the right thing to do and if they really wanted this.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle was at least decent to see since the anime is set in the countryside so we did get to see some nice scenery from time to time and for some reason liked the interior of the houses for some of the characters especially Haruka and Sora's house which looked simple, but cosy to live in.\\n\\n\r\nNow of course the fanservice is very prominent here and when I watched it, it did catch me off guard because it wasn't something I was expecting, I certainly wasn't expecting Haruka to have sex with each of the girls at the end of the arcs and when I saw the harem tag I thought this was going to end up a mess, but luckily this story wasn't linked together.\\n\\n\r\nNow the romance was different for each character since they all had different personalities and different tie's to Haruka, some were old friends while others were new people it just doesn't make sense how helping a girl sort out a big situation ends up with you having sex with them although Haruka has sex with Nao and Sora before the arc even ends so yeah, but it just confused me really how just doing a task like this would end up with you getting laid, then of course is the incest stuff which is something I am not comfortable with and honestly I though Haruka and Sora had a bit of an age difference yet they are the same age which was surprising to me, but again it just felt awkward and uncomfortable seeing them have sex especially when one time was right at the door making it easy for someone to stumble onto them having intercourse which is exactly what happened and it was such a hilariously awkward moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a strange anime that really caught me off guard with the stuff that happened and I wouldn't recommend this unless you are willing to find out just how ridiculous it is.",

Quite the opposite - this is a genuine love story.\r\nNot only is it a dramatic, genuine and romantic anime that, despite its tropes of multiple women loving the main character, avoid unnecessary fanservice-based narratives quite well - but it also, despite many of the characters being pretty \"typical\", manages to involve these characters in ways where they not only show color, but develop strongly as characters.\r\nI find it displeasing when animes feature \"fanservice\" by simply creatingawkward tease-like situations and try to build a story around it. You can have 20 women marvelling over the main character, yet nothing sexual, not even a kiss, is allowed to occur naturally. \\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, this anime is a fresh breath of air and actually *does* bring characters through the *entire* process. Sex happens. Detailed, too. But not in a cheap or pornographic focus.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the anime carries you from start to finish without any major hiccups. And you could argue that many of the possible \"flaws\" are really just a choice of design and direction, as well as the desire to stay true to the nature of anime and not turn this into something it shouldn't be.\\n\\n\r\nI do miss some \"more\" content. I do miss some variation, some more action/excitement, some more indebth personal moments that don't jumpcut ahead, and distractions and travels that add to the feeling of the anime without having to be solely centered on the main characters. All in all, there could be more \"stuff going on\".\\n\\n\r\n** Slightly spoiler-like facts**\\n\\n\r\nThis anime sure acts as a very laid-out adventure, and does not leave you empty or upset at what it tries to do. It leaves you with something that most anime simply don't fease; the denied and overlooked possibility of combining a conclusive-enough ending, with the excitement and curiosity for the future.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, not only was the story believable and exciting enough, but the ending was just outright good, in a way that makes you go \"Finally! An ending that isn't stupid.\"\\n\\n\r\nCould I improve the ending? Yes. But it depends on whether I *want* to go in that direction. And thus, is it really a needed improvement, or simply just a roadblock for a possible future that could be differently interesting in a followup season? Who knows..\\n\\n\r\nAs of my 2017 edit of this review, this is one of my highest rated anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're wondering what to watch next, but might like a juicy anime with honest and fulfilling romance, and perhaps a little bit of taboo, this might be for you.",

            "content": "When I watched this anime I was struck by how much the plot resembles a dating simulator. I did not find the plot profound like some reviewers here, though it was cute and at times very well done for a short anime. \r\nHere is what I felt made the show unique: \r\nIt is a harem anime but unlike I lot of them the main character is not two-timing any girls and he actually picks one for each arc. You will see 4 (technically 5 in the chibi skits at the end) girls get pursued by Haruka and each only one at a time. You getto learn about each girl and the pattern is that Haruka is kind and helps them overcome some problem or trauma and after that they get into a relationship and have sex. \\n\\n\r\nThat's basically the plot and though on occasion the sex seems to accentuate the story a bit (like Akira) it felt a bit out of place and rushed and more for fanservice. The one case where the sex affects the story a LOT is in the last two arcs where Haruka starts to realize he is attracted to his sister--more on that later. \\n\\n\r\nThe situations each girl is in and some of the problems he helps them through are unique and some of them, like akira, I found particularly heart-touching. After coming to the conclusion of each arc with each girl it appears to reset to a sort of \"save point\" in the story prior giving Haruka a chance to make a different choice and learn about a different girl. This is why I said it resembles a dating simulator animated. I thought this was rather clever and enjoyed it more then the typical harem style. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThere isn't a lot of character development because there isn't a lot of episodes devoted to each girl but I was satisfied with the way I got to learn about each person and watch them both change as they interacted with Haruka. They originally, as is often the case, start as somewhat cliched character stereotypes but you get to see them be developed more and feel a greater depth behind each character then is often the case, especially in short anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very pretty. I found the style very appealing and the music choices accentuated the animation well. I watched subtitled so I can't say much about the voice-actors not speaking native Japanese myself. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSo...on the incest: \\n\r\nThe last girl is Haruka's sister Sora, as pretty much everyone should know from any review on here. \\n\r\nIt was an interesting final story that added some dimension to them but, unlike a lot of viewers I didn't find it particularly profound and it made me more worried for them. A lot of viewers loved the idea of forbidden love and said this anime was great for raising questions and challenging society. I tend to think they are wrong, but not because society says so. There are some really good reasons why I didn't think the anime developed this as well as they could have. Just raising a touchy subject and simplifying it doesn't make the anime \"great\". (my thoughts here will be long so skip if you want)\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is trying to make the viewer think about societal pressures and if they are arbitrary. If Haruka loves his sister is a sexual relationship ok? How much is? Is loving someone enough to justify resisting society on this issue? It tries very hard to set this up as a situation where Haruka feels powerless in the face of feelings and society is coming between them. But...the anime robs the situation of its complexity by failing to emphasize the choices each character makes and the possible forms of love. And thus makes a fundamental mistake about the nature of it. It also robs the situation of its potential problems by presenting a \"happily ever after\" choice. Basically Sora and Haruka can move away and go incognito and that's that. \\n\\n\r\nFirst off, \"lust\" is not \"love\", something many people have difficulty recognizing the difference between. I can want to have sex with someone but not love them and want to spend my life with them. Basing a relationship solely on sexual attraction is asking to fail. Similarly, you don't need sexuality to have a good relationship. What matters is the growing intimacy between two people and how they grow to understand and look out for each other. This is what holds relationships together and should be looked for primarily when thinking about making a long-term relationship choice. Sex is the worst glue for a relationship ever, and yet the sister, Sora only seems happy with a physical relationship with her brother? And angry when he is kind and does things for her, makes time for her, but doesn't have sex with her and kiss her? It seems an arbitrary scenario. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes down to it, there are way more choices involved here then the anime makes you think. Being sexually attracted to someone is not love as we can clearly see Haruka could have chosen any of the girls (and does in other arcs). Love is usually not a powerful emotion that you are doomed to follow but fundamentally has choices and complexity. \\n\\n\r\nBut the anime doesn't explore this open avenue at all. it basically just shows Haruka realizing he is sexually attracted to his sister after seeing her masturbating and jumping straight to \"move to another city and live our life together to escape persecution and our family\". Despite the fact that it is clear Sora is not the only person he is attracted too. What Haruka wants is a relationship with his sister. When that is threatened (mainly by Sora's own feelings but also by the potential breakup of them by family members after their parents death) he chooses her. But I don't see why the siblings couldn't insist to their relatives they stay together and expressed that love in a non-sexual way. It felt like a forced plot device. Heck, they could have even continued to live together. It made sense because his sister has health problems and he could keep taking care of her. But the anime made it this \"all or nothing\" sort of scenario. \\n\\n\r\nBeyond this, I think the focus on physical relationship actually has a very high chance of hurting or destroying their relationship in the long run. Imagine how awkward it will be if this is not a happily ever after story and later one of them wants to explore other relationships again? By making this choice they are setting themselves up for an awkward estrangement in the future made all the more awkward by the fact that they are siblings. Once they've chosen to have sex and be involved in this way, they can never go back to the innocent love of \"just being siblings\". If something happens and they break up they will be unable to be there for each other in the same way due to this past, losing forever the chance to support each other as just sister/brother. This is made even sadder by the fact that their parents are dead and they have no other family they are close too. At this time after the loss of their parents they both need close family and romantic relationships. They will be healthier with both imho. And it is sad to me to see them rolled into one with the future possibility that they could lose both. I would have loved to see this developed or even considered but it isn't. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR: I think the anime made the characters seem powerless and two-dimensional by making it seem like they \"had no choice\" and were \"victims\" when they really had all the choices. It is a classic \"depowering\" under the guise of \"romance\" and something I really don't like seeing. They also failed to address the complex issues of these choices such as the fact that by choosing a sexual relationship the siblings are most likely sacrificing their relationship ever being innocent love again. \\n",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS\r\nI am going to preface this review by saying that this ecchi does cover a taboo in it, and that while from a personal perspective I have no issue with this, from a logical perspective there is issues with it, and it's most likely true that most people will find some issue with, or be repulsed by, the taboo in this show. In spite of this, I do feel that this is worth a watch. I will be covering the taboo later in the review as it could be considered a minor spoiler.\r\nLet's start with the aspect of this that I foundthe best; the sound.\\n\r\nIt's rare for me to pay much attention to soundtracks, and when I do it's because  they contain songs that I know and love, like the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, or because they make me feel the emotional impact of scenes and interactions, and add what could almost be considered non-verbal story-telling.\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora falls under the latter. The music in this is amazing, matching up with each and every scene almost flawlessly. The fact that I felt like crying and laughing in various points was made possible by the music. There were scenes where the music was the only real sound there, and those scenes conveyed so much emotion. The one that sticks out the most was one of the sex scenes, which I found to be the most tasteful of them all, where they interchanged it and another scene showing great character development without any speech. That's truly impressive. \\n\r\nThe voice acting was also very well done, and I felt the emotions that were in them. There's not much more to say than that, I'm not really someone who pays much mind to this.\\n\r\nI'm speaking a lot about the emotions, and how I felt them through the music and the acting. I feel that I need to explain this by saying that I'm not someone who finds much emotional impact in things, especially in romances, which makes this somewhat unique for me. Because of the emotions, the music that makes perfect sense for each and every scene, and the amazingly done voice acting, I rate this category 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the art. Fuck me the art is great. The backdrops are simple, but I feel that it was a good choice to keep the scenery simple to keep the focus on the main aspect of the series; The characters. The characters art in this was really well done, and from what I've seen from other reviews, this is important considering its visual novel source. I found everything pleasing to look at, not just the curves. I really felt the emotions that the characters were going through when I looked at their faces, which were enhanced further by the voice acting and music. The sex scenes were done tastefully, and the style and frequency of them was mostly due to the source material. I did find some dilemma in the fact that the female characters were all under 18, and we see breasts from them, however I decided that due to the look and mature feel of them, as well as my views that breasts being seen as sexual is a bit stupid, I can overlook this aspect. Laws in Australia (Where I live) state that basically if the characters are 20 but look 10, then it can be considered child pornography, or if they are under 16 (Like most of these characters) but look far more mature than that then things get iffy. Sorry for that aside, but I do feel that it was necessary to mention.\\n\r\nOverall, I feel that the art and animations were a large part of why I enjoyed it. Easy 10/10 for me.\\n\\n\r\nIt was somewhat tricky to decide which to tackle first out of characters and story, and after some thought I've decided to go with story.\\n\r\nFor the most part, the story is pretty good. I found it somewhat confusing at first, but after reading a few comments on this I managed a good understanding of how it works. The short of it is, Yosuga no Sora began as a visual novel wherein the player has the ability to romance various heroines, leading to a sex scene etc. The anime follows this idea, and at the end of each arc, returns to a previous point in the story and goes \"Well what if this character showed up at this spot rather than this character\" and other things along that line. I personally found this to be really effective, and a very interesting way to transfer that kind of source material into a series like this. It did have some downsides, however. I was left wanting more for the stories of each of the heroines, and felt somewhat unsatisfied by this. On the other side, they managed to tell the stories of each character extremely well in the few episodes that were assigned to each. That is truly an impressive feat, and kept me hooked. The downside was enough for me to bring down the score from an easy 10/10 to an 8/10. \\n\\n\r\nAnd now we get the characters.\\n\r\nEach character is multi-layered and unique. I know that there are terms for their types, but I do not know them, and find them annoying when reading reviews and conversations about things. As such, I will be using none of them.\\n\r\nFor me, the characters were relatable, to an extent. They all struggled with something on their conscience or with other aspects of their life, and they all dealt with their problems in their own ways. The one that stuck out most for me was one of the heroines who felt she had wronged the main character, and was constantly beating herself up about it (Metaphorically, not literally). There was also twincest in here, which I personally have no issue with, but biologically speaking, I do have issues with. I feel the need to mention here that Sigmund Freud had theories that support the idea that we are attracted to our siblings and parents, and seek out romantic/sexual partners that remind us of them. I feel that this arc was the most interesting of all of them, showing a conflict of morality versus emotion versus societal views. It was interesting, and tackled well. It is this taboo that I feel is the culprit of the marring of some reviews. I also understand why it would put people off it.\\n\r\nFor the same reason as the story, characters get an 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this a lot, and will be definitely re-watching it in the future. 10/10 for enjoyment. The average of the scores is a 9/10, rounded to the nearest whole number. I do this as I feel that the average is the best way to give an overall score for a review.",

The only reason i watched it all was because I donot start animes and dont finish them. I couldnt understand if the things happened or if they were haru's thoughts. I hated sora. I laughed at how much i hated her. The story could be developed better so i gave it a 5/10, the worst anime i have ever seen. I do not recommend it to no one. Incest animes can be developed well but the mere fact that sora was such abitch, turned me off.",

Instead, it's more a straightforward ecchi anime. The romances develop between the characters through different scenarios. For example, after one romance is concluded, a fresh romance starts from what I'd call a \"checkpoint\". There aren't multiple romances at once. \r\nThe romance stories of the first two romances was very well developed to me. However, towards the remainder of the series, it really threw me off. That said, let's just say that Sora has a very large big brothercomplex. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is great and the sound is amazing. The characters could've had more development though. I really wish that they had extended the two romances at the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, if you're looking for ecchi scenes (more like semi-hentai) in this, there are some, but only towards the endings of the stories. But if you wait after the credits, you'll enjoy the bonus story! :)",

            "content": "I watched this 7 years ago and I rewatched it today because I remembered this show made a slight impression on me and I couldn't figure out why I assigned such a low rating for this show when I returned to my MAL page. \r\nYosuga no Sora explores the very touchy subject of incest, it a taboo subject and would probably turn anyone away, let alone watch an anime about it. But if you have the patience and open mind to give this a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised with what the show has to offer. If anything, I think the only flaw with thisshow was the excessive lewd scenes and they don't address the incest stuff until the very end.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways the story is about a fraternal twin Haru (the guy) and Sora (the girl) returning to the village they grew up in and getting used to school life. The story is broken up into a few arcs, each arc is focused on a separate girl in the village who has a crush on Haru. Each arc gives you more insight about the girls, the town they live in, Haru and Sora's past, and of course the relationship between Haru and Sora through the other girls' perspective. It's somewhat nonchalant and layback, and it was the slice of life aspect that made me engaged with the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe most interesting character is definitely Sora who is extremely a fragile mentally and physically character. She is spoiled, complains a lot, and gets easily jealous. But you can't fault her or hate her because the writing is very good at showing how and why she acts like this. So instead of hate, you actually sympathize with her. Her brother Haru is pretty much just an average main character of a harem, but he does have some life to his characte. He isn't perfect (other than his looks) and get easily tempted. The other girls in the show are all archetype, they don't serve much purpose other than a plot device for either showing us the environment or initiate the twin's relationship. \\n\\n\r\nThe visuals are okay from what I remembered, but the animation was incredible for this genre. There were a few cinematic scenes that made me go \"wow, I am going to remember this\". There was also a lot of effort put into the lewd scenes, let's just say those scenes were especially  \"energetic\"....\\n\\n\r\nFinally the best part about this show and I think what made the show was the OST. It's also an OST they play every episode in different forms in different situations. It brings out different emotions in you, it can feel calm, mysterious, happy, exciting, mellow, dearing, and most definitely nostalgic. \\n\\n\r\nThis is an anime is great if you want to explore a little and are not afraid of the subject. I just wish they cut down on the lewd stuff\\n\\n\\n",

I was half way through the series and i was lost. I rewatched it in sub and dub and got confused both times. \r\nThe Story starts off cool but then it randomly changes and then changes again! and i couldn't figure out what was going on hahah. I understand if people think that the story was straight forward but honestly i got so confused and finallyfinished it my 4th time with a semi knowledge of what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nSo honestly i enjoyed it but i feel it only deserves a 4 overall.\\n\\n\r\nsound was pretty good and the art and characters were not bad.\\n\\n\r\nthe story is confusing if you have no idea whats going on so i gave it a 3.\\n\\n\r\ni did enjoy it but not very much so i gave it a 4. I personally wouldn't watch this unless you read the manga. Thank you!",

            "content": "There are so many things which are wrong about so many of the relationships in this anime. It basically reads like a high school student's sexual fantasies put into animation. So depending on what you're wanting to get out of this the scoring differs. For a romance it gets a 6, but for a watch-at-midnight-by-yourself anime it's more like a 7.5 because they are fairly gratuitous with showing off body parts and uh, physical recreation.\r\nThere is a semi-decent storyline compared to other animes of this sort for the different story arcs, but because each one is so short there's pretty much no feels for anyof the characters. The way they do the transitions between each story arc is quite good though with same scene-different ending though. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the first arc in full but then basically just skipped to the bits with the action. One thing which really annoyed me though was how frequently they get all the girls naked in this but have Haruka (the male lead) still with all his clothes on. Kinda sexist. And my goodness, how they exaggerate the size of every female's breasts. Character art design almost certainly done by a male.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and EN themes are really beautiful though.",

            "content": "Let's get this out of the way now, if you're uncomfortable with watching a show with nudity and graphic sexual situations, get used to it, because Yosuga no Sora is a hidden masterpiece.\r\nEvery aspect of this show is amazing. Each story arc gives us a short, yet emotional tale of the main characters relationship with a different girl each arc, and they are some of the most mind blowing stories I've ever had the privilege to witness. The arcs last just long enough, and all provide a unique scenario for the arcs main girl and the main character to overcome.\r\nAddressing the erotic content, Yosuga noSora has a lot. Sometimes it serves a purpose to the story or comedy, and other times it's gratuitous and not really necessary, and in these times it often feels silly to watch. In spite of this, it's not enough to diminish the quality by even a point, because the pros outweigh the cons just that much. When the erotic content is used properly, it provides some of the most romantic scenes I've ever seen.\\n\\n\r\nUsing captivating music and animation, Yosuga no Sora is still has one of the most pleasing aesthetics of any anime. One thing that really stands out to me is the lighting. Things as simple as a dim lit bedroom, beams of a sunset cascading through the gaps in the trees in the forest, or the sudden crash of lightning on a dark and rainy night. Many fans of Yosuga no Sora will praise how the show has this very calm, and relaxed fell to it. It's animation and music help you to drift away into the magically normal world of Yosuga no Sora, and immerse you deeper within it, and it makes the story all that more filled with life.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora also poses many controversial moral questions, that most shows wouldn't have nearly enough guts to tackle. It brings up the subject of incest, and gives us a new viewpoint on the subject by putting us in the characters shoes, and does so without ever feeling preachy or shoving it down our throats. It gives an intentionally complicated view on the matter, because it's very rare that things are clear cut black and white.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Yosuga no Sora is a masterpiece, that unfortunately, to many people shy away from because of the erotic content and the subject of incest. If I could say anything to these people, I would ask them to bear with it, because when it comes down to it, it's a shame that anyone who holds a appreciation for stories should miss out on such an amazing one.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is about twin brother and sister, Haruka and Sora moving to their grandparents countryside home after they orphaned. The series follows four separate storylines where you see Haruka forming romantic relationships with four separate girls. Three of the stories are sweet for the most part while the fourth made me very uncomfortable. The series is filled with a lot of softcore hentai and although that's not my cup of tea, it kind of helped appreciate the romance in each relationship and in two of the relationships even fueled the storyline to progress in a more dramatic way. Understanding that these are fourdifferent stories involving the same characters is pretty key to watching the series. Now I said before three of the stories are sweet for the most part while the fourth is rather uncomfortable. The reason it is uncomfortable (and you should catch this by the end of episode 1) is because the fourth story involves an incestuous relationship between Haruka and Sora. Now I understand you can't help who you fall in love with and all but I just can't get past the fact that these two are siblings. Maybe I'm ignorant but that's just how I feel. Incest and softcore henati aside, the relationships are indeed sweet and the characters are all very diverse, each one dealing with their own personal demons and Haruka seems to be the only person who can put a smile on their faces. The series is rather different from anything I've seen, nothing groundbreaking but if sweet romance, softcore hentai and incest is your thing then this would be the perfect series for you.",

            "content": "Like other people here, it was in my endeavors to find some decent anime with nudity (nudity makes all art more fun, as long as it's quality) that I stumbled upon this show.\r\nIt starts off pretty rough, with all this slice-of-life drama and not-at-all interesting initial plot setup sliced up with occasionally grossly pervy panty shots and other such creepshot breast-in-shirt ogling or whatever. I'm really not against pervy stuff, look into my anime history (I started watching anime with the intent to find anime sex and boobs for my partner), it's just the intent that matters to me, I guess. Hentai is honest. HighSchool DxD is honest with itself--the main character is a boob-obsessed perv. Queen's Blade feels honest too--it wants to be a show about \"strong\" females that just happen to keep chopping each other's tops off. This felt dishonest, because it pretends to be some sort of romance, but does all these creepy little things along the way that feel way more voyeuristic, in a bad way, than all of that other blatant ecchi stuff.\\n\\n\r\nBut, I decided to persevere, and there's definitely a bit of a shift as soon as the Nao arc starts -- the show started to engage me as an OK romance, with boobs (which is what I was looking for in the first place). \\n\\n\r\nThen the show surprised me and engaged me even further with the final arc. Haru and Sora are disgusting, and I expected to only be more and more grossed out by the show's pervy ideals in relation to those relations, but I gotta say, the show handles that salacious material quite well, with some really great, shocking, dramatic moments--particularly those endings! \\n\\n\r\nI still can't help but feel like this is still exploitative and it creeps me out thinking someone wrote this only to be able to draw up their incestuous fantasies, but in the Nao arc and the final arc I kept thinking to myself that this kind of sexuality was what I was looking for -- natural and not afraid to show sex or nudity.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my biggest issues with all these ecchi shows is the noxious fan ideals of keeping their anime goddesses pure and virginal. I gotta at least give this one credit for (at least in the second half) having sex scenes that felt like they had purpose, or were given some sort of narrative weight or IDK-- and not being afraid of sexuality. Like all of the basement nerds all those Heaven's Lost Property type trash shows are about.\\n\\n\r\nI'm getting way off base here-- anyway, this is... an interesting show. I wouldn't really recommend it. But you could do way worse.",

            "content": "Tl;dr: this series' greatness depends on your own personal viewpoint. If you're a person that is strictly influenced by the moral of this world regarding incest, then I suggest to watch only until episode 9ish or something and drop it, or even not to consider watching it at all.\r\nBut if you are an open minded person that would actually think more deeply and wouldn't jump onto a typical prejudice and disgust, then you're more than welcome to try this.\r\nI would like to say that I am reviewing this based on a neutral viewpoint, hence the morality of this series will not affect how good orbad this series is. And also in each arc of this series there will be a bit H scene so do consider this too when wanting to watch this.\\n\\n\r\nYosuga no Sora, despite being a rare type of series, is one of the interesting series I had ever watch. Even after rewatching this after four years or so, it didn't let me down. The storyline consist of a few different arcs such as a vn would be, because this series is actually an adaptation of the vn. There are four arcs in this series, and the last arc is the true ending. After a route have finished, the next episode retracts to an event where the  main protagonist would choose a different route than the first route.\\n\\n\r\nEach storyline has its own meaningful story and is quite emotional. The theme of this series is a really deep and serious one and the soundtrack also seems to fit on this. The soundtracks are emotional and always matches with the situation of the story. Furthermore, all of the soundtracks are great to hear and it is also one of the plus points on why I liked this series. However, despite having a good story the pacing is faster than the usual ones that it felt somewhat rushed. This might be because they had to compress four different story onto a 12 episode long anime, which is one of its shortcoming. Another one would be that even though having a good introduction and character development for its side character, the main character itself, Sora and Haru didn't really seem to get developed deeper. Whilst the first three arc had its own unique conflict and resolution, Sora's arc only had an internal conflict between them and the resolution of it felt dull. Nevertheless, this series is great and not disappointing. The reactions and actions are fairly realistic especially how they describe the internal conflict of the last arc, since that matter itself is a complex one.\\n\\n\r\nFor the conflict of the moralism, as I said in the tldr note, those who are strictly influenced by the morals of this world regarding incest, then I suggest to watch it only until episode 9ish and stop there. Or maybe even not to consider watching this. The reason why I said this is because the anime itself isn't that bad and I don't want to say that it is bad just because of the last arc of incest.\\n\r\nFrom episode 1 to 9, the first until the third arc could still be digested rationally. But, the episode after that might not be easily digested if you have a strict viewpoint and if you were to force yourself to watch it, you might find it destroying the whole image of the story. However, if you are a very open minded person (like me) that is willing to think more deeply on things and wouln't throw the typical prejudice and disgust, then digesting the last arc would not be too much of a problem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is (really) enjoyable for me and I would recommend to watch this.",

This is just a random anime that I've picked, I don't know what kind of anime it was but when I watched the first episode and saw the main male protagonist being called 'cute', and saw two other hot chicks blushed just by looking at the guy's face showing interest then yeah... this is definitely a harem anime.\r\nStory 6/10 Basically, The story is like playing an eroge(I haven't played one yet but I knew how the game works) since the game ISbased from an eroge. The first two episode is just a mere introduction, the 3rd episode is where the eroge-like part kicks in. The main character is going to talked to the girl and soon sleeps with them. That part is predictable, he WILL have sex with every female characters(except for one). This is truly a romance anime but with the softcore hentai part ruins it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10 I like the art, it's decent, not too ugly nor too perfect. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10 I gave it a 5? well, I don't pretty much care about the sounds. It just sounded the same to me just like any other anime. Though there are certain anime that has such an annoying voice but not this one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10 Every character has there own personality's well done. Some characters you just can't predict what they are going to do next, the characters are mostly females with two males, one being the hero of the anime. The female characters will show signs of interest to the male protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 I gave it a 10 not because of the softcore hentai scenes, it's censored anyway -.-\". I like it because of the good endings, some anime have bad endings that just leave you depressed and angry, not satisfied with how it should have ended. This anime, well... every girl received their love by this one guy(again, except for one). Though this is like an eroge, like which girl you're going to choose? which route you're going to start with. The female character's story is told one at a time. You could say it's like an alternative ending for the anime where this one guy will love this one girl and there love life goes on... the end. Then the next episode starts but now, the guy will be with the other female characters and their love story will be told....\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I gave it a very good 8. You should watch this aniime if you like harem romance anime.",

            "content": "Yosuga no Sora is simply one of the most unique anime's i have watched\r\nWhen i began the series, i had little to no idea as to what i was getting myself into, i was expecting your typical slice of life romance anime. But interestingly it took a turn for the eechi side, which completely blew my socks off.\r\nYes, you guessed it, THIS ANIME HAS SEX IN IT, however this does contribute to plot and character development and your able to see the effect it has on each girl afterwards. So it simply isn't a pointless hentai that is only good to jack off to.\r\n Theanime is based off a visual novel, so every girl has their own arc and their own version of the story. However each arc has no correlation to each other until you get to the final one. In each arc (which would be every 2 episodes) you see the story from a different perspective with multiple changes, although the one aspect that never changes in all these arcs is the main character\\n\\n\r\nThe main Character Haruka is simply a guy who is a little too perfect. With a chill personality and an overpowering charisma level he is basically responsible for all the arcs in the anime by peeking the interests of the girls around him. But this is only the surface of his character, in reality he is character of multiple imperfections who is often weak and indecisive. His inability to cope with certain scenarios is what causes the abrupt swings in the flow of the storyline, and as a result not the best result is achieved at the end of every arc\\n\\n\r\nSora is the main character's little sister who you simply cannot come to hate . She is troubled and distressed and has spent alot of time in hospital due to her health, but within this time she developed a certain \"love\" for her brother Haruka. Sora would do anything to not have her brother taken away from her by any other girl, this would be to the point in which you could potentially call her yandere. However as the anime progresses you begin to see the insecurites within Sora change her and her mentality which then takes this anime down the road of incest where things start to get to interesting (im not gonna spoil anything)\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for the girls. At first they seem quite ordinary and boring but in their arcs you come to see that every character has a certain amount of depth and imperfections to them. they all bring something to the table and control the ebb and flow of the plot and the main character. I personally liked Kazuha (the class president) who gives off a \"commanding Onee chan\" vibe despite being a kind hearted girl who cares for everyone. Other girls such as Akira (the shrine maiden) come off as the typical carefree, happy maiden who always has a smile on her face, however deep down she is extremely emotional and has her own set of problems to deal with. \\n\\n\r\nSo the characters themselves are quite versetile and likeable, i would give them a 8\\n\\n\r\nNow for storyline. The Slice of life aspect of Yosuga no Sora keeps the plot steady and there are no inconsistencies within time or setting in the anime. However the anime does opt to go for the same layout every arc. The girl gets introduced to the MC, there are several encounters and a potential date on the line and then at the very end Haruka gets down to business with the girl in bed. Even though it is portrayed in every arc differently, it is still quite bland since your expecting the same thing every arc. At times I was more hyped for the soft core porn rather than i was for the story. Many of the girls also seemed less likable in their own arcs (until you got see the oppai) but the anime was made so that the personalities could be more believable. But each girl made Yosuga no Sora the unique anime it is with its ups and downs. \\n\\n\r\n In the end the storyline was quite mediocre and i can only give it a 6\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things i like the most about this anime was the art style. The Art style was crisp and smooth and quite easily one of the best i have seen. the nature and characters were all done well and given their own personality. Also the eechi scenes were quite on point and detailed. At the end of every episode there is a section done is Chibi art which i am also quite fond of. Seeing the characters with massive heads and unproportionate bodies was quite hilarious. I would give the Art style and easy solid 8\\n\\n\r\nThe sound in this anime was also done really well. The voice acting was not sloppy and done well, I can easily say it was better than many of the mainstream animes out there. the background music and OST was also crisp and appropriate and i felt as if though it synced really well with the anime. The sound was of exceptional quality a 9 from me\\n\\n\r\nOverall i really like Yosuga no Sora, It was quite different from what i expected in a good way and i was able to see things in a different manner after watching this. For someone like myself who watches anime merely for good plot character development i enjoyed Yosuga no Sora thoroughly and would give it a 7 Overall\\n\\n\\n",
