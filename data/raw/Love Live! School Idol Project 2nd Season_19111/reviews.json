            "content": "If there have been any worries about the future of the idol genre, Love Live 2 has dispelled them. \r\nIt's hard to deny that the first season of Love Live began with a rocky start. There wasn't much to set itself apart from other idol shows (especially with the likes of Idolmaster and Aikatsu dominating the genre) and it fell prone to melodrama far more than it should have. But, much like K-ON's mediocre first season and excellent second season, Love Live 2 has managed to do more than improve upon its predecessor - it has genuinely become an amazing anime. \r\nI won't lie, Iwas no fan of the franchise when the TV series made its debut in early 2013. I dropped it after the first episode aired and wondered later on what people saw in the series. But now having finished the second season, Love Live has become one of my favourite anime franchises. \\n\\n\r\nCertainly it is not an anime that will test the mind or change anyone's life. It is simply a story of nine teenage girls forming an idol group together. However, it would be an insult to describe Love Live as yet another \"cute girls doing cute things\" anime, as it is a far more meaningful experience. The drama feels genuine this time around, and by the end it is hard to prevent the tears from rolling when the story of \u03bc's reaches its end. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode of the second season, it is clear that Sunrise has made a significant effort to improve the series. It looks better, sounds better, feels better and is far more fun to watch. Most importantly, the girls of \u03bc's all feel like genuine characters now. Honoka's passion makes her truly seem like the leader and centre of the group, whereas the first season didn't have much reason beyond \"well, somebody had to be the leader, right?\" Even the characters who were given little to no screen-time in the first season (Rin, Eli, Nozomi and Hanayo) are fleshed and given their own episode to shine. It is finally a story about the nine of them. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering there have only been twenty-six episodes to develop a cast of nine characters, Sunrise has done a commendable job of doing so without neglecting the story in return. Perhaps the characters could have benefited from another season of episodes, but they hardly feel lacking by the end. The addition of a rival idol group (A-RISE) also makes the story feel less insular. It is no longer confined to the school itself, and with the school's closure no longer being an issue, the girls can finally focus on performing as idols do. \\n\\n\r\nNico is easily one of the show's greatest assets. Sure, her \"nico nico-nii\" catchphrase is cute and all (I go a little bit crazy whenever she utters it), but Nico's presence accomplishes far more than simply being a vehicle for the cute. Of all the character-focused episodes, Nico's is the greatest. It shows that she really, truly cares about the group and is not simply in it for pride and ego. The idol industry is Nico's life, the act of being an idol her most treasured dream. She cares deeply for her siblings and performs primarily to make them smile. She's a kind person inside- contrary to her rough behaviour with the rest of \u03bc's. Perhaps that behaviour may make her somewhat unsuitable for the role of an idol, but she's more serious about it than anyone else. Nico may not be idealised as idols usually are, but that flawed, genuinely human side of her makes her makes her all the more loveable, I think. Even if she does not resonate with you as a character, it's hard to deny that she at least provides an interesting contrast with the rest of \u03bc's. It would not be anywhere near as interesting without her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story peaks in the last four episodes. With the graduation of the third-years quickly drawing closer, a tear-filled goodbye seems inevitable. It is very similar to the final episodes of K-ON's second season. With the prospect of Nico leaving and \u03bc's potentially being disbanded after graduation, I could not help but feel my chest tighten a bit. And then the final episode really drove those feelings home. Perhaps they'll join together once again and find careers as professional idols. I doubt it is the end for Nico, Eli and Honoka.\\n\\n\r\nLike most idol anime, Love Live has a fantastic soundtrack. All the songs the girls perform carry their own theme and message, and none of them (aside from the opening and ending) are used more than once in the anime. Each song represents a new stage for \u03bc's, another step forward as performers and as people. The music peaks with the performance of \"Snow Halation\" in the ninth episode, a rising, sad yet uplifting piece that showcases the appeal of \u03bc's. It is probably one of the best vocal tracks I have heard in an anime to date. There is also a really cool scene at the end of the 12th episode that I won't spoil. Everything with the music sorts of 'clicks' in that moment. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted though that the ninth episode does blunder a bit with its choice of music. As the second-years traverse through a snowstorm, there is an incredibly melodramatic, orchestral piece blasting in the background that would feel more appropriate were demons from hell rising up and setting Earth on fire or something. The second season has improved so much that it is frustrating to see it regress to the first season's melodrama, even for just a brief moment. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the visuals, Love Live looks well above average. The CGI during the performances can be a little bit distracting (and I know some people despise CGI of any form) but between that and low frame-rate, off-model animation, I would gladly take the CGI. It certainly looks better than Aikatsu's CGI, anyway. The rest of the visuals on the other hand holds up reasonably well. There are scenes here and there where lazy, static shots are used for longer than necessary, and while it certainly is no Attack on Titan, Love Live looks just fine. \\n\\n\r\nLove Live has come a long way from its slow beginnings. While it will hardly convert anyone who detests the 'moe' art style, those who have even the slightest inkling of interest in the series will likely find the second season to be at the very top of the idol (and perhaps even music) genre. An anime can be both cute and a genuinely great story, as is demonstrated here. \\n\\n\r\nNow, where's my Nico spin-off?",

            "content": "After finishing 1st Season of Love Live: School Idol Project, I must say, Season 2 sure stepped up it's game. I enjoyed Season 1 a lot too, but Season 2 has just been something else for me.\r\nFor those of you who don't know, Love Live: School Idol Project is based off of a real live idol group called Nine Muses. They all go by different names in the anime itself, but it's a pretty neat concept. Their goal in Season 1 is to keep the school from shutting down by forming an idol group.\r\nIn Season 2, their goal is to make the Love Live, andwin it all, this will be the last chance for them to do this together as members of the group are graduating after their third year.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nSimply, I don't like many music/idol animes. They stray too far away from the main plot. Often times, they become too focused on being cute, and adorable, much like K-On! did, and steer away from the story as a whole, and for me that's a complete turnoff. With Love Live: School Idol Project, I have not had to worry about that at all. The story is not really comedic in any form, which in turn makes the quality that much better as it truly focuses on it being a slice of life anime, rather then throwing little \"hilarious\" moments all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nIn Season 2, we see a lot more drama, heartache, and realization. After eating through all 13 episodes, it's been nothing short of emotional, and I love it.  The theme stays the same, where they're all dedicated to making the best of their school idol group while they can, and they continue to have a goal in mind that they can strive for together. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is once again fantastic, other than, in my opinion the 3D they use for their performances. I dislike 3D animation, but that's my preference. Other than that, I thought it was really good. I love the costumes they wear during their performances as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, well, if you're watching an anime about school idols, I'm pretty sure you expect good music, and this is nothing short of that. Snow Halation, one of the songs they perform in this season, was just phenomenal (And it's a real song by Nine Muse's, check it out!). I personally enjoy the music they sing, and the BGM is well placed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, well, there's nine of them, so I'm not going to run through each one as I'd probably do a messy job anyways. I'll just say that each one of these characters, Nico, Nozomi, Eli, Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Rin, Hayano, and Maki are all unique characters in their group. They all have had struggles (As seen in season 1) and coming into season 2 that's no different, however, they have developed incredibly over the span of this season. They've all conquered certain issues with themselves, and they've done this together as a group. That's one of the huge striking points for me, is that no matter what situation they're in, they figure it out together, and they're all there for one another whenever it's called for. Easily the characters are the strongest point within this anime.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I've never really enjoyed an anime that's been centred around music much like Love Live. This has been such a fun ride for myself, and while I don't think this anime is for everyone, I'd fully recommend you at least give it a try. I'm pretty sure you'll connect with the characters in one way or another, and that's one of the many reasons this anime is so special.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I've ever cried such happy tears before. Best choice I made watching this series, all because of a Nico-Ni .gif.\\n",

            "content": "When Love Live! School Idol Project first aired in Japan, it became a hit sensation, captivating the hearts of many. The show was surprisingly good, with an enjoyable cast, entertaining songs, and a solid story. It was a massive success, and with its popularity came a second season. This might make some people feel anxious, thinking this to be a sell out for more money, but their worries can be put to ease; regardless of its intentions, I believe this second season to be even greater than the first time around.\r\nSpoilers for the first season to follow.\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project Second Season follows \u03bc\u2019sas they get a second chance at the Love Live idol competition after their withdrawal from the first. Beyond that however, the girls are forced to look farther ahead and contemplate the future of \u03bc\u2019s as the third year\u2019s graduation begins to rapidly approach. The story isn\u2019t anything too original, but that\u2019s overshadowed by the fact that it\u2019s done well. Love Live!\u2019s second season will make you laugh and feel good, but at the same time it can bring you to tears. There is a lot of emotion packed into its later episodes, and when the season comes to a close, you won\u2019t want to see them go. The story is brought to a finish with an ending that wraps everything up nicely, making it a satisfying journey from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\n\u03bc\u2019s brings multiple main characters to the table, so there\u2019s a guarantee you\u2019ll love at least one of them, if not all of them. From genki girl Honoka to narcissistic Nico, there\u2019s a lot of variety to be had. More important than that, however, is that the show still manages to bring some depth and development to these characters despite there being so many. The spotlight is given to the girls who weren\u2019t featured during the first season, such as Nico and Rin, but development still continues for the others, such as in Honoka and Umi. Add to that some nice side characters like all the imoutos, as well as some actual presence from the rival idol group A-RISE, not to mention those amazing alpacas, and it is clear that the show does a wonderful job with its loveable cast. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this being an idol show and all, the music is a major component of this show, and I feel it doesn\u2019t fail in this regard. The OP and ED are pretty good, matching the feel of the series quite well. The insert songs are really the standout though, with a mood and lyrics that depict the moments of the show magnificently. My favorite of the bunch definitely has to be \u201cSnow Halation\u201d; when it is being sung, I had shivers going down my spine. Of course, the rest of the bunch is great too, such as \u201cAishteru Banzai\u201d, \u201cLove & Peace\u201d, and even a return of the opening of the first season, which is tied in nicely. The soundtrack is pretty great as well fitting the mood nicely and bringing the tension and emotion when it needs to be brought. Overall, the music of the series is great, as it should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all nice to look at, and there\u2019s probably going to be a design that you love because of the massive cast. The animation runs smoothly for the most part, and can be pretty beautiful at times as well, such as during the performance of the aforementioned \u201cSnow Halation\u201d. One problem that I did have with this show, however, is the CG that is used during the song performances. It is pretty jarring and takes away from what would otherwise be beautiful scenes. Thankfully, the usage of the CG has decreased and the quality has increased slightly from the last season, so it wasn\u2019t as bad as before, but I still wasn\u2019t a big fan of it. Other than that though, this is quite a beautiful show to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a very entertaining show to watch. Even with the bothersome CG, watching the girls of \u03bc\u2019s working to win the Love Live and performing their songs was a wonderful experience. This second season made me fall in love with \u03bc\u2019s even more than the first season had. Anyone who liked the first season will definitely love this; even if you didn\u2019t, I feel as though the second season was a great step up from the first, so you might still enjoy it. While the story is brought to a close for now, I can\u2019t wait to see what the Love Live! series has in store for us next.\\n\\n\r\nReady?\\n\\n\r\n\u03bc\u2019s music start!!\\n",

Although not having an originality, the story is full of excitement, the plot have a great balance between the main story and the fillers. \r\nAs for the art, we have a clear and beautiful animation, despite having a CG during dancing and stage performing, Love Live! have a well-produced animation.\r\nWhat can I say about the sound?

            "content": "Ambition \u2013 the driving force of a goal.\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt that season 1 of Love Live is a truly weak series. There was a lack of detail to characterization; the flow of the plot was all over the place: Shoving cute girls and memes down your throat and then ending on some of the worst melodrama present in anime at the end. \r\nIt would be easy to pass off the second season as equally irresponsible as the first; but oddly enough the second season of Love Live works wonders. This improvement in quality it ascends Love Live from being a trashy meme-fest into something oftrue emotion even if contrived at many points.\\n\\n\r\nGo for glory; the goal set in mind for the group.\\n\r\nAfter saving their school and realising the little time they have left as a group with the third year students graduating; the nine girls of Muse up the ante by setting out to win Love Live!\\n\r\nA simple plot really, but what makes this concept work so well is the structure of this season. Character based episodes and moments of bonding help flesh out the cast well enough while still building the story up to its climax. The fun notion and diverse story of each episode and improved comedy makes the ride endearing; episodes centred on the girls watching romantic films; Honoka and Hanayo losing weight and other quirky concepts that make the show constantly engaging; even if to poke fun at. These episodes are mostly comprised of interaction between the nine main characters; and whilst still conceivably stereotypical, they enhance the overall enjoyment of the show. Achieving a much better structure than what the first season achieved.\\n\\n\r\nThis season also manages to be quite emotional with reminiscence of the journey the members of the group embarked on, the daunting realisation the girls feel as their final concert together as Muse draws near; all of it feels so content.  The dedication; the journey, everything the anime throws at you has you rooting for the girls in one way or another. By the end of the anime there\u2019s enough development into each area of the show; that you may be able to look back in joy and appreciation at the story as a whole, and the bonds with each member of the group. Sure there are many times where elements of the show become questionable and writing feels weak; such as certain road-blocks for the group, seemingly dumb character actions, and a focus too heavily oriented on appealing as a Slice of Life oriented series; but that feeling of bitter-sweet progression for the group through this season make this a wonderful and whole-rounded experience. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOf course the story wouldn\u2019t receive this much praise if it was not for the development the characters received this season. In Season 1, many of the cast was under-developed with not much attention onto each characters ambitions and what holds the group together. In this season we\u2019re shown brighter, memorable captivating versions of the group. With more attention to their ambitions; their relationships and bonds as the group \u201cMuse.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonoka receives some of the nicest development in this season compared to her personality in season 1; she\u2019s still quite obnoxious, ditsy and dumb. But her role as the leader of Muse becomes more important this time round, with the new-found position of student council president she matures slightly and ditches all hesitation: Leading the members of Muse on their path to victory while still managing activities brought on by being president. She\u2019s not a character worthy of much praise in the grand scheme of things, but her drive and aspirations to win Love Live not only for herself but for those around her who have helped her get this far is touching.\\n\\n\r\nRin is the most noteworthy example of Love Live doing character development correctly. From an un-important side character from season 1; Rin evolves into a character that learns to stop doubting herself and breaks out of her shell. Improving confidence of her character and the rest of the cast is necessary to strengthen the bond between Muse; this leads to the group\u2019s journey feeling more genuine, benefiting the show and Rin\u2019s capability and likeability. Her development isn\u2019t that special but the care into developing the cast members to create a more whole experience makes the show much more praise-worthy. \\n\\n\r\nEli is my favourite character in this show; and probably my favourite anime girl in the entire medium. I don\u2019t think she is a great character overall. But, her appearance, and caring; knowledgeable and sweet personality make her special to me. Her character had great development in season 1, but this season it focuses on a different section of her character; her relationship with Nozomi. \\n\\n\r\nIn some-what of a yuri manner, the bond between these two characters is very close and they bounce of each other very well. Both clearly have a very strong relationship together; after spending a lot of time in the student-council. They are both a source of motivation for one another: as explored in Nozomi\u2019s back-story of how they met and the affection they both share. It\u2019s very sweet to see these characters interactions and tight bond with each other. They care for the group equally; especially Nozomi due to the loneliness she feels living on her own. Both are heavily endearing characters and are mature and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand Nico: A fan-favourite of the first season; Nico develops even further from her character arc in the first season. A display of her Narcissistic, self-centred attitude wishing to be praised by her family, after feeling desolation for two years from a lack of being able to find those with the same interests as her. This character arc leads to some quite charming and funny moments with the members of her family introduced, and Nico continues being as expressive as ever with her existential catchphrase \"Nico Nico Nii.\"\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the rest of the cast; most of their development took place in season 1, in which they maintain their personalities throughout the shows run. Kotori and Umi support Honoka in her aspirations and are quite pleasing characters, without any heavy development centred on them; same goes for the first years: Hanayo and Maki. While not serving super important roles into Love Live\u2019s structure or development; they complement the series very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs much as these characters do not contain much depth to them; this should not be a sign of them being bad. There\u2019s probably gropes you can have with certain characters. But for the most part the cast serve the show well for what it is: A fun display of the idol dream coming to life with a quirky roster of school students.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs animation goes for Love Live; it remains pretty generic and remains quite standard through its run-time, although this is an obvious improvement from season 1. It still doesn\u2019t reach excel in style outside of the dance segments. While the face designs between characters aren\u2019t very different from each-other; one area that works well for the show is the facial expressions: The over-exaggerated nature of these works extremely well with comedic impact. \\n\r\nLove Live definitely doesn\u2019t handle the switch between traditional and CG very well; something it has achieved later on in the franchise but at this point is still incredibly weak. While the dance scenes have pretty nice choreography and the scenes presented in the traditional animation style look wonderful the contrast between the two is quite jarring: The models being quite laggy and not blending in with surroundings very well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the first season the song choices included aren\u2019t exactly the best of what the music front of Love Live has to offer; the most memorable and emotional song of this season is \u201cSnow Halation.\u201d A song that has quite a bit of history on the internet; and one that is quite peaceful yet exciting to listen to at the same time. Another good inclusion is \u201cAishteruze Banzai\u201d which is sadly cut short in run-time from its true potential impact as a song, leaving in un-memorable. For the other songs of the show, the opening and ending are similar to that of season 1: Complementing the genre well but not being too heavily impressive. Much is the case with many other songs in this season; the general preference in songs seems to be those catering to the generic ideal style of idol songs rather than more emotional and expressive songs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is a heavily captivating show; and it\u2019s obvious how it got to the high point of success it did. Season 2 pumps out a lot of improvements to the characters, story and overall presentation making it a heavily enjoyable ride and something that will stick with me for a long-time. Watching the cast members grow is moving; the comedy is constantly hilarious. Therefore making Love Live Season 2 a show I wholeheartedly think is good even with its visible flaws.",

            "content": "I've watched IdolM@ster and came to the conclusion that it was the best Idol-related anime and cannot be compared to ...I was wrong\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project is an anime sometimes over-dramatic, but it certainly is an amazing piece of anime. And it certainly lived up to it's name for the franchise in the Anime Idol Industry.\r\nThe Story is incredibly simple, we have 9 girls who strive to win a National Idol competition called Love Live! And this was their Final chance as Three of their members are graduating after that year.\r\nDespite being simple, this anime sticks to it's 'Slice of Life' Genre so wellthat I have absolutely no complaints about. It doesn't try too hard to be comedic nor does it try too hard to be cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound, My God the sound. The Sound in this anime was absolutely Amazing, even in some over dramatic scenes the OST played was amazing, and during their Daily lives the OST played were really refreshing.\\n\r\nThe Songs used in the Lives and the Opening/Ending were Amazing as well. None of the songs were used repeatedly and all of them were sung at the right moment in the anime. \\n\r\nThe Opening \"Sore wa Bokutachi no Kiseki\" really brightens up your mood before the anime, like when you're having a bad day and when you start the episode, then when the opening song plays you go 'Wow, this really makes me feel happy'. I have a huge respect to the team that made this opening, seriously I've never skipped it even once.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art, they've really funded this anime well huh?\\n\r\nThe Art was consistent and Amazing, despite having some CG-Animation during the lives. \\n\r\n(Don't worry the CG-Animation used wasn't very much you can enjoy it to the fullest still)\\n\r\nThe Bright and colorful Art is really healthy to the eyes, you will never get bored looking at the art as it's really refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, the most unique part about this anime are the characters.\\n\r\nHonoka, Umi, Kotori, Eri, Nozomi, Hanayo, Maki, Nico, Rin - Each of them are unique making \u03bc's a really Unique group. (P.S I wrote all of their names down without using any help.) You can really not forget a single member belonging in the group.\\n\r\nAs the Story goes on, they explain each character one by one slowly but surely, leaving a deep impression onto the viewers.\\n\r\nThe Character Development was amazing as well. Honoka from being a Incapable and unreliable person, became someone important in the team acting as a pillar, that is relied on by everyone in the team.\\n\r\nPersonally to me, Nozomi and Nico's Development were the best as they were well written, Both having simple wishes, brought both to experience Ups and Downs in their Lives and how they faced it, simply amazing. Everyone in the Idol Unit will certainly not bore you, they get more mature as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nTo me I thoroughly enjoyed this series with absolutely no complaints about it. It was a very Thrilling and enjoyable ride and I can tell you this, it really left a impact on me. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Idol Animes.\\n\\n\r\nThus, ending my review. This is my first time writing a review, I'm not trying to sound Professional or anything. This are all my honest opinions on the series, and I really hope you have a Wonderful time watching the anime.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nLove Live season 2 has a great story following the first season. I only have two problems with the story. Firstly, getting into season two seems contrived as a second love live festival just happens to be held so Muse can participate. I don\u2019t mind because we got a second season, but it still seemed forced. Secondly, I hated the Halloween episode as it was an excuse for fanservice and the insert song wasn\u2019t very good.\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThis shows best points are the characters. Each character is well fleshed out and well rounded. Every major character gets screen time and a chance to develop. Noneof the characters fit into one troupe and I like that about them. The designs are also really nice and character interactions and developing friendships are nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally like the music in Love Live but feel that it\u2019s an acquired taste as all the songs are the standard candy j-pop that idol groups tend to sing. Another reason for the rating is because not all the songs are memorable. Snow Halation was the big one for this season, but the rest of them, while enjoyable, don\u2019t have a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis would be a 10 had it not been for the 3D used during performances. The animation overall in Love Live is incredible and is very high quality. Animation breakdowns are near impossible to find in the series and character designs are very nice. Dance scenes are beautifully drawn but at some points 3D rendering is used and it honestly looks terrible. Although these moments are rare, they do bring the overall quality down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Opinion: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSeason two did a magnificent job of holding onto the energy of season one and the slice of life genre while still have plot progression and a range of moments that make you laugh and cry. Overall, highly recommended.",

            "content": "Singing in front of people isn\u2019t easy. Just picture yourself in front of an audience or in an arena of over 10,000 people looking at you and perhaps almost always judging you on your performance. It\u2019s both a thrilling and nerve wrecking experience, especially for idols. But for Muse, this is exactly what they are aiming for \u2013 to perform and captivate the audience with their talent in the art of singing. Love Live School Idol Project returns for a second season starring Muse members are they find their way with music.\r\n\u03bc's (pronounced as Muse), makes its anticipated return with all its members back. Oneparticular attribute that stands out for this group is the fact that Honoka, its group leader, has also became the school council president. The sequel insightfully shows how she is able to lead her group to stardom. It\u2019s not easy given the intense competition such as popular idol group, Arise whom stands a firm obstacle in their way. Nonetheless, Honoka takes the stage and does her best to captivate the audience with her skills.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season introduced Muse\u2019s members on the surface level, the second season goes beyond that and focuses more on some of its specific characters. In retrospect, more noticeable characters such as Nico, Rin, and Nozomi all get some of spotlight. Some even get parts of their past revealed in an honest way to show the audience their journey to whom they are now. The sequel does a solid job by evoking thoughts to appreciate the person they are today. And of course, that would be taking on the role of an idol as part of Muse. It takes a group of nine girls yet each of them deliver a special charm. In one particular episode, each of them describe their condition and purpose in just one yet solidifying word. These words are honest feelings with distinctive moments to focus on an aim to success. \\n\\n\r\nEven as an underrated group, Muse continues to make a dominant presence throughout the show. The paramount of their dream comes to a climatic moment when they perform their signature song in front of the audience. Also known for their spirit and determination, Muse is an inspiring group that seeks out their dreams, chases after it, and never ceases to let it go. Win, tie, or loss, the group wants to not just aim for success but also give the audience what they want. And that, is entertainment. The majority of the sequel is built-up but the final few episodes details the fruits of their efforts. In fact, the story is fairly simple. It\u2019s about an idol group of girls aiming for success with their dreams. The catch is what happens afterwards? The sequel depicts a short yet memorable journey as their distinction could change these girls\u2019 lives forever. It also makes us wonder what happens afterwards. As the show nears its end, the girls realizes that nothing lasts forever with tearful moments to induce hardcore feelings of sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nResponsibility and teamwork are also prominent ideas incorporated to this sequel. In fact, one particular member is made temporary leader on the spot as result of special circumstances. Luckily, this adapts with teamwork as she is able to hold everything together not just by herself but with her fellow idols. By presenting itself with this direction, it creates feelings of inspiration and can be relatable when you find yourself needing a helping hand. This is especially true earlier on in the series when the girls faces the hardship of writing music by pressure. And that\u2019s what Muse really is, not just an idol group but a group of girls who shares a deep bond for music and their powerful friendship.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the premise and setup, the show does suffer a bit with some pacing issues. Some episodes feels fillerish including a trollish beach scenario. We also get some gimmicky storyline craftsmanship when it comes to execution with subplots like going on a diet habit. Also, it\u2019s somewhat noticeable that some similar scenarios and scenes are reused; not entirely trace by trace but has familiarity. The recycled ideas becomes a bit of a pin-down and in essence doesn\u2019t strongly recreate memorable moments. And despite being character focused, the series does omit highlights for some characters. The main point is that the sequel anticipates their performance in a festival against other prominent idol groups. The most developed rivalry is against the 3-girl group ARISE, who makes Muse look like an underdog. The rivalry is tense but ultimately isn\u2019t anything too explicit or made into mainstream as a main event. Rather, it trifle on the event for Muse to become superstars with predictable outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork remains standard with Sunrise being charge of the production. Characters are designed with charm, innocence, and with the passion for music. Although not supermodels, the girls have their own qualities and portrays with a beautiful grace. The decorative outfits they wear in front of the world are not just flamboyant, attractive, but also become an image of their dream. Body gestures and their dance moves also inspire creativity with no movement being wasted. It\u2019s hands down attractive not by appearance but with style, class, and inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about the soundtrack, the music would obviously be a key and in my respect, the sequel nails this right away. Although the OP song isn\u2019t something home write about, music shown and performed in this show is colorful. Lyrics are detailed with energy and enthusiasm. Prominent songs from the original project makes their way with alternate edits to deliver a symbol of Love Live. The choreography is excellent with a down-to-earth style yet remains resilient with its smooth setting. Some of the songs also shows symbolism as the animators decorates it with background gags. Additionally, the characters all have distinctive voice mannerism to reflect their personalities. The bottom line is that they are able to command attention and deliver a stellar performance in connection with the songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself isn\u2019t a masterpiece but it should be appreciable with this sequel. It\u2019s not easy being an idol but with friends, anything is possible. The way Love Live can inspire is something to take notice of as the director and animators takes advantage of its directional story. Through characterization and focus, we see different sides of characters as they take on obstacles. And although the story isn\u2019t complex or entirely thought provoking, it\u2019s honest with great comedy. Just be aware that not all the songs can be something you\u2019d enjoy, especially when compared to its original source. Yet, this sequel came, delivered, and leaves the building with endearing moments.\\n",

But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point.\r\nIt's basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the \u03bc's and want to perform at Lovelive, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is't not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way.\\n\r\nSunrise has made a big chance in every part.\\n\\n\r\nThis season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal.\\n\r\nNow that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and \u03bc's story\\n\\n\r\nLike any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED.\\n\r\nThe music got at it's peak when they released the ninth episode with \"Snow Halation\" This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it's just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??).\\n\r\nThe CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn't really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched.\\n\\n\r\nLove live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks.\\n\r\nLike i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn't, it's a huge improvement compared to the first season.\\n\\n\r\nLike any other anime It has come to it's end, the \u03bc's are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the \u03bc's!",

            "content": "To continue working on a broken piece is never easy; to fix what is broken is a hassle. It would be easier to leave it be; it would be easier to start something new, up from the ground, to leave the shambles behind, to never think of them again. However, against all odds, the first season of Love Live, no matter how broken, how unbelievably hollow, how ultimately tired and trite it all was, ended up garnering quite an audience; an audience eager to see more. It is during these times - the times when  a show that I can at best describe aslazily bland is irritatingly popular - that I tend to drown in a sea of assumptions, get tangled up in a net of nitpicking and blinded by my own cynicism. I assume that anything following a bad show can only be a bad show, strictly following the tried and tested failure of a formula of what came before it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a whole season of poorly-developed characters, badly written plot and a terrible ending, it seemed all too easy to conclude that Love Live lacks heart and soul, lacks the passion or just the competence necessary to craft a worthwhile work. But now, one season further into my study of idol degeneracy, I have experienced something I never would have thought possible: Love Live\u2019s troupe of walking tropes (mostly) turned into actually developed characters, the plot was actually solid from start to finish, the finale was actually moving. This soulless product turned into a worthwhile series. More than that, even: It felt genuine.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nAfter the spectacular failure of both a finale of a series and Muse\u2019s shot at the eponymous Love Live competition, the troupe of Muse is in a bind: they have no goal to work towards! To the luck of the girls (and the dismay of my inner cynic), Love Live starts again, but this time with an entirely different system: A direct competition in the form of a preliminary tournament serves as a substitute for the meaningless and boring ranking system that had been in place before. This more direct system sets a direct goal while at the same time presenting the great obstacle, Muse\u2019s main rival this time around, A-RISE, that they will have to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nThe system is not the only improvement in the overall structure in the show however; the plot  is very clearly, purposefully and systematically structured. At first, a new obstacle is introduced, then we spend some time actually developing the show\u2019s blanket characters and then, after finally picking up the shambles that season one left, we reach an impactful, genuinely emotional and moving melancholic finale celebrating that fantastic feat.\\n\\n\r\nIt is easy to see that many, very necessary improvements were made to the show\u2019s plot this time around, however that doesn\u2019t mean that this second season doesn\u2019t suffer from many of the same problems as the first season before it. The show still suffers from overdramatizing every bit of the way; it still suffers from jarring CG and bland music; it still suffers from a cast that is too big for the show to properly to support in its comparatively short runtime.\\n\\n\r\nThe character-focused episodes of this second season are definitely one of the main reasons why this sequel season is so much better than its predecessor. Throughout the whole first half, we get to know the girls better; we get to discover quirks, uncover truths, see bonds deepening; we get to see characters growing and reflecting (yes, even Honoka).\\n\\n\r\nWe get to experience Rin, a character formerly characterized as making a cat mouth and adding \u2018nya\u2019 to the end of every sentence, growing out of her shell and taking center stage (or rather being forced into it by the other girls). Her shying away from being the center of attention is unexpectedly connected to previous bad experiences in life which, while not completely convincing, serve as a much needed reason, a much needed background into the troubles of her character.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to know Nico\u2019s family and discover the needless web of lies the notorious best girl Nico spun around her family (which, by the way, is best family). Few things in this show are as fun as seeing Nico\u2019s snotnosed little brother play with a Muse-themed whack-a-mole while the other girls corner Nico and get her to start being honest with her siblings; few things are as heartwarming as her siblings innocently embracing their sister in spite of the fact.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see Honoka grow responsible, both as a school student council president and as the leader of Muse. After initially succumbing to irresponsibility and laziness, she, through the help of her caring but responsible friend Umi and the rest of the group, not only gets back into shape after eating one(-hundred) too many dumplings, but learns to take responsibility for her her actions and to continue moving forward in the face of adversity.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live still isn\u2019t a strong show visually, and while the backgrounds are as detailed and pleasant to look at as those present in the first season, the slight improvements to the character animation, while definitely noticeable, still aren\u2019t enough to create a strong visual package. The costumes this time around are still very pretty and fun, they do however range from fairly beautiful to frankly boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe performances this time around are as unoffensively acceptable as ever. While the constant changing between 2D and 3D animation is still pretty jarring (mostly because the CG models look like they\u2019re out of a PS2 video game), all of the performances were energetically animated. The songs are still as bland as ever, but both Snow Halation and A-RISE\u2019s performance worked very well as actual highpoints of the show and were a blast to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live\u2019s second season is an improvement worth celebrating. Numerous nitpicks and plenty of the problems present in the first season are fixed. The plot is well-structured, the characters aren\u2019t blanket sheets anymore and the finale of the show was magically moving. However, the show still suffers from many of the more infuriating issues of its predecessor, mainly stark overdramatization and a character cast too big for the show to handle. Overall worth the watch, but locked behind a lackluster first season.\\n",

            "content": "Love Live School Idol Project is not meant for me. Reviewing a show this girly and happy is pretty much impossible based on my age, sex, and what I enjoy watching. The reason I don\u2019t review Pretty Cure? I\u2019m not a ten year old girl. The reason I review Love Live? Despite obviously being a show for ten year old girls it\u2019s got a raging male fanbase that\u2019s about my age.\r\nA year ago I wrote a review for the first season that I feel, now, complains about all the wrong things. It doesn\u2019t at all hit the nail on the head for how to approachthis series. It also complains a lot about Nico. I don\u2019t know why considering she\u2019s my favorite girl in the series\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nSince that review the Love Live mobile game was released in May and, I won\u2019t lie, I play it every once in a while when I need a time-waster. Also a second season was released early last year that I neglected till now because that seems to be the way I operate.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Love Live has the girls of Muse participating in another Love Live tournament. As it will be the last chance for the seniors to win the tournament, there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Honoka and the others to perform as well as possible. They\u2019re forced to face off against their biggest rival, A-Rise and from there battle the best school idols in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe start of this season beats around the bush so much I was nearly going to quit it. I didn\u2019t remember the first season being quite so silly and pointless (but, that said, I barely remember much of anything about the first season in the first place). There\u2019s a lot of exploration of the different characters as well as a really crappy storyline about writing a new song for the Love Live tournament. This episode, in which they go to one of Maki\u2019s summer homes to get some peace, should have shown the comradeship of the girls and how they go about writing songs. What we get instead is a stupid, disjointed episode where, for some reason, they think it\u2019s a good idea to write the lyrics and the music separately.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? So if the beat of the music doesn\u2019t match the lyrics that\u2019s okay?\\n\\n\r\nTwo character episodes are actually somewhat interesting and fun. The Nico episode in which we get to see some of her family is pretty cute and the Rin episode where she\u2019s trying to act like the girl she feels she is makes you d\u2019aww.\\n\\n\r\nBut after the slow start and the somewhat interesting character exploration, we\u2019re presented with a lot of forced drama. The focus isn\u2019t that much on the Love Live or the music; unlike the first season which I commended for having a lot of catchy  songs (I still remember Start;Dash a year later). But this season\u2019s music is lacking any sort of staying power and it feels like it\u2019s put on the backburner to make room for a ton of tears.\\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes are like\u2026Ano Hana level of crying. It\u2019s sad, definitely, to see the seniors go but it\u2019s not so sad I need a whole episode dedicated to them bawling their eyes out. This is episode eleven, which is cute in execution and idea, but ends with so much forced crying that I wanted to laugh instead. It\u2019s okay to be sad and express it but don\u2019t be overexpressive. Especially on something as small as the seniors leaving.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode twelve is the concert of the Love Live. Be prepared for more cheesiness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last episode is the overlong epilogue that further drags out how sad it is the seniors are leaving then ends by\u2026teaching us not to let go of people who are moving on? I didn\u2019t understand the end at all.\\n\\n\r\nHow come you guys can\u2019t hang out after they go to college? Can\u2019t you continue to be an idol group that focuses on larger stages? Doesn\u2019t winning the Love Live mean you could do that sort of thing?\\n\\n\r\nCombine the over-dramatic and weak storytelling with the sheer girliness and you will be laughing your ass off. My God is this show cheesy with themes of friendship and love and following your dreams. The group stands together and screams things into the sky, people stand and clap for no reason, everyone acts like best friends. Oh, and don\u2019t forget the cute little exultations that come every time that the girls see something mildly amusing. I like to call these \u201canime sounds\u201d because in no other medium have I ever seen people go \u201cuguu\u201d over lights.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in the show is pretty lame as well. The character\u2019s are all easily identifiable by their two dimensional traits but the things they say can really make you laugh. At one point Honoka is staring at the city with her friends and talking about how bright the lights are. There\u2019s a huge Zen moment that makes no sense coming from a bunch of teenagers. They talk about the lights belonging to people and not knowing those people\u2026like, what the fuck? And this is followed by them all screaming at the city, completely ruining the somber, thoughtful tone. For the most part, the show if funny if only because of the crappy script.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of these complaints the show is cute as hell and still manages a laugh or two every episode that\u2019s not courtesy of being shitty.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright. Just like the first season is resorts to MMD-style during musical numbers that makes everything look awkward. There\u2019s a huge amount of close-up shots of the girls\u2019 faces which can be scary as fuck (from afar you girls are moe but up close you\u2019re freaking aliens). Otherwise it\u2019s not impressive by any stretch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the music, as I said, is weaker than season one. There\u2019s a great variety of music during the show but the actual performances aren\u2019t memorable at all.\\n\\n\r\nOh, do you hear that sound? It\u2019s time to play BEST GIRL!\\n\\n\r\n9. Honoka- I believe it was Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones who said the best way to keep an annoying bitch quiet is to put your genitals in her mouth. Honoka is the most annoying group leader of anything ever. Someone put their genitals in her mouth.\\n\r\n8. Hanayo- Moeblob von No Character. I could give a fuck less.\\n\r\n7.Umi- It\u2019s so cute when you get mad. Too bad you\u2019re boring otherwise!\\n\r\n6. Kotori- Boooooooooring. But moe as hell.\\n\r\n5.Eli- Cute but definitely not exciting.\\n\r\n4.Rin- Good development in this season. The writers need to quit overusing the \u201cNyan\u201d thing though because it\u2019s really awkward.\\n\r\n3.Nozomi- Really cute and probably the most mature of the characters. Also has a good gimmick.\\n\r\n2.Maki- Tsundere rich lesbian is cool.\\n\r\n1. Nico- May be a self-centered bitch at times but is only trying to live her dream and enjoy her passion. Totally the most adorable and best girl.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 of Love Live might be good for younger girls or guys with nothing better to masturbate to, but for me, despite a few silly and cute moments, it was pretty forgettable.\\n",

            "content": "STORY - 9\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 10\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nHonestly, it's not easy to concisely describe just how vivid the second season of School Idol Project is. A beautiful outburst of the soul. A melodic magic that lifts the heart. A lyrical expression full of emotions. These words are close enough to express how I feel but really, it's better if you listen to \u00b5's (\"Muse\") once more. Because as the saying goes:\r\n\"Where words fail, music speaks.\"\r\nEvery journey will always have a start and an end; and within it, there will always be a story. The story of \u00b5's began as a school-saving solution,and through the passing of time, their journey is reshaped into a sincerity that speaks of passionate wonders, of incredible friendship, and of valued memories. The second season is a continuation of that. With the third-years' graduation quickly drawing near, the end of \u00b5's seems nigh, but it doesn't stop them from making sure their last experience is a meaningful one. The next destination is the second Love Live! contest, and they will make sure to give everything they can to reach that grand stage.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the culmination of their experience together as a school idol group.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we're given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn't get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member's influence on one another. Whether it's to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt's this strong focus on \u00b5's as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they're not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that\u2014into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone.\\n\\n\r\nRivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of \u00b5's to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it's proof that \u00b5's has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the uplifting yet melancholic \"Snow Halation\" to the rosy \"Aishiteru Banzai!\", Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I'm sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it's the same adorable art that I've grown to love, and I don't think that needs to change.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I reflect back on my journey with \u00b5's and School Idol Project, I really couldn't have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I'm their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give \u00b5's a listen.\\n\\n\r\nMany music and memories are awaiting you.",

I could of written a review for the ova and season 1 but i didn't find out about this feature on this website. So anyway, onto my review of this shall we? This season has been an emotional roller coaster since there was a lot of sad feels into this season, not as much as the first season but i gotta say that the relationship grew so much for the members of \u00b5's ever since the first season. These two seasons of love live werefantastic and i'm glad that i found the perfect anime for me to watch on my free time. I will always be a fan to this anime and the music group \u00b5's. I hope in the future that there will be more songs from \u00b5's. \u00b5's became a part of my life since i watched the first episode of season 1. I got really attached to the characters and i can't imagine the rest of my life without them. \u00b5's is my family now and i just can't handle the rest of my life without them. \u00b5's worked really hard since season 1 and they finally reached their dream. I hope \u00b5's stays together in the future so i can continue to support them through the rest of my life. Arigato the creators and voice actresses to working so hard to produce this great anime. \u00b5's music~ start!",

            "content": "Success stories have always had a spirit that the Academy and many others have deemed inextinguishable. The soul and passion of the fight to victory has always had an undeniable effect on us humans, who have always had the hidden spirit of desire; the very desire to go the extra mile and make it to the top. And it is in these stories where we see this undeniable burning human passion. We see it in Daniel's eyes in his final match in the Karate Kid. We see it in Rocky, prepared to fight Apollo Creed with everything he has. We see it in Drumline, asthe monolithic stage overshadows our heroes. We see it in Alan Turing in his struggle to break Enigma in the Imitation Game.\\n\\n\r\nWe see it in \u03bc's, in their fight to the Love Live Championships.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live Season Two is an anime that has been described by most as 'better than season one' or 'the best idol anime ever' but the series has gone above and beyond those simple standards and has become one of the most inspiring success stories I've seen in a very long time. The story is as simple as it can get, with nine girls aiming to winning the School Idol competition known as Love Live. Though it's hard not to admit the faults of season one, the difference between the two seasons is interstellar. As I stated, the burning passion and struggles from films like Rocky or the Karate Kid is very evident here as we see, finally, what makes idols so special. Before seeing this series, I had always thought idols to be like generic pop singers only with a cutesy side to them. You can tell how obviously wrong I was. From what I've seen, idols have a very distinct nature and goal, to shower emotion over the audience in their own unique spectacle. This is what I learned from Love Live and from no one else, as the girls of \u03bc's struggle against themselves and each other. As the curtains come to a close and story of \u03bc's nears its end, we're welcomed with one of the most powerful finales of all time. You've felt this sensation before. When your little brother made that game winning goal? Or when you aced your exams? Or when you got your crush to like you? It is the spirit of achievement and reflection that make this anime truly an inspiring experience. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I have nothing against stereotypes. And when they're utilized correctly, they can do great things. In the first season of Love Live, we were introduced to, well, about nine archetypes that had adequate development to become a bit more three-dimensional. But the godly characterization of the series in only 26 episodes has turned our girls almost human. We're introduced to feelings and thoughts we never thought these characters could have, underneath their stereotypical exterior that truly defines their character as a whole. An example  is Rin who expresses a very self-defeating nature, the same we see in people who suffer insecurity, in her arc which, I have to say, does extremely well to develop her character and features one of my most favorite \u03bc's songs of all time (LOVE WIIIING. LOVE WIIIING). Honoka also gets a share of this, exceeding the 'genkiest is the leader' stereotype to a more definitive reason as to why she is the leader at all, allowing her characterization to truly define her as the one and only leader of \u03bc's. But by far the best arc belongs to Nozomi, as, not only is her character expanded to degrees above and beyond, but it develops more the special relationship the girls have as \u03bc's, the special feelings they share and why their separation would mean the end of it all. With all the characters given godly characterization, it's now not a story about Honoka, but about all of them.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't end this review without going technical. The music of Love Live is one of its main appeals, as a lot of the fans came from playing the musical game on their phones. The best thing about it is how distinct each track is in terms of delivery and emotion. The rhythm endowed that matches each story perfectly really emulates how in-tie music is with the series, unlike some others that like to just play random songs for the heck of it (K-On anyone?). The animation is also above average which is to be expected coming from Gundam-Printing company Sunrise. The design is stellar and gives these different girls a sort of unique flare that gives them distinction and makes them special. If it were not for the blonde hair, the ponytail and the baby blue eyes, Eli would not be my waifu today.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any way to describe this series, it would be inspiring. Being able to correlate both characters and story to the spirit of achievement, boiling with human desire and passion, in a way that is almost Grammy worthy makes this series truly amazing. Despite the somewhat flaky season one, season two is able to craft a story with meaning, emotion and passion. \\n\\n\r\nWith top-notch characterization, a definitive success story and roaring emotion, I can proudly say that Love Live Season Two is one of the best of the best. \\n\\n\r\n(Written in honor of the Final Live and the end of the VAs's contract next year.  You will be dearly missed, \u03bc's) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Not too long ago I looked at Love Live. The anime portion of a multi-media project. It was an enjoyable series. The first series introduced us to \u00b5's (pronounced Muse.) \u00b5's formed with three members in order to gain interest in their school to prevent it shutting down. We saw the original three gradually grow into nine. We saw the nine girls coming together as friends & comrades, doing live shows and getting really, really, really homo-erotic with one another. So, our heroines managed to save their school in the end. Where are they going to go from there?\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Honoka giving a speechas the brand new student council President. Turns out Eri recommended her for the position. Hanayo is interrupted at practice by the news that they're doing another Love Live competition. Most members of \u00b5's are excited by the prospect and eager to enter but Honoka is strangely uninterested, saying that things are fine as they are. The girls are able to persuade her that \u00b5's should enter by pointing out that this will be Nozomi, Eri & Nico's last chance to compete in the competition since they're graduating shortly after. They're also able to ascertain why Honoka hesitated. The story follows \u00b5's and their endeavour to win the competition, their coming to terms with the third years graduating and them just having fun and being yurirrific.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the narrative in this series is that the main arc surrounding the competition is really predictable. You can pretty easily guess where it's going to go just from the set up, without watching a single episode of the series. The series does do a lot well, though. The comedy in this is really effective. The first series was pretty entertaining and had some good comedic moments, but this one elevates it to a completely different level. There are also some really good moments in the main narrative, in spite of its general predictability and there is some effective tension surrounding the graduation and the question of where \u00b5's is going to go from there. The ending is a bit bitter-sweet but it's really effective.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe girls get to develop further as characters than they did in the first series. There are several episodes primarily dedicated to developing them as characters and adding depth to the archetypes. Rin and Nozomi both get really good ones. I will also give this series credit over the first, Nozomi's bad touch habit is virtually non-existent in this one. She gropes another girl without permission once. Which is still completely not okay, but at least it's not a regular thing like it was in the first series. I bet Eri threatened to break up with her if she kept groping other girls. Either way, the combination of that getting toned significantly down and her focus episode combine to transform Nozomi into a really good character. The characters are still a lot of fun and there are still really good interactions, including some with the rival idol group, A-Rise.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the first series, this one has really good costumes and dance numbers. The characters are still basically missing their noses, though. I think this art style was designed by someone with rhinophobia. That would explain so much. In spite of that, the art and animation are good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is excellent. Love Live has singers who are also excellent in their roles. See, Ice, it is possible to have people who can do both. The music is superb. Both series of Love Live have really mazing soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to see why yuri fans gravitate towards this franchise. The les-yay levels are massive. Really, any potential pairing would make sense but there are some that come across more strongly than others. Rin and Hanyo continue to be really adorable. We've also got Nozomi and Eri, who also get quite a bit of les-yay with both Maki and Nico. Honoka, Umi and Kotori are all really homo-erotic with one another.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nLove Live series 2 is a definite improvement over the first. The characters are strengthened. The comedy is more effective and the story, overall, has more going for it. It's not perfect, but it's well worth watching. My final rating on it is going to be a 9/10. The first series was good. This one is excellent. Next week I'll look at Solty Rei.",

            "content": "This review will cover the second season of LLSIP. I'll probably make some comparisons here and there to the first season but if you're interested in what I've had to say for the first season, please see the review I wrote for it beforehand.\r\nLove Live, for me, is one of those series that, before watching, I thought I wouldn't like a bit, but after actually heading into it, I ended up loving it. Also, I honestly can't believe I've missed it all this time.\r\nHaving said a lot in my review of the first season already, I feel like there isn't much to add here. Thesecond season of Love Live tops the first one, which had a rather rocky start, in all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't enjoy the first season as much but still like the show enough to make you want to see more from it, I can be certain when I say that you will feel rewarded at the end of another ~260 minute run. It looks better, feels better, is better in general and more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, who I've had an objective issue with in the first season, actually felt like genuine characters this time around. There is definitely an amount of care put into handling them which can be noticed as you take your time through the season but that can also be seen in the plot as well. A matching pace this time around, rewarding plot-line and, overall, experience.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really talk about the artstyle unless it's too hideous or fascinating to note, but improvements can be seen there as well. The enviroment and characters just look better, I'd say they had more life in them compared to the first season. Love Live looks just fine in general, though some might find the CGI to be somewhat distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThis should be a given, but Love Live has an amazing soundtrack, being an idol anime. It makes a return and finds its way to stay of on-point quality, appeal as each song showcases a new stage for \u00b5's and as an advancement route for the group as performers and people. I find the peak of music in LLSIP to be ''Snow Halation'', a track that showcases \u00b5's and their appeal. It is an absolutely amazing uplifting albeit sad vocal piece that I have a special place for both subjectively and objectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of passion & hype that surrounded Love Live all this time is something I never really understood, until now. I think it will manage to claw itself in as one of the franchises I am most emotionally engaged with and I can't wait to see more from it.",

            "content": "\u201cBut you guys make me want to root for you for some reason.\u201d - Yukiho Kousaka\r\nNote that this review will cover the two inseparable seasons of Love Live! School Idol Project.\r\nI don\u2019t get idols. A bunch of adorable girls sing and dance their heart out on stage and everyone loves it. And that\u2019s exactly what Love Live is. The only difference is that I actually get it.\r\nI had the honor of picking up Love Live as my very first idol anime due to a friend\u2019s humble (and passionately incessant) request. It\u2019s nothing amazing but it\u2019s something special; simple in its message yet powerful in itselocution. It\u2019s a refreshing wake-up call for everyone who wants to\u2026\\n\\n\r\n*sighs*\\n\\n\r\n\u2026 follow their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unexpectedly, I fell in love with that message in all its starry-eyed wonder.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 8\\n\\n\r\nA school is on the verge of closing. A second-year high school girl notices the idol hype. And just like that she assembles two of her closest friends and forms a ragtag idol group in a noble attempt to save the school. Little by little that idol group grows in number; catching the attention of freshmen and juniors alike while touching the hearts of many. Love Live is a story about the nine-girl idol sensation later known as \u03bc\u2019s (Muse); their humble beginnings, their struggles, and their rise to fame.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward and linear plot with some slice-of-life breaks in between. But if there\u2019s one thing Love Live does well, it\u2019s the execution and pacing that delivers unwavering enthusiasm in the midst of constantly growing challenges the group faces. The show doesn't pander much with its fanservice-prone premise (considering the costumes, performances, and character designs and archetypes are fanservice enough). It goes right into the ideal idol experience; from formation and training to national participation and recognition. Love Live has a clear goal with a plot actively working towards it.\\n\\n\r\nThe two seasons, each composed of 12 episodes, have a systematic format in progressing the story. Presentation and resolution.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season introduced the members and established each of their conflicts while the second resolved those conflicts to fully flesh-out the true potential of \u03bc\u2019s as an idol group and a solid circle of friends. Streamlining the series this way made it feel more dynamic and continuous. There\u2019s hardly a dull moment since the show didn't needlessly drag the story. The energy never dies, the stakes keep getting higher, and fillers function more as a breather with added character focus before the plot kicks right back in.\\n\r\nThough the barriers of entry for \u03bc\u2019s from small-time idol group are a challenge in itself, the spirit of competition isn't really present with only one main contender given mention, UTX high school\u2019s A-rise, who are ranked top in the idol group charts. To compensate, time is given to focus more on the inner workings of \u03bc\u2019s as well as their impact on the school and more importantly, themselves. The story, though lacking depth, promises a lot of heart (and sweat\u2026 and tears) which grips the viewer in the same way idols earn fans.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhen you hear the words \u201cLove Live,\u201d you expect something bright and cheerful. Sunrise caught the message and multiplied \u201cbright and cheerful\u201d by 9 in the form of high school girls along with the rest of the cast. The results are freakin\u2019 adorable; a cross between trademark schoolgirl and childlike dreamer. This might go for most shows of the same market but hear me out. \\n\\n\r\nThe eyes are the window to the soul. Eyes here are more round than wide and convey even the most minute shifts in expressions especially during parts when the show isn't so bright. Not only are Love Live\u2019s eyes a window, they\u2019re a magnet; attractive both literally and figuratively. They\u2019re fresh and innocent; full of youthful wonder, passion, and determination. Those eyes look at you and won\u2019t let you look at anyone else. You want to hear what they have to say and see what they have to prove and that immensely aids in character attachment. \\n\\n\r\nEnough about eyes. Colors are strong and vivid with soft edges, evoking the utopian rose-colored high school everyone in the anime world is after. Animation is of average caliber since not much motion is involved\u2026 outside the performances and more powerful scenes. Everything scales up for their live shows; from the stage and costumes down to the individual choreography.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line, the art is cute and I always have room for cute.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 7\\n\\n\r\nI would\u2019ve given this a 6. Funny to give this a rather fair rating when the show\u2019s mostly centered around sound. In a series densely populated with standard upbeat j-pop, which mind you is one of my less preferred genres, I find myself never skipping all the openings and endings and soaking in all the live shows. Head-bobbing, appreciative lyric/subtitle-reading, and attentive musical listening aside, music is relatively standard. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus, who are also the singers, did an amazing job in making each character distinct and familiar. Voices not only fit each respective personality type but also convert well in performances. Based on listening, voices in live shows are categorized in 3 pitch levels (sensual deep, powerful midtone, and cutesy high pitch). Objectively, sound is just above average. Subjectivity however, bumped up the score for me. I\u2019ll go more into that later.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the characters really do start off as stereotypes. We have Honoka, the optimist prime with ditzy tendencies, Kotori, the supportive moe bait, Umi, the straight man + shrinking violet, Hanayo, the glasses girl who\u2019s also a closet Stan, Maki, the rich tsundere loner, Rin, the tomboyish genki \u2018cat\u2019 girl, Eli, the partly-Russian virtuoso bitch, Nozomi, the motherly (well-endowed) weird girl, and Nico, the childish, superficial devil who\u2019s the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes. They have their verbal tics, quirky mannerisms, and own up to who they are. They\u2019re fun, direct, and accessible. You don\u2019t need to think too hard on them because what you see is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, the show eases in shifts in character that are largely attributed to the effect of \u03bc\u2019s on their personality. It\u2019s a lighthearted process of each character warming up to the group while settling their own personal scores. And in the course of events, some magic happens.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10 \\n\\n\r\nYou start to feel like a part of \u03bc\u2019s. You realize the passion behind the songs, the costumes, and the dance moves. You start to cheer them on in every endeavor. You feel their pain and relief in every challenge. And you enjoy every bit of it; the way \u03bc\u2019s intended it.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in Love Live was designed for enjoyment. Not in the sense of taking pleasure in our own preferences, but in the general spirit of being caught up in the moment, letting go of our worries, and pursuing our own unreachable fantasies in the same way \u03bc\u2019s did.\\n\\n\r\nAll that enjoyment can be attributed to something innate in all our social investments; sentimental attachment. It\u2019s that state of getting attuned to the story, characters, the music and the lyrics, and the certain inflections in animation when you start feeling for each of the group's triumphs and hesitations. For instance, Honoka\u2019s innocent optimism is a sweet reminder of that child in you who thought he/she could do anything; carefree yet admirable. She passively commands \u03bc\u2019s with sheer determination and directs the same message down to their songs with visible signs of pent-up anxiety and exhilaration. Seeing that same force break down to reality hurts. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side-note, this show does a great job in visualizing pent-up feelings. You just know a character\u2019s gonna lose it, but they don\u2019t. It\u2019s strangely bittersweet. The show at its core is a heartfelt shout-out to the last time you truly shared your enjoyment with others.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8\\n\\n\r\nInfectiously optimistic with a sweet dose of innocent ambition, Love Live is a celebration of the overflowing passion within us, demonstrating a good balance of character chemistry and plot buildup that creates immense character attachment. Sunrise is a genius for capitalizing on adorable character designs, idol pop groups, and a plethora of catchy songs to impart a message we've all heard before, but need to be reminded of every once in a while. \\n",

            "content": "The only times I ever binge-watch anime is when I'm either extremely bored or the series is extremely entertaining. Although the 2nd season of Love Live! School Idol Project is far from being a masterpiece or one of my all-time favorite shows, it's oddly addicting and, most importantly, far better than the first season. \r\nDespite being turned off by the many problems the first season had, the positive reviews and the amazing art made me want to continue watching this show. Luckily, I was not disappointed.\r\nAlthough the music is still a bit too generic and immature for my personal taste, there are lots of funnew songs and dance sequences. The dance sequences seem to have definitely improved as the CG is either used less or in a more subtle way (or maybe I've just become used to it). As such, all of the performances are seriously striking and make you wish you were up on stage dancing with \u03bc's, too. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the art is as gorgeous as ever (if not more so) and features some of the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in anime. The voice acting does not disappoint either, and the girls quickly transition from sounding slightly annoying to actually sounding kind of cute.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, however, the story itself is far more interesting. Although the girls are still trying to participate in the Love Live! Contest and face many problems along the way, their struggles now seem far more believable and even relate-able, specially for fellow girls (after all, who has never dealt with the horrors of gaining weight, feeling awkward when wearing cute outfits and enduring painful workouts and diets?) \\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, there is far more emphasis on the girls as individuals with their own fears and ambitions rather than simple singing blobs that all love each other for no apparent reason. By showing more of their family, childhood memories, and personal problems, it is easier to see them as real human beings that try really hard to fulfill their dreams. Unsurprisingly, their relationships also benefit greatly from this and allow for far more genuine interactions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a surprisingly enjoyable show that, while slightly cheesy and juvenile, portrays human relationships, struggles, failures and successes in a way that is both beautiful and believable.",

            "content": "As a continuation from the season 1...\r\nSeason 2 of Love Live is fortunately, a Critically important watch for those who enjoyed the initial 13 episodes.\r\nIt holds onto its ability to really motivate its audience.\r\nIt's upbeat, its charming, it allows for more development, and brings the main series to a well wrapped up, beautiful ending.\r\nLove Live is to be commended for the way it sticks to its motives, it's simple if plotted on a timeline, and uses each and every episode to its fullest, as opposed to going off on spontaneous Moe tangents. Love Live continues to weave its way into your heart in Season 2,by developing all of the characters rather well. Yes, even the more shadowed ones that didn't have time to be fully covered in the first half.\\n\\n\r\nNow whereas this usually implies a formulaic series of episodes, Season 2 is instead great in the way that everything is relevant, and integrated into the main plot. This gives the show a more seamless presentation; and while the goal in mind for U's continues to be refreshed, it invokes a sense of excitement even in the most cynical of viewers (i'm sure).\\n\\n\r\nThe methods of Love Live don't change - except for an increase in sentimental references, and emotional, reflective scenes as it comes to a close - but in this sequel series that exists to further develop every aspect, it means that lovers of the original; will come to appreciate the series even more. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound aspects remains flawless, and as i became significantly more attached to characters in these past few days, I've been able to enjoy it all a bit more on the whole. I guess you could say that a weakness of Season 1 (that has been filled in Season 2) - was that it all felt a bit more distant, as in 13 episodes, SUNRISE had to set the scene, cover half of the story, and do their best to convey the personality of each character. Whereas this developed from a casual attitude-oriented perception of each, Season 2 delves deeper, to make it all feel more personal, and more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nMotivational, a feel-good anime throughout, excellently presented, good story despite the limitations of dedicating solely to the Idol genre, all over; a beauty - though definitely a bit cheesy at times... Kind of like this review!",

            "content": "If there have been any worries about the future of the idol genre, Love Live 2 has dispelled them. \r\nIt's hard to deny that the first season of Love Live began with a rocky start. There wasn't much to set itself apart from other idol shows (especially with the likes of Idolmaster and Aikatsu dominating the genre) and it fell prone to melodrama far more than it should have. But, much like K-ON's mediocre first season and excellent second season, Love Live 2 has managed to do more than improve upon its predecessor - it has genuinely become an amazing anime. \r\nI won't lie, Iwas no fan of the franchise when the TV series made its debut in early 2013. I dropped it after the first episode aired and wondered later on what people saw in the series. But now having finished the second season, Love Live has become one of my favourite anime franchises. \\n\\n\r\nCertainly it is not an anime that will test the mind or change anyone's life. It is simply a story of nine teenage girls forming an idol group together. However, it would be an insult to describe Love Live as yet another \"cute girls doing cute things\" anime, as it is a far more meaningful experience. The drama feels genuine this time around, and by the end it is hard to prevent the tears from rolling when the story of \u03bc's reaches its end. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the very first episode of the second season, it is clear that Sunrise has made a significant effort to improve the series. It looks better, sounds better, feels better and is far more fun to watch. Most importantly, the girls of \u03bc's all feel like genuine characters now. Honoka's passion makes her truly seem like the leader and centre of the group, whereas the first season didn't have much reason beyond \"well, somebody had to be the leader, right?\" Even the characters who were given little to no screen-time in the first season (Rin, Eli, Nozomi and Hanayo) are fleshed and given their own episode to shine. It is finally a story about the nine of them. \\n\\n\r\nConsidering there have only been twenty-six episodes to develop a cast of nine characters, Sunrise has done a commendable job of doing so without neglecting the story in return. Perhaps the characters could have benefited from another season of episodes, but they hardly feel lacking by the end. The addition of a rival idol group (A-RISE) also makes the story feel less insular. It is no longer confined to the school itself, and with the school's closure no longer being an issue, the girls can finally focus on performing as idols do. \\n\\n\r\nNico is easily one of the show's greatest assets. Sure, her \"nico nico-nii\" catchphrase is cute and all (I go a little bit crazy whenever she utters it), but Nico's presence accomplishes far more than simply being a vehicle for the cute. Of all the character-focused episodes, Nico's is the greatest. It shows that she really, truly cares about the group and is not simply in it for pride and ego. The idol industry is Nico's life, the act of being an idol her most treasured dream. She cares deeply for her siblings and performs primarily to make them smile. She's a kind person inside- contrary to her rough behaviour with the rest of \u03bc's. Perhaps that behaviour may make her somewhat unsuitable for the role of an idol, but she's more serious about it than anyone else. Nico may not be idealised as idols usually are, but that flawed, genuinely human side of her makes her makes her all the more loveable, I think. Even if she does not resonate with you as a character, it's hard to deny that she at least provides an interesting contrast with the rest of \u03bc's. It would not be anywhere near as interesting without her.\\n\\n\r\nThe story peaks in the last four episodes. With the graduation of the third-years quickly drawing closer, a tear-filled goodbye seems inevitable. It is very similar to the final episodes of K-ON's second season. With the prospect of Nico leaving and \u03bc's potentially being disbanded after graduation, I could not help but feel my chest tighten a bit. And then the final episode really drove those feelings home. Perhaps they'll join together once again and find careers as professional idols. I doubt it is the end for Nico, Eli and Honoka.\\n\\n\r\nLike most idol anime, Love Live has a fantastic soundtrack. All the songs the girls perform carry their own theme and message, and none of them (aside from the opening and ending) are used more than once in the anime. Each song represents a new stage for \u03bc's, another step forward as performers and as people. The music peaks with the performance of \"Snow Halation\" in the ninth episode, a rising, sad yet uplifting piece that showcases the appeal of \u03bc's. It is probably one of the best vocal tracks I have heard in an anime to date. There is also a really cool scene at the end of the 12th episode that I won't spoil. Everything with the music sorts of 'clicks' in that moment. \\n\\n\r\nIt should be noted though that the ninth episode does blunder a bit with its choice of music. As the second-years traverse through a snowstorm, there is an incredibly melodramatic, orchestral piece blasting in the background that would feel more appropriate were demons from hell rising up and setting Earth on fire or something. The second season has improved so much that it is frustrating to see it regress to the first season's melodrama, even for just a brief moment. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the visuals, Love Live looks well above average. The CGI during the performances can be a little bit distracting (and I know some people despise CGI of any form) but between that and low frame-rate, off-model animation, I would gladly take the CGI. It certainly looks better than Aikatsu's CGI, anyway. The rest of the visuals on the other hand holds up reasonably well. There are scenes here and there where lazy, static shots are used for longer than necessary, and while it certainly is no Attack on Titan, Love Live looks just fine. \\n\\n\r\nLove Live has come a long way from its slow beginnings. While it will hardly convert anyone who detests the 'moe' art style, those who have even the slightest inkling of interest in the series will likely find the second season to be at the very top of the idol (and perhaps even music) genre. An anime can be both cute and a genuinely great story, as is demonstrated here. \\n\\n\r\nNow, where's my Nico spin-off?",

            "content": "After finishing 1st Season of Love Live: School Idol Project, I must say, Season 2 sure stepped up it's game. I enjoyed Season 1 a lot too, but Season 2 has just been something else for me.\r\nFor those of you who don't know, Love Live: School Idol Project is based off of a real live idol group called Nine Muses. They all go by different names in the anime itself, but it's a pretty neat concept. Their goal in Season 1 is to keep the school from shutting down by forming an idol group.\r\nIn Season 2, their goal is to make the Love Live, andwin it all, this will be the last chance for them to do this together as members of the group are graduating after their third year.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nSimply, I don't like many music/idol animes. They stray too far away from the main plot. Often times, they become too focused on being cute, and adorable, much like K-On! did, and steer away from the story as a whole, and for me that's a complete turnoff. With Love Live: School Idol Project, I have not had to worry about that at all. The story is not really comedic in any form, which in turn makes the quality that much better as it truly focuses on it being a slice of life anime, rather then throwing little \"hilarious\" moments all over the place.\\n\\n\r\nIn Season 2, we see a lot more drama, heartache, and realization. After eating through all 13 episodes, it's been nothing short of emotional, and I love it.  The theme stays the same, where they're all dedicated to making the best of their school idol group while they can, and they continue to have a goal in mind that they can strive for together. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is once again fantastic, other than, in my opinion the 3D they use for their performances. I dislike 3D animation, but that's my preference. Other than that, I thought it was really good. I love the costumes they wear during their performances as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound, well, if you're watching an anime about school idols, I'm pretty sure you expect good music, and this is nothing short of that. Snow Halation, one of the songs they perform in this season, was just phenomenal (And it's a real song by Nine Muse's, check it out!). I personally enjoy the music they sing, and the BGM is well placed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, well, there's nine of them, so I'm not going to run through each one as I'd probably do a messy job anyways. I'll just say that each one of these characters, Nico, Nozomi, Eli, Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Rin, Hayano, and Maki are all unique characters in their group. They all have had struggles (As seen in season 1) and coming into season 2 that's no different, however, they have developed incredibly over the span of this season. They've all conquered certain issues with themselves, and they've done this together as a group. That's one of the huge striking points for me, is that no matter what situation they're in, they figure it out together, and they're all there for one another whenever it's called for. Easily the characters are the strongest point within this anime.\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nQuite honestly, I've never really enjoyed an anime that's been centred around music much like Love Live. This has been such a fun ride for myself, and while I don't think this anime is for everyone, I'd fully recommend you at least give it a try. I'm pretty sure you'll connect with the characters in one way or another, and that's one of the many reasons this anime is so special.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think I've ever cried such happy tears before. Best choice I made watching this series, all because of a Nico-Ni .gif.\\n",

            "content": "When Love Live! School Idol Project first aired in Japan, it became a hit sensation, captivating the hearts of many. The show was surprisingly good, with an enjoyable cast, entertaining songs, and a solid story. It was a massive success, and with its popularity came a second season. This might make some people feel anxious, thinking this to be a sell out for more money, but their worries can be put to ease; regardless of its intentions, I believe this second season to be even greater than the first time around.\r\nSpoilers for the first season to follow.\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project Second Season follows \u03bc\u2019sas they get a second chance at the Love Live idol competition after their withdrawal from the first. Beyond that however, the girls are forced to look farther ahead and contemplate the future of \u03bc\u2019s as the third year\u2019s graduation begins to rapidly approach. The story isn\u2019t anything too original, but that\u2019s overshadowed by the fact that it\u2019s done well. Love Live!\u2019s second season will make you laugh and feel good, but at the same time it can bring you to tears. There is a lot of emotion packed into its later episodes, and when the season comes to a close, you won\u2019t want to see them go. The story is brought to a finish with an ending that wraps everything up nicely, making it a satisfying journey from beginning to end. \\n\\n\r\n\u03bc\u2019s brings multiple main characters to the table, so there\u2019s a guarantee you\u2019ll love at least one of them, if not all of them. From genki girl Honoka to narcissistic Nico, there\u2019s a lot of variety to be had. More important than that, however, is that the show still manages to bring some depth and development to these characters despite there being so many. The spotlight is given to the girls who weren\u2019t featured during the first season, such as Nico and Rin, but development still continues for the others, such as in Honoka and Umi. Add to that some nice side characters like all the imoutos, as well as some actual presence from the rival idol group A-RISE, not to mention those amazing alpacas, and it is clear that the show does a wonderful job with its loveable cast. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, this being an idol show and all, the music is a major component of this show, and I feel it doesn\u2019t fail in this regard. The OP and ED are pretty good, matching the feel of the series quite well. The insert songs are really the standout though, with a mood and lyrics that depict the moments of the show magnificently. My favorite of the bunch definitely has to be \u201cSnow Halation\u201d; when it is being sung, I had shivers going down my spine. Of course, the rest of the bunch is great too, such as \u201cAishteru Banzai\u201d, \u201cLove & Peace\u201d, and even a return of the opening of the first season, which is tied in nicely. The soundtrack is pretty great as well fitting the mood nicely and bringing the tension and emotion when it needs to be brought. Overall, the music of the series is great, as it should be.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all nice to look at, and there\u2019s probably going to be a design that you love because of the massive cast. The animation runs smoothly for the most part, and can be pretty beautiful at times as well, such as during the performance of the aforementioned \u201cSnow Halation\u201d. One problem that I did have with this show, however, is the CG that is used during the song performances. It is pretty jarring and takes away from what would otherwise be beautiful scenes. Thankfully, the usage of the CG has decreased and the quality has increased slightly from the last season, so it wasn\u2019t as bad as before, but I still wasn\u2019t a big fan of it. Other than that though, this is quite a beautiful show to look at.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was a very entertaining show to watch. Even with the bothersome CG, watching the girls of \u03bc\u2019s working to win the Love Live and performing their songs was a wonderful experience. This second season made me fall in love with \u03bc\u2019s even more than the first season had. Anyone who liked the first season will definitely love this; even if you didn\u2019t, I feel as though the second season was a great step up from the first, so you might still enjoy it. While the story is brought to a close for now, I can\u2019t wait to see what the Love Live! series has in store for us next.\\n\\n\r\nReady?\\n\\n\r\n\u03bc\u2019s music start!!\\n",

            "content": "Ambition \u2013 the driving force of a goal.\r\nThere\u2019s no doubt that season 1 of Love Live is a truly weak series. There was a lack of detail to characterization; the flow of the plot was all over the place: Shoving cute girls and memes down your throat and then ending on some of the worst melodrama present in anime at the end. \r\nIt would be easy to pass off the second season as equally irresponsible as the first; but oddly enough the second season of Love Live works wonders. This improvement in quality it ascends Love Live from being a trashy meme-fest into something oftrue emotion even if contrived at many points.\\n\\n\r\nGo for glory; the goal set in mind for the group.\\n\r\nAfter saving their school and realising the little time they have left as a group with the third year students graduating; the nine girls of Muse up the ante by setting out to win Love Live!\\n\r\nA simple plot really, but what makes this concept work so well is the structure of this season. Character based episodes and moments of bonding help flesh out the cast well enough while still building the story up to its climax. The fun notion and diverse story of each episode and improved comedy makes the ride endearing; episodes centred on the girls watching romantic films; Honoka and Hanayo losing weight and other quirky concepts that make the show constantly engaging; even if to poke fun at. These episodes are mostly comprised of interaction between the nine main characters; and whilst still conceivably stereotypical, they enhance the overall enjoyment of the show. Achieving a much better structure than what the first season achieved.\\n\\n\r\nThis season also manages to be quite emotional with reminiscence of the journey the members of the group embarked on, the daunting realisation the girls feel as their final concert together as Muse draws near; all of it feels so content.  The dedication; the journey, everything the anime throws at you has you rooting for the girls in one way or another. By the end of the anime there\u2019s enough development into each area of the show; that you may be able to look back in joy and appreciation at the story as a whole, and the bonds with each member of the group. Sure there are many times where elements of the show become questionable and writing feels weak; such as certain road-blocks for the group, seemingly dumb character actions, and a focus too heavily oriented on appealing as a Slice of Life oriented series; but that feeling of bitter-sweet progression for the group through this season make this a wonderful and whole-rounded experience. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOf course the story wouldn\u2019t receive this much praise if it was not for the development the characters received this season. In Season 1, many of the cast was under-developed with not much attention onto each characters ambitions and what holds the group together. In this season we\u2019re shown brighter, memorable captivating versions of the group. With more attention to their ambitions; their relationships and bonds as the group \u201cMuse.\u201d\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonoka receives some of the nicest development in this season compared to her personality in season 1; she\u2019s still quite obnoxious, ditsy and dumb. But her role as the leader of Muse becomes more important this time round, with the new-found position of student council president she matures slightly and ditches all hesitation: Leading the members of Muse on their path to victory while still managing activities brought on by being president. She\u2019s not a character worthy of much praise in the grand scheme of things, but her drive and aspirations to win Love Live not only for herself but for those around her who have helped her get this far is touching.\\n\\n\r\nRin is the most noteworthy example of Love Live doing character development correctly. From an un-important side character from season 1; Rin evolves into a character that learns to stop doubting herself and breaks out of her shell. Improving confidence of her character and the rest of the cast is necessary to strengthen the bond between Muse; this leads to the group\u2019s journey feeling more genuine, benefiting the show and Rin\u2019s capability and likeability. Her development isn\u2019t that special but the care into developing the cast members to create a more whole experience makes the show much more praise-worthy. \\n\\n\r\nEli is my favourite character in this show; and probably my favourite anime girl in the entire medium. I don\u2019t think she is a great character overall. But, her appearance, and caring; knowledgeable and sweet personality make her special to me. Her character had great development in season 1, but this season it focuses on a different section of her character; her relationship with Nozomi. \\n\\n\r\nIn some-what of a yuri manner, the bond between these two characters is very close and they bounce of each other very well. Both clearly have a very strong relationship together; after spending a lot of time in the student-council. They are both a source of motivation for one another: as explored in Nozomi\u2019s back-story of how they met and the affection they both share. It\u2019s very sweet to see these characters interactions and tight bond with each other. They care for the group equally; especially Nozomi due to the loneliness she feels living on her own. Both are heavily endearing characters and are mature and beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand Nico: A fan-favourite of the first season; Nico develops even further from her character arc in the first season. A display of her Narcissistic, self-centred attitude wishing to be praised by her family, after feeling desolation for two years from a lack of being able to find those with the same interests as her. This character arc leads to some quite charming and funny moments with the members of her family introduced, and Nico continues being as expressive as ever with her existential catchphrase \"Nico Nico Nii.\"\\n\\n\r\nRegarding the rest of the cast; most of their development took place in season 1, in which they maintain their personalities throughout the shows run. Kotori and Umi support Honoka in her aspirations and are quite pleasing characters, without any heavy development centred on them; same goes for the first years: Hanayo and Maki. While not serving super important roles into Love Live\u2019s structure or development; they complement the series very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs much as these characters do not contain much depth to them; this should not be a sign of them being bad. There\u2019s probably gropes you can have with certain characters. But for the most part the cast serve the show well for what it is: A fun display of the idol dream coming to life with a quirky roster of school students.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs animation goes for Love Live; it remains pretty generic and remains quite standard through its run-time, although this is an obvious improvement from season 1. It still doesn\u2019t reach excel in style outside of the dance segments. While the face designs between characters aren\u2019t very different from each-other; one area that works well for the show is the facial expressions: The over-exaggerated nature of these works extremely well with comedic impact. \\n\r\nLove Live definitely doesn\u2019t handle the switch between traditional and CG very well; something it has achieved later on in the franchise but at this point is still incredibly weak. While the dance scenes have pretty nice choreography and the scenes presented in the traditional animation style look wonderful the contrast between the two is quite jarring: The models being quite laggy and not blending in with surroundings very well. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the first season the song choices included aren\u2019t exactly the best of what the music front of Love Live has to offer; the most memorable and emotional song of this season is \u201cSnow Halation.\u201d A song that has quite a bit of history on the internet; and one that is quite peaceful yet exciting to listen to at the same time. Another good inclusion is \u201cAishteruze Banzai\u201d which is sadly cut short in run-time from its true potential impact as a song, leaving in un-memorable. For the other songs of the show, the opening and ending are similar to that of season 1: Complementing the genre well but not being too heavily impressive. Much is the case with many other songs in this season; the general preference in songs seems to be those catering to the generic ideal style of idol songs rather than more emotional and expressive songs. \\n\\n\\n\r\nLove Live is a heavily captivating show; and it\u2019s obvious how it got to the high point of success it did. Season 2 pumps out a lot of improvements to the characters, story and overall presentation making it a heavily enjoyable ride and something that will stick with me for a long-time. Watching the cast members grow is moving; the comedy is constantly hilarious. Therefore making Love Live Season 2 a show I wholeheartedly think is good even with its visible flaws.",

            "content": "I've watched IdolM@ster and came to the conclusion that it was the best Idol-related anime and cannot be compared to ...I was wrong\r\nLove Live! School Idol Project is an anime sometimes over-dramatic, but it certainly is an amazing piece of anime. And it certainly lived up to it's name for the franchise in the Anime Idol Industry.\r\nThe Story is incredibly simple, we have 9 girls who strive to win a National Idol competition called Love Live! And this was their Final chance as Three of their members are graduating after that year.\r\nDespite being simple, this anime sticks to it's 'Slice of Life' Genre so wellthat I have absolutely no complaints about. It doesn't try too hard to be comedic nor does it try too hard to be cute. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sound, My God the sound. The Sound in this anime was absolutely Amazing, even in some over dramatic scenes the OST played was amazing, and during their Daily lives the OST played were really refreshing.\\n\r\nThe Songs used in the Lives and the Opening/Ending were Amazing as well. None of the songs were used repeatedly and all of them were sung at the right moment in the anime. \\n\r\nThe Opening \"Sore wa Bokutachi no Kiseki\" really brightens up your mood before the anime, like when you're having a bad day and when you start the episode, then when the opening song plays you go 'Wow, this really makes me feel happy'. I have a huge respect to the team that made this opening, seriously I've never skipped it even once.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art, they've really funded this anime well huh?\\n\r\nThe Art was consistent and Amazing, despite having some CG-Animation during the lives. \\n\r\n(Don't worry the CG-Animation used wasn't very much you can enjoy it to the fullest still)\\n\r\nThe Bright and colorful Art is really healthy to the eyes, you will never get bored looking at the art as it's really refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters, the most unique part about this anime are the characters.\\n\r\nHonoka, Umi, Kotori, Eri, Nozomi, Hanayo, Maki, Nico, Rin - Each of them are unique making \u03bc's a really Unique group. (P.S I wrote all of their names down without using any help.) You can really not forget a single member belonging in the group.\\n\r\nAs the Story goes on, they explain each character one by one slowly but surely, leaving a deep impression onto the viewers.\\n\r\nThe Character Development was amazing as well. Honoka from being a Incapable and unreliable person, became someone important in the team acting as a pillar, that is relied on by everyone in the team.\\n\r\nPersonally to me, Nozomi and Nico's Development were the best as they were well written, Both having simple wishes, brought both to experience Ups and Downs in their Lives and how they faced it, simply amazing. Everyone in the Idol Unit will certainly not bore you, they get more mature as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nTo me I thoroughly enjoyed this series with absolutely no complaints about it. It was a very Thrilling and enjoyable ride and I can tell you this, it really left a impact on me. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Idol Animes.\\n\\n\r\nThus, ending my review. This is my first time writing a review, I'm not trying to sound Professional or anything. This are all my honest opinions on the series, and I really hope you have a Wonderful time watching the anime.",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nLove Live season 2 has a great story following the first season. I only have two problems with the story. Firstly, getting into season two seems contrived as a second love live festival just happens to be held so Muse can participate. I don\u2019t mind because we got a second season, but it still seemed forced. Secondly, I hated the Halloween episode as it was an excuse for fanservice and the insert song wasn\u2019t very good.\r\nCharacters: 10/10\r\nThis shows best points are the characters. Each character is well fleshed out and well rounded. Every major character gets screen time and a chance to develop. Noneof the characters fit into one troupe and I like that about them. The designs are also really nice and character interactions and developing friendships are nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally like the music in Love Live but feel that it\u2019s an acquired taste as all the songs are the standard candy j-pop that idol groups tend to sing. Another reason for the rating is because not all the songs are memorable. Snow Halation was the big one for this season, but the rest of them, while enjoyable, don\u2019t have a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis would be a 10 had it not been for the 3D used during performances. The animation overall in Love Live is incredible and is very high quality. Animation breakdowns are near impossible to find in the series and character designs are very nice. Dance scenes are beautifully drawn but at some points 3D rendering is used and it honestly looks terrible. Although these moments are rare, they do bring the overall quality down.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Opinion: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nSeason two did a magnificent job of holding onto the energy of season one and the slice of life genre while still have plot progression and a range of moments that make you laugh and cry. Overall, highly recommended.",

            "content": "Singing in front of people isn\u2019t easy. Just picture yourself in front of an audience or in an arena of over 10,000 people looking at you and perhaps almost always judging you on your performance. It\u2019s both a thrilling and nerve wrecking experience, especially for idols. But for Muse, this is exactly what they are aiming for \u2013 to perform and captivate the audience with their talent in the art of singing. Love Live School Idol Project returns for a second season starring Muse members are they find their way with music.\r\n\u03bc's (pronounced as Muse), makes its anticipated return with all its members back. Oneparticular attribute that stands out for this group is the fact that Honoka, its group leader, has also became the school council president. The sequel insightfully shows how she is able to lead her group to stardom. It\u2019s not easy given the intense competition such as popular idol group, Arise whom stands a firm obstacle in their way. Nonetheless, Honoka takes the stage and does her best to captivate the audience with her skills.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the first season introduced Muse\u2019s members on the surface level, the second season goes beyond that and focuses more on some of its specific characters. In retrospect, more noticeable characters such as Nico, Rin, and Nozomi all get some of spotlight. Some even get parts of their past revealed in an honest way to show the audience their journey to whom they are now. The sequel does a solid job by evoking thoughts to appreciate the person they are today. And of course, that would be taking on the role of an idol as part of Muse. It takes a group of nine girls yet each of them deliver a special charm. In one particular episode, each of them describe their condition and purpose in just one yet solidifying word. These words are honest feelings with distinctive moments to focus on an aim to success. \\n\\n\r\nEven as an underrated group, Muse continues to make a dominant presence throughout the show. The paramount of their dream comes to a climatic moment when they perform their signature song in front of the audience. Also known for their spirit and determination, Muse is an inspiring group that seeks out their dreams, chases after it, and never ceases to let it go. Win, tie, or loss, the group wants to not just aim for success but also give the audience what they want. And that, is entertainment. The majority of the sequel is built-up but the final few episodes details the fruits of their efforts. In fact, the story is fairly simple. It\u2019s about an idol group of girls aiming for success with their dreams. The catch is what happens afterwards? The sequel depicts a short yet memorable journey as their distinction could change these girls\u2019 lives forever. It also makes us wonder what happens afterwards. As the show nears its end, the girls realizes that nothing lasts forever with tearful moments to induce hardcore feelings of sorrow.\\n\\n\r\nResponsibility and teamwork are also prominent ideas incorporated to this sequel. In fact, one particular member is made temporary leader on the spot as result of special circumstances. Luckily, this adapts with teamwork as she is able to hold everything together not just by herself but with her fellow idols. By presenting itself with this direction, it creates feelings of inspiration and can be relatable when you find yourself needing a helping hand. This is especially true earlier on in the series when the girls faces the hardship of writing music by pressure. And that\u2019s what Muse really is, not just an idol group but a group of girls who shares a deep bond for music and their powerful friendship.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the premise and setup, the show does suffer a bit with some pacing issues. Some episodes feels fillerish including a trollish beach scenario. We also get some gimmicky storyline craftsmanship when it comes to execution with subplots like going on a diet habit. Also, it\u2019s somewhat noticeable that some similar scenarios and scenes are reused; not entirely trace by trace but has familiarity. The recycled ideas becomes a bit of a pin-down and in essence doesn\u2019t strongly recreate memorable moments. And despite being character focused, the series does omit highlights for some characters. The main point is that the sequel anticipates their performance in a festival against other prominent idol groups. The most developed rivalry is against the 3-girl group ARISE, who makes Muse look like an underdog. The rivalry is tense but ultimately isn\u2019t anything too explicit or made into mainstream as a main event. Rather, it trifle on the event for Muse to become superstars with predictable outcomes.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork remains standard with Sunrise being charge of the production. Characters are designed with charm, innocence, and with the passion for music. Although not supermodels, the girls have their own qualities and portrays with a beautiful grace. The decorative outfits they wear in front of the world are not just flamboyant, attractive, but also become an image of their dream. Body gestures and their dance moves also inspire creativity with no movement being wasted. It\u2019s hands down attractive not by appearance but with style, class, and inspiration.\\n\\n\r\nWhen talking about the soundtrack, the music would obviously be a key and in my respect, the sequel nails this right away. Although the OP song isn\u2019t something home write about, music shown and performed in this show is colorful. Lyrics are detailed with energy and enthusiasm. Prominent songs from the original project makes their way with alternate edits to deliver a symbol of Love Live. The choreography is excellent with a down-to-earth style yet remains resilient with its smooth setting. Some of the songs also shows symbolism as the animators decorates it with background gags. Additionally, the characters all have distinctive voice mannerism to reflect their personalities. The bottom line is that they are able to command attention and deliver a stellar performance in connection with the songs.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself isn\u2019t a masterpiece but it should be appreciable with this sequel. It\u2019s not easy being an idol but with friends, anything is possible. The way Love Live can inspire is something to take notice of as the director and animators takes advantage of its directional story. Through characterization and focus, we see different sides of characters as they take on obstacles. And although the story isn\u2019t complex or entirely thought provoking, it\u2019s honest with great comedy. Just be aware that not all the songs can be something you\u2019d enjoy, especially when compared to its original source. Yet, this sequel came, delivered, and leaves the building with endearing moments.\\n",

But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point.\r\nIt's basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the \u03bc's and want to perform at Lovelive, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is't not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it.\\n\\n\r\nThe first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way.\\n\r\nSunrise has made a big chance in every part.\\n\\n\r\nThis season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal.\\n\r\nNow that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and \u03bc's story\\n\\n\r\nLike any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED.\\n\r\nThe music got at it's peak when they released the ninth episode with \"Snow Halation\" This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it's just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??).\\n\r\nThe CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn't really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched.\\n\\n\r\nLove live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks.\\n\r\nLike i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn't, it's a huge improvement compared to the first season.\\n\\n\r\nLike any other anime It has come to it's end, the \u03bc's are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the \u03bc's!",

            "content": "To continue working on a broken piece is never easy; to fix what is broken is a hassle. It would be easier to leave it be; it would be easier to start something new, up from the ground, to leave the shambles behind, to never think of them again. However, against all odds, the first season of Love Live, no matter how broken, how unbelievably hollow, how ultimately tired and trite it all was, ended up garnering quite an audience; an audience eager to see more. It is during these times - the times when  a show that I can at best describe aslazily bland is irritatingly popular - that I tend to drown in a sea of assumptions, get tangled up in a net of nitpicking and blinded by my own cynicism. I assume that anything following a bad show can only be a bad show, strictly following the tried and tested failure of a formula of what came before it.\\n\\n\r\nAfter a whole season of poorly-developed characters, badly written plot and a terrible ending, it seemed all too easy to conclude that Love Live lacks heart and soul, lacks the passion or just the competence necessary to craft a worthwhile work. But now, one season further into my study of idol degeneracy, I have experienced something I never would have thought possible: Love Live\u2019s troupe of walking tropes (mostly) turned into actually developed characters, the plot was actually solid from start to finish, the finale was actually moving. This soulless product turned into a worthwhile series. More than that, even: It felt genuine.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: This review contains spoilers!\\n\\n\r\nAfter the spectacular failure of both a finale of a series and Muse\u2019s shot at the eponymous Love Live competition, the troupe of Muse is in a bind: they have no goal to work towards! To the luck of the girls (and the dismay of my inner cynic), Love Live starts again, but this time with an entirely different system: A direct competition in the form of a preliminary tournament serves as a substitute for the meaningless and boring ranking system that had been in place before. This more direct system sets a direct goal while at the same time presenting the great obstacle, Muse\u2019s main rival this time around, A-RISE, that they will have to overcome. \\n\\n\r\nThe system is not the only improvement in the overall structure in the show however; the plot  is very clearly, purposefully and systematically structured. At first, a new obstacle is introduced, then we spend some time actually developing the show\u2019s blanket characters and then, after finally picking up the shambles that season one left, we reach an impactful, genuinely emotional and moving melancholic finale celebrating that fantastic feat.\\n\\n\r\nIt is easy to see that many, very necessary improvements were made to the show\u2019s plot this time around, however that doesn\u2019t mean that this second season doesn\u2019t suffer from many of the same problems as the first season before it. The show still suffers from overdramatizing every bit of the way; it still suffers from jarring CG and bland music; it still suffers from a cast that is too big for the show to properly to support in its comparatively short runtime.\\n\\n\r\nThe character-focused episodes of this second season are definitely one of the main reasons why this sequel season is so much better than its predecessor. Throughout the whole first half, we get to know the girls better; we get to discover quirks, uncover truths, see bonds deepening; we get to see characters growing and reflecting (yes, even Honoka).\\n\\n\r\nWe get to experience Rin, a character formerly characterized as making a cat mouth and adding \u2018nya\u2019 to the end of every sentence, growing out of her shell and taking center stage (or rather being forced into it by the other girls). Her shying away from being the center of attention is unexpectedly connected to previous bad experiences in life which, while not completely convincing, serve as a much needed reason, a much needed background into the troubles of her character.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to know Nico\u2019s family and discover the needless web of lies the notorious best girl Nico spun around her family (which, by the way, is best family). Few things in this show are as fun as seeing Nico\u2019s snotnosed little brother play with a Muse-themed whack-a-mole while the other girls corner Nico and get her to start being honest with her siblings; few things are as heartwarming as her siblings innocently embracing their sister in spite of the fact.\\n\\n\r\nWe get to see Honoka grow responsible, both as a school student council president and as the leader of Muse. After initially succumbing to irresponsibility and laziness, she, through the help of her caring but responsible friend Umi and the rest of the group, not only gets back into shape after eating one(-hundred) too many dumplings, but learns to take responsibility for her her actions and to continue moving forward in the face of adversity.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live still isn\u2019t a strong show visually, and while the backgrounds are as detailed and pleasant to look at as those present in the first season, the slight improvements to the character animation, while definitely noticeable, still aren\u2019t enough to create a strong visual package. The costumes this time around are still very pretty and fun, they do however range from fairly beautiful to frankly boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe performances this time around are as unoffensively acceptable as ever. While the constant changing between 2D and 3D animation is still pretty jarring (mostly because the CG models look like they\u2019re out of a PS2 video game), all of the performances were energetically animated. The songs are still as bland as ever, but both Snow Halation and A-RISE\u2019s performance worked very well as actual highpoints of the show and were a blast to watch and listen to.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live\u2019s second season is an improvement worth celebrating. Numerous nitpicks and plenty of the problems present in the first season are fixed. The plot is well-structured, the characters aren\u2019t blanket sheets anymore and the finale of the show was magically moving. However, the show still suffers from many of the more infuriating issues of its predecessor, mainly stark overdramatization and a character cast too big for the show to handle. Overall worth the watch, but locked behind a lackluster first season.\\n",

            "content": "Love Live School Idol Project is not meant for me. Reviewing a show this girly and happy is pretty much impossible based on my age, sex, and what I enjoy watching. The reason I don\u2019t review Pretty Cure? I\u2019m not a ten year old girl. The reason I review Love Live? Despite obviously being a show for ten year old girls it\u2019s got a raging male fanbase that\u2019s about my age.\r\nA year ago I wrote a review for the first season that I feel, now, complains about all the wrong things. It doesn\u2019t at all hit the nail on the head for how to approachthis series. It also complains a lot about Nico. I don\u2019t know why considering she\u2019s my favorite girl in the series\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nSince that review the Love Live mobile game was released in May and, I won\u2019t lie, I play it every once in a while when I need a time-waster. Also a second season was released early last year that I neglected till now because that seems to be the way I operate.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Love Live has the girls of Muse participating in another Love Live tournament. As it will be the last chance for the seniors to win the tournament, there\u2019s a lot of pressure on Honoka and the others to perform as well as possible. They\u2019re forced to face off against their biggest rival, A-Rise and from there battle the best school idols in Japan.\\n\\n\r\nThe start of this season beats around the bush so much I was nearly going to quit it. I didn\u2019t remember the first season being quite so silly and pointless (but, that said, I barely remember much of anything about the first season in the first place). There\u2019s a lot of exploration of the different characters as well as a really crappy storyline about writing a new song for the Love Live tournament. This episode, in which they go to one of Maki\u2019s summer homes to get some peace, should have shown the comradeship of the girls and how they go about writing songs. What we get instead is a stupid, disjointed episode where, for some reason, they think it\u2019s a good idea to write the lyrics and the music separately.\\n\\n\r\nWhat? So if the beat of the music doesn\u2019t match the lyrics that\u2019s okay?\\n\\n\r\nTwo character episodes are actually somewhat interesting and fun. The Nico episode in which we get to see some of her family is pretty cute and the Rin episode where she\u2019s trying to act like the girl she feels she is makes you d\u2019aww.\\n\\n\r\nBut after the slow start and the somewhat interesting character exploration, we\u2019re presented with a lot of forced drama. The focus isn\u2019t that much on the Love Live or the music; unlike the first season which I commended for having a lot of catchy  songs (I still remember Start;Dash a year later). But this season\u2019s music is lacking any sort of staying power and it feels like it\u2019s put on the backburner to make room for a ton of tears.\\n\\n\r\nThe final few episodes are like\u2026Ano Hana level of crying. It\u2019s sad, definitely, to see the seniors go but it\u2019s not so sad I need a whole episode dedicated to them bawling their eyes out. This is episode eleven, which is cute in execution and idea, but ends with so much forced crying that I wanted to laugh instead. It\u2019s okay to be sad and express it but don\u2019t be overexpressive. Especially on something as small as the seniors leaving.\\n\\n\r\nThen episode twelve is the concert of the Love Live. Be prepared for more cheesiness.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the last episode is the overlong epilogue that further drags out how sad it is the seniors are leaving then ends by\u2026teaching us not to let go of people who are moving on? I didn\u2019t understand the end at all.\\n\\n\r\nHow come you guys can\u2019t hang out after they go to college? Can\u2019t you continue to be an idol group that focuses on larger stages? Doesn\u2019t winning the Love Live mean you could do that sort of thing?\\n\\n\r\nCombine the over-dramatic and weak storytelling with the sheer girliness and you will be laughing your ass off. My God is this show cheesy with themes of friendship and love and following your dreams. The group stands together and screams things into the sky, people stand and clap for no reason, everyone acts like best friends. Oh, and don\u2019t forget the cute little exultations that come every time that the girls see something mildly amusing. I like to call these \u201canime sounds\u201d because in no other medium have I ever seen people go \u201cuguu\u201d over lights.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in the show is pretty lame as well. The character\u2019s are all easily identifiable by their two dimensional traits but the things they say can really make you laugh. At one point Honoka is staring at the city with her friends and talking about how bright the lights are. There\u2019s a huge Zen moment that makes no sense coming from a bunch of teenagers. They talk about the lights belonging to people and not knowing those people\u2026like, what the fuck? And this is followed by them all screaming at the city, completely ruining the somber, thoughtful tone. For the most part, the show if funny if only because of the crappy script.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of these complaints the show is cute as hell and still manages a laugh or two every episode that\u2019s not courtesy of being shitty.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is alright. Just like the first season is resorts to MMD-style during musical numbers that makes everything look awkward. There\u2019s a huge amount of close-up shots of the girls\u2019 faces which can be scary as fuck (from afar you girls are moe but up close you\u2019re freaking aliens). Otherwise it\u2019s not impressive by any stretch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the music, as I said, is weaker than season one. There\u2019s a great variety of music during the show but the actual performances aren\u2019t memorable at all.\\n\\n\r\nOh, do you hear that sound? It\u2019s time to play BEST GIRL!\\n\\n\r\n9. Honoka- I believe it was Theon Greyjoy in Game of Thrones who said the best way to keep an annoying bitch quiet is to put your genitals in her mouth. Honoka is the most annoying group leader of anything ever. Someone put their genitals in her mouth.\\n\r\n8. Hanayo- Moeblob von No Character. I could give a fuck less.\\n\r\n7.Umi- It\u2019s so cute when you get mad. Too bad you\u2019re boring otherwise!\\n\r\n6. Kotori- Boooooooooring. But moe as hell.\\n\r\n5.Eli- Cute but definitely not exciting.\\n\r\n4.Rin- Good development in this season. The writers need to quit overusing the \u201cNyan\u201d thing though because it\u2019s really awkward.\\n\r\n3.Nozomi- Really cute and probably the most mature of the characters. Also has a good gimmick.\\n\r\n2.Maki- Tsundere rich lesbian is cool.\\n\r\n1. Nico- May be a self-centered bitch at times but is only trying to live her dream and enjoy her passion. Totally the most adorable and best girl.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 of Love Live might be good for younger girls or guys with nothing better to masturbate to, but for me, despite a few silly and cute moments, it was pretty forgettable.\\n",

            "content": "STORY - 9\r\nART - 9\r\nSOUND - 10\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 9\r\nHonestly, it's not easy to concisely describe just how vivid the second season of School Idol Project is. A beautiful outburst of the soul. A melodic magic that lifts the heart. A lyrical expression full of emotions. These words are close enough to express how I feel but really, it's better if you listen to \u00b5's (\"Muse\") once more. Because as the saying goes:\r\n\"Where words fail, music speaks.\"\r\nEvery journey will always have a start and an end; and within it, there will always be a story. The story of \u00b5's began as a school-saving solution,and through the passing of time, their journey is reshaped into a sincerity that speaks of passionate wonders, of incredible friendship, and of valued memories. The second season is a continuation of that. With the third-years' graduation quickly drawing near, the end of \u00b5's seems nigh, but it doesn't stop them from making sure their last experience is a meaningful one. The next destination is the second Love Live! contest, and they will make sure to give everything they can to reach that grand stage.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the culmination of their experience together as a school idol group.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the things the first season has are still here: the fun comedies, the expressive enthusiasm, and the adorable interactions. But to reach a bigger stage than before will require a bigger effort from each member. So this time around, we're given more of their roles as school idols, while also bringing a developmental spotlight to those who didn't get much focus from before. It continues on with unlocking each of the nine member's influence on one another. Whether it's to come up with a new song or to support the ones who want to break out of their shell, they will always be there for each other.\\n\\n\r\nIt's this strong focus on \u00b5's as a whole that makes the second half of their journey more emotionally invested, particularly during the latter episodes when everything converges towards a bittersweet reality. Even in the show itself, the collective support from their school, family, and fans is enough to realize just how incredibly special the group is. At this point, they're not just there as a musical entertainment. They go beyond that\u2014into an authentic devotion of hearts shared by everyone.\\n\\n\r\nRivals such as the sassy A-RISE knows fully well of this special ability of \u00b5's to capture the hearts of all who sees them. It does give the Love Live! contest a bit more of a competitive side, but more importantly, it's proof that \u00b5's has grown so much ever since the beginning. All of their charming qualities, from hard work to dedication, become a tangible routine of colorful dancing and beautiful singing. And with a better CGI animation to go along with a vibrant stage, enjoying the various performances is something that can be described as a natural immersion.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the uplifting yet melancholic \"Snow Halation\" to the rosy \"Aishiteru Banzai!\", Love Live! can definitely pride itself with its lovable music. Many of the songs here are thematically relevant to what this season is trying to express, which is the positive message of hope and love that I'm sure a lot of you have heard already in your life before. But to be reminded of it, especially in an endearing fashion, will always be a plus side to me. As for the general visual, it's the same adorable art that I've grown to love, and I don't think that needs to change.\\n\\n\r\nWhen I reflect back on my journey with \u00b5's and School Idol Project, I really couldn't have asked for more. The second season, with its authentic emotions and lasting impressions, is enough to solidify the reasons why I'm their fan now and why Love Live! is a dear franchise to many people out there. If you want to be a part of that wonder as well, give \u00b5's a listen.\\n\\n\r\nMany music and memories are awaiting you.",

I could of written a review for the ova and season 1 but i didn't find out about this feature on this website. So anyway, onto my review of this shall we? This season has been an emotional roller coaster since there was a lot of sad feels into this season, not as much as the first season but i gotta say that the relationship grew so much for the members of \u00b5's ever since the first season. These two seasons of love live werefantastic and i'm glad that i found the perfect anime for me to watch on my free time. I will always be a fan to this anime and the music group \u00b5's. I hope in the future that there will be more songs from \u00b5's. \u00b5's became a part of my life since i watched the first episode of season 1. I got really attached to the characters and i can't imagine the rest of my life without them. \u00b5's is my family now and i just can't handle the rest of my life without them. \u00b5's worked really hard since season 1 and they finally reached their dream. I hope \u00b5's stays together in the future so i can continue to support them through the rest of my life. Arigato the creators and voice actresses to working so hard to produce this great anime. \u00b5's music~ start!",

            "content": "Success stories have always had a spirit that the Academy and many others have deemed inextinguishable. The soul and passion of the fight to victory has always had an undeniable effect on us humans, who have always had the hidden spirit of desire; the very desire to go the extra mile and make it to the top. And it is in these stories where we see this undeniable burning human passion. We see it in Daniel's eyes in his final match in the Karate Kid. We see it in Rocky, prepared to fight Apollo Creed with everything he has. We see it in Drumline, asthe monolithic stage overshadows our heroes. We see it in Alan Turing in his struggle to break Enigma in the Imitation Game.\\n\\n\r\nWe see it in \u03bc's, in their fight to the Love Live Championships.\\n\\n\r\nLove Live Season Two is an anime that has been described by most as 'better than season one' or 'the best idol anime ever' but the series has gone above and beyond those simple standards and has become one of the most inspiring success stories I've seen in a very long time. The story is as simple as it can get, with nine girls aiming to winning the School Idol competition known as Love Live. Though it's hard not to admit the faults of season one, the difference between the two seasons is interstellar. As I stated, the burning passion and struggles from films like Rocky or the Karate Kid is very evident here as we see, finally, what makes idols so special. Before seeing this series, I had always thought idols to be like generic pop singers only with a cutesy side to them. You can tell how obviously wrong I was. From what I've seen, idols have a very distinct nature and goal, to shower emotion over the audience in their own unique spectacle. This is what I learned from Love Live and from no one else, as the girls of \u03bc's struggle against themselves and each other. As the curtains come to a close and story of \u03bc's nears its end, we're welcomed with one of the most powerful finales of all time. You've felt this sensation before. When your little brother made that game winning goal? Or when you aced your exams? Or when you got your crush to like you? It is the spirit of achievement and reflection that make this anime truly an inspiring experience. \\n\\n\r\nNow, I have nothing against stereotypes. And when they're utilized correctly, they can do great things. In the first season of Love Live, we were introduced to, well, about nine archetypes that had adequate development to become a bit more three-dimensional. But the godly characterization of the series in only 26 episodes has turned our girls almost human. We're introduced to feelings and thoughts we never thought these characters could have, underneath their stereotypical exterior that truly defines their character as a whole. An example  is Rin who expresses a very self-defeating nature, the same we see in people who suffer insecurity, in her arc which, I have to say, does extremely well to develop her character and features one of my most favorite \u03bc's songs of all time (LOVE WIIIING. LOVE WIIIING). Honoka also gets a share of this, exceeding the 'genkiest is the leader' stereotype to a more definitive reason as to why she is the leader at all, allowing her characterization to truly define her as the one and only leader of \u03bc's. But by far the best arc belongs to Nozomi, as, not only is her character expanded to degrees above and beyond, but it develops more the special relationship the girls have as \u03bc's, the special feelings they share and why their separation would mean the end of it all. With all the characters given godly characterization, it's now not a story about Honoka, but about all of them.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I can't end this review without going technical. The music of Love Live is one of its main appeals, as a lot of the fans came from playing the musical game on their phones. The best thing about it is how distinct each track is in terms of delivery and emotion. The rhythm endowed that matches each story perfectly really emulates how in-tie music is with the series, unlike some others that like to just play random songs for the heck of it (K-On anyone?). The animation is also above average which is to be expected coming from Gundam-Printing company Sunrise. The design is stellar and gives these different girls a sort of unique flare that gives them distinction and makes them special. If it were not for the blonde hair, the ponytail and the baby blue eyes, Eli would not be my waifu today.\\n\\n\r\nIf there were any way to describe this series, it would be inspiring. Being able to correlate both characters and story to the spirit of achievement, boiling with human desire and passion, in a way that is almost Grammy worthy makes this series truly amazing. Despite the somewhat flaky season one, season two is able to craft a story with meaning, emotion and passion. \\n\\n\r\nWith top-notch characterization, a definitive success story and roaring emotion, I can proudly say that Love Live Season Two is one of the best of the best. \\n\\n\r\n(Written in honor of the Final Live and the end of the VAs's contract next year.  You will be dearly missed, \u03bc's) \\n\\n",

            "content": "Not too long ago I looked at Love Live. The anime portion of a multi-media project. It was an enjoyable series. The first series introduced us to \u00b5's (pronounced Muse.) \u00b5's formed with three members in order to gain interest in their school to prevent it shutting down. We saw the original three gradually grow into nine. We saw the nine girls coming together as friends & comrades, doing live shows and getting really, really, really homo-erotic with one another. So, our heroines managed to save their school in the end. Where are they going to go from there?\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Honoka giving a speechas the brand new student council President. Turns out Eri recommended her for the position. Hanayo is interrupted at practice by the news that they're doing another Love Live competition. Most members of \u00b5's are excited by the prospect and eager to enter but Honoka is strangely uninterested, saying that things are fine as they are. The girls are able to persuade her that \u00b5's should enter by pointing out that this will be Nozomi, Eri & Nico's last chance to compete in the competition since they're graduating shortly after. They're also able to ascertain why Honoka hesitated. The story follows \u00b5's and their endeavour to win the competition, their coming to terms with the third years graduating and them just having fun and being yurirrific.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with the narrative in this series is that the main arc surrounding the competition is really predictable. You can pretty easily guess where it's going to go just from the set up, without watching a single episode of the series. The series does do a lot well, though. The comedy in this is really effective. The first series was pretty entertaining and had some good comedic moments, but this one elevates it to a completely different level. There are also some really good moments in the main narrative, in spite of its general predictability and there is some effective tension surrounding the graduation and the question of where \u00b5's is going to go from there. The ending is a bit bitter-sweet but it's really effective.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe girls get to develop further as characters than they did in the first series. There are several episodes primarily dedicated to developing them as characters and adding depth to the archetypes. Rin and Nozomi both get really good ones. I will also give this series credit over the first, Nozomi's bad touch habit is virtually non-existent in this one. She gropes another girl without permission once. Which is still completely not okay, but at least it's not a regular thing like it was in the first series. I bet Eri threatened to break up with her if she kept groping other girls. Either way, the combination of that getting toned significantly down and her focus episode combine to transform Nozomi into a really good character. The characters are still a lot of fun and there are still really good interactions, including some with the rival idol group, A-Rise.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nMuch like the first series, this one has really good costumes and dance numbers. The characters are still basically missing their noses, though. I think this art style was designed by someone with rhinophobia. That would explain so much. In spite of that, the art and animation are good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is excellent. Love Live has singers who are also excellent in their roles. See, Ice, it is possible to have people who can do both. The music is superb. Both series of Love Live have really mazing soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nIt's easy to see why yuri fans gravitate towards this franchise. The les-yay levels are massive. Really, any potential pairing would make sense but there are some that come across more strongly than others. Rin and Hanyo continue to be really adorable. We've also got Nozomi and Eri, who also get quite a bit of les-yay with both Maki and Nico. Honoka, Umi and Kotori are all really homo-erotic with one another.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nLove Live series 2 is a definite improvement over the first. The characters are strengthened. The comedy is more effective and the story, overall, has more going for it. It's not perfect, but it's well worth watching. My final rating on it is going to be a 9/10. The first series was good. This one is excellent. Next week I'll look at Solty Rei.",

            "content": "This review will cover the second season of LLSIP. I'll probably make some comparisons here and there to the first season but if you're interested in what I've had to say for the first season, please see the review I wrote for it beforehand.\r\nLove Live, for me, is one of those series that, before watching, I thought I wouldn't like a bit, but after actually heading into it, I ended up loving it. Also, I honestly can't believe I've missed it all this time.\r\nHaving said a lot in my review of the first season already, I feel like there isn't much to add here. Thesecond season of Love Live tops the first one, which had a rather rocky start, in all aspects.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't enjoy the first season as much but still like the show enough to make you want to see more from it, I can be certain when I say that you will feel rewarded at the end of another ~260 minute run. It looks better, feels better, is better in general and more fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, who I've had an objective issue with in the first season, actually felt like genuine characters this time around. There is definitely an amount of care put into handling them which can be noticed as you take your time through the season but that can also be seen in the plot as well. A matching pace this time around, rewarding plot-line and, overall, experience.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really talk about the artstyle unless it's too hideous or fascinating to note, but improvements can be seen there as well. The enviroment and characters just look better, I'd say they had more life in them compared to the first season. Love Live looks just fine in general, though some might find the CGI to be somewhat distracting.\\n\\n\r\nThis should be a given, but Love Live has an amazing soundtrack, being an idol anime. It makes a return and finds its way to stay of on-point quality, appeal as each song showcases a new stage for \u00b5's and as an advancement route for the group as performers and people. I find the peak of music in LLSIP to be ''Snow Halation'', a track that showcases \u00b5's and their appeal. It is an absolutely amazing uplifting albeit sad vocal piece that I have a special place for both subjectively and objectively.\\n\\n\r\nThe amount of passion & hype that surrounded Love Live all this time is something I never really understood, until now. I think it will manage to claw itself in as one of the franchises I am most emotionally engaged with and I can't wait to see more from it.",

            "content": "\u201cBut you guys make me want to root for you for some reason.\u201d - Yukiho Kousaka\r\nNote that this review will cover the two inseparable seasons of Love Live! School Idol Project.\r\nI don\u2019t get idols. A bunch of adorable girls sing and dance their heart out on stage and everyone loves it. And that\u2019s exactly what Love Live is. The only difference is that I actually get it.\r\nI had the honor of picking up Love Live as my very first idol anime due to a friend\u2019s humble (and passionately incessant) request. It\u2019s nothing amazing but it\u2019s something special; simple in its message yet powerful in itselocution. It\u2019s a refreshing wake-up call for everyone who wants to\u2026\\n\\n\r\n*sighs*\\n\\n\r\n\u2026 follow their dreams.\\n\\n\r\nAnd unexpectedly, I fell in love with that message in all its starry-eyed wonder.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 8\\n\\n\r\nA school is on the verge of closing. A second-year high school girl notices the idol hype. And just like that she assembles two of her closest friends and forms a ragtag idol group in a noble attempt to save the school. Little by little that idol group grows in number; catching the attention of freshmen and juniors alike while touching the hearts of many. Love Live is a story about the nine-girl idol sensation later known as \u03bc\u2019s (Muse); their humble beginnings, their struggles, and their rise to fame.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward and linear plot with some slice-of-life breaks in between. But if there\u2019s one thing Love Live does well, it\u2019s the execution and pacing that delivers unwavering enthusiasm in the midst of constantly growing challenges the group faces. The show doesn't pander much with its fanservice-prone premise (considering the costumes, performances, and character designs and archetypes are fanservice enough). It goes right into the ideal idol experience; from formation and training to national participation and recognition. Love Live has a clear goal with a plot actively working towards it.\\n\\n\r\nThe two seasons, each composed of 12 episodes, have a systematic format in progressing the story. Presentation and resolution.\\n\\n\r\nThe first season introduced the members and established each of their conflicts while the second resolved those conflicts to fully flesh-out the true potential of \u03bc\u2019s as an idol group and a solid circle of friends. Streamlining the series this way made it feel more dynamic and continuous. There\u2019s hardly a dull moment since the show didn't needlessly drag the story. The energy never dies, the stakes keep getting higher, and fillers function more as a breather with added character focus before the plot kicks right back in.\\n\r\nThough the barriers of entry for \u03bc\u2019s from small-time idol group are a challenge in itself, the spirit of competition isn't really present with only one main contender given mention, UTX high school\u2019s A-rise, who are ranked top in the idol group charts. To compensate, time is given to focus more on the inner workings of \u03bc\u2019s as well as their impact on the school and more importantly, themselves. The story, though lacking depth, promises a lot of heart (and sweat\u2026 and tears) which grips the viewer in the same way idols earn fans.\\n\\n\r\nART - 8\\n\\n\r\nWhen you hear the words \u201cLove Live,\u201d you expect something bright and cheerful. Sunrise caught the message and multiplied \u201cbright and cheerful\u201d by 9 in the form of high school girls along with the rest of the cast. The results are freakin\u2019 adorable; a cross between trademark schoolgirl and childlike dreamer. This might go for most shows of the same market but hear me out. \\n\\n\r\nThe eyes are the window to the soul. Eyes here are more round than wide and convey even the most minute shifts in expressions especially during parts when the show isn't so bright. Not only are Love Live\u2019s eyes a window, they\u2019re a magnet; attractive both literally and figuratively. They\u2019re fresh and innocent; full of youthful wonder, passion, and determination. Those eyes look at you and won\u2019t let you look at anyone else. You want to hear what they have to say and see what they have to prove and that immensely aids in character attachment. \\n\\n\r\nEnough about eyes. Colors are strong and vivid with soft edges, evoking the utopian rose-colored high school everyone in the anime world is after. Animation is of average caliber since not much motion is involved\u2026 outside the performances and more powerful scenes. Everything scales up for their live shows; from the stage and costumes down to the individual choreography.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line, the art is cute and I always have room for cute.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 7\\n\\n\r\nI would\u2019ve given this a 6. Funny to give this a rather fair rating when the show\u2019s mostly centered around sound. In a series densely populated with standard upbeat j-pop, which mind you is one of my less preferred genres, I find myself never skipping all the openings and endings and soaking in all the live shows. Head-bobbing, appreciative lyric/subtitle-reading, and attentive musical listening aside, music is relatively standard. \\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus, who are also the singers, did an amazing job in making each character distinct and familiar. Voices not only fit each respective personality type but also convert well in performances. Based on listening, voices in live shows are categorized in 3 pitch levels (sensual deep, powerful midtone, and cutesy high pitch). Objectively, sound is just above average. Subjectivity however, bumped up the score for me. I\u2019ll go more into that later.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 8\\n\\n\r\nAt first glance, the characters really do start off as stereotypes. We have Honoka, the optimist prime with ditzy tendencies, Kotori, the supportive moe bait, Umi, the straight man + shrinking violet, Hanayo, the glasses girl who\u2019s also a closet Stan, Maki, the rich tsundere loner, Rin, the tomboyish genki \u2018cat\u2019 girl, Eli, the partly-Russian virtuoso bitch, Nozomi, the motherly (well-endowed) weird girl, and Nico, the childish, superficial devil who\u2019s the butt of everyone\u2019s jokes. They have their verbal tics, quirky mannerisms, and own up to who they are. They\u2019re fun, direct, and accessible. You don\u2019t need to think too hard on them because what you see is what you get.\\n\\n\r\nAs the show progresses, the show eases in shifts in character that are largely attributed to the effect of \u03bc\u2019s on their personality. It\u2019s a lighthearted process of each character warming up to the group while settling their own personal scores. And in the course of events, some magic happens.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 10 \\n\\n\r\nYou start to feel like a part of \u03bc\u2019s. You realize the passion behind the songs, the costumes, and the dance moves. You start to cheer them on in every endeavor. You feel their pain and relief in every challenge. And you enjoy every bit of it; the way \u03bc\u2019s intended it.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in Love Live was designed for enjoyment. Not in the sense of taking pleasure in our own preferences, but in the general spirit of being caught up in the moment, letting go of our worries, and pursuing our own unreachable fantasies in the same way \u03bc\u2019s did.\\n\\n\r\nAll that enjoyment can be attributed to something innate in all our social investments; sentimental attachment. It\u2019s that state of getting attuned to the story, characters, the music and the lyrics, and the certain inflections in animation when you start feeling for each of the group's triumphs and hesitations. For instance, Honoka\u2019s innocent optimism is a sweet reminder of that child in you who thought he/she could do anything; carefree yet admirable. She passively commands \u03bc\u2019s with sheer determination and directs the same message down to their songs with visible signs of pent-up anxiety and exhilaration. Seeing that same force break down to reality hurts. \\n\\n\r\nOn a side-note, this show does a great job in visualizing pent-up feelings. You just know a character\u2019s gonna lose it, but they don\u2019t. It\u2019s strangely bittersweet. The show at its core is a heartfelt shout-out to the last time you truly shared your enjoyment with others.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8\\n\\n\r\nInfectiously optimistic with a sweet dose of innocent ambition, Love Live is a celebration of the overflowing passion within us, demonstrating a good balance of character chemistry and plot buildup that creates immense character attachment. Sunrise is a genius for capitalizing on adorable character designs, idol pop groups, and a plethora of catchy songs to impart a message we've all heard before, but need to be reminded of every once in a while. \\n",

            "content": "The only times I ever binge-watch anime is when I'm either extremely bored or the series is extremely entertaining. Although the 2nd season of Love Live! School Idol Project is far from being a masterpiece or one of my all-time favorite shows, it's oddly addicting and, most importantly, far better than the first season. \r\nDespite being turned off by the many problems the first season had, the positive reviews and the amazing art made me want to continue watching this show. Luckily, I was not disappointed.\r\nAlthough the music is still a bit too generic and immature for my personal taste, there are lots of funnew songs and dance sequences. The dance sequences seem to have definitely improved as the CG is either used less or in a more subtle way (or maybe I've just become used to it). As such, all of the performances are seriously striking and make you wish you were up on stage dancing with \u03bc's, too. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the art is as gorgeous as ever (if not more so) and features some of the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen in anime. The voice acting does not disappoint either, and the girls quickly transition from sounding slightly annoying to actually sounding kind of cute.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, however, the story itself is far more interesting. Although the girls are still trying to participate in the Love Live! Contest and face many problems along the way, their struggles now seem far more believable and even relate-able, specially for fellow girls (after all, who has never dealt with the horrors of gaining weight, feeling awkward when wearing cute outfits and enduring painful workouts and diets?) \\n\\n\r\nAs if that wasn't enough, there is far more emphasis on the girls as individuals with their own fears and ambitions rather than simple singing blobs that all love each other for no apparent reason. By showing more of their family, childhood memories, and personal problems, it is easier to see them as real human beings that try really hard to fulfill their dreams. Unsurprisingly, their relationships also benefit greatly from this and allow for far more genuine interactions. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a surprisingly enjoyable show that, while slightly cheesy and juvenile, portrays human relationships, struggles, failures and successes in a way that is both beautiful and believable.",

            "content": "As a continuation from the season 1...\r\nSeason 2 of Love Live is fortunately, a Critically important watch for those who enjoyed the initial 13 episodes.\r\nIt holds onto its ability to really motivate its audience.\r\nIt's upbeat, its charming, it allows for more development, and brings the main series to a well wrapped up, beautiful ending.\r\nLove Live is to be commended for the way it sticks to its motives, it's simple if plotted on a timeline, and uses each and every episode to its fullest, as opposed to going off on spontaneous Moe tangents. Love Live continues to weave its way into your heart in Season 2,by developing all of the characters rather well. Yes, even the more shadowed ones that didn't have time to be fully covered in the first half.\\n\\n\r\nNow whereas this usually implies a formulaic series of episodes, Season 2 is instead great in the way that everything is relevant, and integrated into the main plot. This gives the show a more seamless presentation; and while the goal in mind for U's continues to be refreshed, it invokes a sense of excitement even in the most cynical of viewers (i'm sure).\\n\\n\r\nThe methods of Love Live don't change - except for an increase in sentimental references, and emotional, reflective scenes as it comes to a close - but in this sequel series that exists to further develop every aspect, it means that lovers of the original; will come to appreciate the series even more. \\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound aspects remains flawless, and as i became significantly more attached to characters in these past few days, I've been able to enjoy it all a bit more on the whole. I guess you could say that a weakness of Season 1 (that has been filled in Season 2) - was that it all felt a bit more distant, as in 13 episodes, SUNRISE had to set the scene, cover half of the story, and do their best to convey the personality of each character. Whereas this developed from a casual attitude-oriented perception of each, Season 2 delves deeper, to make it all feel more personal, and more memorable.\\n\\n\r\nMotivational, a feel-good anime throughout, excellently presented, good story despite the limitations of dedicating solely to the Idol genre, all over; a beauty - though definitely a bit cheesy at times... Kind of like this review!",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nIn life, people encounter different forms of happiness. Some people find it in the places they visit. Others discover it in the foods they eat and the beverages they drink. And yet others still find it in the bonds of everlasting friendship. It's with this last part in mind that Love Live! School Idol Project 2 \"sets the stage.\" When it comes to a feeling of togetherness, no other show comes close.\r\nSTORY\r\nLove Live! 2 begins where the first left off. That is to say, the girls of Muse discover that a second Love Live is being hosted, andit is their goal to achieve their dream of conquering the ultimate School Idol prize.\\n\\n\r\nLL2's main focus is in its idols, singing, and dancing. And for the majority of the show, this focus is executed very well. The show's highlights are definitely the compositions that the girls sing and dance to. Many of the songs deal with the problems and feelings they are experiencing at that time. Whether it is about a sense of love or feeling the need to be the group they've always been, the songs do a wonderful job of capitalizing on the shows overall themes.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, what LL2 does better than LL1 is that it forgoes the misplaced melodrama. Instead, LL2 captures these beautiful emotional moments that leave the viewer both incredibly happy and extremely sad. I found myself getting towards the tears and burning throat when watching particular scenes, because after viewing the girls for so many episodes, their plight and their overwhelming love for one another really started to get to me. It's not something on the level of Clannad: After Story, but it is definitely hard not to get somewhat emotional over what is occurring.\\n\\n\r\nWhen the show isn't making you feel so down, it sticks to its method of comedy quite nicely. The show does a nice balance of character gags, jokes, and reactions that show-off the cute girls being cute. With the comedy, the show also delves more into its characters. It forms characterization for those that needed it and expanded upon those that already had it. I enjoyed this approach more, since it allowed me to see different sides to the girls than them just being cute.\\n\\n\r\nMy teeny-tiny gripe with the story is in the ending. Not being shown anything afterwards, but if they somehow retcon what they did, it kind of defeats the purpose of the scenarios and events prior to it. I hope this isn't the case, but the way things are left off, I am led to believe that this is so.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, LL2 does a fine job in the animation department. One of their best talents is in their facial expressions. They usually use more frames than needed (this is a good thing!), making their face movements more detailed than in other shows. The same can also be said for their general body movements as well. The show is not afraid to go all out in terms of animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe same quality is again found in the dancing portions as well. I was a fan of the mix of CG and 2D from LL1, and I was a fan of the technique here as well.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style itself is again rather plain, and the character designs are not terribly unique, but it's not something that should turn anyone off. One thing I found to have increased was the use of lighting. It seemed to have more of a presence this time around, such as with sunsets, night-time locations, and general sunny daytime.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nLL2 features the same nine characters that it did in LL1, and the whole cast is quite likable. As with LL1, I'll focus on three (different) girls to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nEli started off being the student council president and was rather stalwart in her ways in dealing with keeping the school open. But after joining Muse, she learns to not only integrate herself with others but also on how to have fun. She used to be rather strict and unforgiving, but the girls have her learn that sometimes just being with others can make your day that much brighter. She is one of the eldest in the group, and therefore one of the more mature and beautiful, so her character was always nice to see.\\n\\n\r\n\"Nico-Nico-Ni!\" When you probably read this phrase, I hope you re-read it and performed its accompanying hand gestures! Nico is the girl who is both quite prideful but at the same time very sensitive to the things around her. She wasn't quick to accept that there were others just like her, but she realizes this season that the girls are not only their to further their own dreams but to further Nico's as well. Nico, over the course of the series, grows up from being a rather difficult to approach character to an understanding and caring one. It just took a few \"Nico-Nico-Ni's!\" to get there.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, one of my favorite characters from the show is Umi. Umi is serious, determined, and yet shy in certain situations. She looks out for everyone too, especially Honoka. While watching the show, she had some of the best reactions alongside Honoka. Plus, she's able to switch from being quite angry to severely cute in the blink of an eye. Muse literally couldn't have started without her and I'm glad that her character was as good as it is.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, LL2 does a nice job of displacing the screen-time among the entire cast. Nobody ever feels left out, and those that actually seemed to get less screen-time than usual actually got quite a bit more. None of the characters are to die for, but I still like them all the same.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and the ED for LL2 follow the same pattern as the first season. That is, the OP is a School Idol song that is there to get you \"in the mood\" for the show while the ED is there to demonstrate the skills of the singers. I didn't enjoy these songs as much as LL1, but can still appreciate the work put into them.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack's most important elements are once again the rest of the School Idol tracks. My favorite is probably \"Snow Halation,\" but all of them were performed quite nicely and were amazing to listen to. I also thought the inclusion of the first OP was rather clever and a joy to hear once more.\\n\\n\r\nAs a little aside, I feel like it is best to listen to all of the School Idol songs with the appropriate dance animations. Otherwise, I don't think you would get the full experience out of it. This is more of a personal feeling than a fact, so take it with a grain of salt.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also wonderfully done by the whole cast once again. Each of the girls sings and acts their heart out, and I really couldn't ask for more than what we got.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I've never seen another idol show before this one. Going into this season, I knew what to expect: lots of laughs, great singing, and pretty darn good animation. What I didn't expect was the previously mentioned emotions that the show was able to elicit from me. I really like it when a show is able to make me feel enough to care about what is happening on-screen, and the show was able to accomplish this.\\n\\n\r\nI'm one of those dudes who likes to watch the cute girls do cute things. Honoka's infectious smile, Rin's cat-like way of talking, and Hanayo's pleas for help constantly put a smile on my face. One of my favorite moments from the show was their reenactment of each other's personalities. It was always funny to see them joke around with each other in these ways because the show does it so well.\\n\\n\r\nMost importantly, Love Live! School Idol Project Season Two does more than just making you feel happy, watching cute girls, or containing lots of singing and dancing. It leaves you with a sense of wanting more, and I truly hope to see the girls of Muse make their much needed return.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, both funny and emotional but with an unclear ending\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, art style is plain with nice dancing/non-dancing animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, more of the girls of Muse\\n\\n\r\nSound: Great, OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs all performed exceptionally\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, cute girls, dancing, and singing, who would have thought\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "This review will go for both the first and second season, it seems kind of pointless to review them separately. Honestly I don't even know where to begin with this anime outside of the word spectacular. I realize I am slightly behind the curve but it must have slipped through the cracks for me when it aired. Regardless, this anime was absolutely incredible. \r\nStory - 9: My only gripe with the story is the ending of the first season. No spoilers but it was the weakest area of the anime and the only reason I cannot award it a perfect 10. As much as Iwould like to add it to my exclusive list of 10s, I just can't. Outside of this blemish in the middle of the series the story was phenomenal and went in the direction that just felt so right. The ending of the second season and thus the anime was perfect. With feels that hit in just right way and a big finish to end an anime that did things BIG, it was perfect.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10: The art in the first season was awesome. Each character is drawn well in her own distinct way, the scenery is very nice and pleasing to the eye. The second season began and this became a whole new animal. The art was on par with best of any anime I have watched, the scenery was absolutely breathtaking, the detail in everything from surroundings to clothing to subtle facial features was beautifully done. The performances by Muse were also beautifully done, wile they cut to a 3D at times I deemed it necessary as well as pleasing to the eye. With all of these elements done so well art-wise, it was the art during the performances that put this anime over the top into the category of one of the best artistic shows I have watched.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10 (11): The music featured in this anime could possibly be the best I have experienced. If not the best, top 5 for sure. The score is masterfully written and used so well. It follows the scenes perfectly and sets the mood in a way that is matched by few. When the feels hit you, they hit hard thanks to a beautiful oboe piece. When the girls are being mischievous or having some fun, you can feel those feelings thanks to this magical score. The score however is just one element of the sound featured in this anime. As a school idol anime it features of course pop idol performances along with song. The songs sung by Muse and A-RISE alike are just great. This could depend on your taste in music, but for me as a J-Pop fan they were awesome. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10: There are anime that run for literally years that do not develop characters as well as Love Live did. The show took nine girls and made me feel like each one could've been the main character in her own way. They visibly grew as people, friends, a band, and even performers. You could see actual improvement in their shows from performance to performance, it was nothing short of brilliant. The members of muse even after the beautiful art ad captivating music had to be what I'd say kept me wanting more. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10: I have not enjoyed an anime this much in a long time. Even when the writing seemed poor for a brief period I enjoyed the anime because of how much it made me care for the characters. Throughout I was on the edge of my seat, saying \"awwww\", and maybe crying a liiiittle bit. It did everything well and I enjoyed it from episode 1-26.\\n\\n\r\nSo as badly as I want to give this anime a 10 I have to give it a 9 because of the one hiccup season one. I have to keep the 10 rating for literally perfect anime or else the line blurs pretty hard. With that being said Love Live is an asymptote to a masterpiece. It is absolutely recommended at a 9/10. Thank you for reading!",

            "content": "After watching the first season of Love Live (reluctantly at that too), I was rather disappointed by the anime and did not have high expectations coming into the second season. To my utter surprise, the second season seriously impressed me and even 'transformed' me into a Love Live fan. This was definitely a pleasure to watch, as the developers had drastically improved the anime from its first season to create this work of art. Listening to the criticisms of the public in this case definitely worked out for the producers, and they were able to amend most of the glaring flaws present in the anime'sfirst season. Going on to specifics:\\n\\n\r\nStory: Well, this season was mainly about the development of the idol unit as a whole -- the producers evidently decided to ditch individual character development, and emphasized on the development of \u03bc's as a whole. This was an intelligent gamble -- after all, going deeper into nine main characters' backstories would prove to be detrimental to the quality of the anime, causing it to be melodramatic and boring. It was a pleasure to watch as \u03bc's grew and cruised towards their final goal -- to win the competition -- although some parts could be further elaborated. Overall, the story in Season 2 was enjoyable and rather well development -- a massive development from the mess in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt: This is mainly personal preference, but I really love the art used in Love Live (even for Season 1). How the characters are portrayed, how the environment is drawn, etc. -- all these are very well done, and I am unable to pick out any flaws or problems with the artwork of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Now THIS is the defining factor of Love Live. It might be a given for idol animes to have good music, but Love Live's music is beyond fantastic. Almost all of the music in the anime is brilliant, (with a few exceptions here and there) and these songs are also used to great effect -- they have proved to be superb in amplifying the atmosphere and mood present in the scenes they are deployed in. Season 1's music is already good -- but Season 2 takes it to a whole new level. Each new song just has this ability to draw you in -- no matter how much you listen to it, it never gets boring, but instead provides that spark for you to start twitching/rocking to the beat. My personal favourites: Dancing Stars on Me! (S2), No Brand Girls (S1), Snow Halation (H2)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: As mentioned before, the developers decided to sacrifice the development of the individual \u03bc's members to focus on the development of \u03bc's as a whole. Thus, character development is certainly lacking and can be worked on, but I believe that this intended neglect has allowed for the story to be much more enjoyable and appropriately paced.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I enjoyed watching Love Live's Season 2 very much -- \u03bc's jovial nature just seems to draw me in, and create that elusive smile on my face. Throughout the entirety of season II, I have thoroughly enjoyed the anime, and have spent most of my time watching it either grinning stupidly, or even giggling. This is perhaps the anime I have enjoyed the most -- I simply love the jovial, carefree nature of \u03bc's and how the anime was developed.\\n\\n",

Now, the second Love Live contest is happening right around thecorner and \u00b5's has been granted another chance to participate in the contest to try and win Love Live!. However, this is the girls' last chance to participate in the contest. \\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Love Live! really surprised me. I never even thought that the second season would be 2 times better than the first season. Like I said above, this season is a big improvement. While the plot may seem recycled (not exactly), that wasn't the reason why I thought this season was better than the previous season. It was the character interactions, the character development each of the 9 members received and last but not least is the \"Yuri\" pairing. I'll talk about my first 3 reasons later on in the review. \\n\\n\r\nIn my previous paragraph, I said that the plot for the second season is recycled but not exactly. If you compare the plot of the first and second season then you'd notice that it's kind off the same but there are changes between the plot for the first and second season. In the first season, they're trying to win Love Live to save the school but they didn't win. They, however, saved the school. In here, they're trying to win Love Live again but for a very different reason. It's actually a heartwarming reason. It's better if I don't spoil it for you.\\n\\n\r\nPlot aside, Love Live! Second Season is what you'd pretty much expect but every element is improved/better. The comedy in the second season is a lot better than the first season. I was laughing my ass off at the first half of the show. The music is better, the OP and ED theme songs are better, the characters...almost everything here is better. It's like they took notes from the first season, sat down in an oval office and actually discussed on how they could improved on said elements. \\n\\n\r\nWhile this season got a lot of improvements, there are also issues that I have to point out. The first issue that I have for this show is the second half's melodramatic moments. Thank God there's not a lot though because most of the dramatic scenes were done well. It's just that some scenes came out as too melodramatic for me. Another issue that I have is the occasional time skips and awkward pacing in the 2nd half of the show. Sunrise knew that they made shit tons of money in the first season and they probably knew that they would be making more for this season. Sunrise should have expanded the Second Season into a two-cour (24-26 episodes) show because the 2nd half had rushed pacing. There would be time skips like how one episode, it's January and the next episode, it's suddenly March. \\n\\n\r\nOne last thing that I want to talk about is the \"Yuri\" shippings in the show. The yuri pairings in the first season did not exist..At All! However, in this season, the show would pair up the characters from time to time. That doesn't mean all of the \u00b5's members are gay for each other. They're still straight. The shipping scenes here are like Yuru Yuri and it's only used for comedy purposes expect they're not kissing or doing anything sexual. The most notable Yuri pairing in this season is Nico and Maki and most fans of Love Live! (including me) are shipping the hell out of these two characters. Even the voice actors of Nico and Maki ship them which makes these 2 characters an (un)official couple to me. Hell, there are even loads of manga showing these two characters revealing their love for each other and having sex in the beach or in the classroom. My innocence......ruined! Before I end this section, I just want to mention one thing. If you don't ship Nico and Maki then you\u2019re dead to me and your existence is pretty much irrelevant to me XP. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nThe animation for the second season is a lot better than the first season. The character designs looks great and more colours and saturation were present in the characters than the previous seasons. The background and environments looks more improved and there's more lighting in the scenery. \\n\\n\r\nThe first season's use of CGI was an eye sore. I couldn't handle the CGI because of how much it didn't fit with the 2D Animation and the characters looked so dead to me. In this season, CGI is still a bit of an issue but they somehow managed to blend parts of the CGI into the show. When they're doing the live performances or when I'm watching the Opening Animation, it didn't bother me as much as before. It's probably because Sunrise learned their lesson from the first season and actually did something about it or my eyes just got so used to Love Live!'s use of CGI in live performances and Opening Animation.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (10/10)\\n\r\nThe songs in the first season are fairly ok and the only songs that stood out to me in the first season are START:DASH, Susume Tomorrow, and the ED theme song. In this season, there are new songs and new songs means more songs to put in my phone. Surprisingly, the new songs that muse has to offer are not even close to decent. They were all either very good or greatly done. The song that really stood out to me is Snow Halation. Not only was it well done but the quality of the song was close to START:DASH. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is Sore wa Bokutachi no Kiseki\" by \u00b5's and the ED theme song is Donna Toki mo Zutto\" by the members of \u00b5's. In my opinion, the OP theme song for this season is way better than the previous season. It was catchly and not annoying. I also love the ED theme song not just because how it sounds but also the lyrics. My life right now is busy and the lyrics is inspiring me to just take it slow once in a while. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (9.5/10)\\n\r\nIn the previous season, only the 3 main characters got a character development which was Honoka, Kotori and Umi. I mean, it's understandable considering the fact that it's impossible to give all 9 main characters a character development. Now that Love Live! got an additional 13 episodes, all of the main characters got a character development and a ton of screen time to focus on their backstory and why they are acting the way they are today. I applaud the creators for doing something that I thought they would never do just because this is a slice-of-life show. It honestly felt like that time where I was forced to take care of my niece for over 6 months. She was really annoying at first but as I spent more time with her, I grew to like her and ended up wanting to play with her whenever I have the time. Obviously, I wasn't in-love with her...bleh, that's disgusting. \\n\\n\r\nThe character's backstories not only explains why they have that kind of personality but also explains why they were interested in joining a school idol group which was mostly heartbreaking. For example, I actually shed a tear when they explained Nico's backstory. At first, I thought she was just doing it to show off to her siblings (Given the way she acts, of course I would think that) but the actual reasons on why she was \"showing off\" to her siblings broke me. Hell, even Nozomi's backstory was depressing as hell and she doesn't fondle the girls' breasts anymore. In short, most of the character's backstories pretty much crushed me.  \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (9/10)\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this season way more than the first season. For the most part, the drama was well done, though there were melodramatic moments. The comedy is a huge improvement and I was laughing for the entirety of the first half. I would have probably enjoyed this anime more if this was a 2-cour series. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Love Live! School Idol Project 2nd Season\" is a huge improvement compared to the first season. Almost every element is improved in the 2nd Season such as the comedy, drama and actual character development. There's also the \"yuri\" tones if you like shipping two girls. If you finished the first season and you hated it then I recommend that you give the 2nd season a chance because I can assure that you will like the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (9.5/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+2nd Season is a huge improvement\\n\r\n+Improved Animation and CGI doesn't stick out as much as before\\n\r\n+Improved Music\\n\r\n+Outstanding OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\r\n+Great Character Development\\n\r\n+First Half is extremely hilarious\\n\r\n+Well-done Drama moments\\n\r\n+Introduction of \"Yuri\" pairings\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Rushed pacing in the 2nd half\\n\r\n-Some melodramatic moments",

The plot is never predictable and has somany moments worth remembering. Towards the end it gets more emotional, as expected, and I could stop watching. Best of all,this series makes me feel happy,excited and needing more. It's gripping, the story is touching and it never ever fails to make me smile with the antics and charm of all the characters and their melodious voices. It also has great rewatch value as I'm going to rewatch this series multiple times in the future as I can't get enough.\\n\\n\r\nStruggle not to give this a 10 as its absolutely amazing, would recommend anyone watches this as it is appealing to all.",

            "content": "Ok,so I have done watching LL S2 and I have two words: truly amazing. In terms of school idol, if anyone want's a recommendation, I'm totally recommend Love Live. Amazing,satisfying, the feels, and many more are there in LL.\r\nThe anime continue from the first season which is after they save their school from closing. After they know that Love Live tournament will begin, they set their new goal which is to enter and win the tournament since they withdraw from previous LL. I would say, LL S2 really make an impact in terms of story. The balance between story and other character backstory is impaccableand that's one of the reason I really like about LL. They know how to focus each character backstory and combine it with main plot.\\n\\n\r\nFor animation, I can see some improvement in their choreography, 3D CGI and background scenery/building. The synchronization between them in dancing makes the CGI looks nice and satisfying. For music and OST, awesome, nuff said. The songs including OP and ED keeps getting better including their performance in dancing. Goosebump? Yeah, LL S2 also gives you more goosebump and jaw dropping performance when they start their concert.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict: So, what can I say about Love Live School Idol Project S2 is the anime really did a good job showing me about school idol. Maybe not in reality or not as good as other school idol anime such as Idolmaster but LL totally makes me want to see them perform again altough they can't(you will know if you watch it). Also, prepare some tissues or pillow since ninja onion will come not once but twice(maybe thrice) when you watch it(again,you will know if you watch). From season 1 to season 2, from 3 members to 9 members, their jokes never cease to amuse me and their smile,laugh and sad moments always makes me happy and cry(man tears you know). Last but not least, thank you who create this, it was an amazing ride with tears and joy. Not many anime that makes me throb after finishing the series but LL already did that to me. For that, I give them 11/10. \"Muse - A story achieved together\".",

You will probably see the same plot and scenarios in a myriad of other shows but if you overlook this show because of that you're missing out quite the fun experience. If it could be put in words it be like romantic love vs maternal love, shows that really stand out are like falling in love, they make your heart race, they bring out new feelings in you and they always make you smile. This one is like maternal love, it's comforting, and if you don't have and never experiences ityou missed out big time. The show has its laugh and the characters are always entertaining. While one episode may have you laughing, another may really move you to tears. All in all it's worth the watch and can actually appeal to people not into idol shows (believe me as a grown man who doesn't even cry at funerals this show moved me to tears).",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nThe second season of Love Live is... kinda meh, at least, compared to the first one.\r\nIt started out with the same story quality as the first one. It has moments of interesting character development, while also having moments where the plot feels slightly contrived. A few times, characters seem to speak up to give them screen time or to steer the story in the 'right' direction, even if it's somewhat out of character. This particular point seems very prominent, either because I expected more or that's the way it really is. Anyway, no real disappointments here except in episode 9.\r\nEven though thingsseemed to be going fine, disaster befell the protagonists. Faced with overwhelming adversity, they still chose to press on helplessly. There was no hope.\\n\\n\r\nSuddenly, everything was okay. People had helped them even when, logically, their efforts would have been fruitless. Seriously, they could could surely try but it should not have been possible.\\n\\n\r\nIt felt to me that they, the writers, wanted to up the stakes exceeding the previous season then realised they couldn't solve it realistically.\\n\r\nIt was still enjoyable though, plus, the last few episodes was what sold me on the previous season so I figured there was still hope. Episode 11 was headed in a hopeful direction with heartfelt moments.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 12 was okay up until the rather contrived ending with the overt intention to make people tear. Felt forced and didn't work. After what seemed to be a finale, episode 13 seemed to be to tie up all loose ends on a positive, if somewhat sad, note. Unfortunately, it was dragged out with several scenes and character actions meant to evoke sadness, but felt too forced to do so.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it started okay and sometimes good at first, but the ending, among other things, was a letdown.\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "Ever since the first season of Love Live School Idol Project aired last winter, the series has gained a considerable amount of popularity. Since I enjoyed the prequel, I was excited when a second season was announced since Muse will have a second chance of achieving their dreams and number one in Love Live.\r\nThe story continues from the prequel with Honoka becoming Student Council President as an honor of saving the school from being shut down. Shortly after, news about a larger scale Love Live competition started to spread where regional groups have to compete in the final rounds. While Honoka did not want toparticipate at first, she ultimately decides to enter since it was Eli\u2019s, Nozomi\u2019s and Nico\u2019s last chance to participate with the rest of Muse in Love Live before they graduate. With A-Rise being the big rival in their division, the group now has to do their best to become the number one School Idol group in the competition.\\n\\n\r\nLike the last season, the characters and premise are still enjoyable. In the sequel, they finally gave the other four members, Nico, Rin, Nozomi and Maki the spotlight. While I enjoyed these episodes, I liked Rin\u2019s not because she is one of my favorite idols, but I liked how her friends help her resolve her complex of not being able to see herself as being cute because of her short hair. Even so, there are still a lot of enjoyable moments outside these episodes such as Honoka\u2019s diet woes and Muse girls up with crazy costume ideas just to generate impact.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, I felt somewhat disappointed with A-Rise being treated as a goal rather than a true rival. Besides the first performance, I think that they are there just to motivate Muse to become better. In fact, we didn\u2019t get to see them perform in the final preliminaries. Instead, the writers decided to show Honoka, Umi and Kotori struggle their way through a blizzard. To me, I would like to see them as an actual rival by allowing the viewers to see them perform like in the third episode so Muse\u2019s win would feel more meaningful. Not only that, I bet most people want to see them perform \u201cPrivate Wars\u201d opposed to watching the snowstorm melodrama.\\n\\n\r\nAs a whole, I felt that the second season of Love Live School Idol Project is just as enjoyable as the prequel, just with more heartwarming moments. While the animation quality looks just as good, I\u2019m still bothered by the use of CG since Muse\u2019s performance still looks awkward. What baffles me is that A-Rise\u2019s performance of \u201cShocking Party\u201d looked better because it\u2019s animated. I suppose Sunrise didn\u2019t want to go through the trouble of animating all 9 girls. Not only that, most of the songs Muse sung are completely/mostly in unison, thus making it sound as if it lacked character even if its good. If they presented some of the songs from the three subunits (Printemps, BiBi and Lily White) of Muse or even solos, I think it would leave a better impression on the viewer. Despite these flaws, I still enjoyed the sequel and its worth checking out if you enjoyed the first season.",

The length was perfect, they take the time to flesh out the characters, and the story was wonderful.\r\nStory: It starts a little strange and picks off right where the first season ended.  Best part about this season?  Very little flashbacks and when they do, it's done exactly how it's supposed to: you already knew what happened and only the small bits are there to add emotional effect.  Again, no fillers which is greatand there's very little material used to waste air time.  The misadventures of the 9 lead to a great finish and the series does what you don't want it to do, but knows has to happen the way it does (no spoilers).\\n\\n\r\nArt: Same issue with the first season, inconsistent quality with close-up shots and the panned out shots.  I don't understand why they felt the need to do this for the second season, but I got over it.  The performances are drawn better and it's amazing how much more detail is added on the second season to everyone's individual movements to the background.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Definitely better but again, nothing that left a lasting impression.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I was surprised how well the series could pull off doing character development episodes without being boring and exclusive to one character.  There are moments that are just beautiful to hilarious.  Nothing out of character, yet as everyone interacts, you can't help but liking each character to some degree.  They ask questions that has everyone in Muse wondering, \"why am I doing this?\" and \"what keeps me going?\"  And when you get to that reason, you can't help but feel something for everyone by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this wouldn't be in my must-have list for everyone to see, I wouldn't pass this one up if you need a new show to watch and you're OK with the school life series and at least a small tolerance of idol groups.  The first series sets up the group and the premise, the second focuses on them as individuals, as a group, and purpose, and executed wonderfully.  Unless you couldn't stomach the first season, the second season will not disappoint.",

            "content": "Review contains some spoilers:\r\nLet me start out by saying that this will be a review of both seasons of Love Live: School Idol Project. There is almost no reason to separate the two seeing as Season 2 is a direct continuation.\r\nAfter being recommended this anime by a plethora of friends and already being a fan of slice of life shows such as K-On I decided to give Love Live a shot. It far exceeded my expectations in every way possible. While I enjoyed the most of the first season more than the second season, it still had a huge impact on me by the ending.So, without further ado lets break this down shall we?\\n\\n\r\nStory/Character:\\n\r\nWhen it comes to Love Live you might immediately think to yourself that the music has to be the strongest point of this show. I mean, it's an Idol show right and nothing more? That's where you would be painfully wrong. The way this show ties together these 9 girls is flawlessly executed. All of them come from not so much a troubled past, but all have problems many of us faced throughout the course of High School. Their common goal brings them together putting them through numerous hardships and triumphs ultimately leading to their success in saving their school. On the other hand, they did not make it to Love Live the first time showing us the common principle that you can't win everything. On that note, the only thing I did not like about the show was how forced the second season felt. I could have guessed that they would be able to perform at Love Live, but I expected more of a time skip between the two competitions. All of that aside I still found myself engrossed in Season 2 by the heart wrenching end. The three 3rd year girls graduating and leaving the group hit me really hard. Leaving High School and abandoning all of your friends has to be one of the hardest things I have endured personally, and seeing these characters grow together and inevitably parting ways in the end was heart breaking.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Art:\\n\r\nThe music was of course fantastic seeing as we are watching a show about idols here. If poppy upbeat music isn't your thing however you might find yourself loathing most of the soundtrack and dance sequences. The art was very bright and vivid leaving me with no complaints in that department as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nAt the end of the day this anime has a lot of tropes that are probably going to spike negativity in some reviews , but for me the way that they tied these characters together was beautiful. I always found myself laughing, smiling, or even tearing up throughout the series and I can't wait to watch the movie for more fun to come!",

            "content": "This has to be quite a plot twist. I would have never expected that an anime would make me cry. You see, I'm a guy, and as most of you know, guys don't cry. But in my case, if there's something, anything that can make me relate to a certain situation, or just simply be too emotional, I will cry. That's what happened with this second season of this franchise.\r\nLet's start of with the obvious stuff: this is the continuation of the events in the first season. Everything seems to be alright so far. Thr girls are still as cheerful as I remembered and thesongs are great too. But then, the things that really made me feel, well, a bit sad were the last 4 or so episodes...\\n\r\nChoosing to disband \u03bc's, to me, seems like quite a stupud idea and I still don't understand this choise. The scene where all the girls are crying in the train station, that thing reminded me of something similar that happen back when I was in a dance school. Everyone was crying, exept me. I try to only cry behind closed doors and that's what I've done back then. This feeling of sadness and somewhat nostalgia made me to either stare and not think of anything else or to cry pretty hard while watching not only that part, but also watching the flashbacks Honoka had while standing on the rooftop of the highschool. I'm still embarrassed by that, but, well, what can I do? \\n\\n\r\nThe thing that recovered some of my happiness was the fact that the movie would stoll continue this wonderful, yet sad story.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, if you're way too sensible, just like me, I would suggest you to stop at the first season and switch to something else. Otherwise, if you want to hurt yourself or you are just way more normal than me, then go ahead and watch this. You won't regret it.",

However, the fight for the competition is not yet over because there is another Love Live! competition to participate and it is more challenging than ever. Now, the all nine members are reunited once again to sing their hearts out and win the competition. Thereis a big challenge however, the three third years are about to graduate and they must decide to continue performing without the third years or disband for good  and adding the pressure is the responsibilities as the new student council members of the founding three, Honoka Kousaka, Kotori Minami and Umi Sonoda. Can they handle all of these at the same time? Find out. (Okay, enough of a promo-esque act) The story has more drama, comedy and heartaches than ever because they are facing challenges and inner struggles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Nothing has changed since the first season but the are new characters that the \u03bc's  will about to meet such as their rival idol group, A-Rise in person.\\n\\n\r\nMusic and Sound - The series added more \u03bc's songs such as my personal favorite, \"Snow Halation\". \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation - Sunrise is ableto  showcase the beauty of Akihabara especially during nighttime such as Gyoko Street, a location used for the music video of \"Snow Halation\"  which is very realistic and mirrors like the real life counterpart. The CGI animation of the series is so cool just like the previous season.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - Just like the first season, the series is enjoyable to watch because of their determination to win the competition as well as their awesome music.",

            "content": "I finally decided to start writing reviews so here goes my first. \r\nI watched Love Live Season 1 and gave it an eight. Like others have mentioned, it was a bit rocky at first but turned out beautiful. But this is about Season 2. \r\nI gave this a 9/10 mostly because I rarely give out a 10. It's as close to pushing me to a 10 as it can be without actually making a 10. However there are a few 10s in certain categories such as art, sound and characters. \r\nStory: ASCII killed it. They absolutely killed it. The studio took a winning idea andmade it better. The show has a great way of doing what they did in season 1 but doing it more completely. They avoid overdoing the tropes and the factors that made season 1 great. There is a healthy addition of certain character back stories including Nozomi which I know was a draw for many. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a good deal of the usual light humor, and then their is episode 6 which is gloriously funny so long as you understand the characters well enough. Later episodes beef up the tension and frustration of the girls without being cheesy or overdone. The one and only complaint which brings this rating to a 9/10 is episode 7 which has a strange and slightly forced theme. However, it's easily forgotten as episode 6 will make you laugh for days and episode 8 will make you sob with the same intensity. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: I give  ther art style a 10/10 because I am specifically choosing to compare it to new style art as opposed to older styles such as DBZ, Card Captor, and  Gundamn. It's an argument many have over and over but to compare cel animation versus HD/high tech animation is to do each style a disservice. In comparison to HD/high-tech post-90's animation, Love Live Idol Project Season 2 is near perfect. Background is rich and not ignored. The detail and care taken on the outfits is wonderful. The colors are not by any means unique but it's not overdone. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: What's to say? The songs are superb and varied. Listen to them. I have no more to say here. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I have to give character a 10/10. There is simply something for everyone. Tsundere? Check. Sweet and saccharine? Check. Moody? Check. Comic relief? Check. Honorable? Check. And on and on. You get the idea. None of the characters are are shoved in your face. Some may say they dislike Honoka or Kotori for reasons of being generic. While I disagree completely, I can understand how in Season 1 you might be inclined to say so. No more in Season 2. Both Kotori and Honoka are deeper in Season 2. The other 7 girls are made that much better. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's an idol show. It's an idol show done right. It's an idol show that does the job better than other idol shows by a country mile. There is a good deal of replay value to this season. Several episodes can stand alone and much like a beloved show such as The Office (American) or Parks and Recreation, you can watch several episodes many times over and not get bored. Perhaps the only issue is that the season is short at 13 episodes. That's my only complaint. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nGo watch if you haven't already\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Kotori is the best. \\n\\n\r\nPeace out and Nico Nico Nii\\n\\n",

The great graphics, characters and music are still here, but despite a worthy ending, the story stumbles a bit.\r\nThe first season was all about the characters overcoming internal obstacles and growing as artists and as persons. Many obstacles in this season are more of the external kind. Which is a shame; after the brilliant introduction of the cast the first season gave us, I would have hoped the plot would be deeper and even more character driven this time around. Instead we got blizzards, hurricanes and inavoidable deadlines,all in a rather episodic format. The last couple of episodes however, are wonderful and almost made me forgive the somewhat disappointing first half. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, a bright and heartwarming show that couldn't quite keep up with my expectations from the first season.\\n\\n\r\nAlright, keep the downvotes coming...",

            "content": "Love Live! School Idol Project! - A very popular fun and entertaining series that most people adore.\r\nWe've got our fav school idols in another season, this time better than the last. After finishing the movie and series, and crying over the ending, I've decided to review this great anime!\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nIn the 2nd season of Love Live!, we get to see the girls do their best to win Love Live! In the first season, Honoka, the main character, tries to start her own school idol group, in hopes of raising her school's popularity. \u03bc's , the group that Honoka leads, also tries to win Love Live!in the first season, but due to an event that I do not want to spoil, they didn't. In the second season, the girls have a chance to win Love Live! and take home a win! We get to see them work hard to try and win, and during this hilarious and amazing journey, we hear some spectacular songs, the characters friendships grown stronger, how they do their best against their rivals, and you might shed a few tears while watching this season, and the movie.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nCompared to some anime shows I've seen, this show has very good art. It's not fabulous, but it's absolutely NOT ugly. The drawings are cute and beautiful, especially \u03bc's!\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nFor me, the songs from Love Live! are OUTSTANDING!!!! The songs are engaging and the voices from this show go so well together! Love Live! is so popular, they even let the voice actors of \u03bc's actually sing and dance in front of a real, live audience! Just like the anime, the songs are amazing and we all love listening to \u03bc's songs again and again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe characters are cute and own have their own unique personality, such as Nico Yazawa doing her Nico-Nico Ni!, Rin Hoshizora saying nya at the end of every sentence, and Nozomi Tojo being a fortune teller with her cards, and also being very wise, even if she did *ahem* something in the first season that I wasn't very comfortable with. But hey, those three are still excellent characters, and so are the other members, but they aren't the most unique. Honoka is an upbeat and funny character, which is quite common for mains. Kotori, who is sweet and kind, is one of the best friends of Honoka. Umi, the other best and childhood friend of Honoka, is strict and determined. Hanayo, shy and nice, Eli, calm and mature, and Maki, a tsundere. They're all really funny in some situations, especially Honoka, Rin and Nico, but even so, most of the characters are slightly ordinary.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nLove Live! is simply outstanding!! It's really funny and enjoyable, and this anime is sure to catch your interest if if you musical animes. The only down-side is that there are many other anime shows with girls trying to become idols. When boys are centre, such as in the anime 'Starmyu', the anime is more rare than others, but it doesn't matter whether the story focuses on girls or boys. As long as you like it, it's amazing. Love Live! is spectacular and is all over the media, so I recommend you watch this spectacular show!! :3",

            "content": "Story:\r\nA major step up from the first season. Everything feels better and the pacing is better! Is a little more play in my opinion but that makes the show more relaxing. I also cried at the end so there's that\r\nArt:\r\nCharacter seems a little more detail this time! But for me the big change is the color scheme. It's more colorful and the CGI improved alot\r\nSound:\r\nYet again, Is a 10/10\r\nCharacter:\r\nThis is what I think improved majorly, most of the character got an actual background and episode.  Made me just that bit more care for them\r\nEnjoyment:\r\nOverall still super amazing to watch, I still rate this asthe best Idol anime and I think alot of people agree with me. Never thought a show can make me cry huh",

            "content": "Love Live! School Idol Project is by no means the best show around. It's standard fare, run-of-the-mill, and doesn't really stand out. Yet for some reason I still adored this show. Why? There's no enticing romance, no exciting action. It's not particularly funny, and for a show with nine lead female characters there's an astounding lack of fanservice. So then what is it that made this show so damn enjoyable?\r\nIn short, the answer lies in the characters themselves. I've always been of the belief that characters can make or break a show, and Love Live! is a prime example of that. Coming out of thefirst season, I didn't think it was all that special, but I enjoyed watching it, a lot more so than some of the more subjectively appealing shows I've seen. Hearing that a second season was announced, I was so happy to see such a modest success getting more attention. Now, with the second season having come to a close, I can say with certainty that it was absolutely worth the ride.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nNaturally the story is the weakest part of Love Live. It's the simple tale of a group of highschool girls who form an Idol group to save their school from closing. They then go on to enter the popular \"Love Live\" Idol competition. Nothing special about it, that's really all there is to say. While there's nothing noteworthy about it, it's not really bad either, hence the fair rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nFor such a basic show, it was surprisingly beautiful looking. The animations were smooth, the characters were able to stand out without needing unreal hair colours, and the 3D models used for the dances were almost seemlessly inserted. It didn't accomplish the most stunning feats, but for what it did it was phenomenal.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nAs the name suggests, this show is chock full of the kind of J-pop you'd hear from idols. If that's your cup of tea, then look no further because the soundtrack of this show will blow you away. If you're not too fond of the genre, you'd best look elsewhere, because that's about all this show has to offer. But then what are you watching it for if you don't like idol music, anyways?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nLike I said early, the characters are really what made this show. Their personalities are unique and portrayed spectacularly, and they synergize with each other in a remarkable way. Watching the show start to finish, I couldn't help but empathize with them through their ups and downs. They took such a humble story and made it something truly beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nIt's still hard to believe how much I enjoyed watching this show. The first season took me by surprise, but I was ready going into the second one, and even then I was blown away. For something so light to make such an impact really says a lot.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nLove Live is most certainly a very good show. If you want something different from all the action and drama you typically see, and are just looking for a nice leisurely ride, then give this show a watch. I'm sure you'll enjoy it from beginning to end... or is it the end? In a stunning announcement at the end of the final episode, production of a film was confirmed. I was certainly taken by surprise, and I'm excited to experience \u03bc's one last time.",
