            "content": "Yeah, it's a gag anime. A ridiculously cute, hyper, gag anime.\r\nSome of the anime's good points include: a rapid-fire funny dialogue, a cast of oddball characters, a truly out-there plot, the occasional jab at some manga/anime conventions, a short-skit format that never lets it drag, cute overload in every episode, and a ton of fujoshi fanservice (or is it a parody of fujoshi fanservice? Who cares, it works either way!)\r\nThe art's very pretty when it's not chibified, and even the chibification's  used to full effect to prop up the gags, so it all works out in the end.\r\nThe cast gives top-notch performances - I'dnever had imagined Ookawa Tohru could be this outrageously funny, for one. He also performs the ED btw, which is the comedy gem cherry on top of the ridiculousness sundae of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it might be a bit overwhelming and even seem nonsensical for people who prefer a more sedate or sober mode of storytelling. But if you're in the mood for something cute that doesn't take itself too seriously you should give this a shot. It delivers in spades.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a nonsense anime, here's your place.\r\nCuticle Tantei Inaba at first may looks like a ridiculous comedy, but there's a lot of action in there too, as the anime goes on. Ok, there's still the funny stuff, but the background of Hiroshi's life and family starts to get revealed and you  may find the seriousness in some episodes awkward, but later all the chibi gags will be back. And it's exactly the balanceament of both styles that made the anime really nice to watch.\r\nJust as I said above, the story is completely made of nonsense. The idea is so crazy thatit looks amazing, but it also could go very wrong. Inaba went by the right way, thankfully. I mean, when would I think that I'd be liking so much a anime about a werewolf detective fighting against a mafia goat?\\n\r\n[Story - 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have really nice and creative designs that also resemble their personalities in some way. Kei, the 'only sane man' in this show has this plain look, for an example. The animation was very well done (and I watched the whole anime in SLQ!) and so was the colouring. I never heard of the studio before, but ZEXCS has done a very good work. (Looking at their previous works, I saw it's the same studio of Sukitte na Ii yo and Denyuuden)\\n\r\n[Art - 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good! It was a bit strange to hear Hiroshi's seiyuu, Suwabe Junichi (who voiced Grimmjow from Bleach and Aomine from KuroBasu) to talk in such a high pitch, and Ookawa Toru (Mustang from FMA) did a amazing job as Valentino! Kei's seiyuu was also pretty good (poor guy, he screams a lot). I simply loved the opening! It's so fast paced and makes you more excited to watch the episode. The ending was ok, and the ost is rarely noticiable (I don't even remember if there was any music in the anime's background).\\n\r\n[Sound - 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nSomeone once said me that 'the characters from Cuticle Tantei Inaba looked like if the creator used some random rpg character generator and copied the results'. It's something like this, because there's no normal person in this! Even Kei, the 'only sane man'-type was a bit freak. And the coolest about the characters are this randomness! We have the hero with a hair fetish, the mysterious man obssessed with his leader (a goat), the psycho trap, a few last-episode characters... The triumph of this anime are the characters!\\n\r\n[Character - 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nSo, this review is getting long and you may already be tired of me. Sorry. Resuming, the thing is - I LOVE Cuticle Tantei Inaba. It was the reason for me to look foward to next weekend, and every episode passed in a blink of an eye to me. It was amazing and I enjoyed every second of it at it's fullest. It's a great anime to watch when you're bored, or feeling down, or just... It's so nice and cute.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 10/10]\\n\\n\r\n(Oh, a last hour warning. There's a lot of chibi and fujoshi fanservice. You've been warned.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is my second review, so a feedback would be really cool!",

            "content": "Does an anime have to make sense to be good? Or even have a general direction to be appreciated? And how far can a show really go through just plain humor and gags? Well, pretty far if you consider this gem of a show which neither did get the attention it deserves nor did it fool itself with that notion. Rather the creator and the artists just tried to give enjoyment to the select few viewers it is likely to get and achieved even a certain level of perfection in their approach. And having a cool villain or rather a cool mafia goat (not jokingreally) villain is a huge boost to this awesome attempt at insane comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot-line is absolutely ridiculous in a good way, it follows a werewolf detective Hiroshi Inaba in his attempts to catch the goat mafia Don Valentino through solving some really funny cases along the way. The overall story also has subplots involving Hiroshi trying to reunite with his brother and various other side characters including the narrator Kei generally goofing around. On a first glance it doesn't seem much as you expect some kind of show that is bound to get repetitive, well that is so wrong. Each and every episode has generally 2 parts in it and you never guess what to expect next. With a interesting cast of characters the writers threw one after another of these funny situations and you can never guess what to expect next. There are episodes featuring flashbacks and even chibi characters in a unrelated story and even a day at the zoo. Despite the randomness and wacky humor at a few times during the show you almost think the writer is trying to get serious with some emotional scene and right then you are almost smacked in the face with even more slapstick humor.\\n\r\nThere is a background plot involving the main characters' past and corruption in police department which seems to have a more serious basis but then again the writer pulls you back into the fray with his very rich sense of humor and enjoyable variety of characters.\\n\r\nThe story gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as always are the life of a show like this and this show is quite lively with them. From the hair fetishist werewolf Hiroshi to his cross dressing over protective assistant Yuuta to almost normal yet manically cat loving other assistant Kei. From superhuman detective Ogi and his incredible family to all other minor side characters (such as the goat's Lorengo, hot blooded assassin Gabriella, cute mad scientist Noah and real weak brother of the main character to name a few) all are very unique in their roles and add to enjoyment in a very nice way. Special mention is to be given of the mafia goat Don Valentino, to me he is one of the most interesting villainous character ever in any anime out there (at least comedy wise). His unique way of speaking and his money eating tendency, his various tricks that usually backfires in weird ways and his unique sense of mafia honor really adds to the overall charm of the show. No matter what other people would like to tell you the goat is the star of this show, period.\\n\r\nThe characters are the most interesting and gets 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough a show like this one obviously had a low budget the people behind it really did a great job of not making it noticeable through the animation. While it never really tries to reach any new boundaries with its art and animation it does the job perfectly well through its various comical drawing styles with nice chibi drawings and some excellent shots of the characters in many forms (as they even did a manly goat!) which overall add to the wacky humor and make you really laugh out loud.\\n\r\nThis gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was once again quite nicely complimentary to the atmosphere of the show. But I have to mention the voice actors as in a show like this they have huge responsibilities which in this case they pulled off nicely. Tooru Ookawa was once again the star as the Don Valention, I mean that ending theme is something that I almost never could skip. He did an excellent job and despite everything most of the times I really rooted for the Don knowing fully well he would never succeed. Other aspects of music and sound on the show was not bad by any means but never really draws attention to any detail.\\n\r\nThe voice acting pushes the show to a new boundary so the sound gets 8.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of this reminiscence, I really do keep remembering the fun I had watching the show, as at the last episode while the cast kept saying how they are sad this is the last episode I couldn't help but be sad with them. This show was something I enjoyed just for sure power of wacky humor and incredible cast of characters and would love to see more of them which I know is never gonna happen. Fortunately this show have much re-watch value and I just might do that in the future. Highly recommended to any fans of comedy or any one just wanting to watch a light show for fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score -\\n\r\n                         8.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "This is what it looks like when Grell Sutcliff ever gets an anime to himself. From the looks of the cover it seriously looks like an anime which you should avoid(because of the goat)- but don't judge the cover because you'll be loosing a good gem to your anime list. \r\nThis story follows the Cuticle Detective: Hiroshi Inaba who is a artificial cloned Doberman that works for the police and a new threat arises when the goat: Don Valentino (master of a Mafia organization) makes his d\u00e9but in Japan. \r\nStory: So to say this story was fast paced and the only genres that it satisfiedwas comedy and action i suppose. The story wasn't serious, even though it's categorized as a mystery there's only one mystery to the whole plot and it was given through within this 13 episodes but nevertheless i wasn't a klutz to give this one an eight unless it was entertaining. The whole story is a comedy and a little bit of seriousness added to the mix. The only flaw of this anime that it went fast paced with the character introductions(no not the main characters- but the secret characters)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The chara's were drawn very well- although there were some references from other anime like Yuuta is drawn like Armin from SNK and Inaba is very similar to Grell Sutecliffe from Black Butler. The chibi versions of the characters are so cute that literally it makes you go all fuzzy. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening was good- it makes you feel nostalgic. This one is sung by the lead Seiyu who voices Inaba:Yuuichi Suwabe, and the ending was sung by the actor who voiced the goat. The soundtracks were okay- the choir like music in the last episode was epic. The seiyu's did a great job- Sugita Tomozaku(Gin-san) makes an appearance here- popular Seiyus like Fukuyama Jun(irony since he did Grell) and Okamoto Nobuhiko(Rin from Blue Exorcist) does minor roles but the other Seiyus made an enormous contribution too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This one is a comedy and good one at that- but this anime could also get ridiculously serious at some point, the seriousness of the characters is at debate here- the villains are on neither side with the protagonists. I have never seen villains who get along side the protagonists like this. The punch-line giver,the cross dresser,the brother complex and the daddy's daughter fetishes can be found here. There are hidden emotions of the character's and you need to notice them and feel them. Hints were given throughout the anime and it would unmistakeably reveal that these characters are toughened up by the abrupt battles of the past. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this one- i was really sad when I hit the last episode. The show has class A comedy and jokes with punch lines. The character's have the cute version and silly/serious version. Definitely a must watch if you have the wolf/dog lover or a cat lover trait. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was pretty interesting, there were some surprising plot twists that you can never imagine. And the turnouts of the characters are quite surprising. I loved that there was an episode about the spooky forest of Aokigahara- this anime is overall very much nostalgic and many of the audience commented that it definitely deserved a second season. An eight is given because of the creativity,comedy,art, great Seiyu dubbing and a good opening.",

But i liked the jokes so 7 is a good score.\r\nThe art is also very good. Specially because the characters are shown as chibis half of the time.\r\nso i gave it an 8.\r\nThe voice actors have voiced all the characters superbly. The ending song is disappointing but the Opening is good. so another 8.\r\nCharacters are cute.so 8.\\n\\n\r\nEven though everything has got an 8, for me, the enjoyment's gotta be 10. I don't know how others find it, some may think i'm overrating it,  but as a comedy fan i loved it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, 8. Anyone who loves comedy its gotta be 8.\\n\\n\r\nSome people, who comment on each and every small things and make it a drama, may say its \"gay\" or something, but note this, its from a shonen manga.

            "content": "8.1/10\r\nIt was a very enjoyable anime. I was curious about it after watching an AMV.\r\nThere isn't much story, it's more of a \"bits-and-pieces\", \"daily lives\" kind of story. However, the one entire story is where a goat is the villain and steals money just to eat it, and there is a wolf detective who can derive information from hair. (It might sound really bad, but it's pretty good) Does an anime have to make sense to be great? I would say it was a pretty good and funny story because even though it was more of a Slice of Life anime, it added good comedywhen applicable. The story is meant for comedy, so it gives us a good laugh while maintaining action between detectives and the villain.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the characters was very appealing. Inaba Hiroshi is very handsome, the other main detective seems serious and cares about his work, and Inaba's 2 assistants both look capable and reliable. If you ignore that one of them is a trap. XD\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was quite good and was there to show the action in the anime, and introduce the characters within 1:30, but the ending was there for comedic effect, having Don Valentino (the goat) sing. It was meant just to loosen the viewer up and it was the cherry on top for a comedic anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, no matter how comedic an anime this is, you are able to see Inaba's backstory as well as another wolf detective that plays an important role. You also see the trap's assistant's relationships change, especially with Ogino (other main detective). Kei, the other assistant, also changes his views on the odd-ball group and ends up fitting in within the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime. It was a good one to kick back with and relax with. If you were having a stressful day, I recommend watching this anime to unwind. It has comedy, action, a touch of feels, and is a great anime. Unfortunately, I think this anime doesn't get the attention it deserves.",

I guarantee you that you're gonna laugh a lot, or at least smile, for sure.\r\nStory: Now, the story is really stupid. It's pretty much the protagonist needs to stop the evil guy... Oh wait, it's a goat. A goat that eats money (no, really, literally eats money) is so evil you have to do something about it. \r\nBut that'sok, it's a comedy anime after all, it doesn't need a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't know, but I love the art so much.

It's cute too, since they turn chibi a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I really, really love the opening, listened to it for a month. \\n\r\nEnding is funny, but kinda dramatic at the same time. \\n\r\nSoundtrack is basically detective kind of music, it's fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, they're the best ones, I adore the characters. They might look \"normal\" but they're really unique, every single one has something that makes you like them. I didn't dislike any of them.\\n\r\nThey're not serious, don't have a super character development or anything, they're just like a character from a comedy anime should be: crazy. Because hell, all of them are really weird, they all have funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this so much, it's one of my favorite anime so of course I enjoyed it a lot. Laughed myself to tears and had a great time watching it. When I was bored, it cheered me up and made my day better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nThis anime has everything I like from a comedy anime: very random kind of humor, cuteness, sometimes cool \"action\" scenes, great characters. \\n\r\nThe only bad thing I have to say about this is that it isn't very popular so it had only 12 episodes, sadly. I just need more. \\n",

Granted, CD Inaba isn't as recent as the various fairy tale movies that just came out, like Snow White and the Huntress or even the latest Alice in Wonderland, but I just found CD Inaba a couple of months ago and they all seemed to be rolling together.\r\nThough I have to admit, no one in Hollywood would ever twist nursery stories the way that Mochi did with The Wolf andSeven Kids to come up with CD Inaba. It works though, in a ludicrously wacky kind of way. It's like they took a pancake, flipped it and it came down looking like strawberry smores with peanut butter syrup.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing though, is that the end of the anime came so abruptly. A lot of the underlying plotlines were left hanging. Also, what the heck was Lorenzo keeping under the bag?!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I personally find this interesting because of the fact it's not serious, it takes a turn on the usually serious and mysterious feeling an actual mystery story has and it turns it into this funny and nonsensical story to watch. Now, I don't recommend it for anyone who was expecting that, because you might as well justwatch something else with an actual mystery plot to it. I'm not saying this anime lacks plot completely, because it doesn't, I'm simply saying that for this anime, comedy is more of a first priority and it's purpose is to have the watcher enjoy it as opposed to feel emotionally moved by the story. All in all, it was an enjoyable anime, at least for me and while I have a few mixed feelings about it, it was good. Despite what other people may say about it and how downgraded it could be, it's not the worst anime out there and it could in fact be much worse.",

He quit the police force and started his own detective agency, his ability is to go into differenttypes of wolf form based on the hair he eats. His enemy? Don Valentino. a goat. Ikr...I waited for the punch line, but it doesn't exist. Don is a goat, and a criminal mastermind with a taste for yen notes. Inaba tries to \"catch\" Don whenever Don pulls off some hair brained scheme. I say \"catch\" because they are actually more like frenemies who enjoy competing against each other. Kei is dragged along on all the exploits as Inaba's assistant and suffers through every single one of them. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot more to this anime than that, but telling you would spoil it. If you want to learn more, you just have to watch. This anime has a lot pointless comedy, with amazing characters, every single one is unique and has never been copied. Enjoy the watch!",

You have Don Valentino, head of some crazy mafia family and he steals money so... he can eat it. And Inaba and his crew try to arrest him -this isn't even spoiling, as Ahm... it'sbasically the base of the entire anime. there's no development, no emocional awakening or soothing like that. \\n\r\nIt's a Gag anime, you'll watch it for the laughs not for the story.

Again, there's no character growth, but I really don't think that'd be possible anyway :P\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall it's really a great comedy anime that goes over the top with crazy plots, crazier characters, some great art and some extra laugh in the middle.\\n\r\nThere's not much to say other than you'll watch it if you like to laugh.",

A ridiculously cute, hyper, gag anime.\r\nSome of the anime's good points include: a rapid-fire funny dialogue, a cast of oddball characters, a truly out-there plot, the occasional jab at some manga/anime conventions, a short-skit format that never lets it drag, cute overload in every episode, and a ton of fujoshi fanservice (or is it a parody of fujoshi fanservice? Who cares, it works either way!)\r\nThe art's very pretty when it's not chibified, and even the chibification's  used to full effect to prop up the gags, so it all works out in the end.\r\nThe cast gives top-notch performances - I'dnever had imagined Ookawa Tohru could be this outrageously funny, for one. He also performs the ED btw, which is the comedy gem cherry on top of the ridiculousness sundae of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, it might be a bit overwhelming and even seem nonsensical for people who prefer a more sedate or sober mode of storytelling. But if you're in the mood for something cute that doesn't take itself too seriously you should give this a shot. It delivers in spades.",

            "content": "If you're looking for a nonsense anime, here's your place.\r\nCuticle Tantei Inaba at first may looks like a ridiculous comedy, but there's a lot of action in there too, as the anime goes on. Ok, there's still the funny stuff, but the background of Hiroshi's life and family starts to get revealed and you  may find the seriousness in some episodes awkward, but later all the chibi gags will be back. And it's exactly the balanceament of both styles that made the anime really nice to watch.\r\nJust as I said above, the story is completely made of nonsense. The idea is so crazy thatit looks amazing, but it also could go very wrong. Inaba went by the right way, thankfully. I mean, when would I think that I'd be liking so much a anime about a werewolf detective fighting against a mafia goat?\\n\r\n[Story - 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters have really nice and creative designs that also resemble their personalities in some way. Kei, the 'only sane man' in this show has this plain look, for an example. The animation was very well done (and I watched the whole anime in SLQ!) and so was the colouring. I never heard of the studio before, but ZEXCS has done a very good work. (Looking at their previous works, I saw it's the same studio of Sukitte na Ii yo and Denyuuden)\\n\r\n[Art - 9/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good! It was a bit strange to hear Hiroshi's seiyuu, Suwabe Junichi (who voiced Grimmjow from Bleach and Aomine from KuroBasu) to talk in such a high pitch, and Ookawa Toru (Mustang from FMA) did a amazing job as Valentino! Kei's seiyuu was also pretty good (poor guy, he screams a lot). I simply loved the opening! It's so fast paced and makes you more excited to watch the episode. The ending was ok, and the ost is rarely noticiable (I don't even remember if there was any music in the anime's background).\\n\r\n[Sound - 8/10]\\n\\n\r\nSomeone once said me that 'the characters from Cuticle Tantei Inaba looked like if the creator used some random rpg character generator and copied the results'. It's something like this, because there's no normal person in this! Even Kei, the 'only sane man'-type was a bit freak. And the coolest about the characters are this randomness! We have the hero with a hair fetish, the mysterious man obssessed with his leader (a goat), the psycho trap, a few last-episode characters... The triumph of this anime are the characters!\\n\r\n[Character - 10/10]\\n\\n\r\nSo, this review is getting long and you may already be tired of me. Sorry. Resuming, the thing is - I LOVE Cuticle Tantei Inaba. It was the reason for me to look foward to next weekend, and every episode passed in a blink of an eye to me. It was amazing and I enjoyed every second of it at it's fullest. It's a great anime to watch when you're bored, or feeling down, or just... It's so nice and cute.\\n\r\n[Enjoyment - 10/10]\\n\\n\r\n(Oh, a last hour warning. There's a lot of chibi and fujoshi fanservice. You've been warned.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is my second review, so a feedback would be really cool!",

            "content": "Does an anime have to make sense to be good? Or even have a general direction to be appreciated? And how far can a show really go through just plain humor and gags? Well, pretty far if you consider this gem of a show which neither did get the attention it deserves nor did it fool itself with that notion. Rather the creator and the artists just tried to give enjoyment to the select few viewers it is likely to get and achieved even a certain level of perfection in their approach. And having a cool villain or rather a cool mafia goat (not jokingreally) villain is a huge boost to this awesome attempt at insane comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot-line is absolutely ridiculous in a good way, it follows a werewolf detective Hiroshi Inaba in his attempts to catch the goat mafia Don Valentino through solving some really funny cases along the way. The overall story also has subplots involving Hiroshi trying to reunite with his brother and various other side characters including the narrator Kei generally goofing around. On a first glance it doesn't seem much as you expect some kind of show that is bound to get repetitive, well that is so wrong. Each and every episode has generally 2 parts in it and you never guess what to expect next. With a interesting cast of characters the writers threw one after another of these funny situations and you can never guess what to expect next. There are episodes featuring flashbacks and even chibi characters in a unrelated story and even a day at the zoo. Despite the randomness and wacky humor at a few times during the show you almost think the writer is trying to get serious with some emotional scene and right then you are almost smacked in the face with even more slapstick humor.\\n\r\nThere is a background plot involving the main characters' past and corruption in police department which seems to have a more serious basis but then again the writer pulls you back into the fray with his very rich sense of humor and enjoyable variety of characters.\\n\r\nThe story gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as always are the life of a show like this and this show is quite lively with them. From the hair fetishist werewolf Hiroshi to his cross dressing over protective assistant Yuuta to almost normal yet manically cat loving other assistant Kei. From superhuman detective Ogi and his incredible family to all other minor side characters (such as the goat's Lorengo, hot blooded assassin Gabriella, cute mad scientist Noah and real weak brother of the main character to name a few) all are very unique in their roles and add to enjoyment in a very nice way. Special mention is to be given of the mafia goat Don Valentino, to me he is one of the most interesting villainous character ever in any anime out there (at least comedy wise). His unique way of speaking and his money eating tendency, his various tricks that usually backfires in weird ways and his unique sense of mafia honor really adds to the overall charm of the show. No matter what other people would like to tell you the goat is the star of this show, period.\\n\r\nThe characters are the most interesting and gets 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough a show like this one obviously had a low budget the people behind it really did a great job of not making it noticeable through the animation. While it never really tries to reach any new boundaries with its art and animation it does the job perfectly well through its various comical drawing styles with nice chibi drawings and some excellent shots of the characters in many forms (as they even did a manly goat!) which overall add to the wacky humor and make you really laugh out loud.\\n\r\nThis gets 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound was once again quite nicely complimentary to the atmosphere of the show. But I have to mention the voice actors as in a show like this they have huge responsibilities which in this case they pulled off nicely. Tooru Ookawa was once again the star as the Don Valention, I mean that ending theme is something that I almost never could skip. He did an excellent job and despite everything most of the times I really rooted for the Don knowing fully well he would never succeed. Other aspects of music and sound on the show was not bad by any means but never really draws attention to any detail.\\n\r\nThe voice acting pushes the show to a new boundary so the sound gets 8.5 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of this reminiscence, I really do keep remembering the fun I had watching the show, as at the last episode while the cast kept saying how they are sad this is the last episode I couldn't help but be sad with them. This show was something I enjoyed just for sure power of wacky humor and incredible cast of characters and would love to see more of them which I know is never gonna happen. Fortunately this show have much re-watch value and I just might do that in the future. Highly recommended to any fans of comedy or any one just wanting to watch a light show for fun.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score -\\n\r\n                         8.5 out of 10.",

            "content": "This is what it looks like when Grell Sutcliff ever gets an anime to himself. From the looks of the cover it seriously looks like an anime which you should avoid(because of the goat)- but don't judge the cover because you'll be loosing a good gem to your anime list. \r\nThis story follows the Cuticle Detective: Hiroshi Inaba who is a artificial cloned Doberman that works for the police and a new threat arises when the goat: Don Valentino (master of a Mafia organization) makes his d\u00e9but in Japan. \r\nStory: So to say this story was fast paced and the only genres that it satisfiedwas comedy and action i suppose. The story wasn't serious, even though it's categorized as a mystery there's only one mystery to the whole plot and it was given through within this 13 episodes but nevertheless i wasn't a klutz to give this one an eight unless it was entertaining. The whole story is a comedy and a little bit of seriousness added to the mix. The only flaw of this anime that it went fast paced with the character introductions(no not the main characters- but the secret characters)\\n\\n\r\nArt: The chara's were drawn very well- although there were some references from other anime like Yuuta is drawn like Armin from SNK and Inaba is very similar to Grell Sutecliffe from Black Butler. The chibi versions of the characters are so cute that literally it makes you go all fuzzy. \\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening was good- it makes you feel nostalgic. This one is sung by the lead Seiyu who voices Inaba:Yuuichi Suwabe, and the ending was sung by the actor who voiced the goat. The soundtracks were okay- the choir like music in the last episode was epic. The seiyu's did a great job- Sugita Tomozaku(Gin-san) makes an appearance here- popular Seiyus like Fukuyama Jun(irony since he did Grell) and Okamoto Nobuhiko(Rin from Blue Exorcist) does minor roles but the other Seiyus made an enormous contribution too. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: This one is a comedy and good one at that- but this anime could also get ridiculously serious at some point, the seriousness of the characters is at debate here- the villains are on neither side with the protagonists. I have never seen villains who get along side the protagonists like this. The punch-line giver,the cross dresser,the brother complex and the daddy's daughter fetishes can be found here. There are hidden emotions of the character's and you need to notice them and feel them. Hints were given throughout the anime and it would unmistakeably reveal that these characters are toughened up by the abrupt battles of the past. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I really enjoyed this one- i was really sad when I hit the last episode. The show has class A comedy and jokes with punch lines. The character's have the cute version and silly/serious version. Definitely a must watch if you have the wolf/dog lover or a cat lover trait. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: It was pretty interesting, there were some surprising plot twists that you can never imagine. And the turnouts of the characters are quite surprising. I loved that there was an episode about the spooky forest of Aokigahara- this anime is overall very much nostalgic and many of the audience commented that it definitely deserved a second season. An eight is given because of the creativity,comedy,art, great Seiyu dubbing and a good opening.",

            "content": "8.1/10\r\nIt was a very enjoyable anime. I was curious about it after watching an AMV.\r\nThere isn't much story, it's more of a \"bits-and-pieces\", \"daily lives\" kind of story. However, the one entire story is where a goat is the villain and steals money just to eat it, and there is a wolf detective who can derive information from hair. (It might sound really bad, but it's pretty good) Does an anime have to make sense to be great? I would say it was a pretty good and funny story because even though it was more of a Slice of Life anime, it added good comedywhen applicable. The story is meant for comedy, so it gives us a good laugh while maintaining action between detectives and the villain.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of the characters was very appealing. Inaba Hiroshi is very handsome, the other main detective seems serious and cares about his work, and Inaba's 2 assistants both look capable and reliable. If you ignore that one of them is a trap. XD\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was quite good and was there to show the action in the anime, and introduce the characters within 1:30, but the ending was there for comedic effect, having Don Valentino (the goat) sing. It was meant just to loosen the viewer up and it was the cherry on top for a comedic anime like this.\\n\\n\r\nAs the anime progresses, no matter how comedic an anime this is, you are able to see Inaba's backstory as well as another wolf detective that plays an important role. You also see the trap's assistant's relationships change, especially with Ogino (other main detective). Kei, the other assistant, also changes his views on the odd-ball group and ends up fitting in within the first few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the anime. It was a good one to kick back with and relax with. If you were having a stressful day, I recommend watching this anime to unwind. It has comedy, action, a touch of feels, and is a great anime. Unfortunately, I think this anime doesn't get the attention it deserves.",

But no, you're totally wrong if you think that. \r\nThis is a really silly anime, but that's not a bad thing if you're looking for comedy. I guarantee you that you're gonna laugh a lot, or at least smile, for sure.\r\nStory: Now, the story is really stupid. It's pretty much the protagonist needs to stop the evil guy... Oh wait, it's a goat. A goat that eats money (no, really, literally eats money) is so evil you have to do something about it. \r\nBut that'sok, it's a comedy anime after all, it doesn't need a good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I don't know, but I love the art so much. It's not like the best I've seen but I think the characters look fantastic, they're simple but have something special that makes them look unique. It's cute too, since they turn chibi a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nSound: I really, really love the opening, listened to it for a month. \\n\r\nEnding is funny, but kinda dramatic at the same time. \\n\r\nSoundtrack is basically detective kind of music, it's fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Well, they're the best ones, I adore the characters. They might look \"normal\" but they're really unique, every single one has something that makes you like them. I didn't dislike any of them.\\n\r\nThey're not serious, don't have a super character development or anything, they're just like a character from a comedy anime should be: crazy. Because hell, all of them are really weird, they all have funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I loved this so much, it's one of my favorite anime so of course I enjoyed it a lot. Laughed myself to tears and had a great time watching it. When I was bored, it cheered me up and made my day better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10 \\n\r\nThis anime has everything I like from a comedy anime: very random kind of humor, cuteness, sometimes cool \"action\" scenes, great characters. \\n\r\nThe only bad thing I have to say about this is that it isn't very popular so it had only 12 episodes, sadly. I just need more. \\n",

Granted, CD Inaba isn't as recent as the various fairy tale movies that just came out, like Snow White and the Huntress or even the latest Alice in Wonderland, but I just found CD Inaba a couple of months ago and they all seemed to be rolling together.\r\nThough I have to admit, no one in Hollywood would ever twist nursery stories the way that Mochi did with The Wolf andSeven Kids to come up with CD Inaba. It works though, in a ludicrously wacky kind of way. It's like they took a pancake, flipped it and it came down looking like strawberry smores with peanut butter syrup.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing though, is that the end of the anime came so abruptly. A lot of the underlying plotlines were left hanging. Also, what the heck was Lorenzo keeping under the bag?!\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I personally find this interesting because of the fact it's not serious, it takes a turn on the usually serious and mysterious feeling an actual mystery story has and it turns it into this funny and nonsensical story to watch. Now, I don't recommend it for anyone who was expecting that, because you might as well justwatch something else with an actual mystery plot to it. I'm not saying this anime lacks plot completely, because it doesn't, I'm simply saying that for this anime, comedy is more of a first priority and it's purpose is to have the watcher enjoy it as opposed to feel emotionally moved by the story. All in all, it was an enjoyable anime, at least for me and while I have a few mixed feelings about it, it was good. Despite what other people may say about it and how downgraded it could be, it's not the worst anime out there and it could in fact be much worse.",

Inaba has been genetically altered to be part wolf part human, and all types of weird. He quit the police force and started his own detective agency, his ability is to go into differenttypes of wolf form based on the hair he eats. His enemy? Don Valentino. a goat. Ikr...I waited for the punch line, but it doesn't exist. Don is a goat, and a criminal mastermind with a taste for yen notes. Inaba tries to \"catch\" Don whenever Don pulls off some hair brained scheme. I say \"catch\" because they are actually more like frenemies who enjoy competing against each other. Kei is dragged along on all the exploits as Inaba's assistant and suffers through every single one of them. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot more to this anime than that, but telling you would spoil it. If you want to learn more, you just have to watch. This anime has a lot pointless comedy, with amazing characters, every single one is unique and has never been copied. Enjoy the watch!",

            "content": "I started watching Tantei Inaba by accident, I mean, don't usually watch comedy animes, I watch some animes that happen to contain some comedy within the story, so I was pleasantly surprised when I begun to watch Cuticle Tantei Inaba(CTI).\r\nIt's a great anime that will make you laugh with all the extreme mood swings you see in almost all episodes.\r\nStory: Okay, let's be honest, \"CTI\" has no story per se. You have Don Valentino, head of some crazy mafia family and he steals money so... he can eat it. And Inaba and his crew try to arrest him -this isn't even spoiling, as Ahm... it'sbasically the base of the entire anime. there's no development, no emocional awakening or soothing like that. \\n\r\nIt's a Gag anime, you'll watch it for the laughs not for the story. So I'll give it an 8, because somehow they can pull it all together without that much of a storyline behind it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: They are all so extreme it's almost impossible not to love them. Again, there's no character growth, but I really don't think that'd be possible anyway :P\\n\\n\r\nIn the overall it's really a great comedy anime that goes over the top with crazy plots, crazier characters, some great art and some extra laugh in the middle.\\n\r\nThere's not much to say other than you'll watch it if you like to laugh.",
