            "content": "At the start of watching Gin no Saji, I was unsure of what to think about it. I thought it would be just a fun little slice of life anime, but what I got far exceeded my expectations.\r\nGin no Saji is the perfect example that we each have the ability to set our own path and believe what we want to believe. And even if we face adversity we still stand by our beliefs.\r\nPersonally I have never seen an anime in which a city boy was placed in a farming school, so kudos to the maker of the manga for doing it well. The animemisses no opportunities to put the main character, Hachiken, into situations far outside of his comfort zone, thus leading to hilarious developments. But don't let the comedy fool you, because there are moments in this anime where they ask the tough questions, and you may see things in a different light by the end. Another plus is that there's never too much focus on one side character at a time, and instead they all develop together through their interactions with Hachiken. The story progresses at a steady pace, which allows viewers to get to know the characters, but also prevents boredom by giving you a nice change of scenery every episode or two. If the beginning was a little less slow it would be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art is very well done, and for some of the farm equipment and the more movement oriented scenes it is incredibly detailed and flows almost seamlessly. But, I have to take off some points for the lack of  movement during a good portion of the dialogue oriented scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't much to write home about, but I did enjoy the opening and none of the tracks felt out of place. On another note, the Japanese voice acting was well done, and I felt that most of them fit there characters perfectly. Even better than that though, is that I found none of their voices to be annoying and normally there is at least one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sets this anime apart for me is the characters. Not because they are necessarily original character concepts, but because they each add something to the story, whether it's laughs, insight, or even their worries about the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this anime and would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about watching it.",

            "content": "\u201cBecause of the life they were born into, they are immediately stuck as an existence that can\u2019t even choose their own life and death.\u201d\r\nSuch is the life of livestock. Chickens are killed to be eaten if they don\u2019t lay enough eggs; horses are immediately retired or put to rest if they don\u2019t win any competitions or get injured; and pigs and cows are sold at a really cheap price if they do not eat enough. Behind the scenes of our farms and their livestock, the idea of the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is more clear-cut and harsh than it is in human society. However, humansare judged equally as harsh by the results they produce. In a generation that values the credentials of people more than the people themselves, people who fall behind even a little bit are often shunned or overlooked, just as if they are worthless livestock. Therefore, people of all ages, especially those that are younger, are put under a tremendous amount of pressure to succeed and sometimes forced to take on undesired paths for life. And sadly enough, running away never seems to be an option\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOr does it?\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji (Silver Spoon) tells the story of Hachiken Yugo, a boy that decides to go to an agricultural boarding school far away from home after getting rejected from the high school he was aiming for. Hachiken\u2019s tunnel vision to get into the high school causes him to lose sight of what he really wants to do, and so he chooses the agricultural school to get away from being considered a failure. All of us, especially in our teenage and early adult years, can relate to this experience one way or another: the fact that you work diligently towards a goal and realize soon after that the goal can never be reached is a daunting and depressing thing. To make matters worse, you are forced to see your peers achieve that same goal and become afraid of them lest they judge you for failing. You want to escape, but sometimes the pressure from society, from your family and your friends, all chain you down to sometimes lead the life that you don\u2019t necessarily want.\\n\\n\r\nSo for all those that are troubled like Hachiken, I recommend this slice-of-life anime series. One of the core things that Gin no Saji teaches the viewers is to take a break from all that unhealthy pressure for once and reflect upon what is most important FOR YOU in life. Luckily for Hachiken, he is surrounded by classmates that are all passionate about what they want to do in life. For someone without a goal, seeing determined people who constantly pursue their goal may be discouraging but motivating at the same time. This indirect pressure encourages Hachiken to think earnestly about what he wants to do in life. The new experiences and fun memories made at this new school start to bring out a new side of Hachiken that surprises those that have known him in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe magic of the character of Hachiken is that he came in knowing absolutely nothing about the agricultural high school. At least for me, I could personally relate to Hachiken, only because I had to face the same amount of pressure to do well in school. But not only that, just as Hachiken felt bad for the farm animals being killed off out of obligation, I did too; just as Hachiken had to wake up every morning around five to do work, I could relate to how painful that would be; and just as Hachiken felt indirectly pressured by his passion-driven friends, I did too. That\u2019s why this character is really dear to me, and his development as a person is all the more exciting as this series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nBut if the story of Hachiken Yugo and his friends don\u2019t appeal to you, Gin no Saji has high educational value. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the agricultural businesses and farms, then this anime gives you a glimpse of what it\u2019s like. And in addition to the fun facts about farm animals, equipment, and techniques, the anime takes on philosophical views on what the animals teach humans, and how the animals should be treated. For one thing, everyone in this anime has deep rooted respect for livestock. There are owners that hold extravagant funerals for horses to honor them; there are people who appreciate the animals for providing them a new insight or viewpoint in life; and there are people who make the necessary killing of farm animals as quick and painless as possible. Finally, this anime touches upon not only the future of the agricultural and farming businesses, but also sensitive topics such as animal cruelty and cloning. I value this anime highly because of what it teaches me, each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSince Gin no Saji was in an entirely different setting, background, and pacing from Fullmetal Alchemist, I laid off the manga after two chapters or so. But the anime brought me back to the manga, and what a delight it\u2019s been. As a fan of the slice-of-life genre, Gin no Saji is without a doubt a fresh addition to my list. I look forward to more heartfelt and warm moments awaiting Hachiken and his friends at Oezo Agricultural High School!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nReview by MAL criteria\\n\\n\r\nStory: The synopsis is available in the MAL page as well as in the second big paragraph of this review. What gives the story an overall 10 is the number of characters that have very relatable and realistic problems and backgrounds. In addition, as mentioned before, the anime has educational value, as it teaches the viewers about farm animals, equipment, techniques, and the logistics of agricultural and farming businesses. Rarely do we consider a slice-of-life anime with educational value anything from interesting, but Hiromu Arakawa manages to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The opening song \u201cKiss you\u201d by Miwa is a sweet and carefree song, but nothing too memorable. The ending song \u201cHello Especially\u201d is sung by Sukima Switch, who also sang \u201cGolden Time Lovers\u201d from the third opening of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I mention this because Sukima Switch chose to sing a country song for this anime (rather than rock), and no doubt, the song is catchy and fits perfectly to the anime. Besides that, the soundtracks introduced thus far are nothing too special, but they often give you a very warm countryside feeling when you hear them playing at certain parts. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: As the anime is in an agricultural setting, the scenery is pastoral and soothing. Not to mention the use of warm and bright colors to emphasize the warmth and homeliness of the environment. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is a Hiromu Arakawa work, you will see similarities between Gin no Saji characters and Fullmetal Alchemist characters. The depiction of the characters stays true to the manga, and you\u2019ll notice the similar reactions that Hiromu Arakawa likes to use. There is great detail and personification of animals so it is entertaining to see various expressions from these animals.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation of this anime seems to be the most lacking of all the categories because it can get choppy and awkward at times. The animation is especially important because it is tied into delivering punchlines or depicting hilarious scenes, so the humor is not always delivered appropriately or properly conveyed due to the occasionally choppy animations. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Season 1 of Gin no Saji is focused mostly on Hachiken's development from being a gloomy and uptight guy to a more confident and relaxed one. Viewers are introduced to other characters and their backgrounds, but the anime has yet to develop any of them. I rate this section highly, however, because of how well Hachiken's development is done. Viewers see Hachiken learning something different about himself, his friends, and his environment every episode, and in turn his friends learn something different about Hachiken each episode. I can\u2019t wait to see him develop more and more, until the moment he figures out what he wants to do in life. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: On behalf of those who love this anime already, let me say to those reading this review that you\u2019re missing out!! I can\u2019t guarantee everyone will enjoy it, but I hope you do! \\n\\n\r\n8.8/10 \\n",

            "content": "Life is what you make it, if anything, it\u2019s far from perfect.\r\nIn order to experience the true beauty of the world, we must accept the unimaginable situations we\u2019ve been placed in, no matter how uncomfortable they may be. \r\nDive into the world of agriculture \u2018Gin no Saji\u2019 otherwise known as \u2018Silver Spoon\u2019 in English. Our main character, Yugo Hachiken, who in desperation separates himself from his family and their ever growing expectations, enrolls into the boarding school Yezo High School. Carrying a quirky and half assed attitude, Hachiken quickly realizes that escaping the expectations of not only his family, but others as well  withouthaving any aspirations of your own isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. This realization is even further amplified when he is surrounded by peers who seemingly already have their life planned out. If you can relate to this even in the most miniscule way, you should do yourself a favor and give this 11 episode season the time of day. \\n\\n\r\nAs we journey deeper, it is Gin no Saji\u2019s extremely strong cast that truly allows this anime to shine. With an episodic-like structure and an array of unique supporting characters, the awkwardness that is the situations Hachiken is thrown into, know no bounds. Through the eyes of the beholder, we are initially shown the ugly side of the agricultural world, filled with the squirms of Hachiken as he collects fresh chicken periods, becomes overly attached to baby livestock and witnesses the butchery of countless animals. But ever so slowly, Hachiken begins to settle in his new found home, and the beautiful side of this world begins to shine through. As previously stated, the supporting cast Gin no Saji is exceptionally strong. The unique personalities of each character are truly showcased, whether it\u2019s Tokiwa\u2019s eternal struggle with studying, the tit loving Holstein Club, or the iron will of Komaba. Each have their own aspirations which become evident throughout their daily interactions which creates a heartwarming tone.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 pictures generally have a high standard when it comes to artwork, and Gin no Saji is no exception. The vast majority is animated cleanly without any majorly distracting blemishes, characters are easily distinguishable, the scenery is drawn beautifully and the food is at a tantalizing level of animation. Heck, even the eggs fresh out a chicken\u2019s bum looks delectable. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything worthy of complaint in Gin no Saji it would be its background music, which more often than not doesn\u2019t benefit the atmosphere the scene attempts to create. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not a poor soundtrack by any means\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t add much to the premises most of the time. It simply exists at an acceptable standard. Both the opening and ending themes give off a light hearted, rural feeling which compliments the themes of the anime quite well. When taking the above elements into consideration, the soundtrack as a whole is presented to an above par standard. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, chances are you\u2019ll most likely enjoy this series even if you have absolutely no interest in the world of agriculture. Put plainly, Gin no Saji is a warm hearted slice of life filled with plenty of comedic and relatable moments, with an exceptionally strong cast of characters and beautiful visuals. Gin no Saji portrays its story in a simple, yet enjoyable fashion. So what are you waiting for? Take the plunge into the world known as Gin no Saji, and who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll fall in love with the world of agriculture just like Hachiken did.\\n",

            "content": "Everyone has dreams. In fact, dreams can come in all shapes or sizes. It be as simple as getting an A+ on a math exam or to something as difficult as winning a gold medal in the Olympics. The problem with dreams is though is that not everyone seems to be able to follow all the way through. It\u2019s from dreams though that people learn about the world and about themselves. In Silver Spoon, we follow a main male protagonist named Yugo Hachiken as he embarks on a road for his future but one that he never expected to turn out to be.\r\nGin no Saji(also known by its English name Silver Spoon) is anime series based off of the manga of the same name written by Hiromu Arakawa. She is known already for her previous work, Full Metal Alchemist that has achieved universal praise for both its anime and manga creations. As a brand new series, we get to see an insight on her new work from a different perspective. This time, we get to witness the life of a farm boy in the field of agriculture as opposed to the military bases and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, this anime is influenced by the author\u2019s real life childhood because she used to grow up on a dairy farm in Hokkaido. Therefore, we also get to see the author\u2019s reflection of her past life in a sort of way. However, this time we step into the shoes of Hachiken as a student and see how his life is like. \\n\\n\r\nHachiken is one of those character that seems to be unmotivated from the beginning. This is evidenced even from the very beginning in which he tries to get take an easy route by enrolling in an agricultural school. This might sound easy but it\u2019s a lot harder once he opens his eyes to reality. The backstab comes to Hachiken\u2019s part as he quickly finds out that all the students there are motivated by their desire to actually make a professional career out of their time spend there. For Hachiken though, this is more like a time of struggle. \\n\\n\r\nThe various characters of this show makes it quite appealing since almost all of them seems to have a mind set on the future; that is almost everyone except for Hachiken. These goals ranges from inheriting a farm business, to become a veterinarian, or owning a chicken farm. At the same time, these characters all have their own style when they make their appearances. Take Shinnosuke for example. He seems to play a struggling role (although not on the same level from my perspective) in the series. Shinnosuke wants to become a vet but often fears at the sight of blood or animals. Then, there\u2019s also Aki, a girl that is sometimes stereotyped as the pretty girl next door. In fact, she even fits this role literally with her love of horses. (a possible reference to girls\u2019 love for ponies)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series follows a more slice-of-life format where it visualizes and presents how a person\u2019s life is like as a student in the agricultural field. Surprisingly enough, it does make its sense of realism strong through the portrayal of its actions. These include cutting chickens\u2019 heads off, milking cattle, cooking corns, and just an every day style of what is like to be a student at this agricultural school. For viewers however, it can be frustrating in the beginning to witness Hachiken\u2019s life style because he shows little interest in the activities. This is especially true when he realizes how hard life can be on the farm. At the same time though, Hachiken progresses with his effort and learns more about his new life through experience. These experiences puts him in the driver\u2019s seat for the first time on his road for a future. It is also in someway inspirational to see how he progresses throughout the show that might make people realize that dreams can come true.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other interesting factors of the series includes the character interactions. For Hachiken, it\u2019s important for him to make new friends in order to adjust. Thanks to his intellect though, he is able to earn the respect of his peers and possibly even the affection of his classmate, Aki. In fact, there are hints of romance in the series occasionally between Hachiken and Aki. This can be viewed as a more innocent factor of the show and often times or not, we get to witness the silly moments (sometimes misunderstandings as well) between the duo. The sparks are there though but usually Hachiken plays the role of the dummy. On the other hand, Aki\u2019s cheerfulness makes it all more the worthwhile to watch. What might be more scary to watch is maybe her overprotective father as he plays the role of a dad who seems to care about her daughter more than he probably should.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also brings a delightful doses of comedy to the show. In fact, it sometimes barely tries and succeeds in this field. This usually involves Hachiken and how he deals with the various farm animals with various results. In the beginning, most of this is almost absurd but later on spells out more hilarious moments as he gets first hands-on experience with the farm life. Trust me though, it\u2019s a lot harder than what you see with your naked eye. It doesn\u2019t end there as other characters such as Tamako even has her humorous moments and little gags that makes the show of a spoonful of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nVisual wise, Silver Spoon takes on a realistic approach but with rich artistic visuals. The backgrounds is portrayed almost lifelike with a sense of naturalism in terms of its farm animals, buildings, and simplicity. Speaking of simple, most of the characters are designed as such without any fancy outfits, makeups, or battle gear. There is some similarity with its character designs in comparison to Full Metal Alchemist although this should be taken as for granted.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is decent with a simple and straight forward way of presenting its rhythms. The OP song \"kiss you\" by miwa has a silly way of presenting its song with humorous sequences and character montages. On the other hand, the ED song \u201cHello Especially\u201d by Sukima Switch has this sense of calmness as we witness characters walking down a road that can be interpreted as walking down a road towards the future. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show might not be for everyone but it certainly should be worth giving a shot. You don\u2019t have to enjoy agriculture to watch this. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Hachiken. He started out as the new kid at school but now has earned the respect of not just his classmates but me as well. The realism this series focuses more than just the farm animals but also on Hachiken\u2019s progressive development as his new life begins. It might not be the dream he originally wanted to follow but it sure is something enjoyable to watch. Living a life on the farm might be tough but for me, enjoying this show was simple. \\n",

            "content": "Everyone views the world in a different colored light. Our shade is affected by our upbringing, our culture, our religion, our language, and a variety of other factors. However, when our color mixes in with another color, then the light in which we view the world in changes dramatically, as yellow mixing with blue makes green. It allows us to see things that we have missed before, and makes us question the things that we've always believed. Silver Spoon pushes Hachiken Yugo into a completely new world, and changes the hue of his view as well as ours in this story.\r\nWritten by Hiromu Arakawa ofFullmetal Alchemist fame, she writes a story on something that would have been completely overlooked and unappreciated if not for her name, a story about farming, which would have been a complete shame. Based off of her past in growing up on a farm, it is a completely different story from her most famous work, with a completely different tone, but is yet another amazing work. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows city boy Hachiken Yugo as he enrolls in agricultural school for personal reasons, and his cultural shock and adjustment entering into this completely new world. The story is set in a slice-of-life format, with an almost \"plotless\" feel to it, just following Hachiken and his friends' life in agriculture, showing things from rounding up chickens to chasing tractors to cooking pizza. Despite seeming like this would be a negative, it actually ends up being a very effective way to present the story, as it gives you a feel for their everyday lives and everything they go through and enjoy. The show also muses on some subtle philosophical aspects that make you sit back and think, and makes it more than just your everyday slice-of-life show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely one of the strongest points of this show, and it really helps this show to be an enjoyable and personal one. Hachiken is sort of like an avatar for the viewer, a foreigner looking into this new world. He gets sick when they cut off chicken's heads, he gets overly attached to farm animals destined to be food, and is bewildered by this completely different way of life. We also slowly start to see throughout the show the growth of his character as he adapts to this new world and starts seeing things in a different light. All the other characters are interesting as well, from the hilarious Tamako to the strong and caring Komaba, it's always fun to watch their lives and personalities come alive and how they interact with one another. They also have their own dreams they're chasing and goals they want to reach, and it just makes them more personal than characters who are just there as devices rather than people. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is pretty good, animated well. From what I could tell it was pretty fluid most all the time. The character designs are also pretty clean and weren't a distraction. One thing I thought the art did really good on though was making the food look delicious, causing your mouth water. Whether it was egg and rice or pizza, somehow it just makes your stomach grumble even though you ate like an hour ago. The music was also pretty good, supplementing the scenes well. The ED fit well with the show too, having the country feel to it. The OP was alright, but in my opinion, it had kind of a subdued feeling to it that I didn't really like, but that's just my feeling, it's still a pretty good OP. The sound and music really help supplement the show's feeling and dynamic across and fit well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was a lot of fun to watch. From the eye-opening views on the farm world to thought-provoking conversations to hilarious moments, this show on farming had my attention in a way I never thought it would. The premise seems strange, but it was a surprisingly enjoyable watch. Despite seeming slow paced like a normal slice-of-life show would, it still felt like the episodes went by in 5 minutes, a testament to how much it absorbs you into its world. While when this first was announced I was only slightly interested, I'm definitely looking forward to when part two comes out in the winter. Give this show a chance; it may not seem like your kind of show, but is definitely a lot greater than it seems.",

            "content": "\"Tokiwa, how can something so tasty come out of an anus? Chickens are amazing\"\r\nAs an anime I picked up out of a whim I did not expect much, but nonetheless Gin no Saji delivered tenfold. Not only was it a light hearted watch with tasteful comedy given the context, but Gin no Saji really isn't afraid to explore complex issues which inevitably challenge our perspectives on our morality and allow us to really see what we take for granted. Let's go into specifics.\r\nStory (9)\r\nHiromu Arakawa has created the plot through envisioning the life of the protagonist Hachiken, who takes the initiative to enrol in anAgricultural school in order to be separated from his family. Although at first glance this anime does not seem to have a strong standing plot, though it is through its execution of the story that makes the story exceptional. From the transition from city to country life, it's obvious that that MC is way out of his comfort zone, but it is from there that he really develops as a person. The pacing of the show really helps with this as it really allows us to see his experiences with his friends and classmates while being able to acknowledge this personal development. The plot left nothing too overly predictable, and as a comedy it really excelled. I think it really was the carefree nature of Gin no Saji while continuously exploring Hachiken's development which made the anime so entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound (8)\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures has animated Gin no Saji on a solid level. There's not really too much to say other than the character designs were very well drawn, the backgrounds were clean and the animation as a whole was fluid. The opening theme and ending theme were really catchy as well, and really did reflect the down to earth nature of the anime. The OST was also suffice in reflecting the current situation faced by Hachiken, and I felt that I was better able to empathise with the characters as a result.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10)\\n\r\nDefinitely the strong point of the anime. Despite focusing on reflecting Hachiken's development as a person, the producers did not fail to exemplify the efforts of his friends to get him to this point. Through their experiences with the MC, each character is given a great amount of development as well learn about their back stories, motivations and overall, their personalities and how they came to be. Additionally, all the characters are likeable in one way or another, and others really bring out the comedy in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9)\\n\r\nGin no Saji was definitely an anime that I really enjoyed, not just because of its down to earth feel and hilarity, but because it wasn't afraid of exploring issues that other animes probably wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole (and in the end they executed it quite brilliantly). By having such diverse characters which drive the story as well as its solid animation and OST, I cannot express how enjoyable I found Gin no Saji to be.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIn the end I believe that a lot of us can really relate to Gin no Saji and the themes it presses forward, despite what initially seems to be your average school anime. I definitely recommend the anime to anybody who wants to take a break from your typical battle anime and wants to watch a light hearted, comedic anime of a teenager's development as a person when being placed in an unfamiliar situation. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Watching the first couple of episodes of Gin no Saji I was very sceptic. I had heard that it was a very good series but I just could not see it. Having powered through the first two episodes I was relieved to discover that it was indeed a very good series. It was very fun and it deviated from the norms of slice of life anime. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is pretty much what you would expect from such a series but due to the set up in an agricultural high school there were several minute changes that boosted the series as a whole. Unlike otherseries it kept being fun and the stories of each episode managed to make the viewing process very fun. The main story was pretty basic but that does not mean that it was boring in any way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nArtistic wise is what you would expect from a series launched after 2010. The art was very pretty and the scenery complemented the story and characters. It just gave off the feeling that you were actually in a rural part of japan something that it is not seen frequently in anime series (for me it was the first time). Overall I would say that the art was great despite not being flashy. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nSound was a bit bland. I can not say that any of the ost stuck in my head. Everything was ok but nothing was impressive. I imagine this is the case because the whole series had no epic moments that needed to be boosted by awesome tracks but still I think that it could have been improved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nAll characters were designed exceptionally good. The main character was bit hard to like, at first, but as the series progressed and you get to now more about him you understand why he is the way he is. The supporting characters were all well thought and diverse. As a whole the characters managed to help unfold a pretty funny and enjoyable series filled with hilarious 'accidents' but also with deep emotional moments that help the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I have stated above the series was very enjoyable since it deviated from the norms. It is highly recommended to all who wish to watch something uplifting and humorous with that being based on fanservice and slapstick humor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give this series an 8 due to the just fair music and the fact that the season ended very abruptly. Of course there is a season 2 and that may be a little harsh but the fact is that episode 11 (end of season 1) seemed to end in a hurry. Had I been forced to wait for the season 2 to start I would probably not have watched it.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhile sitting here writing this review, I looked around me to see what food I had lying about. I see some left-over chips, crackers, and a bit of candy. When you think about it, the way certain foods are made is pretty amazing. We can go to the grocery store, pick out pre-sliced meat, and bring it home for dinner to make into hamburgers, steak, or what have you. But how does that meat get from the farm to the freezer? Gin no Saji looks to explore the facets of farming, agriculture, and morality when dealing with thevery animals we eat, and it does it in a splendid way.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji starts off in a similar fashion to other shows; new student Hachiken has come to Ezonoo in order to start learning about what it means to run a farm.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't get much more simple than that for a description. As such, the show itself is pretty much slice-of-life. Without an over-arcing story, what GnS aims to do is demonstrate the different parts to the farming lifestyle. One of the things that becomes immediately apparent is its factual nature. On top of being pretty unique in its subject matter, the show goes out of its way to explain many different parts to farming. There are explanations of how chickens are handled, the most efficient ways to milk a cow, and insight into gutting a deer. There is way more than I listed, and that's awesome. The show is not shy about immersing you in this topic that people like me and Hachiken, who come from the city/suburbs, have no knowledge about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show even tackles the idea of morality when it comes to killing and eating animals. What does it mean to love an animal? Is there something wrong with killing and eating living things? The show, like its take on agriculture, explores these questions and more within its contents. I found this type of approach pretty compelling because it got me thinking about the animals that I eat every day. Before, I would have no qualms eating some chicken tenders or scarfing down a nice filet, but after watching Gin no Saji, I will, at the minimum, think twice about what it took for the food in front of me to get there.\\n\\n\r\nAs if the world-building and philosophical ideas weren't enough, the show also sets its sights on what it means to have a dream. Many people that are asked, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" know the answer right away: a doctor, astronaut, computer consultant. For others, they don't have a choice: maybe they have to take over the family business or are pressured into doing something they don't necessarily have the heart to do. Yet others still have no answer because they have no idea what they want. The show does a nice job of presenting these three different sides to the previous question. Is there a right or wrong answer? What the show will teach you is no, that the path you follow is the one you should take. In the end, it is up to you to decide what type of person you will become.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji's art style is rather pleasant. Taking place mostly on farms, the differing locales usually came with differing lifestyles. From pig pens to vegetable fields, the show demonstrates a wide variety of environments that make you feel as if the characters are on the farms they are supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is produced by A-1 Pictures, so it should come as no surprise that the animation is well done. While the character designs are good, the animal details are of particular note. A-1 Pictures seemed to take extra time in making sure the animals looked realistic. The horses had refined muscles, the cows chewed, and the pigs had beady yet sparkling eyes. The focus of the show is on farming and animals and therefore the quality in them is noticeable and greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking again on character designs, I didn't find them to be terribly unique but that really isn't a bad thing. If anything, they all look rather mature for their age. At times, I forgot the show was taking place in high school; the subject material and characters reminded me more of college.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, I like Hachiken's design if only for the glasses. Being a glasses wearer myself, I always appreciate when the MC dons spectacles.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI guess since GnS is technically listed as a shounen, it has quite a large cast. That being said, there are only two main characters and subsequently they are the most important.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the lesser, Mikage is a young woman who loves horses and is one of Hachiken's first friends at his new school. She is very kind, caring, and more courageous than is initially let on. She actually acts as a foil to Hachiken. She knows what she wants to do deep down in her heart but her hand is forced. In contrast, Hachiken has no idea what he really wants to do but the world is his oyster (gotta' make an animal pun somewhere in here!). Alongside being a literary device, there are definitely feelings that develop within her for Hachiken. While not a romance story in the slightest, the romantic in me loved seeing her reactions to particular situations involving Hachiken.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important character of the series is obviously Hachiken. He's smart, shy, and determined to prove himself. For him, results mean everything; you're either a winner or a loser. But his time at Ezonoo, hanging out with friends, helping out Pork Bowl, and making mistakes, helps to flesh him out as a well-rounded character. He starts off stalwart in his thinking but over time he comes to learn that winning isn't everything, and that its okay to not always know everything.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Hachiken and Mikage come the rest of the cast. While nobody distinctly stands out character-wise, they each have their little moments that are used for comedic effect. Special shout out to Nakajima, the equestrian club advisor, for his hilarious Buddha-esque glow behind his head.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is okay to my ears. Besides hearing \"kiss you\" while listening, it is pretty relaxing and matches the overall tone of the show nicely. On the other hand, the ED is pretty good. It really gives off the vibe that they are in the country or on the farm. Likewise, the guitar and the singing complement nicely with one another.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the soundtrack, one of the standout pieces is the \"stair-step\" beat that sounds orchestral. It is hard to describe, but it was used when the characters were looking to get started on a difficult task.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the voice acting is fine. In terms of performances, Ryouhei Kimura does a nice job in the role of Hachiken. Perhaps in the same vein, I found the animal noises to be acceptable as well. Nothing sounded too out of the ordinary, making the animals seem more believable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji is hard to pin down in terms of genre. It is definitely funny, for starters. The comedy isn't based off the jokes or the dialogue, but rather what is happening on screen. Whether this is a girl asking for bacon or Beppu throwing dough at a security camera, the comedy comes from the world itself.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my favorite episodes are definitely the more laid back, slice of life ones. Specifically the pizza and crop circle episodes. I found the former to be a nice tie in with the themes of farming, hard work, and togetherness, while the latter was a fun take on a tired idea.\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned this, but being a huge romance buff, seeing Hachiken and Mikage together on screen, either talking with one another or smiling towards each other, always got a smile on my face and my mind wanting them to already end up together.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond all this, I will say I could easily sympathize with Hachiken. Sometimes you put in a lot of work into something, with the return being negligible. And that can seriously get you down. However, the show goes out of its way to articulate that even when you go through some pretty rough times, there is always going to be some good along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, interesting concept with nice world-building and good themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, animals are detailed and the environments are fresh\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Hachiken and Mikage complement each other nicely\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, fitting OP and ED, with okay soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, funny, hints of romance, and education\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Gin no Saji is a pearl hidden deep underneath the all of the 2014 winter animes. I originally read the description of this anime when it first came out, and found it like any other slice of life anime, that will be good but not enough to keep me wanting to watch more. Boy, was I wrong, and thus came to write this review, which is my very first so please be easy on me. Arakawa Hiromu has out done herself again with this award-winning anime. Gin no Saji is definitely an anime you would want to watch when you want to watch a comedic,light-hearted but deep anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe plot to this anime is rather simple; boy with family problems, doesn't know what he wants to do in life, and goes to an agricultural high school to learn more about himself. The plot is simple to follow but truly teaches you about life and food. To city folk, livestock is simply to eat and not to think about any further; where as to country or farm folk, there is so much more to think about when it comes to bringing these animals to the slaughterhouse and making them into daily food. The anime is simple yet deep.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nBoth the art and sound are simple but nice thus fits extremely well into the simple farm life plot. The art style is distinctly Arakawa Hiromu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very likable with the exception of maybe only one. Each character have their own type of personality but comes together as one big family, making the anime family friendly and guaranteed for laughter. As viewers, we see our main protagonist, Yugo Hachiken, develop from the new antisocial character to one that becomes much more outspoken and social. We see him interact with all kinds of characters and help them overcome their problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji is such a great anime that I sincerely doubt that I will be able to find another slice of life anime on par with this one. I loved watching all the characters including Pork Bowl and Vice Pres, interact, laugh, and argue with each other. I loved learning about the deeper thought process that comes with livestock being born and only a few months later to die for human's sake. Lastly I loved every moment this anime had to offer. Definitely a 10/10 if you need a simple, hilarious, and deep slice of life anime to watch.",

            "content": "Ola everybody, as I've finished this watching this anime, I'd probably say that this is one of the truly most unique anime for this year, since it doesn't focus on the usual genre that every anime has followed, so, without further adieu, I present my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nStory, character, enjoyment- very good 8.\r\nStory:\r\nOk, the story about a city slicker incoming high schooler is very unique in the sense that it presents a strong slice of life that happens in real life, about a boy who escapes from the problems he has with his family only to find himself from the fryingpan to the fire kind of thing. However, there is another part of this anime's slice of life where it shows us that sometimes destiny has a weird way of showing us where we belong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nSo here it's all about the city slicker guy who has no idea what he got himself into and yes I'm referring to Yugo Hachiken, ok, so at one point I would like to give him a Karate chop on his head for being to cheesy about being in an agricultural high school and getting too emotional about Pork Bowl and other livestock's around  the said school, but then again one would appreciate as to how much of an asset he is to his fellow classmates, when everyone looks up to him and sees how much his willing to help out and get alone with everyone else......though, there are situations that he'll grumble and screw-up.\\n\\n\r\nAki Mikage, is basically someone who completes the main character, Hachiken as this sweet girls who has served as the latter's foundation as to keep him in high spirits and, also, I kinda like the Yugo X Aki arc, since those two go nice together.\\n\\n\r\n Tamako Inada, I would never understand why she has to be this oversize high schooler who sounded and looks like and sounds like a milf. \\n\\n\r\nMayumi Yoshino, if this anime have a harem genre, she would fit in as Aki's competition for Yugo's affection.\\n\\n\r\nIchiro Komaba, if he's Yugo's competition for Aki's affection, I would prefer that he loses to Yugo.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest, like Keiji Tokiwa, Shinnosuke Aikawa,Tarou Beppu and Hajime Nishikawa, well, they kinda function well well as the comic relief for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable enough and at the same time this anime does provide some insights about farm life, ever thought the farm theme that this anime presents more like resembles a western farm than a Japanese farm. But the enjoyment was really seeing how Hachiken adjust from being a city slicker to a farm boy throughout his stay at Ezo Agricultural High School as an audience there is that urge for me to do something to make him realize about the situation he entered, but as this anime goes on that urge I have was replace by appreciation as to how he gets along with the said situation he entered.\\n\\n\r\nArt- mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nSince I have no comment about this anime's illustration, but, it would have been nice if Tamako is this slim high school girl. I've also notice another thing about they way the farms were drawn.........the damn illustrator forgot to include rice fields in the damned school or anywhere in Ezo.\\n\\n\r\nSound- poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't like both the opening and closing theme, and I really hate that Tamako should sound like a milf than a sweet teen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt did presented a very good slice of life genre, the character's are well presented and it was really enjoyable, however the farm theme that this anime shows is more of a western farm than a typical Japanese farm, and I did said that the damned illustrator forgot to include rice fields. Well, overall, this anime should have an , but I couldn't ignore the fact that author Taku Kishimoto didn't combine a kind of agricultural school or a typical place where it should both be a typical western farm combined with Japanese farm. Frankly it was too unfair that such series whether an anime or a manga to not include rice paddies or at least not add a kind of modern Japanese farm into this series. So overall, a 7 would suffice for this anime as a whole, I do hope that in the 2nd season we should be seeing some rice paddies somewhere in  Ezo Agricultural High School and I hope there is a character interested in rice research and production.\\n",

Honestly it's more than that.\r\nSilver Spoon is on par with Mushishi and Natsume on its\u2019 feel good. Gin no Saji is the equivalence of a breeze in the summer. You watch it, enjoy it and you forget about it. It is a modest attempt on equating the reason for killing animals in exchange for tasting that delicious. Hachiken is a sympathetic character whose childhood of holding back his compassion made him unable to deny anyones\u2019 call for help. He loves the animal, especially Pork Bowlbut instead of simply delaying/extending his life, Hachiken embraces it. Because life ends, but life goes on. What was the point of rearing the animals, should they only be meant to be used, discarded and eaten. The horses devote their entire effort, but only result is of key. Even after that, once they fail, they are churned into meat. The pigs, cows, chicken, each just playing their role until a moments\u2019 mistake/injury deem their life unworthy, only to be sent to the butcher by the end of the day. This show is the extent of that reasoning. We just gotta enjoy it while it lasts. That is the fate of all the farm animals, and so is it for us. Embrace and enjoy your life, cos\u2019 it ain\u2019t very long to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nBrilliant anime all the way to the end\u2026\\n\r\nHits you perfectly with the points, and knows exactly what it\u2019s all about, really no flaws visually, manages to keep the narrative informative, close to the plot points and the reason for the anime, with no unnecessary additional contexts.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mainstream anime is so predictable, the mere thought of watching one revolts me. Plots are used over and over again, characters are portrayed by the same well-known voices who's lack of emotion is really starting to piss me off, and worst of all, the use of below-average OPs and EDs make majority of mainstream anime a very bad batch of brew... much rather like Budweiser. \r\nGin no Saji however, isn't a bottle of Budweiser... it's a bottle of 30 year old scotch. So now, please allow me to explain the differences to you non-drinkers. \r\nBudweiser.. bitter to drink, flavourless after a few sips, and wouldtake just below 10 gallons to get you tipsy. All in all, a useless piece of garbage designed for those with a unusable tongue, and a lack of tolerance to alcohol. Mainstream anime (such as the dreadful 'Campione!' or 'Shining Hearts') are the same; lacking heavily in substance, and relying on the fact that most otaku would want to watch some semi-naked girls chasing a guy round some poorly sketched field. Sometimes I feel sorry for the actors who have to read the boring script, I mean, even a Shakespearean play is more interesting! But I don't blame the producers. The anime industry is full of competition, and sticking with a fool-proof plot is guaranteed to get at least some figures for them to publish.. what I do blame, however, are the idiots who watch mainstream anime in the first place. Without these pea-brained pussies, we would've ridded the world of hindrance so vile, even a thousand year old cheese would lose the competition. But since we're stuck with them, we've gotta feed them right? So, just like Budweiser, mainstream anime is fed to people without 1) any taste whatsoever. 2) any dignity as a human being.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about the scotch then, who are we going to compare this to? The answer is simple; you and I. Gin no Saji is NOT a mainstream anime. Its' plot is NOT predictable. It's NOT introduced by some silly 'la la la' j-pop crap, neither is it ended with 'lo lo lo' rubbish. It is everything that is NOT Budweiser. The plot may seem simple at first, and you might think you know where it's going to lead to.. like the first sip of a beautiful scotch. But as soon as you swallow the scotch, you feel it. The vibrance, the tanginess, the smokiness, and the mellow finish that brings a hint of woodiness to the taste buds. Ah, blissful. But afterwards, you feel the bitterness of the alcohol protruding your senses. You feel the alcohol burning into the back of your throat. And you're certainly going to feel the fire in your chest, accompanied by the blitz to your head. \\n\\n\r\nYes, Gin no Saji is the same as a good scotch. It certainly led me to a happy place (not that one you disgusting person). It made me think about the meaning of life.. and that's what all anime should do imo, make you think. Engaging the content is far more important than watching it, much rather like sex. The plot was structured simply, mainstream if I dare say, yet with the little details dotted all over the place, it made the anime unique. Like a mountain road, it twists with the bends, and it rise with the bumps. The overall atmosphere was a mellow-upper, comparable to a beautiful piece of tarmac road.. but the grim reminder of death loomed over each corner. The most amazing thing about this anime is, in my opinion, is its ability to bring you back to a mellow-upper state immediately after the downer! Just the roller coaster of emotions is enough for you to WANT to watch the piece. \\n\\n\r\nAh, I can write no more.. Pork Bowl, you were so cute. Perhaps it's wrong of me to say this... but I love you :')\\n\\n\r\nAnd so concludes another piece of my (not) interesting, yet (un)informative review. If you've read to the end, well done. If you haven't, then you won't see this; but you, my friend, is a massive dick head who's sole existence is a crime against humanity lol. Peace out.",

There he meets wise farming teachers and friendly farming students who show him the ropes of farming. He discovers the nuance and talent which lie underneath the surface of farming and becomes determined to be the very best at farming, or at least impress [generic love interest farmgirl]. Prepare for gags and giggles in this hilarious farming anime from A-1 Pictures!\r\nOkay, now that the moderators aren\u2019t looking, I\u2019m going to make my actual review. You guys won\u2019tbelieve this, but I\u2019ve delved beneath the surface of Gin no Saji and discovered that this anime is actually farming shounen disguised as a slice of life comedy. Think about it: clueless boy finds farm school, stumbles upon a farming world he never knew about, haplessly tries to blend in by farming, slowly learns what it takes to be a farmer, develops a bond with farming students, finds an affinity for farming in himself, earns the respect of his farming teachers, impresses his farmer crush, and eventually becomes the very best that no one ever was. Do you see what I\u2019m saying here? Everything falls into place if you just look at it from a different perspective. Once you realize the truth, Gin no Saji is just Harry Potter with horseback riding instead of flying brooms! With that in mind, I have to give this one the credit it deserves for taking two overused anime premises and smushing them together into something fresh. Farm fresh, you could say.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 for a farm-tacular farm-venture that I\u2019ll never farmget. 7/10 for teaching me about all the hard work and passion farmers put in to raise a cow of high enough quality to be served in a McRib.",

            "content": "*This review will cover both seasons of Gin no Saji / Silver Spoon*\r\n     First of all, I\u2019ve got to admit, the premise of the show didn\u2019t impress me at first. The Harvest Moon franchise is as far as my knowledge about farming and agriculture goes. But then, I found out that Hiromu Arakawa, the author of the brilliant FMA is the one behind the manga.  Going by the \u20183 episode rule\u2019, I decided to put this anime to the test.  And I must say I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out to be and ended up binge-watchingit later on. \\n\\n\r\n     The story follows a boy named Hachiken, who for some strange reasons, decided to leave the city and applied for a transfer to a school in the countryside.  There, he learns how to adjust to his new environment-an agricultural school called Ezono and it didn\u2019t take that long for him to realize that life there was not as easy as he thought it would be. The first season focuses more on the education part and I\u2019m impressed by how well represented and interesting it was.  Unlike most \u2018educational anime\u2019 where sometimes it feels like you were forced to learn about something and all the references went straight over your head, everything felt natural here. You don\u2019t need any lengthy and complex explanation to figure out what the show\u2019s trying to convey, instead, they simply show through their actions. Be warned, though, it\u2019s not all fun happy ride all the way. The show can also be serious when it wants to. Being the city boy he was, Hachiken certainly didn\u2019t expect that the industry can be harsh and challenging at times, and we as the viewer can\u2019t help but sympathize with him. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s rewarding to see how he handle and cope with that problems, maturing little by little as time progresses.  In the second season, we saw a much more mature Hachiken dealing with his family problems and we finally get a clearer picture of the reasons behind his action. Expect more drama and conflict in the second season, but worry not, it\u2019s not to the point where it ruined the heartwarming atmosphere of the show. The comedy was alright I guess, compared to Arakawa-sensei\u2019s other work, FMA. One of FMA weakness to me, was the comedy aspect as it felt awkward and out-of-place most of the times, but it was handled and felt more appropriate here due to the lightheartedness nature of the show. \\n\\n\r\n       In terms of animation, the first thing you will notice is the similarity of the character design with the manga and I applaud A-1 Pictures for that. If I have one thing to complain about, it is on how simple and bland the characters look. While it was not awful by a long mile, but if we\u2019re comparing them to let\u2019s say FMA, most of them looked dull and generic in comparison. But who knows, maybe they were supposed to have that simplistic designs, with the story being set in the countryside and all. A-1 Pictures instead, emphasized more on making sure that all animals looked realistic and well-proportioned which is a fair trade-off if you ask me. Thinking back, there was nothing spectacular about the animation overall, but they still managed to capture the essence of the show and that alone is good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\n     Unlike most anime where the OP completely outshines the ED, it\u2019s the other way around here. While the 1st OP sounds catchy and can brighten up the mood, the ED reflect the show\u2019s atmosphere better with its relaxing, country-style tunes. The same goes with the 2nd season where I think switching the OP and ED around would be a better idea. The ED was performed by Goosehouse, the same band behind the catchy \u2018Your Lie in April\u2019 OP and in my opinion it is as equally good if not better. The 2nd season\u2019s OP was alright but not as memorable as I constantly find myself skipping over it every episode. \\n\\n\r\n     Character development has always been one of Arakawa-sensei\u2019s strongest point and it shows here, albeit with a few hiccups. Just like what I mentioned earlier, most of the conflicts happened in the 2nd season and we can see how well Arakawa \u2013sensei handled the character development here without being overly melodramatic. I also liked how they portrayed the students here, where even the dumb ones are not actually idiots, unlike countless other anime out there that just can't get enough of recycling these annoying tropes/clich\u00e9 over and over again.\\n\\n\r\n       Without spoiling anything, the 2nd season focuses more on two important supporting characters that were having a serious crisis and Hachiken, being his usual optimistic self, try to intervene and solve their problems not knowing that his attempts are futile and won\u2019t really change the outcome. By the end of the show, he finally realized that not all problems can be solved with determination alone and as a viewer, it\u2019s nice to see how far he has matured compared to his older self. However, there were some setbacks as well. Many questions were left unanswered and left open, something that you expect would be answered in the 2nd season but sadly, it\u2019s not. Why does Hachiken\u2019s dad act like that? Why did Hachiken\u2019s brother quit that prestigious university? What is Hachiken\u2019s real goal? Now that both main characters have finally realized their true feelings towards each other, how far will the romantic development go? And the list goes on and on\u2026\\n\\n\r\n      Like most manga adaptations, the only downside is that it suffers from incomplete, open ending issues and considering that the manga is currently on a  hiatus, I doubt a 3rd season will follow anytime soon. But don\u2019t let that discourage you from watching it. This show is without a doubt, one of the best \u2018coming-of-age\u2019 anime I\u2019ve seen, bested only by \u2018Honey & Clover\u2019 and \u2018Hanasaku Iroha\u2019 - other fine examples of its genre. All in all, any complaints I may have had with this show are compensated by its believable dramatic situations, its realistic demonstrations of the farmer\u2019s life and for its beautiful, serene atmosphere. A must watch. \\n\\n",

This latest noitaminA feature contains yet another interesting and unique perspective that actually provides meaningful lessons beyond how to immediately get dumped by girls. As with Usagi Drop, the show manages to take a potentially dull and boring topic and turn it into something intriguing and entertaining. While this isn't as emotionally touching as Usagi Drop, it is still a fun watch for anyone even a bit curious about farming or how a city boy will deal with the culture shock of agricultural life.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation studio took amore conventional approach than that in Usagi Drop. For the most part, it looks like any other rural-based anime. The only major differences are the agriculture-specific tools and facilities and a bunch of farm animals. The show uses a fairly saturated palette that gives the series a bit of a lighter mood. Color shading and background details are average overall and character styling is also a bit on the simplistic side. You also have an instructor who humorously resembles Buddha.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much here in terms of either action or fan service. There is a tiny amount of blood once and a while but nothing really significant by action standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show has a fitting guitar-based OP and ED. I'm not a fan of slow, country-ish songs of this sort though so I skipped out on them for the most part. The BGM is minimal and for the most part not really worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThis is in part a documentary and in part a comedy so it is dialogue driven in many parts, but it wasn't very demanding character emotion-wise and no one ended up really standing out for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nHachiken has lived his life in his brother's shadows, so much so that his entire dreamless life consists of studying. Having no real drive or future plans, his teacher sends him to a live-in agrarian high school. To his amazement, Hachiken finds himself surrounded by people with strong goals and dreams. Will Hachiken be able to cope with his new, culturally-different classmates and five AM practicums?\\n\\n\r\nThis is an eye-opener of a series in many regards. In telling Hachiken's tale of learning about agriculture, the show is able to expose and confront a lot of misnomers about agriculture and even address some philosophical questions regarding livestock's transformation from respected living creature to meat. Between these conception-shattering moments, you get a bit of character development and a good deal of comic moments; a lot of these revolve around Hachiken's ignorance of the field that he's studying.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the most intense of series plot wise. Don't expect much in the way of cliffhangers or rising action, in fact the series doesn't even really end on much of a conclusion. I guess this fact is slightly mitigated by the fact that a second season has already been announced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in this show, and while a lot of them contribute to the central plot in one way or another no one is really well developed. The focus of the show is clearly more on showing farming procedures and practices than on giving the, admittedly, bland history of farm hands. While the protagonist clearly becomes much more adept at manual labor, he still maintains a significantly different world view than that of his classmates at the end of the show. The show does occasionally tease at possible character relationships but this is used as more of a comedy gimmick than for plot progression. Overall, the show features a balanced cast that really is presented to highlight the core farming theme rather than the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nMy strongest takeaway from this show (at least to confirm) is that farm-fresh foods appear to be highly superior to what I, as a cheapskate consumer, can get from the local grocery store. Expect to see the protagonist literally prostrate as a reaction to tasting food. Overall, despite being an average show plot wise, the show managed to stick to its unique theme; this alone earns it a lot of kudos. Unfortunately, I don't see it becoming a hit like Usagi Drop, it just lacks the emotional and character depth. Regardless, it still stands on its own as a reasonably entertaining look at how life is as a farmer. While I have new found respect for those in agribusiness, I'll stick to my white-collar line of work thank you very much. If you're willing to ditch established anime norms (required beach scene, unreasonably cute girls everywhere, etc.) and watch something that can teach you a thing or two, give Silver Spoon a go.",

            "content": "Ah, one of the most hyped anime of the season. Why? Not only is it adapted from a commercially successful, award winning & critically acclaimed manga but also it is written by the famous mangaka Hiromu Arakawa who is responsible for the world famous FMA. So how was the anime? Does it live up to the hype? And how can a manga based on life on agricultural school be this famous? And most of all how come a mangaka who wrote such an action based title as FMA write this? Let me just say that whatever else this anime does it proves (or tries toactually) that you can be a person who doesn't have a clear goal in life or any vague idea what you are gonna do with your life even if are surrounded by ambitious people and it is not always bad; and most of all it proves that book-worm nerds can be cool even when they are acting all moronic & stuff.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story of this anime centers around Yugo Hachiken whose dream in life is quite simple (although it seemed a bit weird at the first few episodes). It is to be separated from his family, so he enrolls in an agricultural boarding school which would take him quite far from his house till he gets his own job. As he deems himself to be an excellent crammer, he believes he will have no problem in there. But it turns out the life there is not what he expected as he gets in the world where physical labor is more important than his brains & the cruelty of the harsh reality of the life of the livestock. He eventually finds friends among his classmates who are all farmers' heirs & not a total city boy like him. And thus the story of his new life goes on with everyday learning of the lifestyle of farmers as well as their farm animals, which quite often arises very funny situation, and thankfully the comedy almost never felt forced.\\n\r\nAlthough it may seem very unusual for the premise of an anime, even for a slice-of-life but all the plot elements are gelled together quite nicely by the writer & the episodic nature of the story (at the first half mainly) really goes well with the premise of the show. Although at first the reason of Hachiken wanting to leave his home that desperately was a bit hard to understand, in later episodes it is explained quite clearly. As the various animals in the school grows through the passing of the time in his school so does his understanding (as well as ours) of farm-life grows, and he has to face some facts of reality which is harsh but true. The show mainly focuses on how he overcomes them and even helps his friends in their needs.\\n\r\nThe story certainly gets props for originality and although at times a bit boring with the knowledge bits but definitely was enjoyable for me, so it gets 8.5 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nAlthough many might disagree with me on this but there is actually only one main character in this anime, rest are just side characters. Hachiken is a character who is like the anime, a bit slow to develop, it takes a viewers a bit of time ( a few episodes at least) to relate with him & to understand his motivations, to appreciate his viewpoints. At first you might find him a bit one-dimensional as someone who takes the easy way out,who runs away from his family but if you carry on with him on his journey you will find out his reasons, will find out how he actually is quite caring for his friends through his actions & tries to help in them in their problems while sometimes even completely ignoring his own ones. And in the end he is a likeable character as well as quite unique too.\\n\r\nAs for the other characters they are very likeable too. Mikage who is the love interest for our protagonist seems a bit bland at first but Hiromu later develops her quite brilliantly in her unique way. The other important characters include hardworking & ambitious Komaba (somewhat generic for the source of Hachiken's jealousy but has a well written back-story); whimsical & laughably dumb at math Tokiwa; money lover & aggressive eater frightening Tamako; afraid of blood yet vet wanna be Shinnosuke ( whose struggles to face his fears is portrayed quite nicely); Hachiken's irritable yet funny brother (who is following his dream by the way) Shingo among others.\\n\r\nThe characters are actually the strongest aspect of this anime & pulls through all the rest of the stuff to a very enjoyable height indeed.\\n\r\nSo I give it 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nTo be honest the character designs & the art is not at the same level of the rest of the stuff for this anime. The faces of the characters quite often seem too similar & there is a lack of general detail in them. All the food-stuff at least looked good. The animation also seems bland in this day of top-notch technology and somewhat awkward in occasions. But at least on the positive side there is a sense of consistency in animation of the show as a whole, unlike few other animes these days & the piglets were cute.\\n\r\nHowever, it is not as per with other things of the anime & gets 7 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nSound  \\n\r\nThe opening theme is \"Kiss You\" by Miwa which is a nice song and appropriate for the show but actually not that special. The ending theme is \"Hello Especially\" by Sukima Switch which is the perfect ending song for the show for me, it has kind of a country vibe going for it which is suitable for the atmosphere of the show. Other pieces used during the show are all alright but nothing really stands out as anything special.\\n\r\nAs a whole sound gets from me 8 out 10. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of argument going on the internet whether this is the best show of this season or not, and with a second season now confirmed it is even more fueled. All I can say on these regard is while this anime may not be for everyone (Slice-of-life rarely is), still it is definitely one of the shows to watch for this season; this is kind of a casual & thinking mans show. The funny bits & the thought-provoking realistic situations the characters are put into often are really the highlights and was enough enjoyable for me so that I for one will pick up the second season, I might even try out the fan translated manga too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score - \\n\r\n                           8.5 out of 10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Silver Spoon\r\nRating 5(average-low)\r\n(POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEWARE)\r\nSilver spoon was not that good and In my opinion I didn't find the first season as interesting. In fact I almost don't find it as memorable at all i don't even know all of the characters names for starters (But I guess that is just me). It is just another anime to me.\r\nThe main character is a typical anime type boy cliche,  unrealistically happy like he has never experience  mental pain before, the constant over exaggeration of simple gestures and as always to complete the trend he gets into \"sticky situations\" (uh-oh). \r\nYeah and I should mention thathe is pretty much the focal point for  most of the humor. At the end of the show it never really answers the question, which was what he did want to become when he was older? (he is in a farm school after all). Instead we got a lack luster response of him accomplishing something which is sort of irrelevant because I still got no answer in terms of the ending. But fear not there is a season 2.\\n\r\n Also The character development didn't click with me either, I kind of feel like the creators attempted to make us feel sorry for the main character and his \"tough decision\" at the end, I didn't really get it due to the sped up timeline and I didn't get the point of it (it was kind of silly if you ask me)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst parts was the humor, there was too much in the scenes where characters are having a deep 1 on 1 conversation on what they want to do with their lives, how their personality and morals are indicated through their work ethics and in the character development and then something \"funny\" happens.\\n\r\n Saying that there was \"too much humor\" is an exaggeration, but I guess all I wanted was a solid moment with 2 characters.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you may find all of my other arguments nit-picking type reasons to dislike it but this is the one that annoyed me the most. THE FOCAL POINT FOR ALL POSITIVE EXPERIENCES  REVOLVES AROUND FOOD!! (excluding humor to an extent).\\n\r\nIt is annoying that basically everything links up to food. I mean sure they are in a farm school but why is it that hard for you to base the plot around something else, it is a farm school you don't have to show each and every character eating delicious food in every episode. They even have ongoing jokes about it with this fat girl who almost faints after not eating for a short period of time.\\n\r\n I wanna see something else happen like someone's dreams being accomplished or a taste of something like that (haha \"taste\", see what I did there).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway there is a season 2 coming out so I am guess all that stuff about aspirations will be addressed later on!!\\n\r\nAnyway thanks for reading and of course it is my opinion but you may like all of this stuff\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review considers both seasons to be one entity.\r\nIf any anime has ever been able to evoke feeling of pure joy, it's this one. This isn't the prettiest anime, nor does it feature the most original story, nor does it have the most complex characters. But it is hands down one of the most easygoing, pleasant, and enjoyable anime I have ever seen.\r\nThe first thing I want to note is how much I adore the show's aesthetics. The food is of course, a focal point of the show, and A-1 Pictures managed to make it look damn tasty, as they needed to do in ashow about agricultue. I love Hiromu Arakawa's style and the character designer really nailed the way everyone looked. Which is surprising considering A-1 produced this. Their style is generally so typical and bland to me. It just makes me appreciate Gin no Saji more. However, the animation won't make your jaw drop through the floor like ufotable or Shaft can do, but the show isn't about heavy action or surrealism. The animation did what it needed to do to serve the purposes of the show, and it did it well. However, there are some cringey CGI bits that I didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I just need to gush about the ED for a moment. It's so good and it's catchy as hell. The song perfectly fits the cheerful tone of the show and it forms an excellent bridge between the ending of an episode and the credits. The OP, while it isn't as good as the ED, is still adorable, catchy, and very cheerful. Beyond the OP and ED, though, I don't really remember much about the soundtrack at all to be honest. It did it it's job, I suppose. It wasn't exactly memorable. However, the animal sound effects are good, as they should be. No problems here, but the soundtrack of the anime is it's weakest point.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rather simple, a boy, a studious and urban child, attends a rural agricultural high school. Little does he realize, he's in way over his head. Hijinks ensue. But the point of Gin no Saji isn't to tell an astounding story, it's about the lessons we learn alongside Hachiken. He learns about the brutal realities of farm life for the livestock and the farmers. He learns about responsibility. He even learns a little but about love. \\n\\n\r\nIt's through these lessons that Gin no Saji shows itself to be a very special anime. Personally, I find Hachiken to be very relatable. I wasn't good for much other than memorizing facts and doing tests in school either. I don't know anything about working on a farm or taking care of animals or growing crops. For me, it was like I was right there beside Hachiken, learning about the world and agriculture with him. That is exactly what makes Hachiken such an effective protagonist. A good story, but not all, requires an ignorant character through which the audience can learn more about the world the story presents. It's immersive and informative. The rest of the cast is entertaining. None of the secondary characters were grating or annoying to me. Not all of the characters are explored in that great of depth, but we do gain significant insight into their lives. Ichiro's character probably had the most interesting development of the other characters, but I don't want to spoil too much. I'll just say I loved the characters. Hachiken Yuugo is an excellent protagonist, and he is one of my favorites in all anime.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it present an accurate interpretation of farm life? I don't know, I'm just a city boy. But I've heard that lots of what the anime shows us is very accurate. Hiromu Arakawa was raised on a dairy farm after all, and we follow characters in the dairy sciences program. I'm inclined to say, yes, this story presents entirely plausible and realistic situations.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, I enjoyed this anime immensely. It's some of the best fun I've had watching anything. It's also very touching at times, and even a little sad. It's a story about growing up. It's a story about living life. Life is gonna have its ups and downs and it'll be a confusing, tiring, exciting ride. Gin no Saji conveys such a powerful sense of being alive (it's difficult to put into words). I don't know, I loved every second of this anime. I think it's a masterpiece of the slice of life genre and it's one of the best anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "At the start of watching Gin no Saji, I was unsure of what to think about it. I thought it would be just a fun little slice of life anime, but what I got far exceeded my expectations.\r\nGin no Saji is the perfect example that we each have the ability to set our own path and believe what we want to believe. And even if we face adversity we still stand by our beliefs.\r\nPersonally I have never seen an anime in which a city boy was placed in a farming school, so kudos to the maker of the manga for doing it well. The animemisses no opportunities to put the main character, Hachiken, into situations far outside of his comfort zone, thus leading to hilarious developments. But don't let the comedy fool you, because there are moments in this anime where they ask the tough questions, and you may see things in a different light by the end. Another plus is that there's never too much focus on one side character at a time, and instead they all develop together through their interactions with Hachiken. The story progresses at a steady pace, which allows viewers to get to know the characters, but also prevents boredom by giving you a nice change of scenery every episode or two. If the beginning was a little less slow it would be perfect.\\n\\n\r\nNow the art is very well done, and for some of the farm equipment and the more movement oriented scenes it is incredibly detailed and flows almost seamlessly. But, I have to take off some points for the lack of  movement during a good portion of the dialogue oriented scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't much to write home about, but I did enjoy the opening and none of the tracks felt out of place. On another note, the Japanese voice acting was well done, and I felt that most of them fit there characters perfectly. Even better than that though, is that I found none of their voices to be annoying and normally there is at least one.\\n\\n\r\nWhat really sets this anime apart for me is the characters. Not because they are necessarily original character concepts, but because they each add something to the story, whether it's laughs, insight, or even their worries about the future.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this anime and would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about watching it.",

            "content": "\u201cBecause of the life they were born into, they are immediately stuck as an existence that can\u2019t even choose their own life and death.\u201d\r\nSuch is the life of livestock. Chickens are killed to be eaten if they don\u2019t lay enough eggs; horses are immediately retired or put to rest if they don\u2019t win any competitions or get injured; and pigs and cows are sold at a really cheap price if they do not eat enough. Behind the scenes of our farms and their livestock, the idea of the \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is more clear-cut and harsh than it is in human society. However, humansare judged equally as harsh by the results they produce. In a generation that values the credentials of people more than the people themselves, people who fall behind even a little bit are often shunned or overlooked, just as if they are worthless livestock. Therefore, people of all ages, especially those that are younger, are put under a tremendous amount of pressure to succeed and sometimes forced to take on undesired paths for life. And sadly enough, running away never seems to be an option\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOr does it?\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji (Silver Spoon) tells the story of Hachiken Yugo, a boy that decides to go to an agricultural boarding school far away from home after getting rejected from the high school he was aiming for. Hachiken\u2019s tunnel vision to get into the high school causes him to lose sight of what he really wants to do, and so he chooses the agricultural school to get away from being considered a failure. All of us, especially in our teenage and early adult years, can relate to this experience one way or another: the fact that you work diligently towards a goal and realize soon after that the goal can never be reached is a daunting and depressing thing. To make matters worse, you are forced to see your peers achieve that same goal and become afraid of them lest they judge you for failing. You want to escape, but sometimes the pressure from society, from your family and your friends, all chain you down to sometimes lead the life that you don\u2019t necessarily want.\\n\\n\r\nSo for all those that are troubled like Hachiken, I recommend this slice-of-life anime series. One of the core things that Gin no Saji teaches the viewers is to take a break from all that unhealthy pressure for once and reflect upon what is most important FOR YOU in life. Luckily for Hachiken, he is surrounded by classmates that are all passionate about what they want to do in life. For someone without a goal, seeing determined people who constantly pursue their goal may be discouraging but motivating at the same time. This indirect pressure encourages Hachiken to think earnestly about what he wants to do in life. The new experiences and fun memories made at this new school start to bring out a new side of Hachiken that surprises those that have known him in the past.\\n\\n\r\nThe magic of the character of Hachiken is that he came in knowing absolutely nothing about the agricultural high school. At least for me, I could personally relate to Hachiken, only because I had to face the same amount of pressure to do well in school. But not only that, just as Hachiken felt bad for the farm animals being killed off out of obligation, I did too; just as Hachiken had to wake up every morning around five to do work, I could relate to how painful that would be; and just as Hachiken felt indirectly pressured by his passion-driven friends, I did too. That\u2019s why this character is really dear to me, and his development as a person is all the more exciting as this series goes on.\\n\\n\r\nBut if the story of Hachiken Yugo and his friends don\u2019t appeal to you, Gin no Saji has high educational value. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the agricultural businesses and farms, then this anime gives you a glimpse of what it\u2019s like. And in addition to the fun facts about farm animals, equipment, and techniques, the anime takes on philosophical views on what the animals teach humans, and how the animals should be treated. For one thing, everyone in this anime has deep rooted respect for livestock. There are owners that hold extravagant funerals for horses to honor them; there are people who appreciate the animals for providing them a new insight or viewpoint in life; and there are people who make the necessary killing of farm animals as quick and painless as possible. Finally, this anime touches upon not only the future of the agricultural and farming businesses, but also sensitive topics such as animal cruelty and cloning. I value this anime highly because of what it teaches me, each and every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSince Gin no Saji was in an entirely different setting, background, and pacing from Fullmetal Alchemist, I laid off the manga after two chapters or so. But the anime brought me back to the manga, and what a delight it\u2019s been. As a fan of the slice-of-life genre, Gin no Saji is without a doubt a fresh addition to my list. I look forward to more heartfelt and warm moments awaiting Hachiken and his friends at Oezo Agricultural High School!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\nReview by MAL criteria\\n\\n\r\nStory: The synopsis is available in the MAL page as well as in the second big paragraph of this review. What gives the story an overall 10 is the number of characters that have very relatable and realistic problems and backgrounds. In addition, as mentioned before, the anime has educational value, as it teaches the viewers about farm animals, equipment, techniques, and the logistics of agricultural and farming businesses. Rarely do we consider a slice-of-life anime with educational value anything from interesting, but Hiromu Arakawa manages to pull it off.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: The opening song \u201cKiss you\u201d by Miwa is a sweet and carefree song, but nothing too memorable. The ending song \u201cHello Especially\u201d is sung by Sukima Switch, who also sang \u201cGolden Time Lovers\u201d from the third opening of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood. I mention this because Sukima Switch chose to sing a country song for this anime (rather than rock), and no doubt, the song is catchy and fits perfectly to the anime. Besides that, the soundtracks introduced thus far are nothing too special, but they often give you a very warm countryside feeling when you hear them playing at certain parts. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nArt: As the anime is in an agricultural setting, the scenery is pastoral and soothing. Not to mention the use of warm and bright colors to emphasize the warmth and homeliness of the environment. \\n\\n\r\nAs it is a Hiromu Arakawa work, you will see similarities between Gin no Saji characters and Fullmetal Alchemist characters. The depiction of the characters stays true to the manga, and you\u2019ll notice the similar reactions that Hiromu Arakawa likes to use. There is great detail and personification of animals so it is entertaining to see various expressions from these animals.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation of this anime seems to be the most lacking of all the categories because it can get choppy and awkward at times. The animation is especially important because it is tied into delivering punchlines or depicting hilarious scenes, so the humor is not always delivered appropriately or properly conveyed due to the occasionally choppy animations. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Season 1 of Gin no Saji is focused mostly on Hachiken's development from being a gloomy and uptight guy to a more confident and relaxed one. Viewers are introduced to other characters and their backgrounds, but the anime has yet to develop any of them. I rate this section highly, however, because of how well Hachiken's development is done. Viewers see Hachiken learning something different about himself, his friends, and his environment every episode, and in turn his friends learn something different about Hachiken each episode. I can\u2019t wait to see him develop more and more, until the moment he figures out what he wants to do in life. (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: On behalf of those who love this anime already, let me say to those reading this review that you\u2019re missing out!! I can\u2019t guarantee everyone will enjoy it, but I hope you do! \\n\\n\r\n8.8/10 \\n",

            "content": "Life is what you make it, if anything, it\u2019s far from perfect.\r\nIn order to experience the true beauty of the world, we must accept the unimaginable situations we\u2019ve been placed in, no matter how uncomfortable they may be. \r\nDive into the world of agriculture \u2018Gin no Saji\u2019 otherwise known as \u2018Silver Spoon\u2019 in English. Our main character, Yugo Hachiken, who in desperation separates himself from his family and their ever growing expectations, enrolls into the boarding school Yezo High School. Carrying a quirky and half assed attitude, Hachiken quickly realizes that escaping the expectations of not only his family, but others as well  withouthaving any aspirations of your own isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. This realization is even further amplified when he is surrounded by peers who seemingly already have their life planned out. If you can relate to this even in the most miniscule way, you should do yourself a favor and give this 11 episode season the time of day. \\n\\n\r\nAs we journey deeper, it is Gin no Saji\u2019s extremely strong cast that truly allows this anime to shine. With an episodic-like structure and an array of unique supporting characters, the awkwardness that is the situations Hachiken is thrown into, know no bounds. Through the eyes of the beholder, we are initially shown the ugly side of the agricultural world, filled with the squirms of Hachiken as he collects fresh chicken periods, becomes overly attached to baby livestock and witnesses the butchery of countless animals. But ever so slowly, Hachiken begins to settle in his new found home, and the beautiful side of this world begins to shine through. As previously stated, the supporting cast Gin no Saji is exceptionally strong. The unique personalities of each character are truly showcased, whether it\u2019s Tokiwa\u2019s eternal struggle with studying, the tit loving Holstein Club, or the iron will of Komaba. Each have their own aspirations which become evident throughout their daily interactions which creates a heartwarming tone.\\n\\n\r\nA-1 pictures generally have a high standard when it comes to artwork, and Gin no Saji is no exception. The vast majority is animated cleanly without any majorly distracting blemishes, characters are easily distinguishable, the scenery is drawn beautifully and the food is at a tantalizing level of animation. Heck, even the eggs fresh out a chicken\u2019s bum looks delectable. \\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything worthy of complaint in Gin no Saji it would be its background music, which more often than not doesn\u2019t benefit the atmosphere the scene attempts to create. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not a poor soundtrack by any means\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t add much to the premises most of the time. It simply exists at an acceptable standard. Both the opening and ending themes give off a light hearted, rural feeling which compliments the themes of the anime quite well. When taking the above elements into consideration, the soundtrack as a whole is presented to an above par standard. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, chances are you\u2019ll most likely enjoy this series even if you have absolutely no interest in the world of agriculture. Put plainly, Gin no Saji is a warm hearted slice of life filled with plenty of comedic and relatable moments, with an exceptionally strong cast of characters and beautiful visuals. Gin no Saji portrays its story in a simple, yet enjoyable fashion. So what are you waiting for? Take the plunge into the world known as Gin no Saji, and who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll fall in love with the world of agriculture just like Hachiken did.\\n",

            "content": "Everyone has dreams. In fact, dreams can come in all shapes or sizes. It be as simple as getting an A+ on a math exam or to something as difficult as winning a gold medal in the Olympics. The problem with dreams is though is that not everyone seems to be able to follow all the way through. It\u2019s from dreams though that people learn about the world and about themselves. In Silver Spoon, we follow a main male protagonist named Yugo Hachiken as he embarks on a road for his future but one that he never expected to turn out to be.\r\nGin no Saji(also known by its English name Silver Spoon) is anime series based off of the manga of the same name written by Hiromu Arakawa. She is known already for her previous work, Full Metal Alchemist that has achieved universal praise for both its anime and manga creations. As a brand new series, we get to see an insight on her new work from a different perspective. This time, we get to witness the life of a farm boy in the field of agriculture as opposed to the military bases and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, this anime is influenced by the author\u2019s real life childhood because she used to grow up on a dairy farm in Hokkaido. Therefore, we also get to see the author\u2019s reflection of her past life in a sort of way. However, this time we step into the shoes of Hachiken as a student and see how his life is like. \\n\\n\r\nHachiken is one of those character that seems to be unmotivated from the beginning. This is evidenced even from the very beginning in which he tries to get take an easy route by enrolling in an agricultural school. This might sound easy but it\u2019s a lot harder once he opens his eyes to reality. The backstab comes to Hachiken\u2019s part as he quickly finds out that all the students there are motivated by their desire to actually make a professional career out of their time spend there. For Hachiken though, this is more like a time of struggle. \\n\\n\r\nThe various characters of this show makes it quite appealing since almost all of them seems to have a mind set on the future; that is almost everyone except for Hachiken. These goals ranges from inheriting a farm business, to become a veterinarian, or owning a chicken farm. At the same time, these characters all have their own style when they make their appearances. Take Shinnosuke for example. He seems to play a struggling role (although not on the same level from my perspective) in the series. Shinnosuke wants to become a vet but often fears at the sight of blood or animals. Then, there\u2019s also Aki, a girl that is sometimes stereotyped as the pretty girl next door. In fact, she even fits this role literally with her love of horses. (a possible reference to girls\u2019 love for ponies)\\n\\n\r\nThe plot of the series follows a more slice-of-life format where it visualizes and presents how a person\u2019s life is like as a student in the agricultural field. Surprisingly enough, it does make its sense of realism strong through the portrayal of its actions. These include cutting chickens\u2019 heads off, milking cattle, cooking corns, and just an every day style of what is like to be a student at this agricultural school. For viewers however, it can be frustrating in the beginning to witness Hachiken\u2019s life style because he shows little interest in the activities. This is especially true when he realizes how hard life can be on the farm. At the same time though, Hachiken progresses with his effort and learns more about his new life through experience. These experiences puts him in the driver\u2019s seat for the first time on his road for a future. It is also in someway inspirational to see how he progresses throughout the show that might make people realize that dreams can come true.\\n\\n\r\nAmong other interesting factors of the series includes the character interactions. For Hachiken, it\u2019s important for him to make new friends in order to adjust. Thanks to his intellect though, he is able to earn the respect of his peers and possibly even the affection of his classmate, Aki. In fact, there are hints of romance in the series occasionally between Hachiken and Aki. This can be viewed as a more innocent factor of the show and often times or not, we get to witness the silly moments (sometimes misunderstandings as well) between the duo. The sparks are there though but usually Hachiken plays the role of the dummy. On the other hand, Aki\u2019s cheerfulness makes it all more the worthwhile to watch. What might be more scary to watch is maybe her overprotective father as he plays the role of a dad who seems to care about her daughter more than he probably should.\\n\\n\r\nThe series also brings a delightful doses of comedy to the show. In fact, it sometimes barely tries and succeeds in this field. This usually involves Hachiken and how he deals with the various farm animals with various results. In the beginning, most of this is almost absurd but later on spells out more hilarious moments as he gets first hands-on experience with the farm life. Trust me though, it\u2019s a lot harder than what you see with your naked eye. It doesn\u2019t end there as other characters such as Tamako even has her humorous moments and little gags that makes the show of a spoonful of comedy.\\n\\n\r\nVisual wise, Silver Spoon takes on a realistic approach but with rich artistic visuals. The backgrounds is portrayed almost lifelike with a sense of naturalism in terms of its farm animals, buildings, and simplicity. Speaking of simple, most of the characters are designed as such without any fancy outfits, makeups, or battle gear. There is some similarity with its character designs in comparison to Full Metal Alchemist although this should be taken as for granted.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of the series is decent with a simple and straight forward way of presenting its rhythms. The OP song \"kiss you\" by miwa has a silly way of presenting its song with humorous sequences and character montages. On the other hand, the ED song \u201cHello Especially\u201d by Sukima Switch has this sense of calmness as we witness characters walking down a road that can be interpreted as walking down a road towards the future. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show might not be for everyone but it certainly should be worth giving a shot. You don\u2019t have to enjoy agriculture to watch this. If you don\u2019t believe me, just ask Hachiken. He started out as the new kid at school but now has earned the respect of not just his classmates but me as well. The realism this series focuses more than just the farm animals but also on Hachiken\u2019s progressive development as his new life begins. It might not be the dream he originally wanted to follow but it sure is something enjoyable to watch. Living a life on the farm might be tough but for me, enjoying this show was simple. \\n",

            "content": "Everyone views the world in a different colored light. Our shade is affected by our upbringing, our culture, our religion, our language, and a variety of other factors. However, when our color mixes in with another color, then the light in which we view the world in changes dramatically, as yellow mixing with blue makes green. It allows us to see things that we have missed before, and makes us question the things that we've always believed. Silver Spoon pushes Hachiken Yugo into a completely new world, and changes the hue of his view as well as ours in this story.\r\nWritten by Hiromu Arakawa ofFullmetal Alchemist fame, she writes a story on something that would have been completely overlooked and unappreciated if not for her name, a story about farming, which would have been a complete shame. Based off of her past in growing up on a farm, it is a completely different story from her most famous work, with a completely different tone, but is yet another amazing work. \\n\\n\r\nThe story follows city boy Hachiken Yugo as he enrolls in agricultural school for personal reasons, and his cultural shock and adjustment entering into this completely new world. The story is set in a slice-of-life format, with an almost \"plotless\" feel to it, just following Hachiken and his friends' life in agriculture, showing things from rounding up chickens to chasing tractors to cooking pizza. Despite seeming like this would be a negative, it actually ends up being a very effective way to present the story, as it gives you a feel for their everyday lives and everything they go through and enjoy. The show also muses on some subtle philosophical aspects that make you sit back and think, and makes it more than just your everyday slice-of-life show. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are definitely one of the strongest points of this show, and it really helps this show to be an enjoyable and personal one. Hachiken is sort of like an avatar for the viewer, a foreigner looking into this new world. He gets sick when they cut off chicken's heads, he gets overly attached to farm animals destined to be food, and is bewildered by this completely different way of life. We also slowly start to see throughout the show the growth of his character as he adapts to this new world and starts seeing things in a different light. All the other characters are interesting as well, from the hilarious Tamako to the strong and caring Komaba, it's always fun to watch their lives and personalities come alive and how they interact with one another. They also have their own dreams they're chasing and goals they want to reach, and it just makes them more personal than characters who are just there as devices rather than people. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show is pretty good, animated well. From what I could tell it was pretty fluid most all the time. The character designs are also pretty clean and weren't a distraction. One thing I thought the art did really good on though was making the food look delicious, causing your mouth water. Whether it was egg and rice or pizza, somehow it just makes your stomach grumble even though you ate like an hour ago. The music was also pretty good, supplementing the scenes well. The ED fit well with the show too, having the country feel to it. The OP was alright, but in my opinion, it had kind of a subdued feeling to it that I didn't really like, but that's just my feeling, it's still a pretty good OP. The sound and music really help supplement the show's feeling and dynamic across and fit well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was a lot of fun to watch. From the eye-opening views on the farm world to thought-provoking conversations to hilarious moments, this show on farming had my attention in a way I never thought it would. The premise seems strange, but it was a surprisingly enjoyable watch. Despite seeming slow paced like a normal slice-of-life show would, it still felt like the episodes went by in 5 minutes, a testament to how much it absorbs you into its world. While when this first was announced I was only slightly interested, I'm definitely looking forward to when part two comes out in the winter. Give this show a chance; it may not seem like your kind of show, but is definitely a lot greater than it seems.",

            "content": "\"Tokiwa, how can something so tasty come out of an anus? Chickens are amazing\"\r\nAs an anime I picked up out of a whim I did not expect much, but nonetheless Gin no Saji delivered tenfold. Not only was it a light hearted watch with tasteful comedy given the context, but Gin no Saji really isn't afraid to explore complex issues which inevitably challenge our perspectives on our morality and allow us to really see what we take for granted. Let's go into specifics.\r\nStory (9)\r\nHiromu Arakawa has created the plot through envisioning the life of the protagonist Hachiken, who takes the initiative to enrol in anAgricultural school in order to be separated from his family. Although at first glance this anime does not seem to have a strong standing plot, though it is through its execution of the story that makes the story exceptional. From the transition from city to country life, it's obvious that that MC is way out of his comfort zone, but it is from there that he really develops as a person. The pacing of the show really helps with this as it really allows us to see his experiences with his friends and classmates while being able to acknowledge this personal development. The plot left nothing too overly predictable, and as a comedy it really excelled. I think it really was the carefree nature of Gin no Saji while continuously exploring Hachiken's development which made the anime so entertaining to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound (8)\\n\r\nA-1 Pictures has animated Gin no Saji on a solid level. There's not really too much to say other than the character designs were very well drawn, the backgrounds were clean and the animation as a whole was fluid. The opening theme and ending theme were really catchy as well, and really did reflect the down to earth nature of the anime. The OST was also suffice in reflecting the current situation faced by Hachiken, and I felt that I was better able to empathise with the characters as a result.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (10)\\n\r\nDefinitely the strong point of the anime. Despite focusing on reflecting Hachiken's development as a person, the producers did not fail to exemplify the efforts of his friends to get him to this point. Through their experiences with the MC, each character is given a great amount of development as well learn about their back stories, motivations and overall, their personalities and how they came to be. Additionally, all the characters are likeable in one way or another, and others really bring out the comedy in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9)\\n\r\nGin no Saji was definitely an anime that I really enjoyed, not just because of its down to earth feel and hilarity, but because it wasn't afraid of exploring issues that other animes probably wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole (and in the end they executed it quite brilliantly). By having such diverse characters which drive the story as well as its solid animation and OST, I cannot express how enjoyable I found Gin no Saji to be.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nIn the end I believe that a lot of us can really relate to Gin no Saji and the themes it presses forward, despite what initially seems to be your average school anime. I definitely recommend the anime to anybody who wants to take a break from your typical battle anime and wants to watch a light hearted, comedic anime of a teenager's development as a person when being placed in an unfamiliar situation. Highly recommended!",

            "content": "Watching the first couple of episodes of Gin no Saji I was very sceptic. I had heard that it was a very good series but I just could not see it. Having powered through the first two episodes I was relieved to discover that it was indeed a very good series. It was very fun and it deviated from the norms of slice of life anime. \r\nStory: 8\r\nThe story is pretty much what you would expect from such a series but due to the set up in an agricultural high school there were several minute changes that boosted the series as a whole. Unlike otherseries it kept being fun and the stories of each episode managed to make the viewing process very fun. The main story was pretty basic but that does not mean that it was boring in any way.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nArtistic wise is what you would expect from a series launched after 2010. The art was very pretty and the scenery complemented the story and characters. It just gave off the feeling that you were actually in a rural part of japan something that it is not seen frequently in anime series (for me it was the first time). Overall I would say that the art was great despite not being flashy. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\\n\r\nSound was a bit bland. I can not say that any of the ost stuck in my head. Everything was ok but nothing was impressive. I imagine this is the case because the whole series had no epic moments that needed to be boosted by awesome tracks but still I think that it could have been improved.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\\n\r\nAll characters were designed exceptionally good. The main character was bit hard to like, at first, but as the series progressed and you get to now more about him you understand why he is the way he is. The supporting characters were all well thought and diverse. As a whole the characters managed to help unfold a pretty funny and enjoyable series filled with hilarious 'accidents' but also with deep emotional moments that help the development of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nAs I have stated above the series was very enjoyable since it deviated from the norms. It is highly recommended to all who wish to watch something uplifting and humorous with that being based on fanservice and slapstick humor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give this series an 8 due to the just fair music and the fact that the season ended very abruptly. Of course there is a season 2 and that may be a little harsh but the fact is that episode 11 (end of season 1) seemed to end in a hurry. Had I been forced to wait for the season 2 to start I would probably not have watched it.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhile sitting here writing this review, I looked around me to see what food I had lying about. I see some left-over chips, crackers, and a bit of candy. When you think about it, the way certain foods are made is pretty amazing. We can go to the grocery store, pick out pre-sliced meat, and bring it home for dinner to make into hamburgers, steak, or what have you. But how does that meat get from the farm to the freezer? Gin no Saji looks to explore the facets of farming, agriculture, and morality when dealing with thevery animals we eat, and it does it in a splendid way.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji starts off in a similar fashion to other shows; new student Hachiken has come to Ezonoo in order to start learning about what it means to run a farm.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't get much more simple than that for a description. As such, the show itself is pretty much slice-of-life. Without an over-arcing story, what GnS aims to do is demonstrate the different parts to the farming lifestyle. One of the things that becomes immediately apparent is its factual nature. On top of being pretty unique in its subject matter, the show goes out of its way to explain many different parts to farming. There are explanations of how chickens are handled, the most efficient ways to milk a cow, and insight into gutting a deer. There is way more than I listed, and that's awesome. The show is not shy about immersing you in this topic that people like me and Hachiken, who come from the city/suburbs, have no knowledge about.\\n\\n\r\nThe show even tackles the idea of morality when it comes to killing and eating animals. What does it mean to love an animal? Is there something wrong with killing and eating living things? The show, like its take on agriculture, explores these questions and more within its contents. I found this type of approach pretty compelling because it got me thinking about the animals that I eat every day. Before, I would have no qualms eating some chicken tenders or scarfing down a nice filet, but after watching Gin no Saji, I will, at the minimum, think twice about what it took for the food in front of me to get there.\\n\\n\r\nAs if the world-building and philosophical ideas weren't enough, the show also sets its sights on what it means to have a dream. Many people that are asked, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" know the answer right away: a doctor, astronaut, computer consultant. For others, they don't have a choice: maybe they have to take over the family business or are pressured into doing something they don't necessarily have the heart to do. Yet others still have no answer because they have no idea what they want. The show does a nice job of presenting these three different sides to the previous question. Is there a right or wrong answer? What the show will teach you is no, that the path you follow is the one you should take. In the end, it is up to you to decide what type of person you will become.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji's art style is rather pleasant. Taking place mostly on farms, the differing locales usually came with differing lifestyles. From pig pens to vegetable fields, the show demonstrates a wide variety of environments that make you feel as if the characters are on the farms they are supposed to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is produced by A-1 Pictures, so it should come as no surprise that the animation is well done. While the character designs are good, the animal details are of particular note. A-1 Pictures seemed to take extra time in making sure the animals looked realistic. The horses had refined muscles, the cows chewed, and the pigs had beady yet sparkling eyes. The focus of the show is on farming and animals and therefore the quality in them is noticeable and greatly appreciated.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking again on character designs, I didn't find them to be terribly unique but that really isn't a bad thing. If anything, they all look rather mature for their age. At times, I forgot the show was taking place in high school; the subject material and characters reminded me more of college.\\n\\n\r\nAs a final note, I like Hachiken's design if only for the glasses. Being a glasses wearer myself, I always appreciate when the MC dons spectacles.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nI guess since GnS is technically listed as a shounen, it has quite a large cast. That being said, there are only two main characters and subsequently they are the most important.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with the lesser, Mikage is a young woman who loves horses and is one of Hachiken's first friends at his new school. She is very kind, caring, and more courageous than is initially let on. She actually acts as a foil to Hachiken. She knows what she wants to do deep down in her heart but her hand is forced. In contrast, Hachiken has no idea what he really wants to do but the world is his oyster (gotta' make an animal pun somewhere in here!). Alongside being a literary device, there are definitely feelings that develop within her for Hachiken. While not a romance story in the slightest, the romantic in me loved seeing her reactions to particular situations involving Hachiken.\\n\\n\r\nThe most important character of the series is obviously Hachiken. He's smart, shy, and determined to prove himself. For him, results mean everything; you're either a winner or a loser. But his time at Ezonoo, hanging out with friends, helping out Pork Bowl, and making mistakes, helps to flesh him out as a well-rounded character. He starts off stalwart in his thinking but over time he comes to learn that winning isn't everything, and that its okay to not always know everything.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Hachiken and Mikage come the rest of the cast. While nobody distinctly stands out character-wise, they each have their little moments that are used for comedic effect. Special shout out to Nakajima, the equestrian club advisor, for his hilarious Buddha-esque glow behind his head.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is okay to my ears. Besides hearing \"kiss you\" while listening, it is pretty relaxing and matches the overall tone of the show nicely. On the other hand, the ED is pretty good. It really gives off the vibe that they are in the country or on the farm. Likewise, the guitar and the singing complement nicely with one another.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the soundtrack, one of the standout pieces is the \"stair-step\" beat that sounds orchestral. It is hard to describe, but it was used when the characters were looking to get started on a difficult task.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the voice acting is fine. In terms of performances, Ryouhei Kimura does a nice job in the role of Hachiken. Perhaps in the same vein, I found the animal noises to be acceptable as well. Nothing sounded too out of the ordinary, making the animals seem more believable.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji is hard to pin down in terms of genre. It is definitely funny, for starters. The comedy isn't based off the jokes or the dialogue, but rather what is happening on screen. Whether this is a girl asking for bacon or Beppu throwing dough at a security camera, the comedy comes from the world itself.\\n\\n\r\nSome of my favorite episodes are definitely the more laid back, slice of life ones. Specifically the pizza and crop circle episodes. I found the former to be a nice tie in with the themes of farming, hard work, and togetherness, while the latter was a fun take on a tired idea.\\n\\n\r\nI already mentioned this, but being a huge romance buff, seeing Hachiken and Mikage together on screen, either talking with one another or smiling towards each other, always got a smile on my face and my mind wanting them to already end up together.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond all this, I will say I could easily sympathize with Hachiken. Sometimes you put in a lot of work into something, with the return being negligible. And that can seriously get you down. However, the show goes out of its way to articulate that even when you go through some pretty rough times, there is always going to be some good along the way.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Great, interesting concept with nice world-building and good themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, animals are detailed and the environments are fresh\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Hachiken and Mikage complement each other nicely\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, fitting OP and ED, with okay soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, funny, hints of romance, and education\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 8/10",

            "content": "Gin no Saji is a pearl hidden deep underneath the all of the 2014 winter animes. I originally read the description of this anime when it first came out, and found it like any other slice of life anime, that will be good but not enough to keep me wanting to watch more. Boy, was I wrong, and thus came to write this review, which is my very first so please be easy on me. Arakawa Hiromu has out done herself again with this award-winning anime. Gin no Saji is definitely an anime you would want to watch when you want to watch a comedic,light-hearted but deep anime.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe plot to this anime is rather simple; boy with family problems, doesn't know what he wants to do in life, and goes to an agricultural high school to learn more about himself. The plot is simple to follow but truly teaches you about life and food. To city folk, livestock is simply to eat and not to think about any further; where as to country or farm folk, there is so much more to think about when it comes to bringing these animals to the slaughterhouse and making them into daily food. The anime is simple yet deep.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\\n\r\nBoth the art and sound are simple but nice thus fits extremely well into the simple farm life plot. The art style is distinctly Arakawa Hiromu.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are all very likable with the exception of maybe only one. Each character have their own type of personality but comes together as one big family, making the anime family friendly and guaranteed for laughter. As viewers, we see our main protagonist, Yugo Hachiken, develop from the new antisocial character to one that becomes much more outspoken and social. We see him interact with all kinds of characters and help them overcome their problems.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji is such a great anime that I sincerely doubt that I will be able to find another slice of life anime on par with this one. I loved watching all the characters including Pork Bowl and Vice Pres, interact, laugh, and argue with each other. I loved learning about the deeper thought process that comes with livestock being born and only a few months later to die for human's sake. Lastly I loved every moment this anime had to offer. Definitely a 10/10 if you need a simple, hilarious, and deep slice of life anime to watch.",

            "content": "Ola everybody, as I've finished this watching this anime, I'd probably say that this is one of the truly most unique anime for this year, since it doesn't focus on the usual genre that every anime has followed, so, without further adieu, I present my ratings for each of this anime's category:\r\nStory, character, enjoyment- very good 8.\r\nStory:\r\nOk, the story about a city slicker incoming high schooler is very unique in the sense that it presents a strong slice of life that happens in real life, about a boy who escapes from the problems he has with his family only to find himself from the fryingpan to the fire kind of thing. However, there is another part of this anime's slice of life where it shows us that sometimes destiny has a weird way of showing us where we belong.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nSo here it's all about the city slicker guy who has no idea what he got himself into and yes I'm referring to Yugo Hachiken, ok, so at one point I would like to give him a Karate chop on his head for being to cheesy about being in an agricultural high school and getting too emotional about Pork Bowl and other livestock's around  the said school, but then again one would appreciate as to how much of an asset he is to his fellow classmates, when everyone looks up to him and sees how much his willing to help out and get alone with everyone else......though, there are situations that he'll grumble and screw-up.\\n\\n\r\nAki Mikage, is basically someone who completes the main character, Hachiken as this sweet girls who has served as the latter's foundation as to keep him in high spirits and, also, I kinda like the Yugo X Aki arc, since those two go nice together.\\n\\n\r\n Tamako Inada, I would never understand why she has to be this oversize high schooler who sounded and looks like and sounds like a milf. \\n\\n\r\nMayumi Yoshino, if this anime have a harem genre, she would fit in as Aki's competition for Yugo's affection.\\n\\n\r\nIchiro Komaba, if he's Yugo's competition for Aki's affection, I would prefer that he loses to Yugo.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the rest, like Keiji Tokiwa, Shinnosuke Aikawa,Tarou Beppu and Hajime Nishikawa, well, they kinda function well well as the comic relief for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable enough and at the same time this anime does provide some insights about farm life, ever thought the farm theme that this anime presents more like resembles a western farm than a Japanese farm. But the enjoyment was really seeing how Hachiken adjust from being a city slicker to a farm boy throughout his stay at Ezo Agricultural High School as an audience there is that urge for me to do something to make him realize about the situation he entered, but as this anime goes on that urge I have was replace by appreciation as to how he gets along with the said situation he entered.\\n\\n\r\nArt- mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nSince I have no comment about this anime's illustration, but, it would have been nice if Tamako is this slim high school girl. I've also notice another thing about they way the farms were drawn.........the damn illustrator forgot to include rice fields in the damned school or anywhere in Ezo.\\n\\n\r\nSound- poor 3.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't like both the opening and closing theme, and I really hate that Tamako should sound like a milf than a sweet teen.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall- good 7.\\n\\n\r\nIt did presented a very good slice of life genre, the character's are well presented and it was really enjoyable, however the farm theme that this anime shows is more of a western farm than a typical Japanese farm, and I did said that the damned illustrator forgot to include rice fields. Well, overall, this anime should have an , but I couldn't ignore the fact that author Taku Kishimoto didn't combine a kind of agricultural school or a typical place where it should both be a typical western farm combined with Japanese farm. Frankly it was too unfair that such series whether an anime or a manga to not include rice paddies or at least not add a kind of modern Japanese farm into this series. So overall, a 7 would suffice for this anime as a whole, I do hope that in the 2nd season we should be seeing some rice paddies somewhere in  Ezo Agricultural High School and I hope there is a character interested in rice research and production.\\n",

Honestly it's more than that.\r\nSilver Spoon is on par with Mushishi and Natsume on its\u2019 feel good. Gin no Saji is the equivalence of a breeze in the summer. You watch it, enjoy it and you forget about it. It is a modest attempt on equating the reason for killing animals in exchange for tasting that delicious. Hachiken is a sympathetic character whose childhood of holding back his compassion made him unable to deny anyones\u2019 call for help. He loves the animal, especially Pork Bowlbut instead of simply delaying/extending his life, Hachiken embraces it. Because life ends, but life goes on. What was the point of rearing the animals, should they only be meant to be used, discarded and eaten. The horses devote their entire effort, but only result is of key. Even after that, once they fail, they are churned into meat. The pigs, cows, chicken, each just playing their role until a moments\u2019 mistake/injury deem their life unworthy, only to be sent to the butcher by the end of the day. This show is the extent of that reasoning. We just gotta enjoy it while it lasts. That is the fate of all the farm animals, and so is it for us. Embrace and enjoy your life, cos\u2019 it ain\u2019t very long to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nBrilliant anime all the way to the end\u2026\\n\r\nHits you perfectly with the points, and knows exactly what it\u2019s all about, really no flaws visually, manages to keep the narrative informative, close to the plot points and the reason for the anime, with no unnecessary additional contexts.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Mainstream anime is so predictable, the mere thought of watching one revolts me. Plots are used over and over again, characters are portrayed by the same well-known voices who's lack of emotion is really starting to piss me off, and worst of all, the use of below-average OPs and EDs make majority of mainstream anime a very bad batch of brew... much rather like Budweiser. \r\nGin no Saji however, isn't a bottle of Budweiser... it's a bottle of 30 year old scotch. So now, please allow me to explain the differences to you non-drinkers. \r\nBudweiser.. bitter to drink, flavourless after a few sips, and wouldtake just below 10 gallons to get you tipsy. All in all, a useless piece of garbage designed for those with a unusable tongue, and a lack of tolerance to alcohol. Mainstream anime (such as the dreadful 'Campione!' or 'Shining Hearts') are the same; lacking heavily in substance, and relying on the fact that most otaku would want to watch some semi-naked girls chasing a guy round some poorly sketched field. Sometimes I feel sorry for the actors who have to read the boring script, I mean, even a Shakespearean play is more interesting! But I don't blame the producers. The anime industry is full of competition, and sticking with a fool-proof plot is guaranteed to get at least some figures for them to publish.. what I do blame, however, are the idiots who watch mainstream anime in the first place. Without these pea-brained pussies, we would've ridded the world of hindrance so vile, even a thousand year old cheese would lose the competition. But since we're stuck with them, we've gotta feed them right? So, just like Budweiser, mainstream anime is fed to people without 1) any taste whatsoever. 2) any dignity as a human being.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about the scotch then, who are we going to compare this to? The answer is simple; you and I. Gin no Saji is NOT a mainstream anime. Its' plot is NOT predictable. It's NOT introduced by some silly 'la la la' j-pop crap, neither is it ended with 'lo lo lo' rubbish. It is everything that is NOT Budweiser. The plot may seem simple at first, and you might think you know where it's going to lead to.. like the first sip of a beautiful scotch. But as soon as you swallow the scotch, you feel it. The vibrance, the tanginess, the smokiness, and the mellow finish that brings a hint of woodiness to the taste buds. Ah, blissful. But afterwards, you feel the bitterness of the alcohol protruding your senses. You feel the alcohol burning into the back of your throat. And you're certainly going to feel the fire in your chest, accompanied by the blitz to your head. \\n\\n\r\nYes, Gin no Saji is the same as a good scotch. It certainly led me to a happy place (not that one you disgusting person). It made me think about the meaning of life.. and that's what all anime should do imo, make you think. Engaging the content is far more important than watching it, much rather like sex. The plot was structured simply, mainstream if I dare say, yet with the little details dotted all over the place, it made the anime unique. Like a mountain road, it twists with the bends, and it rise with the bumps. The overall atmosphere was a mellow-upper, comparable to a beautiful piece of tarmac road.. but the grim reminder of death loomed over each corner. The most amazing thing about this anime is, in my opinion, is its ability to bring you back to a mellow-upper state immediately after the downer! Just the roller coaster of emotions is enough for you to WANT to watch the piece. \\n\\n\r\nAh, I can write no more.. Pork Bowl, you were so cute. Perhaps it's wrong of me to say this... but I love you :')\\n\\n\r\nAnd so concludes another piece of my (not) interesting, yet (un)informative review. If you've read to the end, well done. If you haven't, then you won't see this; but you, my friend, is a massive dick head who's sole existence is a crime against humanity lol. Peace out.",

            "content": "Gin no Saji is a charming slice of life comedy that revolves around [generic protagonist] as he tires of the city life and enrolls at a farming school. There he meets wise farming teachers and friendly farming students who show him the ropes of farming. He discovers the nuance and talent which lie underneath the surface of farming and becomes determined to be the very best at farming, or at least impress [generic love interest farmgirl]. Prepare for gags and giggles in this hilarious farming anime from A-1 Pictures!\r\nOkay, now that the moderators aren\u2019t looking, I\u2019m going to make my actual review. You guys won\u2019tbelieve this, but I\u2019ve delved beneath the surface of Gin no Saji and discovered that this anime is actually farming shounen disguised as a slice of life comedy. Think about it: clueless boy finds farm school, stumbles upon a farming world he never knew about, haplessly tries to blend in by farming, slowly learns what it takes to be a farmer, develops a bond with farming students, finds an affinity for farming in himself, earns the respect of his farming teachers, impresses his farmer crush, and eventually becomes the very best that no one ever was. Do you see what I\u2019m saying here? Everything falls into place if you just look at it from a different perspective. Once you realize the truth, Gin no Saji is just Harry Potter with horseback riding instead of flying brooms! With that in mind, I have to give this one the credit it deserves for taking two overused anime premises and smushing them together into something fresh. Farm fresh, you could say.\\n\\n\r\n6/10 for a farm-tacular farm-venture that I\u2019ll never farmget. 7/10 for teaching me about all the hard work and passion farmers put in to raise a cow of high enough quality to be served in a McRib.",

            "content": "*This review will cover both seasons of Gin no Saji / Silver Spoon*\r\n     First of all, I\u2019ve got to admit, the premise of the show didn\u2019t impress me at first. The Harvest Moon franchise is as far as my knowledge about farming and agriculture goes. But then, I found out that Hiromu Arakawa, the author of the brilliant FMA is the one behind the manga.  Going by the \u20183 episode rule\u2019, I decided to put this anime to the test.  And I must say I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by how good it turned out to be and ended up binge-watchingit later on. \\n\\n\r\n     The story follows a boy named Hachiken, who for some strange reasons, decided to leave the city and applied for a transfer to a school in the countryside.  There, he learns how to adjust to his new environment-an agricultural school called Ezono and it didn\u2019t take that long for him to realize that life there was not as easy as he thought it would be. The first season focuses more on the education part and I\u2019m impressed by how well represented and interesting it was.  Unlike most \u2018educational anime\u2019 where sometimes it feels like you were forced to learn about something and all the references went straight over your head, everything felt natural here. You don\u2019t need any lengthy and complex explanation to figure out what the show\u2019s trying to convey, instead, they simply show through their actions. Be warned, though, it\u2019s not all fun happy ride all the way. The show can also be serious when it wants to. Being the city boy he was, Hachiken certainly didn\u2019t expect that the industry can be harsh and challenging at times, and we as the viewer can\u2019t help but sympathize with him. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s rewarding to see how he handle and cope with that problems, maturing little by little as time progresses.  In the second season, we saw a much more mature Hachiken dealing with his family problems and we finally get a clearer picture of the reasons behind his action. Expect more drama and conflict in the second season, but worry not, it\u2019s not to the point where it ruined the heartwarming atmosphere of the show. The comedy was alright I guess, compared to Arakawa-sensei\u2019s other work, FMA. One of FMA weakness to me, was the comedy aspect as it felt awkward and out-of-place most of the times, but it was handled and felt more appropriate here due to the lightheartedness nature of the show. \\n\\n\r\n       In terms of animation, the first thing you will notice is the similarity of the character design with the manga and I applaud A-1 Pictures for that. If I have one thing to complain about, it is on how simple and bland the characters look. While it was not awful by a long mile, but if we\u2019re comparing them to let\u2019s say FMA, most of them looked dull and generic in comparison. But who knows, maybe they were supposed to have that simplistic designs, with the story being set in the countryside and all. A-1 Pictures instead, emphasized more on making sure that all animals looked realistic and well-proportioned which is a fair trade-off if you ask me. Thinking back, there was nothing spectacular about the animation overall, but they still managed to capture the essence of the show and that alone is good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\n     Unlike most anime where the OP completely outshines the ED, it\u2019s the other way around here. While the 1st OP sounds catchy and can brighten up the mood, the ED reflect the show\u2019s atmosphere better with its relaxing, country-style tunes. The same goes with the 2nd season where I think switching the OP and ED around would be a better idea. The ED was performed by Goosehouse, the same band behind the catchy \u2018Your Lie in April\u2019 OP and in my opinion it is as equally good if not better. The 2nd season\u2019s OP was alright but not as memorable as I constantly find myself skipping over it every episode. \\n\\n\r\n     Character development has always been one of Arakawa-sensei\u2019s strongest point and it shows here, albeit with a few hiccups. Just like what I mentioned earlier, most of the conflicts happened in the 2nd season and we can see how well Arakawa \u2013sensei handled the character development here without being overly melodramatic. I also liked how they portrayed the students here, where even the dumb ones are not actually idiots, unlike countless other anime out there that just can't get enough of recycling these annoying tropes/clich\u00e9 over and over again.\\n\\n\r\n       Without spoiling anything, the 2nd season focuses more on two important supporting characters that were having a serious crisis and Hachiken, being his usual optimistic self, try to intervene and solve their problems not knowing that his attempts are futile and won\u2019t really change the outcome. By the end of the show, he finally realized that not all problems can be solved with determination alone and as a viewer, it\u2019s nice to see how far he has matured compared to his older self. However, there were some setbacks as well. Many questions were left unanswered and left open, something that you expect would be answered in the 2nd season but sadly, it\u2019s not. Why does Hachiken\u2019s dad act like that? Why did Hachiken\u2019s brother quit that prestigious university? What is Hachiken\u2019s real goal? Now that both main characters have finally realized their true feelings towards each other, how far will the romantic development go? And the list goes on and on\u2026\\n\\n\r\n      Like most manga adaptations, the only downside is that it suffers from incomplete, open ending issues and considering that the manga is currently on a  hiatus, I doubt a 3rd season will follow anytime soon. But don\u2019t let that discourage you from watching it. This show is without a doubt, one of the best \u2018coming-of-age\u2019 anime I\u2019ve seen, bested only by \u2018Honey & Clover\u2019 and \u2018Hanasaku Iroha\u2019 - other fine examples of its genre. All in all, any complaints I may have had with this show are compensated by its believable dramatic situations, its realistic demonstrations of the farmer\u2019s life and for its beautiful, serene atmosphere. A must watch. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Ever wanted a taste of parenting? Try Usagi Drop. Curious about farming? Silver Spoon's got you covered. This latest noitaminA feature contains yet another interesting and unique perspective that actually provides meaningful lessons beyond how to immediately get dumped by girls. As with Usagi Drop, the show manages to take a potentially dull and boring topic and turn it into something intriguing and entertaining. While this isn't as emotionally touching as Usagi Drop, it is still a fun watch for anyone even a bit curious about farming or how a city boy will deal with the culture shock of agricultural life.\r\nAnimation:\r\nThe animation studio took amore conventional approach than that in Usagi Drop. For the most part, it looks like any other rural-based anime. The only major differences are the agriculture-specific tools and facilities and a bunch of farm animals. The show uses a fairly saturated palette that gives the series a bit of a lighter mood. Color shading and background details are average overall and character styling is also a bit on the simplistic side. You also have an instructor who humorously resembles Buddha.\\n\\n\r\nDon't expect much here in terms of either action or fan service. There is a tiny amount of blood once and a while but nothing really significant by action standards.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show has a fitting guitar-based OP and ED. I'm not a fan of slow, country-ish songs of this sort though so I skipped out on them for the most part. The BGM is minimal and for the most part not really worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nThis is in part a documentary and in part a comedy so it is dialogue driven in many parts, but it wasn't very demanding character emotion-wise and no one ended up really standing out for me.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nHachiken has lived his life in his brother's shadows, so much so that his entire dreamless life consists of studying. Having no real drive or future plans, his teacher sends him to a live-in agrarian high school. To his amazement, Hachiken finds himself surrounded by people with strong goals and dreams. Will Hachiken be able to cope with his new, culturally-different classmates and five AM practicums?\\n\\n\r\nThis is an eye-opener of a series in many regards. In telling Hachiken's tale of learning about agriculture, the show is able to expose and confront a lot of misnomers about agriculture and even address some philosophical questions regarding livestock's transformation from respected living creature to meat. Between these conception-shattering moments, you get a bit of character development and a good deal of comic moments; a lot of these revolve around Hachiken's ignorance of the field that he's studying.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the most intense of series plot wise. Don't expect much in the way of cliffhangers or rising action, in fact the series doesn't even really end on much of a conclusion. I guess this fact is slightly mitigated by the fact that a second season has already been announced.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThere are a lot of characters in this show, and while a lot of them contribute to the central plot in one way or another no one is really well developed. The focus of the show is clearly more on showing farming procedures and practices than on giving the, admittedly, bland history of farm hands. While the protagonist clearly becomes much more adept at manual labor, he still maintains a significantly different world view than that of his classmates at the end of the show. The show does occasionally tease at possible character relationships but this is used as more of a comedy gimmick than for plot progression. Overall, the show features a balanced cast that really is presented to highlight the core farming theme rather than the other way around.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nMy strongest takeaway from this show (at least to confirm) is that farm-fresh foods appear to be highly superior to what I, as a cheapskate consumer, can get from the local grocery store. Expect to see the protagonist literally prostrate as a reaction to tasting food. Overall, despite being an average show plot wise, the show managed to stick to its unique theme; this alone earns it a lot of kudos. Unfortunately, I don't see it becoming a hit like Usagi Drop, it just lacks the emotional and character depth. Regardless, it still stands on its own as a reasonably entertaining look at how life is as a farmer. While I have new found respect for those in agribusiness, I'll stick to my white-collar line of work thank you very much. If you're willing to ditch established anime norms (required beach scene, unreasonably cute girls everywhere, etc.) and watch something that can teach you a thing or two, give Silver Spoon a go.",

            "content": "Ah, one of the most hyped anime of the season. Why? Not only is it adapted from a commercially successful, award winning & critically acclaimed manga but also it is written by the famous mangaka Hiromu Arakawa who is responsible for the world famous FMA. So how was the anime? Does it live up to the hype? And how can a manga based on life on agricultural school be this famous? And most of all how come a mangaka who wrote such an action based title as FMA write this? Let me just say that whatever else this anime does it proves (or tries toactually) that you can be a person who doesn't have a clear goal in life or any vague idea what you are gonna do with your life even if are surrounded by ambitious people and it is not always bad; and most of all it proves that book-worm nerds can be cool even when they are acting all moronic & stuff.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nThe story of this anime centers around Yugo Hachiken whose dream in life is quite simple (although it seemed a bit weird at the first few episodes). It is to be separated from his family, so he enrolls in an agricultural boarding school which would take him quite far from his house till he gets his own job. As he deems himself to be an excellent crammer, he believes he will have no problem in there. But it turns out the life there is not what he expected as he gets in the world where physical labor is more important than his brains & the cruelty of the harsh reality of the life of the livestock. He eventually finds friends among his classmates who are all farmers' heirs & not a total city boy like him. And thus the story of his new life goes on with everyday learning of the lifestyle of farmers as well as their farm animals, which quite often arises very funny situation, and thankfully the comedy almost never felt forced.\\n\r\nAlthough it may seem very unusual for the premise of an anime, even for a slice-of-life but all the plot elements are gelled together quite nicely by the writer & the episodic nature of the story (at the first half mainly) really goes well with the premise of the show. Although at first the reason of Hachiken wanting to leave his home that desperately was a bit hard to understand, in later episodes it is explained quite clearly. As the various animals in the school grows through the passing of the time in his school so does his understanding (as well as ours) of farm-life grows, and he has to face some facts of reality which is harsh but true. The show mainly focuses on how he overcomes them and even helps his friends in their needs.\\n\r\nThe story certainly gets props for originality and although at times a bit boring with the knowledge bits but definitely was enjoyable for me, so it gets 8.5 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \\n\r\nAlthough many might disagree with me on this but there is actually only one main character in this anime, rest are just side characters. Hachiken is a character who is like the anime, a bit slow to develop, it takes a viewers a bit of time ( a few episodes at least) to relate with him & to understand his motivations, to appreciate his viewpoints. At first you might find him a bit one-dimensional as someone who takes the easy way out,who runs away from his family but if you carry on with him on his journey you will find out his reasons, will find out how he actually is quite caring for his friends through his actions & tries to help in them in their problems while sometimes even completely ignoring his own ones. And in the end he is a likeable character as well as quite unique too.\\n\r\nAs for the other characters they are very likeable too. Mikage who is the love interest for our protagonist seems a bit bland at first but Hiromu later develops her quite brilliantly in her unique way. The other important characters include hardworking & ambitious Komaba (somewhat generic for the source of Hachiken's jealousy but has a well written back-story); whimsical & laughably dumb at math Tokiwa; money lover & aggressive eater frightening Tamako; afraid of blood yet vet wanna be Shinnosuke ( whose struggles to face his fears is portrayed quite nicely); Hachiken's irritable yet funny brother (who is following his dream by the way) Shingo among others.\\n\r\nThe characters are actually the strongest aspect of this anime & pulls through all the rest of the stuff to a very enjoyable height indeed.\\n\r\nSo I give it 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation\\n\r\nTo be honest the character designs & the art is not at the same level of the rest of the stuff for this anime. The faces of the characters quite often seem too similar & there is a lack of general detail in them. All the food-stuff at least looked good. The animation also seems bland in this day of top-notch technology and somewhat awkward in occasions. But at least on the positive side there is a sense of consistency in animation of the show as a whole, unlike few other animes these days & the piglets were cute.\\n\r\nHowever, it is not as per with other things of the anime & gets 7 out of 10. \\n\\n\r\nSound  \\n\r\nThe opening theme is \"Kiss You\" by Miwa which is a nice song and appropriate for the show but actually not that special. The ending theme is \"Hello Especially\" by Sukima Switch which is the perfect ending song for the show for me, it has kind of a country vibe going for it which is suitable for the atmosphere of the show. Other pieces used during the show are all alright but nothing really stands out as anything special.\\n\r\nAs a whole sound gets from me 8 out 10. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a lot of argument going on the internet whether this is the best show of this season or not, and with a second season now confirmed it is even more fueled. All I can say on these regard is while this anime may not be for everyone (Slice-of-life rarely is), still it is definitely one of the shows to watch for this season; this is kind of a casual & thinking mans show. The funny bits & the thought-provoking realistic situations the characters are put into often are really the highlights and was enough enjoyable for me so that I for one will pick up the second season, I might even try out the fan translated manga too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score - \\n\r\n                           8.5 out of 10.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Silver Spoon\r\nRating 5(average-low)\r\n(POSSIBLE SPOILERS BEWARE)\r\nSilver spoon was not that good and In my opinion I didn't find the first season as interesting. In fact I almost don't find it as memorable at all i don't even know all of the characters names for starters (But I guess that is just me). It is just another anime to me.\r\nThe main character is a typical anime type boy cliche,  unrealistically happy like he has never experience  mental pain before, the constant over exaggeration of simple gestures and as always to complete the trend he gets into \"sticky situations\" (uh-oh). \r\nYeah and I should mention thathe is pretty much the focal point for  most of the humor. At the end of the show it never really answers the question, which was what he did want to become when he was older? (he is in a farm school after all). Instead we got a lack luster response of him accomplishing something which is sort of irrelevant because I still got no answer in terms of the ending. But fear not there is a season 2.\\n\r\n Also The character development didn't click with me either, I kind of feel like the creators attempted to make us feel sorry for the main character and his \"tough decision\" at the end, I didn't really get it due to the sped up timeline and I didn't get the point of it (it was kind of silly if you ask me)\\n\\n\r\nOne of the worst parts was the humor, there was too much in the scenes where characters are having a deep 1 on 1 conversation on what they want to do with their lives, how their personality and morals are indicated through their work ethics and in the character development and then something \"funny\" happens.\\n\r\n Saying that there was \"too much humor\" is an exaggeration, but I guess all I wanted was a solid moment with 2 characters.\\n\\n\r\nI guess you may find all of my other arguments nit-picking type reasons to dislike it but this is the one that annoyed me the most. THE FOCAL POINT FOR ALL POSITIVE EXPERIENCES  REVOLVES AROUND FOOD!! (excluding humor to an extent).\\n\r\nIt is annoying that basically everything links up to food. I mean sure they are in a farm school but why is it that hard for you to base the plot around something else, it is a farm school you don't have to show each and every character eating delicious food in every episode. They even have ongoing jokes about it with this fat girl who almost faints after not eating for a short period of time.\\n\r\n I wanna see something else happen like someone's dreams being accomplished or a taste of something like that (haha \"taste\", see what I did there).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway there is a season 2 coming out so I am guess all that stuff about aspirations will be addressed later on!!\\n\r\nAnyway thanks for reading and of course it is my opinion but you may like all of this stuff\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This review considers both seasons to be one entity.\r\nIf any anime has ever been able to evoke feeling of pure joy, it's this one. This isn't the prettiest anime, nor does it feature the most original story, nor does it have the most complex characters. But it is hands down one of the most easygoing, pleasant, and enjoyable anime I have ever seen.\r\nThe first thing I want to note is how much I adore the show's aesthetics. The food is of course, a focal point of the show, and A-1 Pictures managed to make it look damn tasty, as they needed to do in ashow about agricultue. I love Hiromu Arakawa's style and the character designer really nailed the way everyone looked. Which is surprising considering A-1 produced this. Their style is generally so typical and bland to me. It just makes me appreciate Gin no Saji more. However, the animation won't make your jaw drop through the floor like ufotable or Shaft can do, but the show isn't about heavy action or surrealism. The animation did what it needed to do to serve the purposes of the show, and it did it well. However, there are some cringey CGI bits that I didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nSound-wise, I just need to gush about the ED for a moment. It's so good and it's catchy as hell. The song perfectly fits the cheerful tone of the show and it forms an excellent bridge between the ending of an episode and the credits. The OP, while it isn't as good as the ED, is still adorable, catchy, and very cheerful. Beyond the OP and ED, though, I don't really remember much about the soundtrack at all to be honest. It did it it's job, I suppose. It wasn't exactly memorable. However, the animal sound effects are good, as they should be. No problems here, but the soundtrack of the anime is it's weakest point.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rather simple, a boy, a studious and urban child, attends a rural agricultural high school. Little does he realize, he's in way over his head. Hijinks ensue. But the point of Gin no Saji isn't to tell an astounding story, it's about the lessons we learn alongside Hachiken. He learns about the brutal realities of farm life for the livestock and the farmers. He learns about responsibility. He even learns a little but about love. \\n\\n\r\nIt's through these lessons that Gin no Saji shows itself to be a very special anime. Personally, I find Hachiken to be very relatable. I wasn't good for much other than memorizing facts and doing tests in school either. I don't know anything about working on a farm or taking care of animals or growing crops. For me, it was like I was right there beside Hachiken, learning about the world and agriculture with him. That is exactly what makes Hachiken such an effective protagonist. A good story, but not all, requires an ignorant character through which the audience can learn more about the world the story presents. It's immersive and informative. The rest of the cast is entertaining. None of the secondary characters were grating or annoying to me. Not all of the characters are explored in that great of depth, but we do gain significant insight into their lives. Ichiro's character probably had the most interesting development of the other characters, but I don't want to spoil too much. I'll just say I loved the characters. Hachiken Yuugo is an excellent protagonist, and he is one of my favorites in all anime.\\n\\n\r\nDoes it present an accurate interpretation of farm life? I don't know, I'm just a city boy. But I've heard that lots of what the anime shows us is very accurate. Hiromu Arakawa was raised on a dairy farm after all, and we follow characters in the dairy sciences program. I'm inclined to say, yes, this story presents entirely plausible and realistic situations.\\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, I enjoyed this anime immensely. It's some of the best fun I've had watching anything. It's also very touching at times, and even a little sad. It's a story about growing up. It's a story about living life. Life is gonna have its ups and downs and it'll be a confusing, tiring, exciting ride. Gin no Saji conveys such a powerful sense of being alive (it's difficult to put into words). I don't know, I loved every second of this anime. I think it's a masterpiece of the slice of life genre and it's one of the best anime I've ever seen.",

            "content": "Note: This is a SPOILER FREE review! Feel free to read without worries : ).\r\nMost bless Hiromu Arakawa for her work on Fullmetal Alchemist yet never really jump too often near \"Silver Spoon\".Arakawa was actually raised on a dairy farm so seeing what she often experienced through the lens of fiction had me very excited to check this series out.\r\nNo, this isn't the story about two brothers trying to regain their bodies back in a country facing disaster. Instead, welcome to a tale that spans through various seasons which plays a beautiful tone about the world of agriculture.\r\nSilver Spoon centers on Yuugo Hachiken..who doesn't reallyknow what to do with his future. He has a dad that doesn't see eye to eye with him too much and he's pretty hard on himself when it comes to reaching success! So, he transfers himself up to a farm life school to find answers.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa never ceases to amaze me with how she can make not only the characters so likeable but also managing to transfer the learning curve about farm life into something translatable. You get a sense of understanding about what it takes to make it in that type of workforce from the good days to the bad.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few little minor cons with Silver Spoon from some slow pacing to a few romantic teases that will make you yell, \"KISS ALREADY\". However, let me promise you that this story definitely doesn't let you down if you keep trucking on afterwards with the manga. This is coming from somebody who is not a heavy fan of manga: Its worth reading! Even then, the anime is so good! Its a series I'm probably going to come back to numerous times because it brings that much joy to my life.\\n\\n\r\nYou could probably nitpick too that there a few stories that feel a bit \"redundant\" like how the main characters will love to make various foods constantly. But, there is always a taste of \"new\" from how the story is being told.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Silver Spoon lives up to being a great series! There is a sense of fresh air from its atmosphere that can really attract those who want something new out of anime.",

            "content": "Born and raised in the countryside I was immediately curious when I read the synopsis of Gin no Saji. I haven\u2019t read the manga and I didn\u2019t expect too much from this, but with these low expectations I was pleasantly surprised.\r\nThe story of Gin no Saji evolves around Hachiken Yugo, a city boy who flees from his family to an agricultural school far away from the city. With his intellect and his talent in studying attending this school seems to be no problem for him, but he\u2019s proven wrong very quickly. From collecting eggs to raising a piglet until it\u2019s being sent off to theslaughterhouse; we follow Hachiken\u2019s struggle when he finds the truth of the harsh world of farming and searching for his goal, when all his new friends (mostly farmer\u2019s heirs) already have their own.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was pretty good and detailed. The food showed here makes you hungry just looking at it. The character designs were nice, with unique and funny appearances, and the animation seemed to go smoothly as well. I didn\u2019t like the opening that much, but the overall soundtrack was good and the ending theme gives off this country feel, what makes it really fitting for this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of Gin no Saji are the characters. Hachiken enters the school as an inexperienced, shy boy who knows nothing about farming, but struggles bravely with the challenges he gets thrown at him. We see him get sick when the head of a chicken gets chopped off and he gets overly attached to animals which are supposed to become food. We can all relate to at least some of his experiences. As the series continues, we see Hachiken\u2019s character grow. All other characters are interesting as well and often funny, but never too unnatural what makes them look like real people with dreams and goals.\\n\\n\r\nSitting back in my chair or lying in bed, I enjoyed every episode of Gin no Saji. The show is easy to follow with subtle psychological themes like seeing cute little animals become your food, and the question whether you should eat it or not. But along with a bunch of hilarious scenes it was a light, heartwarming and very entertaining anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe second season of Gin no Saji will be airing this Winter season and I\u2019m already looking forward to it! Since it\u2019s my first review, I\u2019m still a bit unsure about how to write them, but I hope you liked it nevertheless!",

            "content": "\"Tokiwa, how can something so tasty come out of an anus?\" - Hachiken\r\nEvery so often, we come upon an anime that isn't afraid to challenge the needs and wants of the industry. Gin no Saji, or Silver Spoon, is one such anime. It depicts the adolescent adventures of our young protagonist Hachiken who, despite having a strictly urban upbringing, decides to enrol in an agricultural school, full of budding farmers and the like.\r\nWhile the preface may seem rather dull, I cannot stress how much I came to love and adore this series. And while Hachiken may be introduced as the main character, a massive castof side characters are included in every moment just as much as him. While some may see this as a weakness, thinking something along the lines of - \"Just how much character development can be spread around in a measly 22 episodes?\" - however, I personally find that this massive cast is one of the charms of this show. Every character has their ups and downs, and this just seems to continue to add colour to an already thriving atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nIt appears that much of the more recent comedic releases rely heavily upon things like fanservice and ecchi scenes to entertain audiences. If this is what you're looking for, then I truly apologise for leading you on, as you'll find no scenes like that here, except for the pig/horse/cow variety. However, if you are looking for a truly artful comedy, one so cleverly designed as to have you laughing at the strangest things, Gin no Saji truly is the anime for you. \\n\\n\r\nFrom Hachiken's struggle in consuming eggs, to his attempted romantic advances, there is never a dull moment in this show. So in all seriousness, this truly is an anime to consider, if not an anime to watch, as a comedy like this may very well not only have you rolling around in tears of laughter, but also fundamentally challenge your outlook on food, farms, and every other aspect of life.\\n\\n",

By taking place in an agricultural school, it abandons most of the run-of-the-mill high school storylines. The main character flees his home to this farflung school for reasons that are only vaguely outlined during the show. The secondary characters are amusing, but have limited depth to them, and his love interest is almost one-dimensional. As such, this show is not really character-driven. It's about the novel new burdens of life that the protagonist has to accept at this school. If anything, the protagonist's increased understanding and respect for the foodchain becomes the main focus of the show; his own personal development doesn't seem to go anywhere. \\n\r\nGin no Saji is different enough from other high-school series to warrant a viewing, but it doesn't excel in any specific respect. It is mildly amusing and just interesting enough to keep you going from one episode to the next.",

Unknowingly, this series provided entertainment and the humor is unique and entertaining. I thought that it all comes down to that, but there's more. The characterization is outstanding and you can see wellthe character development throughout the series. In this anime, you get to watch the characters work hard for their dreams, not a bunch of boobs and pantyshots. I related to the main protagonist Hachiken's situation and problem, for my parents often criticized my grades, flaws, and inability to do something. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this series is a masterpiece. Hiromu Arakawa never failed me.\\n",

            "content": "*Spoiler free review:*\r\nIf you are looking for genuine life advice and motivation, or maybe you are looking for a good laugh, you may even just be looking for some time to pass. I can safely say that this anime is HIGHLY recommended to you. No matter who you are, anime fan or not, you can learn something from this anime. I was hesitant at first, going into the first episode my first impression was \"ey, this art style kinda looks like full metal alchemist, I had no idea what I was getting into to be honest. I don't really read summaries or reviews before watchingor reading a new series. I like coming into a show with a fresh mindset, and that's what I did, and oh boy did I not expect to come eyes with one of my new favourite anime. (I'll try to keep this short) (ILL TRY!!).\\n\\n\r\nStory: (8)\\n\r\nThe story is great, it's not your generic slice of life anime rather a story about trail and error, facing hardships in life, making though life decisions and with great comedy at that. I found myself agreeing, surprised and overall laughing and having a great time, the story really put me in a inspirational and great mood. It's another one of those \"Oh SNAP, I couldn't stop watching\" type of series. \"Don't watch at bed-time on a weekday if you treasure your sleep and don't like being fatigued in class or work\". If you are anything like me, then you would not of been able to keep yourself away and sat up all night ruining your whole day for the sake of another anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (8)\\n\r\nThe art is good, I love the characters and environment, it's not my favourite art style but I grew to like it as the show progressed, the animation isn't breath taking either, but it does the job, it's a well put together anime, therefore the art is a strong 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound: (8)\\n\r\nI'm not an expert of sound, but I can easily differentiate from good quality anime and bad quality anime just from it's audio samples. The voice acting is decent, the animal sounds are good and he overall sounds are good, apart from that there isn't really anything that stands out except for the ED which I really enjoyed and was looking forward to through out every episode. (I'm usually a big fan of Ending Songs).\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: (8)\\n\r\nI really loved the character development in this one, I'v said this in another review before but I really look for characters that stand out and leave impressions in anime, it's something I sought after.\\n\r\nAll the characters really did leave a good impression on me, they all have unique interesting personalities that each shine in their own ways. It's hard to get bored with all of these awesome personalities on your screen.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (10)\\n\r\nIt's been a long long time since an anime made me feel this enjoyed, It's been a while since i'v been motivated and just overall felt good about watching an anime. Not only was it educational but it was funny too, which really lifts my mood. I did not expect to laugh so hard to the jokes that were cracked in the anime, maybe it's just me that have a weird sense of humour but I doubt that as I laugh together with people all the time, and If this anime makes me laugh, I'm sure it will make you laugh too, It's really hard not to ( I'm being serious here ). \\n\\n\r\nOverall: (9)\\n\r\nA strong 9, I'd like to give it more, but In the end it's no Akira or Made in abyss we are talking about here, it's not a Ghibli movie either. It's a good slice of life comedy anime with good education value and life advice. ( That was a weird sentence, lol ). But yeah, recommend this to anyone anime fan or not, worth your time, maybe you will learn something useful?\\n\\n\r\nSorry for grammatical errors, I'm confident in my use of grammar, but then again I always hurriedly type down these review because that's what I do. Hope they did not throw you off my review and hope you found it helpful. ( It's easy to make errors ). I'm only human after-all, \"we all make mistakes, it's inevitable, the only time you can't afford to make mistakes is when lives are at stake\".\\n\\n\r\nYou will appreciate that last sentence a lot more after watching the show!",

It has a very good balance, bringing comedy and romance at the right time. Its creator is Hiromu Arakawa, a legend of Japan and creator of the famous work Fullmetal Alchemist, making the plot of Gin in the Saji a true peculiarity. So there is not much to talk about in your storyline or even the mistakes, as it shows very well how the farms are and how a resident of a big city is amazed at how scary andfun agriculture can be.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Gin no Saji has a good animation, because the movement of the characters and animals in the work are excellent. The scenery is very well detailed, as well as bringing an air of farms and far away places. It does not have many perceptible errors, what makes of the work one of the best animations of the time. The studio is A-1 Pictures, a real machine to make great quality anime and was what was expected of Gin in Saji, without mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is not very present and they are not remarkable, but they combine very well with the scenes, we have to forgive because it is a slice of life anime, so we can not depend on an excellent soundtrack\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: By its creator Arakawa, obviously the trait of the characters are the same of Fullmetal Alchemist (for those who read the manga, because the Bones studio fled a little of the art of the manga). They are very cool and charismatic, the protagonist Hachiken has a good development, each one has its own importance and we also identify with all of them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: It is a work with many positive points, making it a great anime to watch and brighten your Sunday. It has a good soundtrack and its scenery is not to be desired with many well-designed details. The story has a perfect gender balance, which is to be expected from Hiromu Arakawa, who always brings a comedy above average and at the right moments. Its main purpose is very well accomplished by showing the life of a farmer and his routine, a plus point to watch. Basically this is a different anime and nothing clich\u00e9.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW COVERS BOTH  SEASONS OF GIN NO SAJI\r\n   Did you know that Fullmetal Alchemist is not Hiromu Arakawa's only work? Because it sure doesn't seem like it. So many people loved FMA but the thought of watching other anime adaptations from the same author's works never crossed their minds. Everything else she has made is so overshadowed it's not even funny. Well, in hopes of changing that, I'm going to tell you about Silver Spoon, which is based on her most recent manga with the same name.Silver Spoon is the exact opposite of Fullmetal Alchemist, it is a slice of life comedy with elements of romance and a particular take on the school genre. This is because \"Rather than writing another fantasy series like Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa wanted to challenge herself by trying a more realistic story with Silver Spoon\" (From Hiromu Arakawa's Wikipedia page). Instead of sticking to a proven-to-work formula, Silver Spoon is the work of a passionate mangaka who is not afraid of experimenting with concepts she has never delved into before, resulting in a show that is clearly more than just the typical boring RomCom slice of life.\\n\\n\r\n   The story follows Yugo Hachiken, a teenager who was not able to score grades high enough to enroll in his parents' university of choice. His dad reacted extremely negatively to this, and Hachiken, tired of the constant pressure to have amazing grades, decides to join a school dedicated to agriculture and areas related to it. There he learns what it means to live in the world of agriculture.\\n\\n\r\n   Sounds boring, doesn't it? The reason for that is that there are very few stories that deal with normal, everyday life. It is, in fact, hard to make an interesting story out of such concepts, and most writers are not skilled enough to deal them, and so they add something to spice things up. However, this is not the case with Silver Spoon. There is no need for fanservice or flashy visuals. Instead, Silver Spoon's strength is in its characters. Yes, the show can be boring at times due to lack of cool action fights or complex sci fi worlds, but Silver Spoon is not about keeping the viewer on the edge of his seat all the time. Instead, it keeps us interested simply by having a setting that feels plausible, and characters that feel real. No heroes, villains, geniuses, psychopaths or any other archetypes. Just regular teenagers, living their normal life (though the quirkiness of an agricultural school limits the term \"normal\" a bit). But normal isn't always boring. Everyone living person has dreams and ambitions, as well as their own personal struggles. And the same can be said about most everyone in Silver Spoon. MOST everyone. Unfortunately, so many characters are introduced on the span of 22 episodes that it becomes near impossible to flesh out each of them. These underdeveloped characters are sadly what brings this show down. Silver Spoon could've beneffited drom introducing less characters, or from having double the episodes per season.\\n\\n\r\n   Moving onto the story, Silver Spoon is a strict slice of life, and focuses entirely on the everyday life of the people in the school. The first episodes are interesting and different enough from other slice of life to grab your interest. During the introduction, the show does a good job with presenting many of the students, each of them have different reasons for joining that school and have interest in a specific area of the agricultural life. This gives them a distinct personality as well as opportunities to interact and talk to Hachiken, while explaining how the school works.\\n\\n\r\n   As the show progresses, we are presented with a lot of situations that make Hachiken, and even the viewer, question their way of seeing things. He is faced with the problems like the killing of farm animals for mankind's convenience. He also has to deal with his own personal struggles, like his relationship with his parents, and even later on in the second season he ends up falling in love with a girl he is friends with. Although shown in a light fashion, these themes are a good addition to the show, and help Hachiken grow as a person.\\n\\n\r\n   Not a lot can be said about the ending of the anime, since the manga is still ongoing, but there are various unresolved conflicts that deserve exploration, hinting that a third season might be on the works. My only problems with the story by the end of the second season were that some arcs felt like a bit of a waste of time, especially during the episodes the blond snob girl is introduced. Time that could've been used to flesh out previously introduced characters.\\n\\n\r\n   For an anime that aired during 2013/2014, the visuals are pretty good, which is to be expected from A-1 Pictures. The animation is fluid, and didn't have any noticeable quality drops. The farm animals and the backgrounds in particular looked very detailed.\\n\\n\r\n  Sound-wise, they did a decent job with the voice actors, they fit the characters they played for the most part, and again, special attention was paid to the animals, they sounded very realistic. Soundtrack, for the most part, fit the setting of the anime, and the intro and outro songs in particular will still be enjoyable well after finishing the show.\\n\\n\r\n   Overall, despite having some weak characters and not always being consistent with the plot, Silver Spoon was made with passion, which is noticeable throughout its duration of 22 episodes. It has a strong cast to which you can relate to, charming visuals, and due to its unusual setting, it deals with themes relating to the agricultural world that are not often found anywhere else. It is highly recommended for people who like slice of life anime and are interested in checking out other works from the writer of Fullmetal Alchemist.",

            "content": "Ever wondered what you should do with your life? \r\nThe sheer pressure of making something worthwhile of one's life has probably hit many of us at least one point in life. Maybe that's why Hachiken's struggle hits so close to home.\r\nMaybe that's also why I quickly marathoned every episode hoping that he would find his answer by the end of it all. Though following his journey I together with him discovered that there's other important things that requires your attention and that if you don't force it, the answer will surely come one day. If you think too much about it, you will miss alot of fun things that you will never be able to get back.\\n\\n\r\nSilver spoon is a light hearted SOL that is fitting for everyone, whether you are interested in agriculture or not the way it present itself to the viewer makes it really interesting. \\n\\n\r\nTogether with its seemingly large cast it makes for a hilarious trip through its 12 episodes. It's difficult to not like every single one of them and to certain degrees emphatize with their struggles because it feels so real.\\n\\n\r\nThough a lot happens through the episodes, plot wise not a lot develops and by the end of it, everyone is basically the same. But that's ok, because the charm is the humor, characters and overall light hearted tone that makes Silver spoon a fun, heart warming ride. While you won't come out as a new person after watching it, you will hopefully end it with a smile on your face just like I did as you click on season 2. \\n",

            "content": "This was for me a very interesting and enjoyable story line. This anime had the focus on the farming element while developing the characters and there relationships. It as very innocent in many way and fun in it uniqueness. It kept the viewer engaged through both drama and comedy and very light heart-ed romance. It struck a good balance between these element to make the story very engaging.\r\nThe art was nice. There was no issue that stood out and it was pleasant to watch.  The sound was good the intro music I found enjoyable and overall the audio in the series was good. \r\nThecharacter make up was good. Having a nice mix of personality types and not an heavy overbearing main character elements. Some of the side character didn't really get that much screen time which is a shame but does not detract from the story at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a very enjoyable series for me. It had a unique story and interesting character. Telling a fun and comedy filled plot in a all 11 episodes. I would recommend it to any one who wants a different slice of life anime with no desire for ecchi stuff.",

            "content": "This review is spoiler free\r\nStory: 8\r\nThe anime follows a city boy's school life as he tries to assimilate into an environment completely new to him, exploring themes such as realisation of the things people take for granted, lack of direction in life and personal morals. Though it sounds very cliched and somewhat disheartening/depressing, this anime in contrast is very mellow and light-hearted and is filled with heart warming moments and humour.\r\nEven though I gave the story a 9 it does not mean it is particularly unique, however the execution and pacing is superb. The flow throughout the series very consistent and you'll unlikely find periodswhere you lose focus. The anime keeps it's direction and rarely sidetracks or forces cliched or stereotypical scenes and/or interactions between characters to occur.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  9\\n\r\nThe strongest point regarding this anime (in my opinion) and is what carries the relatively straightforward plot to awesomeness. Characters here are well rounded and have many facets to their personality, usually behaving how you'd expect them to (though this does not by any means mean that they are predictable). Comedic and over the top reactions as you would expect in any comedy/slice of life anime can be found here too though the anime will not overuse this to the point it becomes stale.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast size is reasonable and there is plenty of interactions and conversations between them to create a feeling that the anime actually takes place within a somewhat populated area (of course it has to, it's a school!). By this I do not mean the main characters give a passing comment frequently, but the side characters are well involved with the story and have a fair share in screen time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe art here is not one of the best out there or so brilliant that it's dazzling but in conjunction with other aspects of this anime it is very well done. It to a certain degree is realistic (no i don't mean it like like real life). Characters are mostly drawn such that they reflect their personality but is not done over the top such as the thickheaded class clown guy looking like a crazy nut who was dropped on their head as a baby. This being said, there are eccentric looking characters scattered here and their but they mainly serve as comedy relief or support for the main character and don't get as much focus or screen time.\\n\r\nScenery and colours used here reflect the mood well, usually bright and warm to add the the relaxing mood but when necessary it will adapt to more serious scenes.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nThe voice acting and music throughout the anime was close to seamless. Dialogue flowed smoothly and consistently (much thanks goes to realism in character personality and interaction) and background music added significantly to the mellow atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nI don't particularly like to make mention of the opening or ending songs as I don't believe they should impact on the quality of the anime itself and how enjoyable it was.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nI'll admit i didn't expect a whole lot when i first started watching this anime. I thought it would be a typical episodic anime without any direction or character dept or development but boy was I wrong. Following the main character's train of thought really makes you think about yourself as it's easy to be immersed in his way of thinking and the things that troubles him can easily be related to by just about anyone. \\n\\n\r\nI strongly urge (and hope) that you consider watching this or at least give 2 episodes a shot.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Before I get into this review, I should warn folks that this series may not be for everyone as it is a slice-of-life title, a far cry from Hiromu Arakawa's previous hit title Fullmetal Alchemist. In addition, aspects of the farming lifestyle it explores such as animals giving birth and the slaughtering of animals for food may not be pleasant for some sensitive viewers. If you're expecting the grand plot and action that FMA delivered with this title or something clean with its content, I would strongly suggest you do not look into Silver Spoon any further. However if you enjoy slice-of-life titles or arelooking for a title that is different from the norm compared to many recent anime offerings, this could be the title for you.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Spoon focuses on high school student Yugo Hachiken who enrolls at an agricultural school in the countryside and finds himself adjusting to the rather different environment he is living in as he was living in Sapporo before moving to the boonies. The series mixes around comedy and drama as Hachiken adjusts to his new living environment, befriends students at the school and tries to determine what he hopes to get out of his learning. A good amount of the comedy from the series comes from Yugo's reactions to the farming environment that he is mostly alien to and some of the seemingly eccentric quirks to his classmates brought about from having experienced farming their entire life. The comedy to this mostly delivered well for me mostly since it felt natural in the adjustment to a different lifestyle that Hachiken had to adjust to, though some of the comedic bits do usually fall flat or feel overused.\\n\\n\r\nThe drama from Silver Spoon comes from Hachiken and his classmates learning from one another throughout their ordeals at the agricultural school. Hachiken comes to understand the rigorous work and tough decisions that many of the students have to make in order to maintain their way of life. In return, Hachiken's outsider perspective on farming, as he comes to learn more about it, lead his classmates to consider aspects of their regular routines that they took for granted as they considered them natural due to being brought up on them their entire lives. Hachiken and several of the students get their characters fleshed out so we get to learn more about their family lives and what they hope to gain through their learning at the agricultural school. The farming elements to the series (riding horses, selling and raising animals for meat or produce, being up early to care for farming duties, etc...) are believably portrayed thanks to Arakawa's own personal upbringing of living on a dairy farm growing up, an aspect that anime fans who live on farms could possibly relate with. The series lacks a proper ending as its source material is still ongoing, though a second season of Silver Spoon has since been made and I look forward to adding it to my physical collection of anime whenever Aniplex releases it.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the scenery for this sports vivid color and a good amount of detail showing off its rural settings and even having realistically-drawn animals, with some occasions they are rendered in super-deformed design for comedic gags. The character designs are nothing out of the ordinary, though they are reasonably detailed and there is variety in how characters are drawn. The animation is also a bit on the subpar side at points, though it isn't really the prominent element of Silver Spoon. The music for the series consists of a laid-back and mellow soundtrack that is fitting for its intended focus on rural life.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Spoon won't be for everyone thanks to its slice-of-life genre and focusing on a theme that would seem to appeal to a niche audience. Still, it believably portrays the rigorous work and tough decisions that a farming lifestyle brings to those who experience it and Hachiken's role as observer to it make it an engaging experience as he comes to deal with the everyday challenges that farming brings to the students at the agriculture school. The series is definitely worth a look if you like slice-of-life, live life in the boonies or are looking for something out of the ordinary for an anime title.\\n",

            "content": "Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n\u201cDamn rooster,\u201d you think, as you wake up, wiping goop from your eyes. It\u2019s only four in the morning, and yet, you\u2019ve got the stables to clean, the pigs to feed, the cows to milk, eggs to collect, and man, does your life suck.\r\nBut you start to realize that by working so hard, you\u2019ve become the tough and caring person you are today. You\u2019re shaped by what\u2019s around you in this world, come hell or high water. Hiromu Arakawa, the mangaka behind the critically acclaimed, \u201cFullmetal Alchemist,\u201d has made the perfect story of demonstrating this effect.\r\n\u201cGin no Saji,\u201d or \u201cSilver Spoon\u201d as translated in English,is a Slice of Life/Comedy-Drama about a young man\u2019s experiences with his classmates and his newfound farm life after he enrolls in Yezo High, an agricultural high school. \\n\\n\r\n--this review is SPOILER free, contains a tl;dr, and IS for both seasons--\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nWhat better way to explore the themes of life and growth than with life itself? \\n\\n\r\nI know what you\u2019re thinking, but this series does something a little different than the usual SoL/Comedy-Drama, which makes the aforementioned idea of life being explored with the use of life itself completely applicable. Instead of some generic high-school setting that we\u2019ve seen more than a thousand times, the characters are living in an incredibly unique backdrop; an agricultural school, filled with cattle, combines, and corn. I\u2019ve never seen a setting such as this, they grow and harvest crops, they take care of animals, milk cows, ride horses, the whole nine yards.\\n\\n\r\nGiven Arakawa\u2019s track record, she knows how to handle her storytelling, and Silver Spoon is no exception. Immediately, it delves into the hardships of farm life and the both physical and emotional tolls people who live said lives have to pay. From getting up early in the morning just to work yourself half to death, to seeing an animal you grew attached to and spent countless hours raising get sent to the slaughterhouse. There\u2019s even cows\u2026\\n\\n\r\n\u2026giving birth. In great detail.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy.\\n\\n\r\nThese happenings within the very simple story of Silver Spoon serve doubly as both comedic relief and harsh characterization. The characters grow as people through the difficult missions they\u2019re tasked with and the environment they\u2019re surrounded by. While the series is filled with comedy, (and this time around with Arakawa\u2019s story, it doesn\u2019t feel out of place or interrupt story flow, most likely due to the flexible setting) there\u2019s quite a lot of crushingly realistic problems in the story which are never handled immaturely, such as animal euthanization and entire families in debt. It genuinely affects the people in the series, from initial reactions, to how they end up coping with their problem. It takes time, effort, and resources to live even the simplest of lives, and equally so with farming.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even though the mangaka grew up on a dairy farm, it\u2019s obvious through the amount of various information on animals and the food industry that she did not skip doing her extended research. There\u2019s a vast array of trivia throughout the series (usually revealed through dialogue) about chromosomes, animal cloning, food production, breeding, and much more that has to do with the harshness of the farming industry. \\n\\n\r\nSo, as far as subtle growth through life experiences and hardship goes, this series is almost unmatched. There\u2019s just one, glaring problem.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nWe got another go read the manga ending? Dammit.\\n\\n\r\nThis series technically concludes, but given where and how, (as well as the entire setting anyway) there is SO much more room for more. As far as I know, there is no third season, and this is beyond unfortunate, because it feels like there is a lot of completely unused potential. We\u2019re left on an anticlimactic note; with no actual closing statement to any of these character\u2019s lives. So unless we get that third cour, this story isn\u2019t really over enough to be anything truly brilliant. But with what was given to us, we did get some absolutely amazing, emotional, and downright pure reality. \\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nThere\u2019s something this story is before anything else. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s character driven. \\n\\n\r\nYugo Hachiken is the protagonist of the story. He came to Yezo a bespectacled introvert, obsessed with his ability to conquer everyone around him academically. A person like him obviously does not initially enjoy his newfound country life, but it\u2019s that realism throughout the series that causes him to grow in many different ways.  \\n\\n\r\nThrough Hachiken\u2019s experiences on the farm, his friends become his extended family, and his entire outlook changes as he realizes that it\u2019s not about status or superiority over others; but the bonds you share with them, and the path you take in life while admiring the small things, and your endless options. Options you have to earn to get to.\\n\r\nHe comes out a hardworker, with only the well-beings of his friends on his mind, even if there are a few screw-ups along the way, but who doesn\u2019t mess up? That\u2019s his humanity speaking for itself, it takes a long time for people to truly change, and when the journey is portrayed in the way it is here, there\u2019s no room for disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nFor the other characters, we have Mikage Aki, the \u201cgirl next door,\u201d and quite possible Hachiken\u2019s romantic interest in the series. She loves horses, (what girl doesn\u2019t love horses these days in the teen drama, right?) and is living at her parent\u2019s ranch. Then there\u2019s Ichiro; a farm boy whose only dream is to make it to baseball\u2019s big leagues and support his farm with the money he earns. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other various characters as well, and to be quite honest, a lot of them are extremely stereotypical. The over-protective dad, the supportive teacher, the goofball, the list goes on. But it\u2019s their chemistry as regular, everyday people that make their interactions work. Silver Spoon prides itself on how the characters learn that they need to persevere to be, both for themselves and those around them, thinking both in the moment to the future, but never to the past. It is here and now that we need to be living in; as we won\u2019t get anything done otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nTheir interactions; both the humorous ones and the realistic ones, are what really make the series priceless. Sometimes it\u2019s adorable. And sometimes, it pulls at your heartstrings, and the transitions are never off-handed. It\u2019s easily shown that the most effort was put into the cast.\\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Amazing- --\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nThe look of the series is actually very well done, the smoothness of everything fits perfectly and the style is extremely \u201cfriendly,\u201d if I can put it that way. The character designs and detailed background artwork is all very inviting and pleasant to look at. There\u2019s also a lot of color and detail in both the food and the foliage around the school.\\n\\n\r\nEven if the characters stand around a lot, (which makes for a lot frames with nothing but moving lips) the series isn\u2019t supposed to be action oriented. Though, it would have been nice to have some movement, and\u2026\\n\\n\r\nNo they didn\u2019t\\n\\n\r\nOh shit that\u2019s\\n\\n\r\nWHY?\\n\\n\r\nCOMIC SANS? REALLY? They translate all of the Japanese credits into English using COMIC SANS? F***!\\n\\n\r\nAnd what\u2019s up with the CG animals? I\u2019m done complaining about 3D, it is now something I must accept with grace, but geez.\\n\r\nSo overall, the look of the anime is very nice and clean, even with the manure. \\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUND---\\n\r\nI was waiting to get here, for one reason. At first, the soundtrack didn\u2019t sound that great, until I realized one thing.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s all country. \\n\\n\r\nDid you HEAR me? Japanese Country! I\u2019ve never ever heard of these things being combined before, and for the series, both openings, (\u201cLIFE\u201d by Fujifabric and \u201ckiss you\u201d by MIWA) have the same sound-dynamics and instrument usage of traditional Bluegrass/Country, with Japanese vocals. \\n\\n\r\nRegardless of taste, for the series, it fits EXTREMELY well. For the actual soundtrack, there\u2019s a lot of woodwind and piano that also fits with the welcoming atmosphere. Also, what\u2019s that instrument? That\u2019s commonly used in Pokemon games?\\n\\n\r\nSpecifically the third generation?\\n\\n\r\nTrumpets. Lots of trumpets. \\n\r\n---Sound Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS: \\n\r\n-\tExtremely realistic story, with perfectly placed drama that causes characters to mature as human beings, and learn valuable life lessons\\n\r\n-\tRefreshing comedy that fits into the story like a puzzle piece\\n\r\n-\tSubtle but brilliant transformation of the main character, fantastic interactions and chemistry within the cast\\n\r\n-\tInformative about the harshness of the food industry\\n\r\n-\tTouchingly mature, and one of a kind setting\\n\r\n-\tAmazing, unique and fitting soundtrack\\n\r\n-\tSolid animation\\n\r\n-\tI\u2019m putting this here because it\u2019s downright RARE to see in anime; it is actually very \u201cclean\u201d. There is a little bit of innuendo (and cow porn mags) but to be honest that is nothing out of the ordinary for a PG movie. If possible, this series is perfect for a family\\n\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n-\tYou know at the end of it all it isn\u2019t action oriented or \u201cexciting,\u201d so many viewers may not see it as entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\r\n-\tLack of a definite conclusion makes the already good series feel it holds baggage of wasted potential. \\n\r\n-\tDoesn\u2019t go to lengths to flesh out as many characters as it could have with the setting\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Amazing-\\n\r\nSo for those of you who really want a simple story of self-discovery, hard work, and perseverance, Silver Spoon is absolutely for you. It\u2019s cute at times, and incredibly sad at others. It is life in a nutshell. \\n\\n\r\nFans of Arakawa\u2019s work may be a bit put off to the incredibly different setting and story from FMA, but she further shows her prowess as a brilliant storyteller. I look forward to a possible third cour. \\n\\n\r\nSilver Spoon gets a 9 from me, good job!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Most mediums of storytelling tend to focus on Urban and suburban life. The life of farming is usually an unwanted bore. Not only because stories are rarely told in this setting, but because when I say I'm in real country land people usually comment about how boring that must be. \r\nSo I was pleasantly surprised upon hearing about Silver Spoon (AKA Gin no Saji). Especially since it would focus on a school that actually taught agricultural studies. Where it would focus on the animals, science, and such of farming. From large scale setups to small family ones. I was mainly curious to see the similaritiesto dissimilarities  of Japan and USA farming. (Though I didn't see it addressed that limited space means Japan uses a lot of high tech things to utilize space. No open range farming, which I'm used to.) I also like that they address bacteria, regulations, and disease as important parts of farming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's very similar. And I found very few errors. (Though the should emphasis that when dealing with pigs or hogs you do not get friendly. A neighbor got mauled by her seemingly sweet pig. She lost her thumb, part of her thigh, and calf. If she hadn't been wearing sweats by accident she would have had her leg severed. It's not an uncommon thing. An aunt had a chunk bit out of her thigh. And the hog farms literally have signs warning you about pig mauling.) As a chicken farmer I was bummed about not focusing more on them, but that's just preference. (Though I've never seen an egg come out wet before. Maybe they were trying to emphasize that the egg is briefly soft before the air hardens it?) It was really fun getting some city views. Like the egg does come out of the cloaca, which shares it's purpose with pooping. \\n\\n\r\nI adored the characters! From Hachiken who was just learning about animals and farming, to the experienced heirs to their family farms. I loved how each character developed and added to the story. The romance isn't the main focus it accompanies the story of Hachicken learning about agriculture. (To be honest it's more of a one sided crush.) \\n\\n\r\nI loved that it even brought focus on the ethical questions of livestock. They're not pets and one can get numb to the fact that their lives are short as they become food. If chickens don't lay, food. If a cow gets injured it's cheaper to put them down. Handling and livestock is constantly handling lives. I enjoyed that Hackiken's newness to the concept brought up a lot of questions. For those used to the idea and such. Even how vets have to make tough calls about healing an animal and knowing when to put them down. Even briefly touching on slaughter houses.\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who lives around farms and has helped as a farmhand I enjoyed it. Especially since my chickens are pets and I like them to retire into ripe old ages. I've dealt with the reality of having to put down a loved one because of illness. \\n\\n\r\nDon't worry though, the majority of the story is very heart warming. It focuses on the dreams and goals of it's characters. I also enjoyed that while there is a certain comfort to being an heir, a lot of times it's the only options. Most farmers do not make a lot of money. I'm curious if they'll ever address the restrictions of the government on forming. The story did touch lightly on large scale and small scale farming. \\n\\n\r\nI really liked the look of the art, especially when it came to the animals. They were still anime cute, while being realistic. Especially when they were meat. ^_- The scenery is gorgeous and I think it captured the look and feel of farming beautifully. \\n\\n\r\nI like that the arc of this season's story was wrapped up. So even if a season 2 had not come out we'd have some closure. I love the characters and look forward to them. I can't wait to see what the next season brings. What animals will be focused on. Not to mention what will happen to the many shiny eyed, and hopeful, characters the next season. I enjoyed that I spent most of the time smiling during Silver Spoon. But I still got teary eyed despite knowing how things go the way of the slaughter house. Well done.",

            "content": "''Gin no Saji: Harvest Moon Nostalgia!''\r\nGin no Saji, or Silver Spoon is an experimental series for me. and i was surprised that this series amuse me a lot\r\nsure it has flaws, but a good anime doesn't mean it's got to be flawless, right?\r\nStory 8/10\r\nThe story revolves all around Hachiken Yugo, who's without any goals, attend the agricultural school just to escape from his parents. Apparently his parent are so damn strict so..yeah it's predictable.\r\nAnd so he's struggling at the school, which is of course contradicts with his daily lives in city. but luckily, he's surrounded with a lot of great guys, most of them comesfrom farmer's family, to help him deal with chickens, pigs and cows.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Gin no Saji's story amuse me is, execpt Hachiken, all the students there seems to have their own aspiration, Hachiken, with lack of ambitions, learn that sooner or later he's got to find his own goals. And also apparently, he's in crush with Mikage, cute member of the equestrian club, which encourage Hachiken to join the club, too.\\n\\n\r\nAnd i guarantee that Gin no Saji has a very good comedy side, like when Hachiken realize that egg come from chicken's anus, and refused to eat them for a while. So lives in Gin no Saji is never getting so bored after all, and that's a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nIf you looked at my profile page, it's clear that i'm fans of KyoAni. I won't say that Gin no Saji has a very bad art, it's good, natural and acceptable, but just that. Well at least everything looks fluid, although i'll be happier if the background (mostly farm and livestocks) could be brighter. Hope that the 2nd season could be better though..\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nProbably the weakest aspect of Gin no Saji. The OP and ED is impressive, but the background sound? it's utterly suck. I expected daily farm-feel on the background sound, but what i found is just medicore Slice of Life-feel. Well it's SOL show but it won't fit the story that's has a lot of\\n\r\npotential, though. dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nThis is the strongest point of Gin no Saji. I love to see Hachiken developed over time as he struggling with the new world that actually don't fit on him. And his contradicts background lives with his friend makes him so different in terms of treat the animals in the school, which is\\n\r\nshown greatly episode by episodes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10\\n\r\nI'm fans of high quality artworks, and it's a shame that i can't enjoy much aesthetics stuff from Gin no Saji. But the lack of great art is perfectly coverd with great story. The comedies is fresh, and it's somehow, remind me of Harvest Moon, on of my favorite game ever!\\n\\n\r\nOf course Gin no Saji has a lot of potential and i'm really expecting a lot of surprising stuff shown in the 2nd season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nThere's not much to say in the end. I would say that Gin no Saji is a very promising series and the sequel is what i anticipated the most. i expecting a \\n\r\nbit romcom between Hachiken and Mikage, but just don't too much drama of course. Life can be hard, especially in farm. But hard things always come along with fun things too.\\n\\n\r\n''It's okay to run away in order to live. It's entirely okay!''",

Thus, I\u2019d make this review clear-cut as to why this Anime is very interesting: \r\n1. Hachiken\u2019s life is so realistic that can be related at some points such as the indecisiveness on the future goal, the difficulty of suddentransformation from urban lifestyle to agricultural lifestyle, the fun of having friends being around, the joy of hardworking and so on. \\n\r\n2. The author, Hiromu Arakawa has done a lot of research regarding the agricultural practices, especially related to livestock farming. Besides being able to enjoy Anime, it is no doubt that we get to know some knowledge and techniques on how modern agriculture works. \\n\r\n3. Seeing how food can be so delicious with freshly collected ingredients in their own farm, it makes you wanna have a life like that just because of the tasty food. \\n\r\n4. On top of that, the beautiful OPT and EDT are really well-suited for the Anime by adding refreshing flavours to the Anime. \\n\r\n5. But most importantly, the Anime may not make you laugh out loud, but it will certainly put a smile on your face after each episode without realising it. Why can I be so confident about this? Experience it yourself and try to prove me wrong if you can :P \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, if you ever find yourself liking it afterwards, I have a good news, season 2 is there for you :) \\n",

            "content": "Months ago, I watched the first half of the first episode of this anime, and I decided to invest my time in something else, because what could be interesting about farming? \r\nHaving finished season 1, I couldn't be happier that I decided to take it up again.\r\nSilver Spoon follows Hachiken, a high school boy who finds himself in a situation that many of us can relate to on a very personal level. He feels directionless in life, doesn't know what he wants to do with himself, so he makes the decision to attend a farming boarding school out in the country, despite having no particularinterest in the field.\\n\\n\r\nIf one thing in Silver Spoon stuck out to me, it was how it looks at life. Watching the series feels like receiving a life lesson from your wise old grandfather. And Hachiken, being possibly one of the most realistic and relate-able characters in anime, is a character you can seamlessly put yourself in the shoes of. \\n\\n\r\nAs the show goes on, an overarching theme is that of death and the cycle of life. Our MC finds himself getting to attached to baby pig, after he decides to name it, knowing that it is born and raised for slaughter. As we watch this pig grow, we're confronted with extremely profound questions. Things like, if he was born for slaughter, what is the point of his life at all? Watching this, and all the other things going on around the farm school, really shows us how interconnected the cycle of life is.\\n\\n\r\nRather than just giving us a simple message of \"Be a vegetarian\", this mundane sounding issue delivers an amazingly profound message about life. But at the same time, it doesn't just shove its morals in our face. In all the lessons Hachiken learns throughout each episode, we often feel just as lost as he does when faced with these dilemmas. But all in all, you walk away from season 1 feeling as though you've grown along with Hachiken.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, there are a few places where it falls short. None of these things are by any means bad, but things like the comedy and music could be better. They do their job, but they don't stand out. The side characters are good, and a select few we get to see in a deeper light, and I am hoping to see more development in season 2. The animation is rather good, and the only flaw I can point out about that, is just that it didn't do better.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Silver Spoon teaches us something about life. Not always through wise words, but through the feelings we experience along with Hachiken as he makes his way through this diverse high school life. You can always point out exactly what you've taken away from it, but no doubt, you walk away knowing more about the big picture regarding life as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nYa'll should watch this series. (But if you're touchy with animal death, be forewarned there is a bit of that. I would still recommend it to you)\\n",

            "content": "Alright, so this is an anime about the arguably harsh reality of farming and working with livestock. Gotta say, it gets points for originality right out the gate.\r\nI'm gonna start with the one and only issue I had about this anime, and that is the main character's motivation and reason for being at this agricultural school being pushed to the background. Essentially, you go into this anime knowing that the main character is out of place in this environment because of his background, but that's all you know. There's no foundation in flashback or exposition that actually makes you, as the viewer, feel that thisis an unusual situation for the main character. So, seeing this character struggle at this school doesn't really hold the same type of weight as it could had his background been expanded on. It kind of felt like the dynamic of him being a city boy in the boonies wasn't necessary. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I know that this anime is more about message than story. The overall theme of this anime is about forging one's own path and working hard to make it happen. Demonstrating that theme through an anime like this is very original and enjoyable to watch. Using animals as catalysts for real life conflicts, I think, was a great way to portray the message of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nFor what it's worth, this anime made me think, and that's probably what kept me hooked most of the time. It's hard to say what makes this anime so enjoyable to watch, especially since it doesn't really come with a lot of big plot twists or developments, but it's not an empty story. Honestly, if you're interested in this anime, give it a shot, because you might find something in it that you wouldn't expect.",

I have a very soft spot for stories about farming - the idea of connecting to the land and labor that sustain us as a therapeutic experience - but Gin no Saji captures this idea so perfectly and so sincerely. It's really, really sweet. \r\nArakawa's best known for sprawling fantasy epics like Fullmetal Alchemist, but I think it's in character-driven slice-of-life stories like this where her talents really shine; Gin no Saji is smart, funny and carefully written, able to linger on its subtle character work and thematic beats in ways somethinghuge, like Fullmetal, simply can't. There's a special and simple wisdom that comes from agriculture, with its direct connection to life (and sometimes death), that Arakawa understands intimately and expresses with loving, detailed attention here. Gin no Saji is a show as gentle-spirited and fun as it is illuminating.\\n\\n\r\nIt's also just plain cute.  The farm animals are absolutely adorable, especially the pigs and dogs - the rounded, cartoonish visual style lends itself really well to this. Though the show never lacks tension and conflict, it also never feels overly dark; its mature concerns and conflicts are managed within its lighthearted, optimistic tone.  \\n\\n\r\nIt's absolutely worth the watch, especially if you're having a hard day (or in my case, a hard several years lol).

            "content": "This review does not contain any spoilers.\r\n--Story--\r\nFirst of all, when I downloaded this anime I didn't look at the plot. I usually download animes regarding their score and genre and this looked quite good, had a good source to watch it so I decided to try it out. Watched the first episode and I was SHOCKED. \r\nIT IS AN ANIME ABOUT FARMING? I LOVE IT. Despite the fact that this anime is an, well anime, it feels beyond real and raw. I've never seen a farm or any agricultural facility in my life and this was eye opening. I knew about slaughter houses and generallybasics of farming but seeing how hard it is and how much effort and thought goes into it in the eyes of an anime is amazing. \\n\\n\r\nMy thought through out can be summed in one sentence. \"I wanna be a vegetarian but meat is just too good.\" \\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about this anime is how easy it is to relate with the main character, he is human, has feelings, doesn't have any experience with the field and he's just a teenager trying to figure out what to do with his life. He is trying to be happy and find a dream. That is so easy to relate and it makes it so easy to immediately like the guy. \\n\\n\r\nOther charecters are also well thought and has their unique personalities and you end up remembering them at the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\\n\r\nArt is in my opinion pretty generic and a style that you can see in a lot of anime series. The animals are cute, people has their unique styles and the surroundings are also good, they are not great but they are definitely not just okay either. It's enjoyable and you don't end up thinking well it could've been better which is just enough. \\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\\n\r\nExcept the opening and endings which are just fine, not memorable, the general score is also not memorable but sound is not the thing they clearly focused on and I didn't really care about it either so It's fine.\\n\\n\r\n--Final Thoughts-- \\n\\n\r\nMy overall score is going to be 8 because it's a show that I'd definitely recommend and I enjoyed it a lot. It's a nice escape from that action fantasy genre that's everywhere and classic high school slice of life romcom dramas. So if you're looking for a good enjoyable and quirky show this is your show! \\n",

            "content": "I really liked this anime. This anime made you feel a certain way. It made you get attached to the animals. I mean, THEY'RE ANIMALS FOR GOODNESS' SAKE. I'm quite surprised that I liked this anime. I'm not into agriculture, but I enjoyed this anime. The reason I watched this anime was because of an anime podcast I listened to (Anime Addicts Anonymous). This anime was included in one of their Anime Oscars, I do believe. Onto da other stuff! \r\nI really liked the way this anime looked. This was the first time that I ever saw an anime that had a look like this.Sure, the humans looked a little weird at first look, but, it grew on me. I grew to really like the way it looks. The humans may look a little weird, but the animals are ADORABLE. The calves are so cute looking. Pork Bowl as a little piglet is probably the cutest. *sniff* *sniff*\\n\\n\r\nThe story was pretty good. Well, in my opinion at least. I can't really explain why I like it, but I just do. Can't you relate? The characters were okay, a little better than mediocre. I don't think they were your \"run-of-the-mill\" characters, but they were pretty darn close to it. Mikage is just your average oblivious anime girl. Hachiken is your MC who likes the girl who is oblivious to his feelings. In this first season, Pork Bowl was my favorite character, if he even counts as one.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely LOVED the music for this anime. It really sets one into the mood that the creators probably meant the watchers to feel. The opening sounded strange at first, but it really grew on me. I liked the ending right from the start. I feel it really fits the anime as a whole.  \\n\\n\r\nThe anime was extremely enjoyable. The animals really made it very enjoyable to watch. I liked to see them every episode. I grew to look forward to it. The art made it enjoyable as well. I feel like I'm just repeating what I've already stated. Oh well. That's life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would rate this anime a nine out of ten. I would definitely recommend this anime to pretty much everyone and anyone. It's just that amazing of an anime. :D",

            "content": "January Challenge\r\nTask 1: Watch an anime from Gourmet Challenge\r\nPossible spoilers, proceed with caution. \r\nSlice of life has always been a tough genre for me to really get into. I\u2019ve probably started five or six shows and dropped them all episode three, just because I\u2019ve found them boring. Nozaki-kun I think was the first slice of life show I had finished and enjoyed. This is the one I wish I had started with. \r\nI\u2019ve grown to appreciate the \u201ccharacters doing stuff\u201d genre thanks to this. It starts off as just seeing the life of this kid going to a high school he isn\u2019t quite sure about.He meets new people and ends up enjoying his school. It\u2019s a simple enough plot, but it\u2019s feels like more than that. The characters feel more fleshed out and it had a lot of heart. \\n\\n\r\nAs I said before, the story is simple, and something we\u2019ve seen before multiple times. It\u2019s the story of Yuugo Hachiken, a kid from the city trying to escape from his parents by going to a boarding school in the middle of nowhere. He notices that everyone around him already has a Dream for what they want in life after high school, whether it be taking over the family farming business, becoming a veterinarian, or becoming a national baseball star to support their family. Yuugo on the other hand, just wants to stay away from his family and be the top student of his class. \\n\\n\r\nThere are so many things that show Yuugo\u2019s development throughout the series. He starts off as a kid who just wants to do good in all his classes, and eventually graduate. Later on, he realizes he has to take a club in order to graduate, and he chooses the equestrian club as a girl he likes is in the club. Eventually he develops a deeper love for animals, and it shows when he is helping with the pigs, and sees Pork Bowl, a weak little piglet that is in danger of getting killed for not having enough meat. Hachiken is now determined to help this little guy out, even though everyone warns him about getting too close to farm animals. \\n\\n\r\nAnother way you see Hachiken\u2019s development is through his sleep schedule. He started out by not being able to get up at 5:30 with everyone else for practicums, and woke up earlier to help with horses, and even earlier after that on his own at 3:00 to help Pork Bowl and the horses, all before breakfast. The fact that he is willing to give up this time for his school, his friends, and his animals shows how much he has grown throughout the eleven episode season. \\n\\n\r\nI think a more interesting part of the series is when Yuugo goes to stay with Mikage for the summer and works part time of her farm. He learns to deal with deaths of animals, and then the consumption of them by skinning and gutting a deer that was ran over (this sounds dark and gloomy but I promise it\u2019s more light hearted). Also, seeing Yuugo and Mikage\u2019s relationship grow over time was nice to see as well. \\n\\n\r\nI think my only main problem with the series is the use of montages towards the end. I think there were three montages towards the end of the series that felt like they were there to make you get emotional, and while the first on seemed to work, it felt manipulative once the second one came and the sad music started playing again. I just feel like it could\u2019ve worked better with a different way of getting the audience to feel emotional. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a show I see myself coming back to at some point, and I will be seeing season 2 sometime in the near future. So far the shows aired on noitaminA (the block that aired this) have done well for me. I enjoyed this and Wotakoi very much, and will definitely get to the show they\u2019re airing this winter, and might do a marathon of their shows as well.\\n",

            "content": "A review of perhaps the most Japanese show this season. This is an anime about hard work, hard work and the fruits of your labor, as well as other bits and pieces along the way. Not only is it Japanese, it\u2019s also original!\r\nWRITING (9/10)\r\n*Characters\r\nThe characters in Gin no Saji feel very real, even if a bit exaggerated as in most anime. All the characters except the main one come from rural areas, and are already familiar with the setting. They\u2019re strong, knowledgeable and know their stuff when it comes to agriculture. Tamako, for example, is a ruthless business woman but at the same time showshints of playfulness and friendliness. The main star, Hachiken, is in a position most of us have been in: wandering aimlessly without any goals or aspirations while the people around him all seem to have their futures figured out. This is what makes Hachiken relatable, he arrives at the location of the show, an agricultural school, simply to get away from his old and pointless life. What happens later is a transformation from cynical city boy to a responsible student as he rapidly learns from everything and everyone around him. He was given a fresh start in a totally different environment and as a result of that grew as a person. The large supporting cast all seem to have something to teach him, which only proves the importance of seeing a situation from different perspectives, from the eyes of others. Everyone are fun to watch and are characters you don\u2019t get bored with, all with their own quirks and talents.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall writing\\n\\n\r\nAs I said in the introduction, Gin no Saji is both original and -very- Japanese. Hachiken learns about the importance of hard work, responsibility and teamwork, which is easy to get inspired by. A teacher likens Hachiken\u2019s entry into the class to an animal from a different tribe joining a new one. He shares his own thoughts and perspectives which help the class grow and evolve as a whole, and in return receives their knowledge. Aside from being inspiring and entertaining, Gin no Saji is also educational. The viewers learn about the agricultural life, how it is to work at a farm and even brings up how little they are paid. They show how cattle are brought up, how cows are milked, how pigs make it from the pen to the slaughterhouse, etc etc. One of the longer story arcs involves Hachiken and Pork Bowl, the runt of a litter of piglets. Hachiken decides to rear Pork Bowl from the smallest pig in the litter to the same size as its siblings. Here, the show takes the opportunity to deal the themes of attachment and loss. Needless to say, it\u2019s both sad and beautiful in its own way.\\n\\n\r\nThese themes have of course been explored before, but not in such a fresh way as Gin no Saji does it. I look forward to every episode just to see what\u2019s going to happen! This show gets interesting right away, and you feel compelled to watch. Even if the events are trivial, they could be totally foreign to many of us who live in the cities. It\u2019s just such a great display of hard work, dedication, friendship and growth delivered in such a simple way that is easy to absorb and enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n*Ending\\n\\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look down on yourself for running. Make it meaningful by making something out of it.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, we see the value of the lessons Hachiken has learned, about the country life and about himself. We see how far he\u2019s come, how he now has plenty of friends and truly enjoys life at Ezonoo. The ending is left open so they\u2019ll have little issue with introducing the second season, but at the same time there is a feeling is completion. It feels like Hachiken has found his place, and even if his future is still uncertain, right now he\u2019s where he wants to be.\\n\\n\r\nAUDIO (8/10)\\n\\n\r\n* Voice Acting/Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are brought to life with fitting voices for the roles. The large and tough third year students all sounds manly and gruff, ,even with their relatively young voices. Tamako\u2019s voice adheres to her role with a hilariously mature voice and speech pattern that you really think of her as a step above all the others while Hachiken has the voice of a regular guy, with a sometimes uninterested tone which fits him well. The sounds themselves blend in well with the show. It\u2019s not easy to comment on background noises since a well-designed background should go unnoticed and blend in with the rest of the show, which is exactly what it does.\\n\\n\r\n*Music\\n\\n\r\nI give the music a high score mostly because of the outro: a catchy Japanese country tune that was well chosen. I really love when an anime decides to pick a different kind of genre for their openings and endings instead of a throwaway pop song. Good going!\\n\\n\r\nART (9/10)\\n\r\nThe campus is huge and well-drawn, with plenty of key locations and life-like details. Just looking at the equipment used in the school\u2019s facilities is educational and fascinating due to its realism. What surprised me is the light use of 3D to show the animals (mostly cows) and that they actually show plenty of blood, all in context of course. At one point, Hachiken is called upon to skin a roadkill, and a documentary details the slaughterhouse process, including draining a pig of blood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter designs are fairly normal, with some being designed in a way that complements their personality. Visual gags here are kept to a minimum and realism is the aim.\\n\\n\r\nYURI RATING (0/10)\\n\\n\r\nNot even goggles will get you any readings here. Abandon all hope.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nGin no Saji excellently captures Japanese values about hard work, dedication and the importance of your \u201cgroup\u201d, while at the same time cherishing the individual and his or her own goals and dreams. It offers a close look at the rural, agricultural life of Japan, both its ups and downs, which makes it a compelling watch because of the unusual setting it has. A competent show all around, it sets out on a journey which teacher, entertains and questions, all in one finely crafted package. It\u2019s a true joy to watch Gin no Saji, and I hope the second season will take the original concept,  improve and expand upon it, as a sequel should.\\n",

            "content": "They say it's not possible to succeed in life without having a dream or any ambition. But are dreams really that important if you want to achieve big things and live out a prosperous life? This is the question that revolves around the head of our protagonist in Gin No Saji, a brilliant anime that will probably be over-looked by most.\r\nSTORY:\r\nTo keep things simple, Gin No Saji isn't your average SOL anime. The show is unique in most aspects, starting from the fact that it actually takes place in an agricultural school to the vast diversity of characters with their own relate-able and realistic backgroundsand problems. Another big factor is the sheer amount of educational knowledge that can be obtained by watching this show, which explains how hard yet fruitful the life of farming can be. The show, on the whole, paces along very well, although it could have used a bit more time in a few episodes.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nThe art was very fluid throughout the series. The scenery is beautiful and fascinating; the vibrant display of the colours used give the anime a really pacifying and reassuring atmosphere which might also put you at ease. The animation is consistent throughout, which was reassuring.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nThe only downside of the series. The soundtrack was largely disappointing. Both the opening and the ending were mediocre at best and I really don't think I'll go back and listen to them again. The BGM was okay in most cases but they were, on occasions, completely missing from the scenes in question. The voice-acting, though, was pretty good and the VAs deserve, at least, some credit.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nIn one word, INCREDIBLE. Starting from the protagonist to the characters who spend a small amount of time on-screen, nobody's representation is over-done. Each of the main characters and supporting protagonists have aims and histories you can (probably) relate to, and nothing really feels out of place. The dialogues are also very solid. The jokes were mostly hilarious too, although they did on occasion feel out-of-place or over-used.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\nIn general, Gin No Saji has been a very enjoyable anime. Sans the music aspect, the show was outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nGin No Saji is truly one of those rare animes that will just captivate you and keep you glued to the screen, making you want more and more as each episode finishes. The shows that it's perfectly alright to start all over again and that you should never be scared of taking an unconventional step.\\n\\n\r\nSCORES IN BRIEF:\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\r\nArt- 8/10\\n\r\nSound - 6/10\\n\r\nCharacters - 9/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 8/10\\n\r\nOVERALL - 8/10",

            "content": "A not so hidden gem that is one of the best things you could suggest to somebody if they're looking for a good \"slice of life\" anime. \r\nGin no Saji has managed to deliver a great sense of realism without losing that wholesome anime feel (wholesome being a relative term). It offers a nice amount of teenage angst, but not so much as to turn it into a melodrama. \r\nIt livens the whole rural agricultural Japan setting and the plethora of educational nuances it has are both accurate and interesting. Even with my laughably little knowledge of farming, it actually tugs me to learn orat least spark some interest in the craft. And normally when an anime does that, it's a good one. \\n\\n\r\nMy only particular complaints would be that sometimes the pacing does get a little weak and character development isn't that widespread. \\n\\n\r\nThough I'm not saying that the characters aren't well developed, quite the opposite to be exact; Everyone in the anime almost feels alive. The main and even some side characters' developments were amazingly on point. Which kind of saddens me that not everybody gets a similar amount of development. \\n\\n\r\nBut those are easily overlooked with how good the anime is. Partner this up with the great pieces from Miwa and Sukima Switch and you got yourself some fresh, charcoal grilled to perfection, Gin no Saji. Something your really should indulge in.",

            "content": "Silver Spoon was such a good watch for me. I'm not one to watch Slice of Life Animes; most have never appealed to me. There's was something different about this one though, maybe it was the agricultural twist? Or the fact that the manga was drawn by Hiromu Arakawa. I  don't know, but I'm so glad that I gave it a shot.\r\n     I really connected with the main character, Hachiken, everything he goes throughout the show just resonated in me somehow; its something I have never felt in another anime. I could only think \"Isthis me in another world? Another life?\" and the supporting cast is just a fricken' great, there really isn't any character I am just utterly displeased with. All of them are pretty well rounded and fit into their trope accordingly. \\n\r\n     The music isn't spectacular, but that is honestly fine. Its there to give you the proper emotions and that's all this show needs honestly. The opening theme and closing theme are both pretty good, I especially love the ending, something about it makes me happy. \\n\r\n     The art is really nice to look at, and most of the animals that are depicted are animated very well, aside from a few horse shots. Still, it was great to look at the scenery whenever they showed off their environmental skills and the characters all look great and pretty distinct from one another. So there's no mix up of \"Is that the same spikey haired guy?\" \\n\r\n   All in all, Silver Spoon was a good, funny, and actually thought provoking anime. Will I continue to watch into Season Two? You betcha! Thanks for reading if you made it all the way down here, and I hope you enjoy the amazing eleven episode runtime. \\n\r\n~Cheers~ Tom",

They show how hard living by agriculture really is in realistically manner. \\n\r\nIt's easy to get in debt, hurt yourself from overwork and most important is to commit your whole life for your craft. \\n\r\nIt also makes you question your own morals and think about animal rights. It's very refreshing to see how boldly they show the process of raising the livestock with care only to have them end up as their livelihood.\\n\\n\r\nAll the ethical and moral questions aside, Silver spoon has this lovely SOL and romance as part of it. I enjoyed and cherished every single episode.\\n\r\nThe OP and ED set the feel and they're perfect for this show. Especially the ED is heartwarming.\\n\\n\r\nI totally recommend you watch the anime and read manga afterwards. This series is a masterpiece within It's own genre.\\n",

            "content": "I never thought I would enjoy a SoL anime (about farming no less) as much as I did Gin no Saji. And from the great Arakawa Hiromu (of FMA fame) herself. I admit, I was hooked in by the authors name and jumped in blind but it became one of the best decisions I made in my anime watching life;) Here's why.\r\nStory/Characters: \r\nThe main protagonist this time is this young, bespectacled lad named Hachiken Yugo who is very much a city boy hailing from Sapporo. After failing his entrance exams for his chosen school he decides to enroll at Yezo Agricultural High thinking that hewould have an easier time preparing for college if the academic level was a bit lower than usual. Little did he know this decision would lead him to a great journey of self discovery (Cheesy? I know... Just work w/ me here...). \\n\\n\r\nIt might sound no different from all adolescent coming of age dramas we've encountered but trust me it's not. It's one of the very few series where you feel the authors sincerity in the story. Arakawa sensei really put a lot of thought and heart into making this series and it shows. \\n\\n\r\nAdd a memorable cast of characters, good pacing, and the trademark Arakawa humor and you have yourself a real good show.The issues it tackles are things we often take for granted (Pork Bowl for example) but the way the show presents them and the conclusions it offers really hit you deep in the gut. There isn't so much heavy drama but it still manages to touch the audience. That in itself is testament to how good the storytelling in this series is.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of conclusions, the show doesn't actually present a definite one but just basically says, and I quote, \"never stop trying to understand\". There is no definite answer. But whatever decision you come to just be sure to face it head on. This really got to me personally.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\\n\r\nA-1 really shows their stuff when working w/ SoL shows and Gin no Saji is no exception. The backdrops are filled w/ detail and the animation is smooth. The OP/ED are catchy and the OST is appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\\n\r\nA very enjoyable watch. One of the few animes that prompted me to read the manga straight away. This is one of those gems where the different elements merge to paint a beautiful montage w/out anything feeling out of place at all. The warmth and problems that accompany human relations, the farming backdrop, coming of age, comedy... All merge into one great SoL series. A definite must watch for those who like the genre.",

            "content": "Made by the very same genius who made Fullmetal Alchemist, Hiromu Arakawa, Silver Spoon is a very funny series about a group of high school students learning about agriculture-the studying of how farming is truly done and how animals like pigs for example are processed into food like sausage and bacon.\r\nThe theme of Silver Spoon is all about learning, however, it does have a story to tell indeed, as it focuses on a young man named Yugo Hachiken of whom decided to join an agriculture centered school on a whim due to not having good relations with his family and also wanting to get awayfrom everything that was a problem for him.\\n\\n\r\nAt Ooezo Agricultural High School, its here that Hachiken's demeanor and views on life more then less soften up, as he meets good friends that help to teach him about new things.\\n\\n\r\nAmong them is a young woman who he instantly becomes infatuated with named Aki Mikage who in particular teaches Hachiken about horse riding after he joins the club that is primarily in charge of looking after the animals belonging to Ooezo.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Spoon is definitely not, as great and/or, as huge in scope when compared to Fullmetal Alchemist but in a way, it offers fans of Hiromu Arakawa's works a parallel universe setting of Fullmetal Alchemist where imagine if all of our fan favorite characters were living in real life and weren't involved in any kind of trouble whatsoever...namely the fictional battle elements kind.\\n\\n\r\nIts a nice day to day life series that manages to equally balance learning, comedy and romance all together nicely, however, i think in major parts to Silver Spoon's success is because of both the author of Fullmetal Alchemist and her unique comedy style and that keeps viewers and readers going on laughing again and again non stop.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in Silver Spoon is very slow paced but does gradually build over time, giving fans something to enjoy and have a buildup of excitement over if fans like myself like or even love romance but in the otherwise case then i promise you that Silver Spoon is definitely a good watch for its comedy alone, i don't know anything about agriculture so i can't really comment but Silver Spoon is definitely a very funny series.\\n\\n\r\nIts sense of humor might keep fans going and longing for enough to watch and read the series until the very end, there is no other kind of humor found in both Fullmetal Alchemist and Silver Spoon quite like Hiromu Arakawa's who i personally believe is a master of comedy itself.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Hiromu Arakawa herself, Silver Spoon is a more or less biography adaptation story on her real life experiences involving farming and such, apparently having grown up in real life on a farm from what i've researched.\\n\\n\r\nSilver Spoon deserves its high ranks in Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment and Overall respectively, it is guaranteed not to disappoint viewers and already fans of Hiromu Arakawa's works due in strong part to its strong characterization, especially full of the characters' humor and the budding romance between both Yugo and Aki.\\n\\n\r\nPlus, Silver Spoon is a good series to learn something new that we may not have known about before, the study of agriculture, of what makes it fascinating and how it is done professionally both, as teaching and especially, as a business respectively.\\n\\n\r\nHere's hoping my Review was helpful in any way.",

            "content": "You know an anime is good when it inspires people in Japan to build their own pizza ovens.\r\nYes, really. One of NHK's investigative shows correlated a spike in pizza oven kit purchases with the show's pizza oven episode.\r\nChucking a city slicker like Hachiken into an aggie school is just as hilarious as it sounds. Toss in his background and personality, and you have a good balance of LOL and drama. Aside from a couple of comedic relief characters (who are used as easily scapegoated troublemakers as well, so that's fun too), most of the characters are well-written and designed. Unfortunately, that's not quite so forMikage, but (small spoiler) her good moments come later in season 2, so if you wanted to see her be someone other than a grinning cardboard cutout on a horse, I encourage you to keep watching.\\n\\n\r\nI loved how the show brought actual, real-life questions and problems to the forefront and had Hachiken tackle them like a 100-pound linebacker with a chip on his shoulder, in his own way coming up with answers but not solutions as such. That gives this slice-of-life show believability, depth, and gravitas, and it's damned funny watching Hachiken faceplant. This, of course, extends into diving into every aspect of animal husbandry, even the \"Hi, I'm Mike Rowe, and this is my job. Now, get ready to get dirty\" stuff. Who says you can't knock yourself out laughing while saying, \"Good thing this isn't smell-o-vision!\"\\n\\n\r\nI feel as though that, because a lot of interesting stories and character development happens later in the series, they should've taken their time and released a full series in one go rather than split it up into 2 seasons, but sometimes that's how the production is planned (I'm guessing a lot of TV stations got burned by 4-cour anime). On the other hand, I wouldn't want them to cut corners on the animation or do a clip show episode to let the animators catch up to a grueling schedule.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is pretty good-- one track with a string orchestra playing a repeating motif then joined by a (edit, oops, my memory sucked) solo clarinet regularly gets stuck in my head in a good way. The opening and ending credit animation/music is both funny and well executed, like many other Noitamina productions.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's a weakness to this series, it's that after season 2, there isn't much material left in the original manga (and what is there has a tendency to drag on), because the author took a hiatus. Hopefully he can get back in the saddle, because the stories he tells seem amazingly real, and he has a knack for getting audiences to root for the hapless but hardworking Hachiken.",

            "content": "One of the most pleasant surprises I\u2019ve had in quite some time, Silver Spoon defied every expectation I set for it. Being no stranger to the slice of life genre (my favorite), I did not expect this show to be so consistently hilarious throughout its entire run. You could easily classify it as a straight-up comedy, but there are some deep themes that elevate the series to something special. Hachiken\u2019s eternal search for direction and purpose is something anybody can relate to. His discovery of new experiences and lowering his mental walls makes Silver Spoon an important tool for viewers to open themselves up. Andthe cast of characters is instantly likable, even when they come off as harsh prudes. This is a genuinely funny show that absolutely earns its moments of bittersweet poignancy. Looking forward to more.",

            "content": "As a vegan, this anime was a difficult watch, but I decided to put my personal beliefs aside and try and give it a shot.\r\nThe story as stated, is about a city boy who enters an agricultural school and develops culture shock as he discovers a totally different view of life. Everyone is connected to their buisness, their families, and their farms. Over time, Hachiken develops bonds with the other students and learns new skills, often struggling and complaining about the chores and work load in a comedic fashion. Hachiken also struggles with his own morality as he is faced with the cruel reality ofagriculture - the death of the farmed animals.\\n\\n\r\nA few things I appreciate about this anime..\\n\\n\r\nThe music is memorable and fits the mood. The opening and ending songs are catchy songs with farm-like feels. The soundtrack is beautiful and it often fits the different themes, there were times I got emotional during the sad moments of the story due to the aura of the music. It is very good.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is also unique; all the characters are uniquely drawn with different features. It can sometimes feel like anime characters are drawn too generically, and they all have to be thin and attractive. Silver Spoon helps express people in a variety of different shapes, sizes and personalities. I really enjoyed that aspect of the anime and it allows it to keep it memorable.The animals are also drawn super cute!\\n\\n\r\nI found the story to be quite straight forward and realistic to how agricultural families view their livelihood. Silver spoon definitely sums up the farm life and the farm student life super well. Sneaking out, playing with friends, falling off horses, dealing with animal slaughter, they were all things presented quite realistically to a sense. Although I appreciate that the anime presents factory farming as an existing reality in today's age, it is a very sanitized version. Realistically, the conditions are a lot worse and you can easily find real undercover videos that illustrate the corruption in these industries. But I suppose they had to show it in the most refreshing, wholesome farm feel where no animals are sick, dying  or clearly shown to be incredibly distressed. There was no slaughterhouse footage either of 'Pork Bowl' and the other 'retired' animals such as the race horses or dairy cows, not suprisingly.\\n\\n\r\nFun fact: Tamako Inada is also like an anime version of Gina Rinehart. No doubt.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I didn't like about the anime was Hachiken's quick change of heart simply through eating food. When he is faced with the dilemma of meat and where animal products come from; he quickly dismisses his pesky sense of morality and has an almost orgasm when he consumes the animal flesh, I know anime likes to exagerrates people's reactions but c'mon...he was so disgusted and sad and had such as sudden change of mind through eating! It was probably very troublesome for him to give up Pork Bowl, and fighting for Pork Bowl in such a strong farming community would probably give him a lot more trouble then he wanted; seeing as he had little family support anyway. It's a comforting notion that he wants to 'respect' the animals 'sacrifice' but also incredibly hypocritical - the animal is just going to be shitted out by you anyway so where is the respect there? He was so empathetic to Pork Bowl that he would hug him teary eyed but the next minute it was time for Pork Bowl to be cooked and eaten. Cognitive dissonance exists even in anime, it seems.\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say, I think this anime is important to get a simple sense of farm life - especially the sense of community and family that comes along with the lifestyle and that aspect is very enjoyable. However, it does seem a bit sanitized for the sake of being a wholesome slice of life anime. I hope Silver Spoon broadens your eyes a bit wider and allows you to make your own decisions on what is important and what is not.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I really loved Gin no Saji. In a phrase, this anime was able to take a multitude of themes and balance them beautifully to create a series that is thoughtful but light-hearted. That describes the story, the characters, the music, and the overall experience.\r\nGin no Saji is all about first-experiences. From Hachiken's first taste of raw egg on rice, freshly steamed corn on the cob, to riding horses, and baseball games this anime is all about the experiencing new things and learning a new perspective of things that is both thoughtful, incredibly insightful, educational but still funny. \r\nHachiken experiences so many new things, including aboutthe characters around him, the farming industry, as well as about himself. The thing that amazes me about this anime is that it was able to pull off touching on so many different themes while still moving the story forward and never losing it's light-hearted comedy without hurting the seriousness of themes. Themes like raising animals we eat, working hard, making mistakes, discovering what we want in life- were all touched on in ways that brought me some admiration about the farming way of life in general. For that the story has to be a 10. For the innovative and artful blend of comedy and seriousness this anime was able to pull off something other writers and directors could not.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't super unique or great but was extremely conducive for the light-heartedness of the series. The coloring was bright and the characters personalities really shown through in just the character design itself. One of the reasons the art was a bit innovative was because of it's detail to preparing food, from the butchering and skinning of animals to the steam rising off freshly steamed rice. The animation, color, and drawing of the food prep and cooked food was amazing. I always got hungry whenever they showed them eating things. I gotta say seeing the freshly melted cheese is probably one of the most delicious looking art I've seen. xD About the only negative thing was I did feel whenever they stir-fried the meat it tended to look the same golden-coated browned pieces. Other than that though, the art helped bring me into the story and food as well as fall in love with the hilarious personalities in the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe personalities for the characters were quite unique and I really enjoyed all the different classmates Hachiken had. They really made for a hilarious show and taught a bit about different types of farming styles and philosophies as well. The characters also were a great contrast to the main character in their dreams and perspective in life. Without the characters this show definitely would not have been as funny.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the sound was great. I never once thought any of the animal sounds was fake. And found the sounds of the cooking food to be absolutely tantalizing. The voice actors did a wonderful job of closing the jokes with the timing and expressive natures of their characters and the music always did a great job of bringing back the thoughtfulness of the show while still keeping that light-hearted feel that was so prevalent in all aspects of Gin no Saji. The opening and ending songs were great, and I loved the ending song especially. I never once great tired of the song and listened to it every episode. The use of the banjo and the vocals of the main singers just created such a perfect country-fell to the song.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I immensely enjoyed this anime. For it's comedy, it's light-heartedness, it's educational value about farming, food processing, and ability to balance the two together makes this show a jewel. I can't wait for the 2nd season. =)",

This anime started out, for me at least, being a well-drawn placeholder until my favorites of the next season started airing.... but this was the epitome of ignorance on my part. This anime broadsided me with a down to earth main character, lovable side characters and even memorable characters that only show for a single episode! \r\nOn to the story. My god, this was good. I expected to be bored to tears,but it was the complete opposite. It literally draws you in and keeps you entertained as you watch this young man learn from his own mistakes and misgivings to develop into a truly wonderful human being. I have never thought about becoming a farmer in my entire life, but if it was half as fun as this anime showed, albeit the show did a good job showing off how hard it is as well, count me in!\\n\\n\r\n10/10, saving this one for a rewatch come December, to get ready for January!",

            "content": "When thinking of watching something in the slice of life genre, you can't go wrong with Gin no Saji (or Silver Spoon in English). The story was so well paced in this first season's 11 episodes that it made it very easy to watch and enjoy. The characters were all fleshed out and all supported Hachiken really well. As a main character, Hachiken goes through a lot of emotions and feelings and you as the viewer can't help but feel for the guy throughout the series. It even makes you start to wonder about some of the choices in your own life. From issues stemmingfrom meat consumption to questioning your own ambitions in life. I enjoy an anime that engages the viewers mind and Gin no Saji does just that.\\n\\n\r\nI always feel that music can play such an important role in a piece of film or animation that it can make the most subtle scene feel important and have an impact. Gin no Saji is filled with these well composed original piano tunes that enhances the emotion of a scene and really help immerse you into the story and setting. The OP and ED of this season was so memorable that it left me humming and whistling to them throughout my time watching these 11 episodes. Songs that go so perfect with what the story is about, it really does its job.\\n\\n\r\nIm glad the manga is currently ongoing and so it means the anime is still going as well. I urge you to watch this anime if you're in the mood for something different but at the same time very engaging, funny and heartfelt.",

            "content": "Tadgh: This is not a show for the typical anime fan. It's not about normal high school life. It's not about action. It's not about supernatural powers or a teen learning they're half demon. It's about an earnest young man throwing himself into a flurry of new experiences in an attempt to figure out his life. The farm setting is great because it introduces a lot of moral decisions that many of us ignore. I actually think I learned something from watching this show. It's listed as a comedy, and while funny, it's more about the struggle we all face while figuring out life. It'snot a typical anime, but it's definitely worth a watch.\\n\\n\r\nDr. R. Dash: I absolutely loved silver spoon. I feel like i enjoyed it so much because i have been in the veterinary field for the last 6-7 years of my life and it was a rough road at the start but now its my every day so watching hachiken-kun go through all the little details that people who work with animals everyday take for granted he takes to heart I even had two veterinarians i work with watch a episode with me on a lunch break and they loved the calf being born episode- Please watch CANT WAIT FOR SEASON 2.\\n\\n\r\nLaohoam: This anime really does lean toward a genre all on its own.  at first I thought it was going to be a bore, but as the story progressed on I could really relate to the protagonist.  He was lost and didn't know what to do with his life.   It really shows his growth and the everyday struggle.  Just as he did, and we all do, I learned something.  i learnt not to judge an anime to early.      \\n\\n\r\nRasanaph: It was hard for me to stay enthralled, but all in all it was an alright anime.\\n",

            "content": "The following is a combined review for both the first and second season.\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t look down on yourself for running. Make it meaningful by making something out of it.\u201d\r\nSilver Spoon tells the coming-of-age story of Yugo Hachiken, a studious teenager who enrolls in the agricultural boarding school Yezo High, in order to escape from his parents. There he meets a varied cast of characters, and through his interactions with them ultimately grows as a person.\r\nI have a bit of a soft spot for well told coming-of-age stories. I thoroughly enjoyed Barakamon, and Hanasaku Iroha is one of my favorites. Characters are generally what I watch ashow for, and watching the MC grow and develop over the course of the series is something I really enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nYugo Hachiken is a great example of overarching development done right. He\u2019s unique in his own way, and is far bolder than I\u2019d ever be, yet possess just the right personality traits that he\u2019s not only someone you\u2019d aspire to imitate, but also someone you could likely relate to and emote with. Hachiken is far from perfect, which is especially clear at the series\u2019 start. His imperfections make him human, and sometimes those seeming flaws turn out not to be not flaws at all. As the show continues, we\u2019re gradually revealed more information as to why Hachiken is the way he is and what\u2019s shaped his life to this point, from his relationship with his parents to the relationship he has with his friends now.\\n\\n\r\nI will point out that while I really do love Hachiken\u2019s character, I could see that some people might find him a little too perfect in his strong-willed determination, that said, it didn\u2019t bother me personally.\\n\\n\r\nHachiken is joined by our fairly large cast of characters. Sadly, however, it feels like a lot of the cast didn\u2019t get their proper chance to be fully explored. This isn\u2019t so much due to poor time management, but rather the lack thereof. Quite a bit of time is covered in these 22 episodes, and I wish there had been more episodes inbetween covering the side characters in a bit more depth. I found Aikawa and his determination to become a vet despite his weak heart to be especially interesting, and I really would have liked if that had been explored more.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the second season in particular, two characters besides Hachiken are explored in more detail, that being Aki Mikage, and to a lesser extent, Komoba Ichiro, who while he is a nice, in this respect serves not-so-much as an in-depth character, but rather as an assistant for moving forward Hachiken and Mikage\u2019s development in the latter half of Season 2.\\n\\n\r\nMikage is a very interesting character. Roughly put, Mikage is very different from what you would first think. She has her imperfections, and by the end of the show I found myself really caring about what happens to her. The dramatic aspects are handled realistically, such that you could really easily see yourself or a friend behaving similarly if you or they were put in her situation, and this makes it incredibly easy to sympathize with her. Even further, I absolutely love Hachiken and Mikage\u2019s interactions, as it hits just the sweet spot at being initially cute and then gradually progressing to a deeper level of trust and true friendship, never falling into the absolutely awful total \u201cblush-frenzy and nothing but\u201d that is so common. If you\u2019ve seen Space Brothers, I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat similar to the relationship between Serika and Nanba, though more developed.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes Hachiken and Mikage\u2019s dynamic so effective though, is how their character traits and flaws play off of each other. Both have their strengths and weaknesses, with quite a few being on opposite sides of the spectrum, causing this very intriguing back-and-forth of reliability, as they open up to each other and help each other out. My main problem is simply that I wanted more. I feel the show would\u2019ve benefited greatly if there had been more times where we see just Hachiken and Mikage interacting with each other. The show itself is surprisingly fast paced for a slice of life and could have done with some slowing down on occasion. Another factor to this complaint is that their development is interrupted by the rather jarring end to the series. It felt like we were finally getting some further development on Hachiken\u2019s side after focusing on Mikage and her problems for quite a while, and then it just ends out of absolutely nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s right folks, this is a read the manga ending. :-(\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ve rambled on about Hachiken and Mikage for a while (can you tell they\u2019re some of my favorite characters?), but I should at least touch on the story that takes place during the first season, where the predominant focus is Hachiken and his conflicting morals on the farm life.\\n\\n\r\nPut simply, it\u2019s really well done. Now that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s for everyone, heck the first time I watched it, perhaps be it lack of experience or just mood itself, I found the show pretty boring. Yet even still I could tell I was missing something, that for some reason I couldn\u2019t enjoy it but there was still quality there. Coming back to it quite a few months later, I find that I love this series. How it explores both sides of an issue, but never gives a direct conclusion. How it represents the feeling of working hard for something. How it talks about having a dream and working towards that. How it does everything, really.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s move forward, and touch on the animation for the series. They can make some legitimately good looking stuff, take SoRaNoWoTo for instance, but from what I\u2019ve seen they also have the tendency to have massive quality drops out of nowhere. Silver Spoon isn\u2019t the worst case among those, and for the most part is pretty consistent, but I still will never forgot those horrid CG cows till the day I die. I don\u2019t care that they only used them like twice in the entire show, it was still far too much.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, the general aesthetic doesn\u2019t stand out too much. The art style even in the manga was fairly simplistic, and the anime retains that. The character designs are fitting, though I will point out that Mikage\u2019s face always tends to look a bit \u201coff\u201d, like it\u2019s somewhat out of proportion or something like that. Thankfully though, she\u2019s the only one who suffers from this.\\n\\n\r\nI must give them credit for the animation on the food and animals, because for the most part it looks pretty darn impressive. There\u2019s quite a bit of detail and fluidity, and the use of still shots was rarer than I expected, though obviously not completely gone. Even on the side of the characters, there are select moments where the quality spikes up quite a bit, at the peak moments of the show where it really matters. It\u2019s no Unlimited Budget Works, but for the most part it does the job pretty well.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t leave off without touching on the music, which is pretty solid overall. The OPs and EDs are all great, particularly the second ones, and the general OST has some pretty good themes. It certainly isn\u2019t the greatest, as sometimes the music felt a little too forceful in trying to convey an emotion, rather than letting the show just portray it well by itself. However, when it does work, it works really well. When the tone of the show and music match, it creates some really touching and downright inspirational moments. The music overall generally does well to fit the setting and it\u2019s mood, and as far as soundtracks go is much more memorable than most. I wouldn\u2019t call it play-on-repeat playlist material, but it\u2019s definitely above average, even if they did reuse the same themes a little too much for my taste.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Silver Spoon is an incredibly captivating and memorable experience, and one that I feel I could come back to again later in life and get even more out of. The interactions, development, and themes present feels real, and it was an unexpected but incredibly welcome surprise. This is one little gem I wouldn\u2019t pass up for the life of me, and one I don\u2019t think you should either.\\n\\n\r\n(Originally Written March 1st, 2015)\\n\\n\r\nhttps://writtenandwriting.wordpress.com/",

            "content": "Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d enjoy an anime about farming this much. Here is my review on what I thought was one of the best anime of this past summer.\r\n\u201cGin no Saji\u201d, or Silver Spoon, is based on the on-going manga of the same name. The story is about a teenage boy named Hachiken who enrolls in an agriculture school, on a whim, as a means to disconnect himself from his family. However, agricultural life proves to be too much for our city grown boy as he discovers the hardships and realities of farming.\r\nDespite the seemingly realistic setting, the story is highly romanticized. The \u201chardships\u201d and \u201crealities\u201dit entails doesn\u2019t go any further than emphasizing: hard labor and Hachiken\u2019s inner struggle to eat animals \u2013 a struggle I think we should all experience at least once in our life. Instead, it gives us a glimpse of farming within a very intimate, almost family-like, environment and shy\u2019s away from touchy subjects like animal cruelty or the darker aspects of food processing. Then again, Japanese farming techniques may run under a different set of rules than that of the U.S or any other country in the world (I doubt it). But knowing that it comes from Arakawa, Hiromu, the original creator of Fullmetal Alchemist, the series denotes a more cheerful and uplifting vibe. If you like Fullmetal Alchemist, then you can expect the same level of humor in Silver Spoon. But don\u2019t get me wrong, the humor added a lot to my enjoyment of the anime. Plus, Hiromu does a pretty good job at balancing the drama and comedy aspects of the series. I just thought I\u2019d shed some light on the author\u2019s approach to the \u201crealities\u201d of farming in this series. Who knows, maybe the manga goes a little deeper into the darker aspects of farming but, for now, I am content with Silver Spoon\u2019s attempts to explore the more \u201cmoralistic\u201d side of farming \u2013 via Hatchiken. Although, the story is a lot more light-hearted than I make it sound.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the great things about Silver Spoon is that it follows a city boy \u2013 who knows little to nothing about farming \u2013 and allows him to serve as a stand-in for the audience \u2013 who may also be disconnected from the rural lifestyle, thereby, allowing the audience to join in the experience as well. Moreover, the story doesn\u2019t just stop at the \u201cmoralistic\u201d sides of farming. Silver Spoon also takes the time to explore another of its main themes: \u201csearching for a purpose in life\u201d \u2013 something I think we can all relate to.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, there was quite a large cast of like-able characters in the series, though I wish I got to see them develop more. Plus, there were hints of a possible romance that didn\u2019t get its chance to develop into anything but a simple crush, so I would definitely appreciate another season. Nevertheless, if you grew up in or ever experienced the country side, you\u2019re bound to find this pretty enjoyable. If not, I\u2019m sure it makes for a rather educational experience. Although, I believe Hachiken\u2019s struggles falls under a coming of age story that I would recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "I found Gin no Saji an amazingly enjoyable anime, honestly speaking I haven't enjoyed a series so much in a long time. If you're looking for an anime that will lift your spirits with feels and a good laugh, you've come to the right place. \r\nThe best part of the anime, in my opinion, are the characters, more specifically, Hachiken. He isn't the lame main character you see in many series, he has personality. He brings up questions the students who are used to farm life wouldn't ever think about. He pays close attention to the people around him, is very empathetic, selfless and smart.However at the same time he's also a bit clumsy and naive, which makes him a very realistic character, so much so that I can actually really understand him.\\n\r\n Everyone there isl amazing though, not just the main character, there are barely any bland ones at all! Everyone has their weird side, but they're also all good at something, or just very sweet/funny in general. I find it impressive how realistic the anime is in a way that there is no perfect person there, everyone has flaws, and not the overly funny flaws, realistic, believable ones! \\n\\n\r\nWhat may turn some people off is the 'cruelty' presented. As a warning, yes it does show the merciless beheading of chickens, slaughtering of pigs, the birth of a calf and hitting animals while driving. If you can't handle such things, then don't watch, however I feel it fits in with the story perfectly, farmers have to deal with such things as a part of daily life. The realism in the show is downright impressive, there is no such thing as the romanticized view people may have on livestock or farming.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the art and sound. It's drawn pretty damn well if I may say so myself. The animation is very neatly done and pleasant to watch. The opening song is mediocre and the ending one quite happy-sounding. The background music in the episodes isn't very obvious, for me anyway, I didn't even pay attention to it and can't say what instruments were being used, it's just that invisible, blends in perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nShould you watch it? \\n\r\nYes, yes you should, it's good food for your feels.",
