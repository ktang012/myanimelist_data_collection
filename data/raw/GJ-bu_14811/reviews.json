            "content": "Being as frank as possible, I found the Winter 2013 season to be quite weak, despite having a lot of bright and colourful ideas. The majority of them only proved to be average, slightly above even, and they definitely won't be memorable for long. Now, this talk may portray to be a little irrelevant and bias (and apologies if it is), but the point I want to get across is that I was hoping that 'at least' one show in the season would be in a state without having to be stalled, being both enjoyable and interesting every episode and with no actual problems draggingit down. In other words, a hidden gem.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully there was one, and funny enough it's about a school club with absolutely no purpose or theme whatsoever. Wait, what?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about... as stated earlier, nothing. Kyouya is in a club called the 'Good-Job Club', and their activities involve having various discussions, eating food, laying around the room being struck by lasers of heat, biting each other, lewdly brushing hair, bringing little sisters in and many more things. The other members of the club are four girls; the childish club president Mao who has a short-temper, the refined angel-like Megumi, the genius Shion lacking common sense and the mysterious cat-like Kirara.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd probably be thinking that... it sounds like a pretty generic slice of life without actually anything going on, which would naturally sound really boring to watch. To top it all of though, it sounds like a harem! There's no doubt it's harem-like with the boy:girl ratio of 1:4, and you'll probably agree that nearly all harem shows fail to be remotely good. And guess what? I found this much more interesting than all the other shows, and I'm not close to devoted with slice of life shows in a school setting. So... how, and why, did I find this more entertaining than the rest of the season?\\n\\n\r\nBecause GJ-bu does something a lot of normal slice of life shows fail to do - restraining from pushing itself to far.\\n\\n\r\nOr in other words, it didn't try to hard to be what it is. GJ-bu acknowledges fairly well that it's a full slice of life series with the given setting; there's no unnecessarily technical writing involved and it doesn't forces the contents or intentions of the show onto the audience in a demanding way - it just does what a slice of life is supposed to be. It really does take a slice of one's life, and converts those everyday actions into animated form. Because of this, everything feels natural, both pacing and scenery, and without having to feel boring too. None of the jokes feel dragged, and neither does the dialogue, so the conversations and spacelessness you'd feel in real life are portrayed rather nicely here.\\n\\n\r\nBut who wants to watch some guy's life in a club in the first place? Who'd find that interesting? Which brings me to my second point. The natural flow in the entire show gives of a really, really lovely relaxing pace. The pacing does feel rather slow at times, but because nothing is so dragged along or forced, it makes the audience quite relaxed whilst watching each episode, and so the slowness isn't something to be weary of (well, depending on your preferences but I'll mention that later). Although the speed of the pace is noticeable when you start the series, it starts getting less obvious and time starts to fly by so swiftly you'd be completely used it over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, looking at a specialist's point of view, GJ-bu really isn't that unique at all. It just stands out because it does what most slice of life anime doesn't do, and that is to keep the viewers actually engaged without a plot in mind instead of building up their bore meters. The show is just about five members in a non-specified club, enjoying their time there whilst they can, so if anyone is expecting some actual plot, romance, drama, tragedy, deaths, epicness, inspiring moments and so forth, then I'm afraid your expectations are at risk (though, there is a sweet semi-closure which was done really well). But if you thought that it'd be a bore-pumper and something immensely non-memorable whilst choosing your seasonal shows (and, admittedly, that was me), then you should pretty much give this a go for a change of pace, and especially if you're a big fan of the slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't so remarkable as from the outside, but during the course of the show the art department actually does get handled as greater than what you'd expect. On one hand, the budget doesn't seem so noticeable and it's understandable since it's a slice of life. The outlines of the characters can be inconsistent in terms of thickness, which is a rather rare problem in anime in general. On the other hand though, there's certain scenes where the budget goes remarkably high, in both backgrounds, atmosphere and animation (which applies to 95%+ of the last episode). Regards to the budget, there's no rubbish or quality moments in which effects the series in any way. Talking about animation, the area which it's taken in full consideration is the EDs, which used the budget pretty wildly.\\n\\n\r\nWell actually, scratch that. GJ-bu wins for the best ending sequence in 2013 so far. And second place. And third place...\\n\\n\r\n...and fourth place too. The anime consists of four ending sequences, one playing every two episodes and the fourth one playing throughout the second half of the show. Each ED is based around a certain character or two, provided with a theme; the first ED being based around the Amatsuka sisters (Mao and Megumi), the second being based on Shion, the third being Kirara's ED and the last one centered towards the entire club. The collection of EDs varies in the type of songs and mood, being from extremely high-spirited with a fast-paced rock style, to a more contemplative mood in J-Pop form. All four songs are outstandingly well-composed, being catchy and vibrant in their own ways, and the studio probably blew 90% of their budget in the EDs to make them as visually attractive and fluent as possible, even coming with a unique summer atmosphere and funky dancing. They're extremely fun to watch and I doubt you'd regret having downloaded the full songs of all four endings, because I know I didn't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nSo... in conclusion, the four EDs are the best parts in the animation and sound department, in both the entire show and the Winter season. Woops, it seems like I dedicated a whole paragraph to the GJ-bu endings, so I should start on the actual sound department now. Uh... anyway, the opening sequence plays throughout the entire show, sung by the main VA cast. It's a really catchy up-beat song, and probably not so unexpecting in a slice of life. A lot of the time the OST doesn't play, mainly for the cause of the relaxing pacing and atmosphere. The soundtrack isn't at all incredible in stand-alone, but they're very cutely composed with simple and/or retro instruments, fitting the very light mood for the show. The voice actors do a good job (haha pun) with the characters, generally fitting well in their roles. Not to mention that several of the voice actors are actually teenagers, the youngest being Kirara's VA, at the age of thirteen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, despite the relaxing mood and atmosphere to the plotless show, it couldn't be as interesting as it is with just the aspects I described several paragraphs ago. Of course, we can't have a club without its members!\\n\\n\r\nNearly the entire cast consists of female (the male being Kyolo, the main character), and they're divided into two groups; the members of the GJ-bu, and the little sisters of those members. Let's introduce the main members the second (or third?) time, since I think it's a little necessary too; there's presisdent Mao Amatsuka, the orange one, who acts rather childish despite her rich background, and bites Kyolo when she's angry. But her younger sister is quite the opposite - Megumi Amatsuka, the pink one, is both refined and well-mannered, described almost as an angel, although it's not the case when it comes to weight. Shion Sumeragi, the purple one, is somewhat clever in lots of ways, but it seems common sense isn't her strong point. And then there's Kirara, my personal favourite member. She acts less human and more cat, structuring her sentences uniquely, and does lots of things the other members don't usually do, like eating meat all the time. And of course, we can't forget to mention Kyolo, our main man. He's presented in the series as a kind, caring and laid-back guy, though usually questioning whatever actions the other members perform (and usually on him too).\\n\\n\r\nOh and there's the green one. She doesn't appear in the beginning though.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the members are, firstly to say, stand-alone in their own way. You get a variety of personalities (and hair colours), and each have their own qualities for themselves in which both benefits and non-benefits them. However, it's the way they're presented that fleshes out the personalities further - The features of each individual becomes clearer and fresher with certain tropes and actions happening on-screen. Basically, the characters are in a club room, talking and in different ways interacting with each other. Whether it's conversations or actions, each individual would perform any kind of action which adds up as the evidence of one of the features in the characters, and it fleshes out into the characterization of the members (some of those actions may reveal one of the tropes at first shot though, depending on how obvious the feature is). In other words, characterization happens in the course of events, rather than having them explained, which feels both natural and less lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe more fun thing about this though is that each of the characters has quite distinct personalities and different features, fears, knowledge, preferences and so on compared to each other, so it's pretty fun seeing them hang round together as a group. You get a lot of times when they all agree to tease Kyolo in the most entertaining way for them to watch, and then scenes where they all take their turns to do a certain activity, from having their hair brushed, to arm-wrestling, to guessing whatever picture Kyolo drew and so on. There's no real hatred, drama and problems going around in the GJ-bu, so it's hard to start hating a character in the series, though of course it's not the case for everyone. Also, need to mention development. Well, there isn't much development since the anime starts during the middle course of Kyolo's time being in the club, but he does get a well-hidden development in the entire series, to both towards the other members and personality. It's just not so easy to notice and stretched out.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy GJ-bu? Considering that the entire show felt really natural and relaxing, and seeing each characters with different kinds of features interact with each other and Kyolo, of course I did. I had a really hard time debating whether or not to rate GJ-bu a solid 7 or a low 8, but it seemed like it was the latter (though honestly, I still can't decide). For anyone who just regarded this as some moe anime with really bland episodes might want to give this a second thought; this was the only show I started in the season which I didn't decide upon my full plan for the season, and it turned out it was the only show I actually thoroughly enjoyed in the entire show. If it wasn't for my brother I would've never encountered this gem, so it was lucky I didn't pass on this. GJ-bu was a enjoyable and relaxing ride for me, and it seems like I've grown fond to the series more than I expected to be.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish that more school slice of life anime was like GJ-bu.",

            "content": "Personally, I find this anime, basically, a cute, simple, slice-of-life anime. It reminds me a lot of several other slice-of-life anime like Lucky Star, Working!! or Acchi Kocchi. Why? Well it's mostly because GJ-Bu doesn't seem to have a real plot of its own.\r\n But despite that, I find it entertaining. Sure, there's no story behind it. But seeing Kyoya and the stuff that happens with the girls in the club room? I can't help but smile while watching it.\r\nThe art is bright and colorful. The anime screams a rainbow of colors, which is a good thing. It's also clear and the animation flows rathersmoothly. \\n\\n\r\nI personally like the characters. Though, Mao reminds me (in a way) of Aisaka Taiga from Toradora. But all the characters can easily be described as \"Kawaii.\" Maybe that's a personal opinion, but I'm sure a lot think that way. \\n\\n\r\nI don't really see anything to dislike this anime for. Maybe I missed a few things, but small things won't stop me from watching good anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is still airing, so there's more to be expected. I don't know where this anime will lead to-- but for now I'll give it an 8/10",

            "content": "GJ-bu is part of a sub-genre of slice of life which encompasses K-On, Yuru Yuri and others. These shows spend most of their times showing characters on a club usually doing absolutely nothing, whether because they skip club activities or because the club activities have no real purpose. They are usually hard to review due to few complexity in plot and characters, but it's not like it's non-existent. GJ-bu, however, takes this to extreme measures.\r\nNow, before you argue that the quality of the story is irrelevant, consider the following. If GJ-bu wants to show cute girls (and a boy, though on the verge of beingconsidered a girl as well) doing nothing but random stuff, then first it must get the viewer to actually care about the girls, otherwise it's just irritating rather than endearing. That's what good storytelling does, by offering a bridge between the world, including its characters, and the viewer. The problem is... this show doesn't have good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most shows at least try to construct a basic conceptual setting for the story to take place, this one decides it doesn't need to. Instead, we are thrown into the middle of an unknown place, with anonymous faces doing strange things we don't understand. Who are they? What are they trying to achieve? How do they relate with each other? There are many other questions, but these are the least you have to answer to convince the viewer that your characters are humans and not moeblobs walking around. GJ-bu's characterization is done through a few dialogues there and here and a few, very few, scenes outside the club. That's all you get.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the story just wasn't well executed, but the characters could still be good, right? Indeed, conceptually it's possible to elaborate interesting characters, but fail to fulfill their potential in practice. That's not the case of GJ-bu, which defines its characters in terms of clich\u00e9d stereotypes and refuses to give them any further depth. It's not that they lack back-story or psychological investigation, they just weren't meant to have any complexity to start with.\\n\\n\r\nOne-dimensional characters can be done well as long as they remain entertaining and/or charismatic, but to do so they must have interesting features and interactions with other characters. Characters from GJ-bu just do the same things over and over again, taking for granted the viewer's interest because of the cute and silly things going on. There's pretty much nothing fresh about the scenes, since they revolve around stereotypes doing their things.\\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect, if the storytelling is bad and the characters are poor, the jokes aren't exactly a masterpiece of humor, specially because they rely heavily on the characters. Shion, for instance, is very knowledgeable about many topics, but lacks common sense, as the stereotyped genius she is. That's it, there goes about 90% of all jokes about her, and not particularly creative ones. Oh, eventually she reveals that she would like to have a younger sister and has Tama fulfill that role because it's cute.\\n\\n\r\nYes, \"because it's cute\" and \"because the public's desires must be satisfied\" seem to be the main driving factors for GJ-bu. You've got tsunderes, maids, all kinds of hair colors, cat ears, little sisters, foreigners, heck, there's even cross-dressing for the girls and Kyoro. Everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer through a specific stimulation. If the show had used at least half of the time spent on this planning towards making the characters and their context actually interesting, a great deal of its problems would have simply disappeared.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've got the bad things out of the way, let's focus on the bright side. Since visual appeal is relevant to GJ-bu's purposes, it tries to build its own style, as colorful, cute and comfortable as possible. These efforts are mostly successful, but the character designs are easily forgettable, nothing you haven't seen in other moe shows, and the animation is only average. As for the soundtrack, it's pretty catchy, and a lot of effort is put into the ending's themes... still, they end up sounding quite generic as well. As a whole, though, the production values are all right.\\n\\n\r\nNow, after all of this, it could be concluded that this show is lame and boring, incapable of doing anything remarkable on its own. Well, there's nothing remarkable for sure, but surprisingly, it's still enjoyable. That's the ultimate secret of GJ-bu: it knows what it's doing. It was previously said that everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer, and this becomes evident as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nGJ-bu's focus on quantity rather than quality may lose points in artistic and creative value, but it's an important trade-off. You don't like this girl? Oh, then have another, and another, and another, all with distinct specifications, until you have one that you like. The stereotyped personalities are very helpful because otherwise it would be difficult to do this. Real people have common mindsets and physical attributes due to sharing the same environment, many have similar goals and ideologies, are constantly changing or trying to change, show different sides of themselves depending on the context... Stereotypes, on the other hand, are static, simple, and make sure that two characters will be as different as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut surely there must be at least one grumpy old man who isn't charmed by any of the show's attempts, right? No problem. It may sound crazy, but GJ-bu doesn't deliver enjoyment solely from the viewer's love; hate is also effective. The series tries so hard to be cute and funny with its endless list of clich\u00e9s, shallow characters and situations, fetishes and repetitive jokes that it turns into a laughable parody of itself for those who are not amused and become increasingly cynical. For example, the fact that the maid spins around every time she appears may either be seen as endearing or a pathetic attempt at being endearing. Both are acceptable, because GJ-bu doesn't care if it's being loved or hated, as long as it's not being ignored.\\n\\n\r\nGJ-bu is, quite literally, an anime for everyone. It has generic written all over it, but you end up either loving or hating it because it goes so overboard in applying all sorts of tested formulas. Truth be told, if you are a fan of this kind of series, has no problems with underdeveloped characters and poor storytelling, and want something with a sort of relaxed atmosphere and all types of cuteness, then try GJ-bu, as it probably won't disappoint. Otherwise, it's not advised to take the risk, but the show could be good for a few laughs; if not genuine, then mocking.",

            "content": "\"Slice of life anime have always interested me.Watching some random anime characters doing their everyday chores and spending their life carelessly reminds me of my own life.The life which is spent in search of those small moments of happiness.It remind me of me having fun with my friends and family.There are sad times too but there are other happy moments as well.After all,life is not completely about joy and pleasure.We have to bear sadness as\r\nwell\"....So,before u get bored by my life lecture(which u are sure being,T.T),I better start my review which is about an hidden gem i.e. Gj-bu or in other words \"Good Job\"\r\nGj-bu huh,...whereto begin..When I first started watching,I didn't pay much attention to it.I didn't expect it to become THIS awesome as I was like\"Yeah,it is good..but there are other awesome anime too..\"But I was wrong.As i watched more,I got engrossed in it to a point that I began to wait for it every week unknowingly.After watching the last episode,I just couldn't take it as I realized that \"Man,I am in love with it.\"So I decided to write a review for this so that other people who are looking for some fun anime may give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nStory:-(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all..about story..there is none...Well it is a slice of life anime,not much to expect in this department.After all,slice of anime are not about story,they are more about characters,fun,comedy and about creating an carefree environment in which a person can relax.They give us a hint of our everyday life in which this anime surely succeeds.I can this say this confidently that this will make you laugh a lot and you will grin in front of your computer(or laptop:P) screen countless times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a NORMAL high-school boy who gets recruited in a random club in which there are no prominent club activities..They just relax,play around,get warmed up in kotatsu(when it is winter of-course),drink tea(a lot...),eat cakes etc etc.In other words,a dream-like club(I want a club like that,T.T).\\n\\n\r\nStory wise,it reminds me of Seitokai no Ichizon and Sket Dance which,just like it,are anime about everyday life of their respective characters.Above all,it is very natural.It is not artificial.There are some shows which try too hard to make their audience laugh but that is not the case here.There is a flow in dialogues of the characters and a person laughs even when he don't want to.\\n\\n\r\nSo,I give it a solid 8 score out of 10:)The only reason I cut marks is that this is a \\n\r\nslice-of-life anime and marks are bound to cut in such a kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just simply great.It is elegant,vibrant and colorful just the way I like.You can see the detail in everything.The backgrounds are also beautifully done.The best thing is that,art's quality remains constantly goodt.It is not like one episode has great art but in the next episode,the quality drops,no...It remains same throughout the series which is one of those lovable points of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs may bug some people on their first try at this anime(it bugged me for sure) but as u get used to it,it gets better until you start to love those.It is quite unique but once you get a hang of it,it becomes pleasant to look at.So....I give it a mega-solid 9 points for its beautiful and colorful art:P\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow,Even,in sound department,this anime shines as much as in others.When I first heard the opening song,I was like is it really a song?I mean it begins very randomly but as I listened it more as new episodes aired,I totally fell in love with it.It is so catchy and upbeat,totally the genre I like.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song changes  after 2-3 episodes so as to give each female lead,her own song.I love each and all of them but due to them being not used more than 2-3 times(except the last one,in which all the famale leads sing together),they are sadly not as memorable as they CAN be which is a slightly weak point of this series.\\n\\n\r\nNow,voice-acting...is SUPERB as well.I just love Shion,Kirara,Mao's,Megumi's(and lol everyone's) voice..(Seriously speaking)I\\n\r\nlove megu's voice the most.They have done a fantastic job so kudos to them.About the bgm...is it important in a slice-of-life?I don't think so..but it is still good.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's why,I give it,a mega-solid 9 points here as well for  lovable voice-acting by seiyuus and for OP and ED songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:-(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow finally the department where it shines truly...the character are lovable..I love all the characters.The only complaint I have that the imoutos don't get as much screen-time as they should get as they are so lovable.\\n\\n\r\nMao-chan..is the bubbly and mischievious club buuchou or in other words,club president(uhum,my translating abilities:P).She is short,has curly hair and is conscious of her short height.Well,she sure has it rough as she is called to be in elementary school by some people.She acts bossy but in truth likes the main lead very much so she gets shy easily but hate to show her shyness so that's why she acts bossy(there is a whole cycle man,T.T)\\n\\n\r\nMegumi is Mao's younger sister(but looks older..ahem).She is a sweet and kind-hearted girl who loves to make cakes and....make others drink a lot of tea especially our main male lead Kyoya or Kyoro(as called by club members)I don't like anime characters who are like her usually but she has a special magnet that attracts me to her I.She is super-conscious about her weight(both sisters have some thing to be conscious about,T.T), a pretty cute point of hers.\\n\\n\r\nShion,is a GENIUS!!... but lacks common-sense which is her MOE-KYUN point(:P)She has a lot of brothers who are as intelligent as her,each excelling in at least one field.She gets pampered a lot as one of her brother makes her lunch,dinner etc while other makes special kind of coffee for her etc,so she wants to eat things like hamburger etc.and drink things like canned coffee etc.She is pretty and lovable.\\n\\n\r\nKirara is the tigress of group(well she behaves like a cat and sometimes tigress) who loves to eat meat so she is sometimes forced to eat veggies by her younger sister which she eats...raw!(really)The meat which she eats..is a special kind of meat which only Kyoro has eaten.She speaks in very short sentences but can,surprisingly speak like a normal girl through cell-phones which is her super-cute point.\\n\\n\r\nKyoro,is our main lead who is super lucky to be in part of this harem..I mean who wouldn't wants to be there with all those amazing girls.He is very surprisingly beautiful as when he cosplays,he becomes a bishoujo,club members fear his this ability.Thats not all,he can transform into ORE-MAN.During this transformation,he gets Extra-Masculine,a fact due to which he is loved by fellow club members.His last skill is that he is super-good at hair-brushing which can \\n\r\nmake any girl MOE-KYUN.So all in all,he is a nice lead as he develops nicely throughout the series by acquiring his...fearsome skills...\\n\\n\r\nThere are other nice characters too.Tamaki is a newly recruited or more like...abducted girl who eats a lot and amazingly does not become..fatter.The imoutos(or in other words,sisters.Again my translating abilities,huhu) group which consist of Kyoro,Megu and Mao's and Kirara's sisters.The have a Gj-bu at their school as well.Who can forget the strongest women of the entire world i.e. Mori who is a maid at Megu & Mao's house.When she does that maid twirl as requested by Kyoro,I bet your heat will skip a beat.She does not age..and has a daughter just like her,a mystery that has not be solved ever.In a nutshell.I totally love the characters which you may have guessed by now(:P)This department is done splendidly sooo a giga-solid 10/10 from me:D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall(9/10):-\\n\\n\r\nI loveee it!This is an amazing series as it gets you on a ride full of fun and enjoyment.I laughed a lot and at end I got  teary(sob sob)After completing it,I just want to say\"Good Job\" to the studio which has done it(dogakobo is its name,i think..)Now for recommendation..I don't recommend it to those people who watch series based on its story as there is not much here.Contrary to it,I totally recommend it to people who,just like me,love to see those cute,slice-of-life sort of anime.If u are one of these,then go man(or woman,:P),watch it as u are missing a hidden gem which u may want to add in your anime list.So,what u are waiting for,watch it now.I promise that you won't be \\n\r\ndisappointed(:D)\\n",

            "content": "There is one word I hate to use to describe stuff, and that is boring. I mean, that's such a generic word. When something is boring, that just means that you couldn't get into it, as even bad shows aren't boring, they're just, well, bad. All bad shows aren't boring, but all shows that someone says are boring, they typically see that as a bad show. And no matter how much I hate to use that word, I cannot deny the word boring is a perfect word that sums up GJ-bu. \r\nGJ-bu is based off of a \u201c4-panel light novel\u201d (aka, a collection of short4 page stories) written by Araki Shin, who has done nothing else of note. It tells the story of a certain boy (Kyoya) who was apparently forced to join the Good Job Club, or the GJ-bu. This is a club who's purpose they never tell us, as most of the times they just sit around and do nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I mean nothing. Literally the whole show,one short scene at Kyoro's house, oh, and a small part at the cafe, happens inside that damn room .In a way it's like K-On, where all they do is eat and talk, but at least K-On pretended to have a story. GJ-bu just goes from skit to skit to skit. One skit they're combing hair, the next skit they're dressing up in swimsuits (yes, the beach episode doesn't even take place at a beach),  then they play doctor, then they look at Kyoya's sketchbook, and then they comb hair some more (every girl seems to get their hair combed in this show somewhere by the way). Sure they are a few connections and running gags, but most of those are not very entertaining and original (oh, the maid likes to spin! Mao is short and gets pissed a lot! The rich person doesn't know how to eat cup noodles! HAHAHA!). And everything about this show is not entertaining. It just abuses the characters' main traits over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nLet's take a look at them, shall we? They tried to make Kyoro the only sane man, which might have been nice, but his voice has no emotion at all in it and sounds so bored, and being the only sane man, his goal is mainly to comment on how absurd each situation is. He's the only boy in this show, making it a harem by definition, and it's true he does seem to go from girl to girl to talk, most obvious in the last episode. Then there's Mao, the tsundere, who is of course short. There's also Shion, the calm smart girl, Megumi, the calm reliable girl, and there's Kirara. She eats a lot, and due to the fact she's originally from Canada she speaks in fragmented Japanese, and not very often in the first place. There's also a green-haired girl thrown in about halfway through, but they barely show her anyway. She's just basically another tsundere though, so yeah. Two tsunderes and two calm girls. How entertaining.  There's also a maid, and three sisters that belong to random members of the cast. Those don't appear much though, and the only one that is okay is Kirara's sister, who can only speak in (bad) English but can write perfect Japanese on a white board. Which does make a little sense considering she could've just picked up kanji or something, but still.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices were rather annoying and tried to hard to just be the clich\u00e9 the character was and nothing more. On the music, I don't recall any from the show itself, but on the opening and ending themes... The opening starts out really neat with this cool rap... But then they start singing in these emotionless off-tune voices, and yeah, it sounds really bad. They are four ending themes for some reason, with varying degrees of how good those are (ending 1and 3 are bad, ending 2 is actually really neat sounding and 4 is decent enough I suppose).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation however was rather bad. The character designs weren't best to begin with, but at random times you could see thick black lines around them, which never looks pretty. And it seems the amount they move gets worse and worse every episode. They must of wasted too much money early on or something. \\n\\n\r\nI think GJ-bu might of worked as one of those 3 minute episode anime, but with full length episodes, it just gets boring so fast. I have seen a good amount of slice-of-life anime, and GJ-bu might be the worst one I've seen, with Kill Me Baby as its only true rival. If you enjoy the characters more than I do, then it's worth a watch, but I can't recommend this to anyone else.",

            "content": "Slice of life is always a very interesting genre, that can be portrayed in a majority of ways, considering the fact that life can be swayed into various situations and lifestyles.  We have the wonderful Anohana that depicts a more serious and tragic story on one hand, and we have Lucky Star one of the most well known slice of life's to date, featuring the daily live of 4 girls.  And, we have Gj-bu, an anime, that is, what I refer to as, a little ball of fun.\r\nStory (7/10): Speaking of Lucky Star, this anime Gj-bu, has an immense similarity to it.The story of Gj-bu is nothing special or new in the anime world.  To put it simply, it's about the daily \"club activities\" of the Gj club, a club that apparently, everyone in the school avoids for some odd reason.  The characters generally spend most of their time in their little club room world, and rarely leave the godforsaken place.  Not that that's wrong, but personally, I would like for them to leave the clubroom for at least a few minutes more, considering the fact that the total amount of screen time that was outside of the clubroom, doesn't even equate to the length of a single episode.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the amount of screen time outside the clubroom does show a little bit of lost potential, what goes on in the club room makes it up for it, tenfold.  Because the show is heavily relying on the character interactions, and it excels at it at that, there's no need for them to really leave in the first place.  The comedy that this show is probably known for, is created and harvested from their activities and random acts of wackiness, and therefore, we have this formula of (characters + activity = comedy) which turns out to work out VERY well for this anime.  While I won't say that this anime deserves any plot originality by any means, Gj-bu is pretty damn enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): Characters are where slice of life's really shine in.  This particular anime shines extremely brightly on the slice of life spectrum in the character category.  While the troupes of characters aren't necessarily original, (weight complex, very smart with low common sense, short tsundere) the anime does well in trying to set them apart from their normal roots.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, Kyoya, or Kyoro as he's more known for.  As literally the only guy to exist in this anime, (there's seriously no one else), I find him as a rather amusing character.  He plays off at first as one of those, \"what am I doing here?\" characters, but slowly becomes accustomed to his situation, and having fun with what he's doing in his spare time.  Now, I should mention that this guy is the butt of all jokes.  All of the characters tease him, he's the one getting abused the most, and you gotta hand it to him for enduring 2 years of pain from 4-5 girls.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the Gj club, we have a bramble of girls (not a harem...I think.)  Megumi, Shion, Kirara, and the ever so wonderful and terrifying, Mao.  And later, Tamaki.  While usually I dislike anime troupes due to their overuse and unoriginality, I really do like these characters.  Though they are based on something we've all seen before, they all have a very unique twist that adds in to the whole atmosphere to the show.  While no, I cannot explain what those twists are, I found all of these characters quite funny and extremely likable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also get a round of applause for this anime, specifically because of how good they are, in supporting character standards.  While yes, I did have a problem with them appearing in so late in the series, I didn't really mind them that much considering how much they all added to the show.  They were just as entertaining, and I found myself laughing a lot.  Overall, these characters are extremely likable, and VERY funny.  (There's 4 little sisters total.  5 if you want to include Tamaki.)  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art in this anime is a very interesting mix.  On one hand, we have the normal animation, which is this really strange half-chibi mix where the characters sort of look chibi, but they're not.  The other one is a straight up chibi art style that makes everyone a chibi.  Kind of weird considering that there are scenes where the tallest person in the room, and the shortest person in the room are the same height due to chibi logic.  Regardless, the animation does work really well for this anime, adding more to its comedic aspect, making it more joyful and overall, really fun to watch.  It has very light colors and a decent looking background, as well as distinct hair colors for every character so you know exactly who is who.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is your typical fast-paced music.  The OP is very catchy and fast, with a skippy beat that makes it easy to sort of dance along to.  The ED's vary from episode to episode, and all have their own distinct feel on every one of them.  There's also some pretty good piano tracks and some good sad music as well.  While the soundtrack is pretty decent, it's still your usual slice of life upbeat soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9/10): Whenever I watch anime of a repeated/overdone genre, I always try to find something that's different than the rest of the anime in that category.  If not, I dump it.  Gj-bu surprised me greatly because of just how addicting and cute the characters were as I was watching it.  It has this really unique touch to the typical slice of life that I cannot explain, which probably makes it why I enjoy this anime so much.  I laughed a great deal while watching it, and enjoyed every last ridiculous moment.  I wouldn't say this isn't the best slice of life's out there, (Clannad Afterstory takes that position in my opinion), but it is very fun to watch, and a fun way to kill time.  While sadly, this anime does not get a season 2, I still enjoyed it to the fullest, and promised to rewatch it any time I want to.  The characters were great, the art was pretty good, the soundtrack and story were done before, but I would highly suggest it to anyone who loves a good and fun little series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.05",

We follow the characters in their daily club activities and watch what they are doing as the days go by and how they interact with each other. The story has only 1 male character (which is a quite weak one) and multiple female characters so be prepared for some harem-ish development. \\n\r\nThe development for the whole series is not really explored too much which is a shame because it has good potential with its characters. The character development is all right for a show which focuses on humor much more than on telling a story. \\n\r\nThe anime delivers great humor with fantastic characters that interact very well with each other and makes sure it doesn't get too slow and heavy and loses the audience. \\n\r\nA great show that I enjoyed from start to finish and that is why I give this anime an 8.",

It\u2019s kind of like Shitposting: The Anime.\r\nTo be the honest, there\u2019s really no reason to watch this anime. It\u2019s your basic slice of life but the jokes aren\u2019t really funny. I only chuckled at like 3 gags and I\u2019m not even exaggerating.\r\nThe characters are just an ensemble of cliches and stereotypes that somewhat click well together, I guess.\r\nThis anime is a 4/10 for me. There aremany moe-blob slice of life shows out there that are much better than GJ-bu. Prime examples are Lucky Star, Nichijou, Kill Me Baby, and Yuru Yuri. Go for GJ-bu only when you\u2019re bored out of your tits and have already seen the aforementioned shows and some. Maybe you\u2019ll like it more than I did. Comedy is subjective, after all.",

However, in spite of myself, I enjoyed the anime quite a bit. It proved to be entertaining and had some good laughs in it. All in all, if you aren't obsessed with any other anime right now, and don't have any you REAAALLY want to start, this is a great anime to kill some time with.\r\nStory:\r\nI gave it a 5, because, well, there was none really. Just the base: A high schooler gets forced to join an all-girl club that really hasno honest purpose. The club is just a hangout, really.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very unique. The wide, bright color palette keeps a cheery \"background mood\" throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything in the sound that stood out to me. But it fit in with the action just fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters. Each one had a set, defined, and unique personality. But, none of the characters changed through the entire anime, with the exception of a couple slight changes to Kyouya's and Mao's personality, mostly because Kyouya gets used to being there and more comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is really the only reason to watch the anime, and the artwork is a plus. You should get a few good laughs out of this anime, and the interactions between the members are quite charming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, the anime provides some nice enjoyment and relaxation. But unless you have some extra time to kill, or really need a break from all the action and complex plots, there's not much else reason to watch it.",

Tamaki is another main character (even though im pretty sure she came more later in the anime) im pretty sure shes a decent character also she carries a camera around all the time a decent character. Shion is another female lead and she is a geniuses in her family and to describe her she is pretty nice and whatnot. Megumi is another female lead she is also the sister to Mao she pretty much is like the different  of Mao cause she is matured refined and stuff like that to describe her she is a pretty nice and going character just don't ask her about her weight. Mao is another female lead and she is pretty much a wild one but a nice on at that she does pick on Kyouya a lot of the time to describe her more like the whole cast her just a nice and going person. Kirara is the last main person in the anime and she pretty much is a cat like person she has cat ears and also she pretty much eats nothing but meat all the time to describe her she is like the muscle of the group awhile also being a good person. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: what i liked about the anime: from what i remember about it the comedy was really well done and also the fact that the characters and also the art were really well done as well as the VA's being really good for there roles. What i didn't like: the Op and Ed were decent at best not the greatest though and also wish they would have went out more instead of being in one room the whole time but that wasn't that bad just a knack if anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: id give this a 8 the comedy in this was really well done to the art and also the Va's doing really well for the roles that they were giving in this anime the thing i didn't really care for are more knack's again if anything but again the anime is really well done and would diffidently recommend it.",

The characters are all acted extraordinarily, and their interactions and scripting is top-notch. They have become part of me.\r\nWhen I watch this show, I clear a little place in my heart for all the characters, and it's like everything they do is orchestrated just for me, to give me what I crave: sweet, kind, funny interaction between people who really care about each other. This was a show that was made with love. The restaurant scene shows this perhaps the best,but there are dozens, and maybe hundreds of little moments that are acted out and drawn with such care and attention. Not so much attention to detail, but attention to emotional impact. I have never been so emotionally satisfied by an anime as I have been by GJ-bu. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of others that satisfy me in other ways, but as for that feeling of contentedness after the show is over, none have beat GJ-bu. Angel Beats could have done it, but that ending... ouch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not making a career out of writing reviews, so I'll just leave it at this, the core of what I had to say about this fantastic, endearing, heartwarming, and hilarious show. If you enjoyed Nichijou, Lucky Star, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, you will certainly enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nI'll add this one little detail: if at all possible, watch it with headphones on. There are many genuine ASMR moments interspersed throughout. (That's why it got a 10 for sound, mostly)",

So i decided to actually watch the short small video of GJ-BU then judge it. But i came to realize that the art was JUST SOOOO good and the voice and the characters overall are soo \"lively\" i felt the URGE to actually watch a few more then i told myself \"know what i mind as well watch this\". So i ended up watching it and actually finishing it. And based on the anime my personal opinions are different from other butfirst off the Story itself really doesn't have a \"plot\" the scenes are always from a different time of the day and one scene doesn't last as long too. I FELL in love with the art it's SOOo good and beautiful it's innocent which matches along with the story and characters. The sound is also really good it just FITS in place with everything else. CHARACTERS on the other hand have flaws First off the story never really explains the characters In FULL detail but you basically understand them already. Also the way some characters are introduced are random and kind of bad but it doesn't stop the anime from being enjoyable. My overall with this ANIME is a 9 because once i graduated from my highschool i do somewhat miss my highschool activities and classes so this anime brought back Nostalgia. I definitely recommend this anime to WHOEVER like slice of life, school and a little bit of harem",

            "content": "First off, let me say that I am very light on anime, as I generally really like anime that others don't like so much (Basically, if I watched it I really liked it, with few exceptions) , so this review should be taken with a grain of salt\r\nCharacters: GJ-Bu was overall pretty good, but it had so much potential, especially the characters (Like Kasumi), which the never-progressing style of the show did nothing for (Kasumi needed more air time!).\r\nIt has a lot of good characters (Kasumi) and several of them more than deserved true development beyond forming their personalities and quirks. In short, the onlything this show is missing is true story development (Well, and more Kasumi), which is kind of what this type of show does, so I forgive that. Even the characters you don't particularly like you can't help but not hate. They all have good qualities and give something to the show, whether it's mostly comedy, or mostly cute moments, not of them are just there as glue to keep the show together.\\n\\n\r\nSound&Art: The art and sound are nothing special in particular, but they are nice, and the style of art suits the genre of show, so there won't be any of that \"This is a good show, but the art isn't quite right...\" feeling you can get from some anime. (In short, Kasumi Kawaii!!!)\\n\\n\r\nSetting: The show takes place almost exclusively in one room, but unlike many shows that do this, it's not EXCLUSIVELY in one room. The characters are occasionally seen in different places (For example, Kasumi is seen out on the street, and reading in her brother's room). This helps you to get the feeling of the club atmosphere because you're there so often, but not to feel like the show is trapped or that it is being \"acted out\" by the characters. It feels natural to be in that room because it's not constant, but you still always get carried back (I want to carry Kasumi back...).\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Feelings (Rant): This show was very good, but I can't help but feel like I missed out on a masterpiece. GJ-Bu had so much potential that it hurts to see it stand where it is. If there was more development in the story, and it focused more on the protagonist and his relationships with the heroines, then this show could have easily been rated a ten. In particular if the protagonist, Kyoro, and the apparent main heroine, Mao, had developed some sort of serious relationship during the show, and if Kasumi was more than a short appearance every once and a while, this show would be through the roof. Mao is where I feel really disappointed in the show because she is such a great character and had so much potential, but was seemingly given the \"Never growing, never changing\" curse by the writer. Mao could have easily been the best heroine of the year, but the type of show didn't allow for it. All I can hope is that some fan of the show or novels creates a doujin to give the characters the story they deserve, and that I can find it...quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading through my rant...",

            "content": "Being as frank as possible, I found the Winter 2013 season to be quite weak, despite having a lot of bright and colourful ideas. The majority of them only proved to be average, slightly above even, and they definitely won't be memorable for long. Now, this talk may portray to be a little irrelevant and bias (and apologies if it is), but the point I want to get across is that I was hoping that 'at least' one show in the season would be in a state without having to be stalled, being both enjoyable and interesting every episode and with no actual problems draggingit down. In other words, a hidden gem.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully there was one, and funny enough it's about a school club with absolutely no purpose or theme whatsoever. Wait, what?\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is about... as stated earlier, nothing. Kyouya is in a club called the 'Good-Job Club', and their activities involve having various discussions, eating food, laying around the room being struck by lasers of heat, biting each other, lewdly brushing hair, bringing little sisters in and many more things. The other members of the club are four girls; the childish club president Mao who has a short-temper, the refined angel-like Megumi, the genius Shion lacking common sense and the mysterious cat-like Kirara.\\n\\n\r\nYou'd probably be thinking that... it sounds like a pretty generic slice of life without actually anything going on, which would naturally sound really boring to watch. To top it all of though, it sounds like a harem! There's no doubt it's harem-like with the boy:girl ratio of 1:4, and you'll probably agree that nearly all harem shows fail to be remotely good. And guess what? I found this much more interesting than all the other shows, and I'm not close to devoted with slice of life shows in a school setting. So... how, and why, did I find this more entertaining than the rest of the season?\\n\\n\r\nBecause GJ-bu does something a lot of normal slice of life shows fail to do - restraining from pushing itself to far.\\n\\n\r\nOr in other words, it didn't try to hard to be what it is. GJ-bu acknowledges fairly well that it's a full slice of life series with the given setting; there's no unnecessarily technical writing involved and it doesn't forces the contents or intentions of the show onto the audience in a demanding way - it just does what a slice of life is supposed to be. It really does take a slice of one's life, and converts those everyday actions into animated form. Because of this, everything feels natural, both pacing and scenery, and without having to feel boring too. None of the jokes feel dragged, and neither does the dialogue, so the conversations and spacelessness you'd feel in real life are portrayed rather nicely here.\\n\\n\r\nBut who wants to watch some guy's life in a club in the first place? Who'd find that interesting? Which brings me to my second point. The natural flow in the entire show gives of a really, really lovely relaxing pace. The pacing does feel rather slow at times, but because nothing is so dragged along or forced, it makes the audience quite relaxed whilst watching each episode, and so the slowness isn't something to be weary of (well, depending on your preferences but I'll mention that later). Although the speed of the pace is noticeable when you start the series, it starts getting less obvious and time starts to fly by so swiftly you'd be completely used it over the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, looking at a specialist's point of view, GJ-bu really isn't that unique at all. It just stands out because it does what most slice of life anime doesn't do, and that is to keep the viewers actually engaged without a plot in mind instead of building up their bore meters. The show is just about five members in a non-specified club, enjoying their time there whilst they can, so if anyone is expecting some actual plot, romance, drama, tragedy, deaths, epicness, inspiring moments and so forth, then I'm afraid your expectations are at risk (though, there is a sweet semi-closure which was done really well). But if you thought that it'd be a bore-pumper and something immensely non-memorable whilst choosing your seasonal shows (and, admittedly, that was me), then you should pretty much give this a go for a change of pace, and especially if you're a big fan of the slice of life genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation isn't so remarkable as from the outside, but during the course of the show the art department actually does get handled as greater than what you'd expect. On one hand, the budget doesn't seem so noticeable and it's understandable since it's a slice of life. The outlines of the characters can be inconsistent in terms of thickness, which is a rather rare problem in anime in general. On the other hand though, there's certain scenes where the budget goes remarkably high, in both backgrounds, atmosphere and animation (which applies to 95%+ of the last episode). Regards to the budget, there's no rubbish or quality moments in which effects the series in any way. Talking about animation, the area which it's taken in full consideration is the EDs, which used the budget pretty wildly.\\n\\n\r\nWell actually, scratch that. GJ-bu wins for the best ending sequence in 2013 so far. And second place. And third place...\\n\\n\r\n...and fourth place too. The anime consists of four ending sequences, one playing every two episodes and the fourth one playing throughout the second half of the show. Each ED is based around a certain character or two, provided with a theme; the first ED being based around the Amatsuka sisters (Mao and Megumi), the second being based on Shion, the third being Kirara's ED and the last one centered towards the entire club. The collection of EDs varies in the type of songs and mood, being from extremely high-spirited with a fast-paced rock style, to a more contemplative mood in J-Pop form. All four songs are outstandingly well-composed, being catchy and vibrant in their own ways, and the studio probably blew 90% of their budget in the EDs to make them as visually attractive and fluent as possible, even coming with a unique summer atmosphere and funky dancing. They're extremely fun to watch and I doubt you'd regret having downloaded the full songs of all four endings, because I know I didn't regret it.\\n\\n\r\nSo... in conclusion, the four EDs are the best parts in the animation and sound department, in both the entire show and the Winter season. Woops, it seems like I dedicated a whole paragraph to the GJ-bu endings, so I should start on the actual sound department now. Uh... anyway, the opening sequence plays throughout the entire show, sung by the main VA cast. It's a really catchy up-beat song, and probably not so unexpecting in a slice of life. A lot of the time the OST doesn't play, mainly for the cause of the relaxing pacing and atmosphere. The soundtrack isn't at all incredible in stand-alone, but they're very cutely composed with simple and/or retro instruments, fitting the very light mood for the show. The voice actors do a good job (haha pun) with the characters, generally fitting well in their roles. Not to mention that several of the voice actors are actually teenagers, the youngest being Kirara's VA, at the age of thirteen.\\n\\n\r\nNow, despite the relaxing mood and atmosphere to the plotless show, it couldn't be as interesting as it is with just the aspects I described several paragraphs ago. Of course, we can't have a club without its members!\\n\\n\r\nNearly the entire cast consists of female (the male being Kyolo, the main character), and they're divided into two groups; the members of the GJ-bu, and the little sisters of those members. Let's introduce the main members the second (or third?) time, since I think it's a little necessary too; there's presisdent Mao Amatsuka, the orange one, who acts rather childish despite her rich background, and bites Kyolo when she's angry. But her younger sister is quite the opposite - Megumi Amatsuka, the pink one, is both refined and well-mannered, described almost as an angel, although it's not the case when it comes to weight. Shion Sumeragi, the purple one, is somewhat clever in lots of ways, but it seems common sense isn't her strong point. And then there's Kirara, my personal favourite member. She acts less human and more cat, structuring her sentences uniquely, and does lots of things the other members don't usually do, like eating meat all the time. And of course, we can't forget to mention Kyolo, our main man. He's presented in the series as a kind, caring and laid-back guy, though usually questioning whatever actions the other members perform (and usually on him too).\\n\\n\r\nOh and there's the green one. She doesn't appear in the beginning though.\\n\\n\r\nAll of the members are, firstly to say, stand-alone in their own way. You get a variety of personalities (and hair colours), and each have their own qualities for themselves in which both benefits and non-benefits them. However, it's the way they're presented that fleshes out the personalities further - The features of each individual becomes clearer and fresher with certain tropes and actions happening on-screen. Basically, the characters are in a club room, talking and in different ways interacting with each other. Whether it's conversations or actions, each individual would perform any kind of action which adds up as the evidence of one of the features in the characters, and it fleshes out into the characterization of the members (some of those actions may reveal one of the tropes at first shot though, depending on how obvious the feature is). In other words, characterization happens in the course of events, rather than having them explained, which feels both natural and less lazy.\\n\\n\r\nThe more fun thing about this though is that each of the characters has quite distinct personalities and different features, fears, knowledge, preferences and so on compared to each other, so it's pretty fun seeing them hang round together as a group. You get a lot of times when they all agree to tease Kyolo in the most entertaining way for them to watch, and then scenes where they all take their turns to do a certain activity, from having their hair brushed, to arm-wrestling, to guessing whatever picture Kyolo drew and so on. There's no real hatred, drama and problems going around in the GJ-bu, so it's hard to start hating a character in the series, though of course it's not the case for everyone. Also, need to mention development. Well, there isn't much development since the anime starts during the middle course of Kyolo's time being in the club, but he does get a well-hidden development in the entire series, to both towards the other members and personality. It's just not so easy to notice and stretched out.\\n\\n\r\nDid I enjoy GJ-bu? Considering that the entire show felt really natural and relaxing, and seeing each characters with different kinds of features interact with each other and Kyolo, of course I did. I had a really hard time debating whether or not to rate GJ-bu a solid 7 or a low 8, but it seemed like it was the latter (though honestly, I still can't decide). For anyone who just regarded this as some moe anime with really bland episodes might want to give this a second thought; this was the only show I started in the season which I didn't decide upon my full plan for the season, and it turned out it was the only show I actually thoroughly enjoyed in the entire show. If it wasn't for my brother I would've never encountered this gem, so it was lucky I didn't pass on this. GJ-bu was a enjoyable and relaxing ride for me, and it seems like I've grown fond to the series more than I expected to be.\\n\\n\r\nI just wish that more school slice of life anime was like GJ-bu.",

It reminds me a lot of several other slice-of-life anime like Lucky Star, Working!! or Acchi Kocchi. Why? Well it's mostly because GJ-Bu doesn't seem to have a real plot of its own.\r\n But despite that, I find it entertaining. Sure, there's no story behind it. But seeing Kyoya and the stuff that happens with the girls in the club room? I can't help but smile while watching it.\r\nThe art is bright and colorful. The anime screams a rainbow of colors, which is a good thing. It's also clear and the animation flows rathersmoothly. \\n\\n\r\nI personally like the characters. Though, Mao reminds me (in a way) of Aisaka Taiga from Toradora. But all the characters can easily be described as \"Kawaii.\" Maybe that's a personal opinion, but I'm sure a lot think that way. \\n\\n\r\nI don't really see anything to dislike this anime for. Maybe I missed a few things, but small things won't stop me from watching good anime.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is still airing, so there's more to be expected. I don't know where this anime will lead to-- but for now I'll give it an 8/10",

            "content": "GJ-bu is part of a sub-genre of slice of life which encompasses K-On, Yuru Yuri and others. These shows spend most of their times showing characters on a club usually doing absolutely nothing, whether because they skip club activities or because the club activities have no real purpose. They are usually hard to review due to few complexity in plot and characters, but it's not like it's non-existent. GJ-bu, however, takes this to extreme measures.\r\nNow, before you argue that the quality of the story is irrelevant, consider the following. If GJ-bu wants to show cute girls (and a boy, though on the verge of beingconsidered a girl as well) doing nothing but random stuff, then first it must get the viewer to actually care about the girls, otherwise it's just irritating rather than endearing. That's what good storytelling does, by offering a bridge between the world, including its characters, and the viewer. The problem is... this show doesn't have good storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nWhile most shows at least try to construct a basic conceptual setting for the story to take place, this one decides it doesn't need to. Instead, we are thrown into the middle of an unknown place, with anonymous faces doing strange things we don't understand. Who are they? What are they trying to achieve? How do they relate with each other? There are many other questions, but these are the least you have to answer to convince the viewer that your characters are humans and not moeblobs walking around. GJ-bu's characterization is done through a few dialogues there and here and a few, very few, scenes outside the club. That's all you get.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe the story just wasn't well executed, but the characters could still be good, right? Indeed, conceptually it's possible to elaborate interesting characters, but fail to fulfill their potential in practice. That's not the case of GJ-bu, which defines its characters in terms of clich\u00e9d stereotypes and refuses to give them any further depth. It's not that they lack back-story or psychological investigation, they just weren't meant to have any complexity to start with.\\n\\n\r\nOne-dimensional characters can be done well as long as they remain entertaining and/or charismatic, but to do so they must have interesting features and interactions with other characters. Characters from GJ-bu just do the same things over and over again, taking for granted the viewer's interest because of the cute and silly things going on. There's pretty much nothing fresh about the scenes, since they revolve around stereotypes doing their things.\\n\\n\r\nAs one would expect, if the storytelling is bad and the characters are poor, the jokes aren't exactly a masterpiece of humor, specially because they rely heavily on the characters. Shion, for instance, is very knowledgeable about many topics, but lacks common sense, as the stereotyped genius she is. That's it, there goes about 90% of all jokes about her, and not particularly creative ones. Oh, eventually she reveals that she would like to have a younger sister and has Tama fulfill that role because it's cute.\\n\\n\r\nYes, \"because it's cute\" and \"because the public's desires must be satisfied\" seem to be the main driving factors for GJ-bu. You've got tsunderes, maids, all kinds of hair colors, cat ears, little sisters, foreigners, heck, there's even cross-dressing for the girls and Kyoro. Everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer through a specific stimulation. If the show had used at least half of the time spent on this planning towards making the characters and their context actually interesting, a great deal of its problems would have simply disappeared.\\n\\n\r\nNow that we've got the bad things out of the way, let's focus on the bright side. Since visual appeal is relevant to GJ-bu's purposes, it tries to build its own style, as colorful, cute and comfortable as possible. These efforts are mostly successful, but the character designs are easily forgettable, nothing you haven't seen in other moe shows, and the animation is only average. As for the soundtrack, it's pretty catchy, and a lot of effort is put into the ending's themes... still, they end up sounding quite generic as well. As a whole, though, the production values are all right.\\n\\n\r\nNow, after all of this, it could be concluded that this show is lame and boring, incapable of doing anything remarkable on its own. Well, there's nothing remarkable for sure, but surprisingly, it's still enjoyable. That's the ultimate secret of GJ-bu: it knows what it's doing. It was previously said that everything is meticulously engineered to appeal the viewer, and this becomes evident as the show goes on.\\n\\n\r\nGJ-bu's focus on quantity rather than quality may lose points in artistic and creative value, but it's an important trade-off. You don't like this girl? Oh, then have another, and another, and another, all with distinct specifications, until you have one that you like. The stereotyped personalities are very helpful because otherwise it would be difficult to do this. Real people have common mindsets and physical attributes due to sharing the same environment, many have similar goals and ideologies, are constantly changing or trying to change, show different sides of themselves depending on the context... Stereotypes, on the other hand, are static, simple, and make sure that two characters will be as different as possible.\\n\\n\r\nBut surely there must be at least one grumpy old man who isn't charmed by any of the show's attempts, right? No problem. It may sound crazy, but GJ-bu doesn't deliver enjoyment solely from the viewer's love; hate is also effective. The series tries so hard to be cute and funny with its endless list of clich\u00e9s, shallow characters and situations, fetishes and repetitive jokes that it turns into a laughable parody of itself for those who are not amused and become increasingly cynical. For example, the fact that the maid spins around every time she appears may either be seen as endearing or a pathetic attempt at being endearing. Both are acceptable, because GJ-bu doesn't care if it's being loved or hated, as long as it's not being ignored.\\n\\n\r\nGJ-bu is, quite literally, an anime for everyone. It has generic written all over it, but you end up either loving or hating it because it goes so overboard in applying all sorts of tested formulas. Truth be told, if you are a fan of this kind of series, has no problems with underdeveloped characters and poor storytelling, and want something with a sort of relaxed atmosphere and all types of cuteness, then try GJ-bu, as it probably won't disappoint. Otherwise, it's not advised to take the risk, but the show could be good for a few laughs; if not genuine, then mocking.",

            "content": "\"Slice of life anime have always interested me.Watching some random anime characters doing their everyday chores and spending their life carelessly reminds me of my own life.The life which is spent in search of those small moments of happiness.It remind me of me having fun with my friends and family.There are sad times too but there are other happy moments as well.After all,life is not completely about joy and pleasure.We have to bear sadness as\r\nwell\"....So,before u get bored by my life lecture(which u are sure being,T.T),I better start my review which is about an hidden gem i.e. Gj-bu or in other words \"Good Job\"\r\nGj-bu huh,...whereto begin..When I first started watching,I didn't pay much attention to it.I didn't expect it to become THIS awesome as I was like\"Yeah,it is good..but there are other awesome anime too..\"But I was wrong.As i watched more,I got engrossed in it to a point that I began to wait for it every week unknowingly.After watching the last episode,I just couldn't take it as I realized that \"Man,I am in love with it.\"So I decided to write a review for this so that other people who are looking for some fun anime may give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nStory:-(8/10)\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all..about story..there is none...Well it is a slice of life anime,not much to expect in this department.After all,slice of anime are not about story,they are more about characters,fun,comedy and about creating an carefree environment in which a person can relax.They give us a hint of our everyday life in which this anime surely succeeds.I can this say this confidently that this will make you laugh a lot and you will grin in front of your computer(or laptop:P) screen countless times.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a NORMAL high-school boy who gets recruited in a random club in which there are no prominent club activities..They just relax,play around,get warmed up in kotatsu(when it is winter of-course),drink tea(a lot...),eat cakes etc etc.In other words,a dream-like club(I want a club like that,T.T).\\n\\n\r\nStory wise,it reminds me of Seitokai no Ichizon and Sket Dance which,just like it,are anime about everyday life of their respective characters.Above all,it is very natural.It is not artificial.There are some shows which try too hard to make their audience laugh but that is not the case here.There is a flow in dialogues of the characters and a person laughs even when he don't want to.\\n\\n\r\nSo,I give it a solid 8 score out of 10:)The only reason I cut marks is that this is a \\n\r\nslice-of-life anime and marks are bound to cut in such a kind of anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe art is just simply great.It is elegant,vibrant and colorful just the way I like.You can see the detail in everything.The backgrounds are also beautifully done.The best thing is that,art's quality remains constantly goodt.It is not like one episode has great art but in the next episode,the quality drops,no...It remains same throughout the series which is one of those lovable points of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs may bug some people on their first try at this anime(it bugged me for sure) but as u get used to it,it gets better until you start to love those.It is quite unique but once you get a hang of it,it becomes pleasant to look at.So....I give it a mega-solid 9 points for its beautiful and colorful art:P\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:-(9/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow,Even,in sound department,this anime shines as much as in others.When I first heard the opening song,I was like is it really a song?I mean it begins very randomly but as I listened it more as new episodes aired,I totally fell in love with it.It is so catchy and upbeat,totally the genre I like.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song changes  after 2-3 episodes so as to give each female lead,her own song.I love each and all of them but due to them being not used more than 2-3 times(except the last one,in which all the famale leads sing together),they are sadly not as memorable as they CAN be which is a slightly weak point of this series.\\n\\n\r\nNow,voice-acting...is SUPERB as well.I just love Shion,Kirara,Mao's,Megumi's(and lol everyone's) voice..(Seriously speaking)I\\n\r\nlove megu's voice the most.They have done a fantastic job so kudos to them.About the bgm...is it important in a slice-of-life?I don't think so..but it is still good.\\n\\n\r\nSo that's why,I give it,a mega-solid 9 points here as well for  lovable voice-acting by seiyuus and for OP and ED songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:-(10/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow finally the department where it shines truly...the character are lovable..I love all the characters.The only complaint I have that the imoutos don't get as much screen-time as they should get as they are so lovable.\\n\\n\r\nMao-chan..is the bubbly and mischievious club buuchou or in other words,club president(uhum,my translating abilities:P).She is short,has curly hair and is conscious of her short height.Well,she sure has it rough as she is called to be in elementary school by some people.She acts bossy but in truth likes the main lead very much so she gets shy easily but hate to show her shyness so that's why she acts bossy(there is a whole cycle man,T.T)\\n\\n\r\nMegumi is Mao's younger sister(but looks older..ahem).She is a sweet and kind-hearted girl who loves to make cakes and....make others drink a lot of tea especially our main male lead Kyoya or Kyoro(as called by club members)I don't like anime characters who are like her usually but she has a special magnet that attracts me to her I.She is super-conscious about her weight(both sisters have some thing to be conscious about,T.T), a pretty cute point of hers.\\n\\n\r\nShion,is a GENIUS!!... but lacks common-sense which is her MOE-KYUN point(:P)She has a lot of brothers who are as intelligent as her,each excelling in at least one field.She gets pampered a lot as one of her brother makes her lunch,dinner etc while other makes special kind of coffee for her etc,so she wants to eat things like hamburger etc.and drink things like canned coffee etc.She is pretty and lovable.\\n\\n\r\nKirara is the tigress of group(well she behaves like a cat and sometimes tigress) who loves to eat meat so she is sometimes forced to eat veggies by her younger sister which she eats...raw!(really)The meat which she eats..is a special kind of meat which only Kyoro has eaten.She speaks in very short sentences but can,surprisingly speak like a normal girl through cell-phones which is her super-cute point.\\n\\n\r\nKyoro,is our main lead who is super lucky to be in part of this harem..I mean who wouldn't wants to be there with all those amazing girls.He is very surprisingly beautiful as when he cosplays,he becomes a bishoujo,club members fear his this ability.Thats not all,he can transform into ORE-MAN.During this transformation,he gets Extra-Masculine,a fact due to which he is loved by fellow club members.His last skill is that he is super-good at hair-brushing which can \\n\r\nmake any girl MOE-KYUN.So all in all,he is a nice lead as he develops nicely throughout the series by acquiring his...fearsome skills...\\n\\n\r\nThere are other nice characters too.Tamaki is a newly recruited or more like...abducted girl who eats a lot and amazingly does not become..fatter.The imoutos(or in other words,sisters.Again my translating abilities,huhu) group which consist of Kyoro,Megu and Mao's and Kirara's sisters.The have a Gj-bu at their school as well.Who can forget the strongest women of the entire world i.e. Mori who is a maid at Megu & Mao's house.When she does that maid twirl as requested by Kyoro,I bet your heat will skip a beat.She does not age..and has a daughter just like her,a mystery that has not be solved ever.In a nutshell.I totally love the characters which you may have guessed by now(:P)This department is done splendidly sooo a giga-solid 10/10 from me:D\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall(9/10):-\\n\\n\r\nI loveee it!This is an amazing series as it gets you on a ride full of fun and enjoyment.I laughed a lot and at end I got  teary(sob sob)After completing it,I just want to say\"Good Job\" to the studio which has done it(dogakobo is its name,i think..)Now for recommendation..I don't recommend it to those people who watch series based on its story as there is not much here.Contrary to it,I totally recommend it to people who,just like me,love to see those cute,slice-of-life sort of anime.If u are one of these,then go man(or woman,:P),watch it as u are missing a hidden gem which u may want to add in your anime list.So,what u are waiting for,watch it now.I promise that you won't be \\n\r\ndisappointed(:D)\\n",

            "content": "There is one word I hate to use to describe stuff, and that is boring. I mean, that's such a generic word. When something is boring, that just means that you couldn't get into it, as even bad shows aren't boring, they're just, well, bad. All bad shows aren't boring, but all shows that someone says are boring, they typically see that as a bad show. And no matter how much I hate to use that word, I cannot deny the word boring is a perfect word that sums up GJ-bu. \r\nGJ-bu is based off of a \u201c4-panel light novel\u201d (aka, a collection of short4 page stories) written by Araki Shin, who has done nothing else of note. It tells the story of a certain boy (Kyoya) who was apparently forced to join the Good Job Club, or the GJ-bu. This is a club who's purpose they never tell us, as most of the times they just sit around and do nothing. \\n\\n\r\nAnd I mean nothing. Literally the whole show,one short scene at Kyoro's house, oh, and a small part at the cafe, happens inside that damn room .In a way it's like K-On, where all they do is eat and talk, but at least K-On pretended to have a story. GJ-bu just goes from skit to skit to skit. One skit they're combing hair, the next skit they're dressing up in swimsuits (yes, the beach episode doesn't even take place at a beach),  then they play doctor, then they look at Kyoya's sketchbook, and then they comb hair some more (every girl seems to get their hair combed in this show somewhere by the way). Sure they are a few connections and running gags, but most of those are not very entertaining and original (oh, the maid likes to spin! Mao is short and gets pissed a lot! The rich person doesn't know how to eat cup noodles! HAHAHA!). And everything about this show is not entertaining. It just abuses the characters' main traits over and over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nLet's take a look at them, shall we? They tried to make Kyoro the only sane man, which might have been nice, but his voice has no emotion at all in it and sounds so bored, and being the only sane man, his goal is mainly to comment on how absurd each situation is. He's the only boy in this show, making it a harem by definition, and it's true he does seem to go from girl to girl to talk, most obvious in the last episode. Then there's Mao, the tsundere, who is of course short. There's also Shion, the calm smart girl, Megumi, the calm reliable girl, and there's Kirara. She eats a lot, and due to the fact she's originally from Canada she speaks in fragmented Japanese, and not very often in the first place. There's also a green-haired girl thrown in about halfway through, but they barely show her anyway. She's just basically another tsundere though, so yeah. Two tsunderes and two calm girls. How entertaining.  There's also a maid, and three sisters that belong to random members of the cast. Those don't appear much though, and the only one that is okay is Kirara's sister, who can only speak in (bad) English but can write perfect Japanese on a white board. Which does make a little sense considering she could've just picked up kanji or something, but still.\\n\\n\r\nThe voices were rather annoying and tried to hard to just be the clich\u00e9 the character was and nothing more. On the music, I don't recall any from the show itself, but on the opening and ending themes... The opening starts out really neat with this cool rap... But then they start singing in these emotionless off-tune voices, and yeah, it sounds really bad. They are four ending themes for some reason, with varying degrees of how good those are (ending 1and 3 are bad, ending 2 is actually really neat sounding and 4 is decent enough I suppose).\\n\\n\r\nThe animation however was rather bad. The character designs weren't best to begin with, but at random times you could see thick black lines around them, which never looks pretty. And it seems the amount they move gets worse and worse every episode. They must of wasted too much money early on or something. \\n\\n\r\nI think GJ-bu might of worked as one of those 3 minute episode anime, but with full length episodes, it just gets boring so fast. I have seen a good amount of slice-of-life anime, and GJ-bu might be the worst one I've seen, with Kill Me Baby as its only true rival. If you enjoy the characters more than I do, then it's worth a watch, but I can't recommend this to anyone else.",

            "content": "Slice of life is always a very interesting genre, that can be portrayed in a majority of ways, considering the fact that life can be swayed into various situations and lifestyles.  We have the wonderful Anohana that depicts a more serious and tragic story on one hand, and we have Lucky Star one of the most well known slice of life's to date, featuring the daily live of 4 girls.  And, we have Gj-bu, an anime, that is, what I refer to as, a little ball of fun.\r\nStory (7/10): Speaking of Lucky Star, this anime Gj-bu, has an immense similarity to it.The story of Gj-bu is nothing special or new in the anime world.  To put it simply, it's about the daily \"club activities\" of the Gj club, a club that apparently, everyone in the school avoids for some odd reason.  The characters generally spend most of their time in their little club room world, and rarely leave the godforsaken place.  Not that that's wrong, but personally, I would like for them to leave the clubroom for at least a few minutes more, considering the fact that the total amount of screen time that was outside of the clubroom, doesn't even equate to the length of a single episode.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile the amount of screen time outside the clubroom does show a little bit of lost potential, what goes on in the club room makes it up for it, tenfold.  Because the show is heavily relying on the character interactions, and it excels at it at that, there's no need for them to really leave in the first place.  The comedy that this show is probably known for, is created and harvested from their activities and random acts of wackiness, and therefore, we have this formula of (characters + activity = comedy) which turns out to work out VERY well for this anime.  While I won't say that this anime deserves any plot originality by any means, Gj-bu is pretty damn enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10): Characters are where slice of life's really shine in.  This particular anime shines extremely brightly on the slice of life spectrum in the character category.  While the troupes of characters aren't necessarily original, (weight complex, very smart with low common sense, short tsundere) the anime does well in trying to set them apart from their normal roots.  \\n\\n\r\nFirst, Kyoya, or Kyoro as he's more known for.  As literally the only guy to exist in this anime, (there's seriously no one else), I find him as a rather amusing character.  He plays off at first as one of those, \"what am I doing here?\" characters, but slowly becomes accustomed to his situation, and having fun with what he's doing in his spare time.  Now, I should mention that this guy is the butt of all jokes.  All of the characters tease him, he's the one getting abused the most, and you gotta hand it to him for enduring 2 years of pain from 4-5 girls.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the Gj club, we have a bramble of girls (not a harem...I think.)  Megumi, Shion, Kirara, and the ever so wonderful and terrifying, Mao.  And later, Tamaki.  While usually I dislike anime troupes due to their overuse and unoriginality, I really do like these characters.  Though they are based on something we've all seen before, they all have a very unique twist that adds in to the whole atmosphere to the show.  While no, I cannot explain what those twists are, I found all of these characters quite funny and extremely likable.  \\n\\n\r\nThe side characters also get a round of applause for this anime, specifically because of how good they are, in supporting character standards.  While yes, I did have a problem with them appearing in so late in the series, I didn't really mind them that much considering how much they all added to the show.  They were just as entertaining, and I found myself laughing a lot.  Overall, these characters are extremely likable, and VERY funny.  (There's 4 little sisters total.  5 if you want to include Tamaki.)  \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art in this anime is a very interesting mix.  On one hand, we have the normal animation, which is this really strange half-chibi mix where the characters sort of look chibi, but they're not.  The other one is a straight up chibi art style that makes everyone a chibi.  Kind of weird considering that there are scenes where the tallest person in the room, and the shortest person in the room are the same height due to chibi logic.  Regardless, the animation does work really well for this anime, adding more to its comedic aspect, making it more joyful and overall, really fun to watch.  It has very light colors and a decent looking background, as well as distinct hair colors for every character so you know exactly who is who.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is your typical fast-paced music.  The OP is very catchy and fast, with a skippy beat that makes it easy to sort of dance along to.  The ED's vary from episode to episode, and all have their own distinct feel on every one of them.  There's also some pretty good piano tracks and some good sad music as well.  While the soundtrack is pretty decent, it's still your usual slice of life upbeat soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (9/10): Whenever I watch anime of a repeated/overdone genre, I always try to find something that's different than the rest of the anime in that category.  If not, I dump it.  Gj-bu surprised me greatly because of just how addicting and cute the characters were as I was watching it.  It has this really unique touch to the typical slice of life that I cannot explain, which probably makes it why I enjoy this anime so much.  I laughed a great deal while watching it, and enjoyed every last ridiculous moment.  I wouldn't say this isn't the best slice of life's out there, (Clannad Afterstory takes that position in my opinion), but it is very fun to watch, and a fun way to kill time.  While sadly, this anime does not get a season 2, I still enjoyed it to the fullest, and promised to rewatch it any time I want to.  The characters were great, the art was pretty good, the soundtrack and story were done before, but I would highly suggest it to anyone who loves a good and fun little series.\\n\\n\r\nOverall score: 8.05",

The characters were all \"cute\" static boring things. Though to be fair you cant do much with a short series except i feel like you can but I'm sure someone will make that excuse for it.

The story is like many others focusing on a club and its members which purpose is nothing really. We follow the characters in their daily club activities and watch what they are doing as the days go by and how they interact with each other. The story has only 1 male character (which is a quite weak one) and multiple female characters so be prepared for some harem-ish development. \\n\r\nThe development for the whole series is not really explored too much which is a shame because it has good potential with its characters. The character development is all right for a show which focuses on humor much more than on telling a story. \\n\r\nThe anime delivers great humor with fantastic characters that interact very well with each other and makes sure it doesn't get too slow and heavy and loses the audience. \\n\r\nA great show that I enjoyed from start to finish and that is why I give this anime an 8.",

It\u2019s kind of like Shitposting: The Anime.\r\nTo be the honest, there\u2019s really no reason to watch this anime. It\u2019s your basic slice of life but the jokes aren\u2019t really funny. I only chuckled at like 3 gags and I\u2019m not even exaggerating.\r\nThe characters are just an ensemble of cliches and stereotypes that somewhat click well together, I guess.\r\nThis anime is a 4/10 for me. There aremany moe-blob slice of life shows out there that are much better than GJ-bu. Prime examples are Lucky Star, Nichijou, Kill Me Baby, and Yuru Yuri. Go for GJ-bu only when you\u2019re bored out of your tits and have already seen the aforementioned shows and some. Maybe you\u2019ll like it more than I did. Comedy is subjective, after all.",

However, in spite of myself, I enjoyed the anime quite a bit. It proved to be entertaining and had some good laughs in it. All in all, if you aren't obsessed with any other anime right now, and don't have any you REAAALLY want to start, this is a great anime to kill some time with.\r\nStory:\r\nI gave it a 5, because, well, there was none really. Just the base: A high schooler gets forced to join an all-girl club that really hasno honest purpose. The club is just a hangout, really.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is very unique. The wide, bright color palette keeps a cheery \"background mood\" throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThere wasn't really anything in the sound that stood out to me. But it fit in with the action just fine.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nI liked most of the characters. Each one had a set, defined, and unique personality. But, none of the characters changed through the entire anime, with the exception of a couple slight changes to Kyouya's and Mao's personality, mostly because Kyouya gets used to being there and more comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is really the only reason to watch the anime, and the artwork is a plus. You should get a few good laughs out of this anime, and the interactions between the members are quite charming.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOverall, the anime provides some nice enjoyment and relaxation. But unless you have some extra time to kill, or really need a break from all the action and complex plots, there's not much else reason to watch it.",

Tamaki is another main character (even though im pretty sure she came more later in the anime) im pretty sure shes a decent character also she carries a camera around all the time a decent character. Shion is another female lead and she is a geniuses in her family and to describe her she is pretty nice and whatnot. Megumi is another female lead she is also the sister to Mao she pretty much is like the different  of Mao cause she is matured refined and stuff like that to describe her she is a pretty nice and going character just don't ask her about her weight. Mao is another female lead and she is pretty much a wild one but a nice on at that she does pick on Kyouya a lot of the time to describe her more like the whole cast her just a nice and going person. Kirara is the last main person in the anime and she pretty much is a cat like person she has cat ears and also she pretty much eats nothing but meat all the time to describe her she is like the muscle of the group awhile also being a good person. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: what i liked about the anime: from what i remember about it the comedy was really well done and also the fact that the characters and also the art were really well done as well as the VA's being really good for there roles. What i didn't like: the Op and Ed were decent at best not the greatest though and also wish they would have went out more instead of being in one room the whole time but that wasn't that bad just a knack if anything.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: id give this a 8 the comedy in this was really well done to the art and also the Va's doing really well for the roles that they were giving in this anime the thing i didn't really care for are more knack's again if anything but again the anime is really well done and would diffidently recommend it.",

The characters are all acted extraordinarily, and their interactions and scripting is top-notch. They have become part of me.\r\nWhen I watch this show, I clear a little place in my heart for all the characters, and it's like everything they do is orchestrated just for me, to give me what I crave: sweet, kind, funny interaction between people who really care about each other. This was a show that was made with love. The restaurant scene shows this perhaps the best,but there are dozens, and maybe hundreds of little moments that are acted out and drawn with such care and attention. Not so much attention to detail, but attention to emotional impact. I have never been so emotionally satisfied by an anime as I have been by GJ-bu. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of others that satisfy me in other ways, but as for that feeling of contentedness after the show is over, none have beat GJ-bu. Angel Beats could have done it, but that ending... ouch.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I'm not making a career out of writing reviews, so I'll just leave it at this, the core of what I had to say about this fantastic, endearing, heartwarming, and hilarious show. If you enjoyed Nichijou, Lucky Star, Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu, or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, you will certainly enjoy this one.\\n\\n\r\nI'll add this one little detail: if at all possible, watch it with headphones on. There are many genuine ASMR moments interspersed throughout. (That's why it got a 10 for sound, mostly)",

So i decided to actually watch the short small video of GJ-BU then judge it. But i came to realize that the art was JUST SOOOO good and the voice and the characters overall are soo \"lively\" i felt the URGE to actually watch a few more then i told myself \"know what i mind as well watch this\". So i ended up watching it and actually finishing it. And based on the anime my personal opinions are different from other butfirst off the Story itself really doesn't have a \"plot\" the scenes are always from a different time of the day and one scene doesn't last as long too. I FELL in love with the art it's SOOo good and beautiful it's innocent which matches along with the story and characters. The sound is also really good it just FITS in place with everything else. CHARACTERS on the other hand have flaws First off the story never really explains the characters In FULL detail but you basically understand them already. Also the way some characters are introduced are random and kind of bad but it doesn't stop the anime from being enjoyable. My overall with this ANIME is a 9 because once i graduated from my highschool i do somewhat miss my highschool activities and classes so this anime brought back Nostalgia. I definitely recommend this anime to WHOEVER like slice of life, school and a little bit of harem",

            "content": "First off, let me say that I am very light on anime, as I generally really like anime that others don't like so much (Basically, if I watched it I really liked it, with few exceptions) , so this review should be taken with a grain of salt\r\nCharacters: GJ-Bu was overall pretty good, but it had so much potential, especially the characters (Like Kasumi), which the never-progressing style of the show did nothing for (Kasumi needed more air time!).\r\nIt has a lot of good characters (Kasumi) and several of them more than deserved true development beyond forming their personalities and quirks. In short, the onlything this show is missing is true story development (Well, and more Kasumi), which is kind of what this type of show does, so I forgive that. Even the characters you don't particularly like you can't help but not hate. They all have good qualities and give something to the show, whether it's mostly comedy, or mostly cute moments, not of them are just there as glue to keep the show together.\\n\\n\r\nSound&Art: The art and sound are nothing special in particular, but they are nice, and the style of art suits the genre of show, so there won't be any of that \"This is a good show, but the art isn't quite right...\" feeling you can get from some anime. (In short, Kasumi Kawaii!!!)\\n\\n\r\nSetting: The show takes place almost exclusively in one room, but unlike many shows that do this, it's not EXCLUSIVELY in one room. The characters are occasionally seen in different places (For example, Kasumi is seen out on the street, and reading in her brother's room). This helps you to get the feeling of the club atmosphere because you're there so often, but not to feel like the show is trapped or that it is being \"acted out\" by the characters. It feels natural to be in that room because it's not constant, but you still always get carried back (I want to carry Kasumi back...).\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Feelings (Rant): This show was very good, but I can't help but feel like I missed out on a masterpiece. GJ-Bu had so much potential that it hurts to see it stand where it is. If there was more development in the story, and it focused more on the protagonist and his relationships with the heroines, then this show could have easily been rated a ten. In particular if the protagonist, Kyoro, and the apparent main heroine, Mao, had developed some sort of serious relationship during the show, and if Kasumi was more than a short appearance every once and a while, this show would be through the roof. Mao is where I feel really disappointed in the show because she is such a great character and had so much potential, but was seemingly given the \"Never growing, never changing\" curse by the writer. Mao could have easily been the best heroine of the year, but the type of show didn't allow for it. All I can hope is that some fan of the show or novels creates a doujin to give the characters the story they deserve, and that I can find it...quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading through my rant...",

The first episode didn't land for me so I kept watching and watching until I had finished the entire series.\r\nI felt like I had wasted my time with this one. Its like a dumbed down version of every Slice Of Life anime out there. Nothing really happens, there's no conflict, character development,obstacles or anything. This in itself is fine. but paired with the fact that these characters are so boring it just makes for 12 episodesof the same story told other ways. like every other Slice Of Life, its a pseudo harem with the brown haired inexperienced boy in an after school club filled with girls who have no reason to be drooling over categorized as a loser. buuuttt what ever. \\n\r\nA lot of the moments meant to be funny in this anime just aren't. We see multiple times (basically once an episode) the pink haired girl being the butt end to a fat joke. Thing is, shes not fat. But this is still the topic of discussion every single time. Most comments are weirdly sexist and it never just makes you laugh. There's no comic release relief or anything past a half baked characters who fill the anime stereotype.\\n\r\nIt just sucks, with such pretty art I really hoped the anime would've just been better, when it simply wasn't.",

            "content": "There is nothing particularly wrong with GJ-bu in terms of its general comedy, but what convinced me to give it a rating that I usually do not give out very often stems from the Kyolo torture porn. Also, lots of spoilers here, so read a different review if you just want a general thesis on the nature of the anime. This review is more along the lines of something you read after you have seen it and just want to read someone else's opinion.\r\nOh, and I will bring this up right now just to get it out of the way. How the hell did DogaKobo, being as little of a production company as it is, manage to acquire the rights to show the characters eating legitimate McDonalds onscreen, right down to the logo and bag being exactly the same? It is introduced right off the bat when you watch it and I found it to be quite hilarious. They even bring up Burger King and KFC, too.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, well the characters are distinct from each other, they resort to some pretty high extremes to torture Kyolo at times and none of these situations ever have him win. I know this is a common trope in anime, but the fact that Kyolo has no perverted traits about him whatsoever makes this pretty sad, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOh, and before I go on further about the anime itself, I also want to bring up the very cruel running gag where Kyolo asked one of Mao's maids, Mori, to twirl once for him. I thought this was just going to be a one-off joke where Mao teased Kyolo for asking a maid to twirl, but it got progressively worse overtime.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the maid decides to twirl whenever she sees Kyolo. He enjoys it, and was not asking her to do it. So, does this mean that he just gets teased every time he enjoys it? No, he gets tortured every time he enjoys it. I am talking sadistic smiles on everybody as they all kick him to the ground, effectively shattering the character development of a few of them; most notably, Megu, whom should come off as the innocent one of the club, but is willing to torture Kyolo the same as everyone else whenever her maid twirls for Kyolo on her own accord. This alone dropped my overall rating of the anime halfway through as I planned on giving it a higher one otherwise. I am not a big fan of torture porn that is unjustifiable. I will point it out again in case you forgot why I was upset over this:\\n\\n\r\n1) Kyolo only asked Mori one time to twirl for her and everyone simply teased him for it. Mori, again by her own accord, always twirled whenever she saw Kyolo and everyone always disrespected Kyolo for this.\\n\r\n2) More importantly, well Kyolo had a positive reaction to this every time she twirled, this was by no means a perverted one where he was drooling or anything. If you watched this, you know Kyolo is pretty innocent.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of, most of the KTP is heavily unjustified in this anime. He gets bagged on at random points for virtually no reason and it is almost always due to a spontaneous decision by Mao. On top of that, everyone agrees to do it and they take the sadistic torture part a bit too far on most, if not all of them. It gets rather tedious and, due to how stoic Kyolo is, you feel more sympathy for him than you do for the girls. In most harems, this is a common trope, but I have never seen it pushed so far like this. And in every other harem I have seen, the main male lead normally has an advantage in at least a few of the torture situations.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of Kyolo, I suppose I can finally dive into the positives now.\\n\\n\r\nWell, that is, after I bring up one more of the KTP bits. This one, in particular, convinced me that this anime was not worthy of a higher rating. Basically, in the episode, we find out that Kyolo drew honest descriptions of everybody in the room. The first one to be angered, Mao, is understandable because she was drawn pretty hilariously in is drawing and the usual brief, Mao exclusive KTP takes place.\\n\\n\r\nShion is next and her description is fitting, yet complementary of her main attributes. Despite this, she (somehow) gets enraged by this and steals Mao's shtick as she, too, gnaws at him. This was basically hinting that, even if his drawings were mildly offensive, he is doomed to at least some degree of punishment. Speaking of which, the same thing happens to Megu, though this is a little justifiable due to hers also being pretty offensive. And once again, they throw a character out of, well, character, and she leaps at Kyolo as well. Humorously enough, though, her gnawing has no effect at all and Kyolo just stands there confused.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, probably the only time Kyolo is actually shown a little sympathy, is when Kirara begins to attack. Knowing how strong Kirara is, seeing her bite Kyolo would be quite frightening and she aims for his head, effectively, yet slowly, shattering his skull; prompting Mao and Shion to actually step in and save him. Hey, at least they are not completely sadistic. They only aim to torture him to the point of death, not actual death.\\n\\n\r\nBut, anyway, back to Kyolo and, now, the positives. He is one of the most respectful male protagonists I have ever seen in a harem. He is not perverted in any way whatsoever (honestly, I doubt he was aroused by the maid twirling, so do not bring that up) and simply aims to help anyone in need. As I said before, he is stoic, but he takes it to the extremes; and even mentions in one episode that he chooses not to be angry with anyone. \\n\\n\r\nHe admits that he can get annoyed, but he would rather not upset the people around him. Now, if we had a Mao torture porn, I am all game for that. Little bitch does not deserve Kyolo's friendship and, until now, I have never gone so far as to call a female character in an anime a bitch, but this character rightfully deserves the title due to her actions being fully unnecessary almost all of the time. She is honestly worse than Yuna and that is a BIG statement coming from me since she is from my most hated anime.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other characters, well, as I said earlier, the KTP segments ruin what development they would have, but I will go more on that later. I will only bring up a few since most of them are pretty generic. Out of all the girls, I admire Shion the most as she is probably the most sympathetic towards Kyolo out of everyone else and she has the least creepiest smile during the torture porn scenes; hinting that, perhaps, she does feel bad for Kyolo whenever the KTP segments take place. Also, her intelligence was quite the funny running gag, as it referenced how little common sense she had.\\n\\n\r\nAnother positive were a few of the comedy bits. My favorite running gag is probably Yo-Man. I heavily admire how Kyolo is just able to transform into the generic bad-ass male protagonist whenever he wants, right down to sporting a bigger line (nose) on his face, the narrower eyes and even attitude adjustment. On top of that, with only one exception, he barely breaks out of character. I honestly wanted at least one of the episodes to show him be Yo-Man the entire time to see how disastrous it would be for the females. For instance, him successfully escaping the KTP segments or, after enjoying Mori twirl again, successfully blocks all of the kicks that approach him. If that episode was a real thing, I would rate this two whole points higher for that alone.\\n\\n\r\nBesides that, I loved it whenever Geraldine entered the room as her English was pretty enjoyable and that is a trait I do not often see in anime where a character speaks entirely in English. I have seen one where one of the characters can speak English, and that is still one of my favorite comedies. But, having one character exclusively speak it was interesting.\\n\\n\r\nUm, let's see, I also liked the segments where Shion would bring up one of her brothers and it showed all of them in silhouette form until she revealed what one of them did. All this really does is show the silhouette with tools for whatever task he does. For instance, if Shion brings up how one of her brothers usually cooked her breakfast for her, one of the silhouettes in the background would go to the front part of the segment screen and show his cooking tools. It was pretty enjoyable to me.\\n\\n\r\nNow, onto the neutrals. Being an anime centered on a club, I was not surprised to see the characters not leave the room whatsoever. That being said, I believe I have only seen a few of these, but the other ones at least had them occasionally leave the room occasionally whenever they decided to play a sport or something. I was a little disappointed that they were solely in the club room the whole time, besides one episode where Mao invited Kyolo out to eat so that she could have a kid's meal.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, I forgot to mention, but Mao falls under the \"younger than I look\" trope and is actually the oldest out of all the protagonists. Besides that, the last episode actually has Kyolo and Shion walk outside the school so that she could acquire a beverage. That is probably the last time they ever exit the school. Hell even the infamous \"beach episode\" that most anime have was not followed with this one. They just wore their swimsuits in the club room and that was it.\\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts on GJ-bu are that it breathed a lot of potential, delivered some really unique comedy at some points, but suffers due to the heavy amount of KTP which nearly prompted me to write a review after only four episodes to recommend not watching this. However, I stuck it out to the end and I do not regret it as it gave me a more balanced opinion, as opposed to just giving up on it and not seeing what else it had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nI will also bring up one more thing that, well, still does not justify Mao's actions. Megu always whispered to Kyolo how Mao usually did the things she did to him because she was \"shy\" or something like that. I suppose you could call Mao somewhat \"tsundere\" then with this logic, but barely. Her actions still do not make much sense.\\n\\n\r\nOh, one major thing I forgot to bring up was that nearly every new character introduced (all female, basically) always had some form of grudge towards Kyolo. The worst was probably Seira, whom had some of the most sadistic statements in the entire anime. Well the girls simply engaged in regular KTP most of the time, Seira was hellbent on killing Kyolo if he \"had his way\" with any of the girls. It was a bit dark for a comedy whenever she talked, too. A bit of a mix of cringe and fear.\\n\\n\r\nFear not, though, for this was also a part of one of its many unique traits. Seira apparently has a disembodied soul in her hair accessory that mutters dark thoughts for what we find out to be no reason whatsoever. Kyolo apparently just has to \"put up with it\" and Mao is the one that brings it up when she asks if she was hearing the voices as well. This probably could have been a lot more sadistic if Mao knew that Kyolo could hear the voice, but instead teased him about it.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on a bit longer, but I think I will stop here cause this is just a SoL after all and only twelve episodes on top of that. I can simply say it is an adequate comedy and if you want new offerings, but can tolerate an innocent character suffering a lot throughout the whole ordeal, then give it a go. I enjoyed it for the good bits it did offer, but they did not outweigh the bad bits enough to give it a high rating.",

            "content": "I have referred to GJ-bu as a great deal many things - a far better show than it had any right to be, the most solidly 7.5/10 show ever created, the anime equivalent of listening to a Matchbox Twenty song five times in a row on repeat - but what's most important to know going in is that this is not just a generic harem anime. It is THE generic harem anime.  If you have ever watched a harem slice-of-life and thought, \"Wow, I want more of that show,\" then you're in luck because this show is basically just a single serving of 'moreof that.'\\n\\n\r\nDo you want to know the plot of GJ-bu? There is no plot to GJ-bu. A boy is in a club that does nothing with a bunch of cute girls, and together, they have wacky shenanigans. That is all the plot there is. The very first scene is a silly skit, before you even know the character's names. This show does not waste time. If I had to summarize the experience of GJ-bu in one sentence, I would tell you that, in GJ-bu, there is a beach episode in which they never leave the changing room. It knows what you're here for, and it delivers it, streamlined.\\n\\n\r\nBeing nothing you haven't seen before doesn't a good show make on its own - in fact, that's almost entirely a negative more often than not - and GJ-bu knows that as well. The one thing this show excels in above all else is the little touches. This show is basically a love letter to every harem anime that came before it, and as such, all of its aping and classic gags come with that added degree of heart. It's sincere, more than anything, which is what bumps this up from a 7 to and 8 in my book.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves are able to tread the fine line between being wacky caricatures and relatable people like its nothing. The designs can be a little off-putting at first, with the technicolor hairstyles and sharp outlines, but it grows on you really quickly once it's all in motion, thanks to the talents of the animators at Doga Kobo. They're silly and cliche'd when they need to be for a joke, but there are plenty of slow, character-driven moments that exist only to give them just that tiniest little bit of necessary depth rather than aim for pure comedy all the time. The time spent giving them actual tangible personality really pays off by the time you finish the final episode, which is a marvelous send-off to everything the series had built up so far. The intention of these characters is not just to make you laugh - it's to make sure you miss them once it's all over.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the actual plot itself (or lack thereof), perhaps the single greatest part of the entire show is the animation and music for the ending credits themes. There are four total ending credits themes over the course of the twelve episodes - two episodes each for the first three and six for the final - and they are all nice in their own ways, with some of them even being spectacular. The first one is cute, the second one is astounding (featuring the always impressive vocals of Suzuko Mimori), the third is feverish and dance-inducing as all get-out, and the fourth is an endearing reminder of the way these characters get along together and only serves to underline the show's entire purpose. They're catchy, memorable, and they'll do a great job of keeping you watching to see the after-credits scenes (which are also a really nice touch and important to some of the impact of the finale, so don't skip them). Even if you don't end up watching the show, at least look up the ending themes; you owe yourself that much.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation... It's just fine. Go watch it.",

But that's the best way to sum up this anime, completely random. \r\nIt's very hard to write this review, as there isn't much really to comment on. It's a 12 episode comedy/slice of life with 1 OVA and has few flaws, but in my opinion is worth the watch. In this review, I will tell you why I believe this.\r\nI'd also like to start by saying that this anime has little romance, and no haremin it. So if you wanted that kind of thing, I don't suggest this anime. \\n\\n\r\n*This review will contain no major spoilers (There isn't much to spoil, as there is no plot line)*\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\\n\r\nTo put it plain and simply, there isn't one. It's about a group of friends having fun and doing crazy things in their clubroom, it's hard to comment over this because it has not plot line, and I recon you could watch the anime out of order and it would still make some sense. It shows high-school kids doing the unthinkable. The Slice of Life genre seems to be popular, so for those liking this genre along with comedy and you enjoyed animes like Lucky Star, this is a must watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art really was one of the animes strong points. In my opinion, the art was great. They used Chibi characters along with normal ones to emphasise a characters anger and frustration in that given moment. I loved the use of bright colors, and believed it gave the anime a much lighter look as it should have when dealing with this genre.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nI personally liked the soundtrack, nothing more to it.\\n\\n\r\nCharecter: 8\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters where different in many ways. Trying not to spoil it here but for instance, Shion. She is a genius, and your typical know it all. But when it comes to common sense, she lacks in some areas. Kind of relating to animes such as The Pet Girl Of Sakurasou, this makes for a funny and entertaining character. Every character is relatable to, (Except Kirara. If you can relate to Kirara, go see a doctor) and they all make the series more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was made to enjoy. I believe that this was a well executed anime, using the slice of life genre and comedy made it all the better. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI can understand why this anime gets hate. This anime is not for everyone and anyone, it's one of those animes that you either love or hate. I loved it, it was flawed, had no character development and no plot line or goal, but it was enjoyable and helped me take a break from all the normal, more depressing and sad anime I sometimes watch.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review c; It's only my second one, so sorry if you don't think it's at a very high standard q.q",

It basically takes place in a highschool club called the GJ club. I dont know how to spell any of the names so ill call them by there nicknames. It centers around a second year highschool boy named Kyoya. He gets into this club with a bunch of girls. The GJ club is supposed to be a club that endures challenges and festives.\r\nI think its a wonderful story. It really connects youwith all of the characters and its one of those animes where you feel sorry that its ending. I wish they would make a second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is basically the same as you would see in any of these highschool based animes so i dont have much to say. \\n\\n\r\nSound: ALL OF THE GIRLS ARE KAWAII SOUNDING",

I found decent enjoyment when watching this show, but it was lacking much momentum throughout the series. The story, so to speak, follows the club activities of of the GJ-BU club. I feel that the two most representative genre for this show are, without a question, slice of life and comedy. I went into the show expecting for an element of romance, but that was not found in this show. If you have the spare time, i feel this show is worth watching, but i wouldn't go out of my way towatch it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.4",

It's like a pie with no filling satisfying your appetite, an achievement without challenge leaving you fulfilled. I'd say it's is not for those who cannot forgo a deep plot, but I can't say I'm normally a fan of slice of life either, so why not give it a shot.\r\nThis anime, in my opinion, was nearly flawless with it's delivery. I give it an 8 because it did feel a little too slow at times, but the beauty of it is that the show never stopped moving forward. Itnever crow barred in needless romance or drama, stopping what little pacing these type of shows normally have. It put several people in a room together and let the them collide. For twelve episodes you see the GJ club live out there high school days together. Just living, the humor coming off of where these characters come together. They act, react, and grow, and every new episode leaves you wanting to see what they might do next, what new collision will occur. And by far my favorite part was it's ending. A conclusion came, and it came because it was not a farce I watched, a fantasy played out. It was people's lives, viewed through the eyes of this club.\\n\\n\r\nIt was a pie that left me more than satisfied, grinning the whole way through, excited for their victories, and deeply saddened when it ended. I couldn't have asked for more, and recommend it wholeheartedly.",

            "content": "Story: I got into this anime because of my friend in college, Neeraj. He's one of the only guys I know who is interested in shojo type manga/anime, and when he found out that was my favorite genre, he recommended me this. My other friends and I actually watched a few episodes together, and while they were watching Fate, I was in my room finishing this. There's not much story to this. It's basically about four girls and a guy in some made up club at their high school, and they do random shit. It's one of those. Normally, I wouldn't be up to somethinglike this unless it's super funny. This show is very funny, but there are some moments where I'm just, \"What the fuck is this shit?\" Something kept me from stop watching this whole in general, but I can't put my finger on what it is. It's not the best slice of life I've seen, but it's not bad either. I rate this portion an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is very cutesy because it's meant for girls, but guys can watch it, too (i.e. Neeraj). I don't see anything that distastes me in this department. I mean the evil looks on the girls' faces and the shocked expressions on Kyoya's are always enjoyable to see. I'd rate this 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: This anime has one opening and four endings songs. Two of the four ending songs and the opening are annoying as hell. They are so annoying that they aren't even enjoyable. The only songs I like in this anime are the second ending and the last ending that's played the rest of the episodes, starting episode I forgot. Out of those two, the last ending song is my favorite. For those reasons, I'd rate this a 6 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: There are five main characters: Kyoya, Mao, Megumi, Kirara, and Shion. Kyoya is the only boy in the GJ Club, and he's clearly the character who has to suffer through the girls' antics in every episode. It's slice of life, so you should expect crazy shit to happen. Mao is the president of the GJ Club, and she is the shortest girl, which you will clearly see that it's a shortcoming. Outside of school, she is seen as an elementary school student, which really pisses her off. Megumi is Mao's little sister, and she prepares tea for every club meeting. She is very cute, but she gets pissed off about her weight. I'm assuming Kirara is one of those American students that decided to live in Japan for her high school years. Her last name gives it away; plus, she has a little sister, Geraldine, who can really speak Japanese, but she writes in it very well. Then, we have Shion, who has a clan full of big brothers who are very good at the jobs they have. She's also a genius, but she hates to show it off. Out of all the girls, I would say that Mao is the most annoying. I know you're probably going to yell at me about why I'm picking on the leader of the club, but she says she hates being older and shorter than her sister, but she acts like a complete child. The other girls are enjoyable though. I rate this section 9 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not only is this anime a slice of life, it's also a comedy. Some of the activities Kyoya has to go through are very funny, but there are times when you feel bad for him because he didn't deserve to get beaten up or having to be the center of attention. Sometimes, they are hiliarous. Other times, you hate the girls for it. There are some moments when they make some female sex jokes, but I don't find them funny half of the time. Still, I'd go for 9/10 on the scale.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Adding the numbers up, the main score is a rounded up 8/10.",

Well honestly, I've watched Acchi Kocchi too and I felt that the premise and setting was also quite similar in a way... but somehow GJ-Bu exudes a different feel, which explains why I completed GJ-Bu but stopped Acchi Kocchi at ep 4 or 5. \r\nAnyways, about this show, it is basically a club activity, and its interesting main and side characters. It's about slacking around, but what makes this so interesting? To me, the story only got abit boring in a few moments of this series, since it treads on quite a narrow storyline (about a club activity and some relations). To be honest, I've never read the manga but I suspect it is a 4-koma since it seems to be quite episodic. This series isn't really comedy, but has quite a lot of funny parts. More importantly, it has some warm and fuzzy moments, kinda reminded me of Hobbes when I watch Mao or Kirara lol.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, in short, this is a show for people who like slice-of-life anime.",

            "content": "When i first saw this i knew it was going to be a show about doing nothing. \r\nThen i finally started to watch it, at first i was just so appauled at just how much nothingness was done and i decided to drop this anime. Around a week later I've decided to give this anime another go and man am i seriously glad i did.\r\nStory: 9\r\nWHAT STORY!??!?!?!? DON\"T NEED NO STORY TO BE GREAT\r\nArt: 8\r\nThe art in this anime was really calming, just looking at the characters just makes me feel at peace. EVERYTHING IS SO GOD DAMN MOE!\r\nSound:\r\nThe music that plays when Kyolo andthe bunch are doing random shenanigans really fits the mood of peacefulness and nothingness. It is great. Two tracks caught my attention though. The track that places where it represents the midway point of the show, I somehow found that track to be.....really catchy and is something i would hear in an action anime, It does not really fit this anime but somehow i am glad that it is there because every time it reaches the midway point i get all excited to hear that track because of how action-y it sounds. The other one was the ending song, the one that they used near the latter half of the show. I like that song. That is all....\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nKyolo- He's your average nice guy. There is not much to say other than he is a really calm and fun character to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMao-  And She's your typical Tsundere like chick that always likes to mess around with the main character. She also has a special attack, the turn to Chibi Mao and bite Kyolo. I always find myself giggling at that.\\n\\n\r\nShion- Once more, this character is pretty typical but even though typical, this is the type of character that i usually like in an anime filled with cute chicks. She is the smartest of the bunch and has this Ojou-sama-ness to her character. Everything she does seems sophisticated and well mannered. There are a lot of those kind of characters but Shion here lacks a lot of common sense which makes her a little bit different from the typical Ojou-sama character so it makes her just a little bit more interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi- Her character reminds me of a really nice maid. lol. She is never seen mad until Tama says how Tama doesn't get fat no matter how much she eats. Megumi gets jealous and you can see her pissed off face. It's quite funny.\\n\\n\r\nTama- To me she seems like a tomboy for some reason, probably because due to her aggressive nature. She refers to her self as Tama instead of \"Watashi\" or \"Atashi\" and i find that kind of quirky. \\n\\n\r\nKirara- Ohhh yeaa the most interesting character of them all. She is from England and she is super mutha F**king strong. The way she speaks is so interesting. All her sentences are just one word. An example, if she wanted to say, \"Hey guys i am hungry let's go eat\", she would say \"Kirara. Hungry. Eat!\" Oh and she also does what Tama does, refers to herself as her name, Kirara. When the three seniors who graduated at the last episode, Mao and Shion did a twirl for Kyolo, but what about kirara? Nope.... she does a back flip....... A F**KING BACK FLIP!!!! Man she is so interesting.. We need more characters like her in the future animes.\\n\\n\r\nJill- Kirara's sister. She speaks only in english. Short words. Mainly, \"My samurai master\" or \"master\" or \"sister\". She always carries a board and marker with her so she can write down Japanese for people to read since it doesn't seem like she can speak it well.\\n\\n\r\nKasumi- Kyolo's Imouto. She totally has a Brother complex, doesn't want kyolo to be manly. \\n\\n\r\nSeira- The youngest of the three sisters of the Amatsuka family. Her character is of a nice young lady but she has this demon mask thing that ...i guess speaks her inner thoughts or something.. Kind of creepy but yet cute..\\n\\n\r\nMori- YES THE EFFING MAID. She likes to tease Kyolo a lot and rides a motorcycle, A MAID ON A MOTORCYCLE. WOW.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: 8.5\\n\r\nI wish this site gave the option of point fives. It would alter alot of my anime scoring on my list. ANYHOW... I am really glad i decided to re-pick this up. I definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys really calming slice of life shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~Til next time\\n\r\nTomislol\\n",

            "content": "This is my first time writing a review. English is not my native language. please forgive me if I make any beginners mistakes.\r\nGJ-bu, a slice of life comedy. I began this series because I was bored, expecting it to be 'another' crappy harem series. Turns out it doesn't have allot of romance in it, but is really, an amusing comedy.\r\nMany slice of life series try so hard to be more funny than they actually are.. GJ-bu stands out, by not trying to stand out. in a good way.\r\nStory: 6\r\n  This series is mostly, just the main characters doing amusing things in their club room.They play chess, drink tea, eat unhealthy food.\\n\r\nThere actually isn't much more to this. Still, it was really fun to watch and I was never bored throughout the series. Each character has its own set of jokes and puns that go with it. Most series based around this concept tend to get old after about 6 episodes. GJ-bu managed to keep the same level of amusement the entire series. They didn't try to go over the top with their jokes and puns\\n\\n\r\nSince there is no real story line, but really well planned episodes. a 6 seems fair\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n  The art was surprisingly good. On close-ups the characters were double vectored and at a distance you are still able to make out what is happening. I really love the colors they used. The light warm colors give off a cozy atmosphere which absolutely fits the series.\\n\\n\r\n  The amount of angles from which the room was drawn is amazing. I didn't count them or anything, but I noticed I never really saw much of the same backgrounds.\\n\\n\r\n  There were no real unacceptable mistakes in the animation, characters nicely drawn, allot of variation for just one room. But no real extraordinary things. it's worthy of an 8.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\n  The Japanese characters were voiced well, they had voices fitting them.\\n\\n\r\n   The ones who supposedly spoke English had such a terrible accent. I wasn't sure whether they didn't have enough money to hire English VA's, they were making fun of the Japanese accent or if the characters were lingually-handicapped.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't a lot of BGMs, but the ones they did have added something to the situation. Making it more funny or serious.\\n\\n\r\n  I liked the beginning of the OP. It's not often that you find such a cheeky little rap. But the rest of the OP was completely average for a SoL highschool comedy.\\n\\n\r\n  There were 4 EDs which were rather catchy but nothing special.\\n\\n\r\n  Nice voice cast, OK OST, OP and EDs a 7 seems about right.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\n  The main cast consists of 6 characters. 5 girls and a boy.\\n\\n\r\n  Mao, The club president: A cheeky little girl. kind of bossy. She seems rude, but that is mostly because she likes the main character, Kyouya (kyoro). Again, this is not a harem series. they don't take her liking him to, too much of an issue. She spends most of her time keeping the rest of the club from being bored to death by annoying them.\\n\\n\r\n Megumi, Mao's younger sister: She may be the younger one, but is more mature for her age. in body and mind. I could still sense the Mao was the older sister. Mao is way more bossy and experienced in life (not in a sexual way). She spends her time making tea and baking cakes and cookies.\\n\\n\r\nKirara, the mysterious one: Most of the time, when there's a mysterious character in anime that character gets ditched or becomes annoying after he or she's not mysterious anymore. Kirara stays mysterious and interesting as the girl who eats meat and sits in the room. She spends her time eating meat.\\n\\n\r\nShion, the elegant one: She doesn't know much of the outside world and lacks common knowledge on food and other activities for ordinary people. luckily kyoro is there to support her on this issue. She spends her time playing chess.\\n\\n\r\nKyouya (kyoro), aka ORE-MAN: The protagonist of this story. He's the only boy in the good job club. all of the little stories per episode involve him.\\n\\n\r\nTamaki: Halfway the series, she was suddenly introduced as one of the main characters. It turns out her role isn't all that big. She's like mao in a lot of ways. the moment she was introduced was the moment I thought this series was going to suck. it didn't as her role isn't all that significant.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well balanced and don't get boring. Because of the insignificant role of tamaki I'm only giving it an 8.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series so much more than I thought I would. What I thought to be a generic SoL, turned out to be a good generic SoL. Good characters, nice art and not overdone.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n",

It is a simple, slice of life harem simply to be a slice of life harem.  It's a feel-good smile of a romp through the eyes of a high school club.  That's it.  It tries to be nothing more, and succeeds perfectly at that.  It doesn't go in too many directions and fall on all of them, it doesn't even try to go in one direction very far.  It is simple, cheery, and feel good.If you like harems and happy moments, definitely check it out, if you need action, mystery, adventure, or even a semblance of some sort of plot, steer well clear of this series.",

            "content": "GJ-bu is a very unique take on Slice of Life in which the majority of the story takes place inside of a club room of the characters' high school. In this room the characters share many hilarious times with one another and I simply could not stop watching once I started. This show is definitely something to be admired for; from the amazing characters that are the sole focus of the show to the setting which is used to even further develop the occasion of the episode. Never before has a SoL so strongly grabbed and held my attention and excitement throughout the entire show,even though it is placed in such a simple setting. This show is, in my opinion of course, most excellent for anyone who loves to watch anime for its characters and the simplicity of their lives together. Now for the little bit more organized and little bit less fanboy-opinion part of the review.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nBeing a Slice of Life, albeit unique, the story is faint and not all too important in the series. Some things are left unexplained, as curious as they may be, but I feel it is for the sake of the show and it might not have needed such explained. I give it an 8 out of 10 because this one is carefully developed throughout the show and still better than some that I've seen which are nothing but story.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nGJ-bu has a fairly generic art style but it is still done well and you can see that it is not just a piece of rushed work, it actually had time put into it. Also there are little bits in the work's setting that I really enjoyed seeing that made me happy and sad (not a disappointed sadness but emotional).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThere were moments where I couldn't help notice how perfectly the music and sounds fit the scene and furthered the overall quality of said scenes. I am not any analyst on particular noises and effects to use however I can personally appreciate when something fits into its place well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThese characters are phenomenal. Although there are slight hints of tropes within them it is not so overplayed that they become boring and predictable. Rather it aids their personalities and really makes them seem like they deserve to have a show based entirely around them. The characters are by far the best part of the show and I couldn't stop myself from clinging on to some of them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nNo show that I've watched before has had me so utterly amused (granted I don't watch many comedies) to the point in which every episode seemed like happiness was flowing out from the show and straight into my soul. The comedy is hilarious and refreshing, and a highlight of the show to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI cannot say this show is one of The Greats that is to be admired for centuries to come, but it is definitely a show worth experiencing for one's self. The characters are phenomenal, the enjoyment is boundless, and the sound, art and story were all great. This show has left an impression on me like no other and I have been delighted to have been able to watch it.",

            "content": "This is a review of the entire GJ-bu franchise. This includes: GJ-bu, GJ-bu@.\r\n1) STORY (6/10)\r\nGJ-bu is an adaptation of a 4-panel comic strip. These gag strips rarely have a self-contained story, given that it simply does not need a plotline to begin with. The way the anime portrays the 4-koma is wholly faithful, and therefore lacks substance as a result. It isn't that the story is poor enough that it is only given a \"fair\" rating, it is simply that there isn't a story because it was not necessary. Nevertheless, the show attempts to guide us through the lifespan of this GJ-bu, and does soamicably.\\n\\n\r\n2) ART (6/10)\\n\r\nGiven the thematic direction of the anime, it may come across as slightly unsettling when viewers lay eyes on the first episode of GJ-bu. The beautifully striking palate of colours greet us in a manner that overshadows the characters themselves, to an extent. It is as if they put a tad bit too much makeup on the characters that may put some viewers off. \\n\\n\r\nIt is not to say that the vibrant art style obfuscates our perception of the characters, but when trying to animate comedic scenes, it may be wiser to draw attention to the mannerisms of the characters through animation, rather than their individual illustrations. \\n\\n\r\nOver time, viewers are accustomed to the settings and begin to truly immerse themselves in the characters themselves instead. The art in this anime can be very pretty and illustrious at various points, showcasing the effort the production team has put into drawing the sets, but the creative directions may have strayed slightly. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is good, but mildly inappropriate.\\n\\n\r\n3) SOUND (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED songs were catchy and really got viewers fired up about the episode, which is a big plus as the consistent cheerfulness of the scenes as well as the upbeat musicality make for a dreamy joyride pre- and post- episode. \\n\\n\r\nDuring the show, there were no boisterous music choices, as producers opted for very light, perky music choices instead. As a result, the scenes felt atmospherically relaxing, and does a fair job of setting the mood for any upcoming silliness. \\n\\n\r\n4) CHARACTER (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe characters feel like stoic regurgitators of gag after gag. Yet, the jokes are funny and as a result, there is no real need to rat on the rather unmoving characteristics of the protagonists. For they are there to do their job of delivering punchlines and they do an appreciable job at that.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I felt that the straight man could have done a better job with stronger lines and a tad bit more exaggeration, but nevertheless, the characters were made well enough to enjoyable and not too stereotypical so as to be off-putting.\\n\\n\r\n5) ENJOYMENT  (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nGJ-bu certainly is an enjoyable anime. The anime is a series of jokes and running jokes, and should all be taken at face-value. Whether you are watching the show after a long day or just want to kick back and relax, this show does not fail to deliver in most cases. Sure, there may be repeated jokes based on the stereotypical behaviour of the characters, but that does not mean a viewer cannot enjoy them repeatedly, as they barely get old before the series comes to a quick end after 12 episodes and 1 OVA.\\n\\n\r\n6) OVERALL (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nGJ-bu is yet another anime that seeks to charm and entertain, and it is very clear that the producers had every intention to stick to their guns till the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn't a must-watch, but it certainly is a should-watch.\\n",

I don't have a certain thing about the art/animation, if I thinkit's good I do, it's not like I'm interested in one kind of specific art over another. It is a bit something you'd expect from this genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't bad at all, I generally liked this music and the opening wasn't bad either.

            "content": "intro\r\nGJ-bu or in english the good job club is a very innocent slice of life comedy, that had some subtle jokes that were brilliant.\r\nif you watched an anime, do you think you could watch twelve episodes that were more or less constantly in the same place?\r\nArt.\r\nThe artwork for this anime was great for the characters and all of the additional features that would enter their club room episode after episode sadly how ever it didn't have the best in terms of scenery, the artwork was as i said great for the characters it has one of the nicest looking cast simple but none the lessgreat looking. They added some beautiful details to this anime just very simple little details through out the series which really made the artwork stand out.\\n\r\nDue to the artwork mainly surrounding the characters, it influenced and brought the characters to the spot light and enhanced the looked and sheer beauty of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nscore 7/10\\n\\n\r\nStory.\\n\r\nThe story is very simple as it is mainly twelve episodes consisting of being in the club room of the good job club, however each episode has such simple plain ideas that can be very easily linked into normal everyday life.... well almost. what i love about this is that it follows out a normal year in a chronological order, going through the seasons and ending at graduation.\\n\r\nThe story is loving and innocent the comedy is very easy to grasp with some very subtle inside jokes thrown in to make the viewer laugh even more its fantastic, although it is a very typical slice of life comedy it doesn't fail to amaze me at how well portrayed the story is.\\n\r\nThe story is not pushed in anyway and it feels completely natural and very relate-able to every day life.\\n\r\nhow ever with all these positives said there have to be a negative and sadly there is, due to the lack of settings the story doesn't really become very strong how ever nearer the end episodes it intensify's drastically.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nI feel the music used in the anime was very well thought out as I've said alot its a very innocent feeling anime and the music seems very childlike and tends to intensify that feeling of it being very innocent, i know that I've over used that word.\\n\r\nthe voice acting is great, the characters have simple light hearted tones to simple make the characters as loveable as possible. \\n\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters.\\n\r\n- the main protagonist although it is arguable is Shinomiya, Kyouya, he is the only male of the group and simply is the most enjoyable of the characters, \\n\r\n- the other members consist of five females, Amatsuka, Mao or \"prez\" is the small red haired leader of the group and has a habit of biting Kyouya when ever he steps a foot wrong, Amatsuka, Megumi is her sister, she has a love for baking and making tea, unlike her sister how ever she has a gentler nature and also is very insecure about her weight.\\n\r\nBernstein, Kirara is the some what cat like character in the group, she is almost always eating and if she isn't she is mentioning food in some way, it is quickly very clear what her favourite food is and its not a surprise considering her height and strength.\\n\r\nKannadzuki, Tamaki is a relatively new member as she joins in later on in the series how ever it is obviously that she's a fan of the word \"desu\" not to stereotype of course, she also is a huge fan of cake and Megumi offers her a challenge that has alot of cake involved.\\n\r\nSumeragi, Shion is the purple haired common senseless genius with the ever expanding family tree, although her family is huge she is the only daughter and dreams of having a little sister.\\n\r\nBecause of the character this beautifully gentle and kind story is able to be as good as it is, the characters generate such natural and loving friendships that it simply is brilliant.\\n\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime so very much and i was throughly shocked by it, i didn't expect an anime like to have been made this year, i was hooked after the first episode and annoyingly i didn't understand one of the biggest jokes within the series, Getting the guy to brush their hair.\\n\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nGoal of the anime.\\n\r\nthis anime i feel was made simply just to ren-act the bonds that build between friends, be it through meeting people or simply being in a club.\\n\r\nThe only thing I would ask, is will there ever be more of this anime?\\n\\n\r\nscores\\n\\n\r\nart: 7/10\\n\r\nstory: 8/10\\n\r\nsound: 7/10\\n\r\ncharcters: 9/10\\n\r\nenjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\noverall: 8/10\\n",
