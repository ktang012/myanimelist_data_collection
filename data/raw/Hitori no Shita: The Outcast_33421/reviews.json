The animation is so awkward even the movements of themouths and eyes are weird and off.

            "content": "People are giving this show much more credit than it deserves. The title of the anime is spot on tho, Hitori no shit.\r\nI don't usually get triggered by anime, but this is a new low. \r\nWe follow in the footsteps of a \"virgin\" Chou Soran a heir to some powerful family. One sudden day the grave of his grandfather is pillaged and he has to find out why. On his way to his dear grandfathers grave, he finds goku, no wait i mean Fuu Houhou. Fuu just like Soran, are supernatural humans who can freely control their Ki and use Martial arts as their weapons,called outsiders. In a world filled with people like them Soran is extremely special and is headhunted by many evil organizations, but fret not, during the story you will find out why, but not really :)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is trying to be something original and to follow the whole martial arts ki-superpower thing to an extent that it's just horrid. What could have been key-parts of this anime ended up as dull battles with zero progress(not even one good battle at the end of the anime), a main character that is your typical young \"i want justice, i have this awesome superpower, i am stronger than you think\" attitude with no character progression. The other characters except our Fuu \"GOKU\" Houhou are so miniscule you won't even bother thinking about them as none even leave a single trace of impression.\\n\\n\r\nOh did i mention that there is comedy in this anime and most of it is about Soran being a virgin? I also feel that the mix the anime is trying to do between comedy and action, just can't be taken seriously, the comedy is slapstick and dry humor about being a virgin. Now the worst part is, this anime tries so hard to reach a Shounen level that is just dosen't know how to deal with the story, because there literally is none. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the new generation of anime, thats so horrible i can't even imagine why this got produced at all. With each episode you keep expeting, \"wow when is an amazing battle gonna start with our main character doing something really cool?\". Well don't bother. If a fight starts, it's 30 seconds long and in the end goku comes, kicks everyone and it's over. No fights last longer than 3min. \\n\\n\r\nThere is just nothing, this anime lacks soul. Nothing to captivate it's audience and being so damn slow paced, it even ended in a way so that they can get a season 2, if they sell well... Let's be honest, that will never happen. Or you will have to read the manga for the rest, but at this point if' the anime is this dissapointing, the manga will be as well. \\n\\n\r\nI Give it a solid 2! I would have given it a 1, but damn I just had to give it +1 for this crap to even leave the studio and reach the tv. Hurray, for Hitori no Shit. I honestly recommend this if you are on the verge of quitting anime, as this will definitevly seal the deal.",

            "content": "It seems like everyone forgot that another anime about psychics existed that isn\u2019t called Mob Psycho 100. This time it\u2019s a Chinese-Japanese led project fulfilling our dreams of being able to called this anime a Chinese cartoon. OK all jokes aside this series does have something interesting to offer as it incorporates both martial arts and psychic powers to give us a predominantly action focused show.\r\n***Note I\u2019ll be using the translated names as I watched the Japanese dubbed version with English subtitles.***\r\nThe start of this show at one point led me to think that it was another zombie apocalypse show like High School of theDead but only to realise that certain people can manipulate the corpses freely. Our main protagonist Chou Soran in the dead of night, is making a visit to his grandfather\u2019s grave only to find himself in a precarious situation with the moving corpses. Out of nowhere, he is saved in mesmerising fashion from a powerful women called Jo Houhou who is talented in every way possible. This is the first encounter between the main duo who later find themselves attending the same college, only to the dismay of Soran who was semi-traumatised from the earlier meeting.\\n\\n\r\nChou Soran is then made to be subservient to Houhou, after getting his ass handed to him while retaliating at the thought of being obedient to her. She then leads him to an organisation called the Express Delivery Company who are pretty much composed of psychics called \u2018Outsiders\u2019. The abilities between individuals vary from super strength, manipulating the elements to controlling the mental state of people through their emotions. The Express Delivery Company\u2019s main objective is to act as the police for these outsiders who are a minority but nevertheless still need to be monitored to avoid engaging in criminal activity. This makes sense as the regular police would get battered by attempting to deal with the psychics, so it\u2019s only natural that the Government made a subdivision to respond to these situations.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other groups who inhabit these individuals such as Zensei and Tengekai. The former is just a random collection of users with similar interests. They are the first group to provoke our main duo when it is revealed that they have possession of something close to Soran. The group are just bizarre and uncoordinated when they have a little kid in charge, a woman whose lust knows no bounds and some black guy (not race-wise) whose has no purpose despite having many cameos. Tengekai are more interesting as they at least have a proper hierarchy in place with its bureaucratic rules. The magnanimous leader of the organisation directly tries to recruit Soran, when it is known that he has acquired psychic abilities from a young age. His abilities obviously matured as he grew up around the presence of his grandfather who was a well-respected individual.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are not impressive by any standards when they don\u2019t have any unique selling points. Chou Soran resembles another shounen protagonist who tries to get past every obstacle through sheer power, only to realise its futile when facing much stronger outsiders who have fully mastered their powers. He doesn\u2019t really have any motivation whatsoever when all he thinks about is wanting a nice girlfriend, lamenting the fact that he is useless in that department. The girlfriend he desired for so long does happen only for events to change drastically.\\n\\n\r\nJo Houhou at first looks like another monotone girl and is a mirror for reflecting dreariness. The only time she shows any emotion is being violent towards Soran which is a feature found in most tsunderes but thankfully she does not follow that archetype. Her actions make me cringe at times when it feels like everything she does is robotic; to the point she is just a yes-man. The supporting cast of Jo San and Jo Yon don\u2019t really offer much as they are insistent on abiding by the rules of the company. They do participate in battles alongside the main duo but do not get sufficient characterisation for me to talk about them adequately.\\n\\n\r\nThis art style/animation aspect is something I wanted to avoid because it is obvious that it will end up being me giving a scathing attack on it, hence sounding like a diatribe. The animation is not comparable to the anime produced in Japan when series from a decade ago have similar or in fact better production values. There were instances when the fights looked visually appealing, through good usage of special effects but it did look choppy at times with the in-between animation needing further improvements. The colour scheme used throughout the show is very basic but does it job when trying to complement the appropriate background such as the countryside in rural China. The only information on the staff of this show is that Komatsu Arisa was the colour designer. I really hope someone updates the key staff involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound here is quite lacklustre with nothing of the soundtrack being memorable or worth noting to the point it is just abysmal. Good thing, the sound staff are confidential which makes it difficult to expose them for their average work. The opening and ending have been dubbed over and were quite the delight to listen to if that means anything. The voice actors used in this show aren\u2019t household names here in the anime community. The man who voiced Ayato from Asterix War is back to offer his voice for a complementary dull protagonist, truly befitting one must say. The wonderful voice of Hayami Saori is back, this time for Houhou which is a good match for her easy sounding speech patterns/mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is not really a must watch in any category and is a very average show at best with mediocre production values. I would probably give it more attention if the production committee put more dedication into it.\\n",

Personally I don't like the amount of fan service in todays anime. In my opinion, this anime would've been just fine without it. \r\nAt first glance, the plot seemed odd and different, but then by the second episode, things fell into place. It cleared up a lot of the, why is this like this or how come those things are doing this, etc., etc.. The groundwork has been laid with great action sequences, which have implied thatthey are only going to get a lot more action packed and suspenseful. The plot is starting to come together and can makes you start to guess what might happen next. Lastly the characters are not perfectly defined yet, but they are definitely starting to be and growth is starting to already take place at its own rate. You can start to feel yourself finding a point in liking the characters, which a lot of anime struggle with. Hitorinoshita - the outcast goes off its own drum beat and is definitely unique in more ways than its supernatural plots. I look forward to how it turns out.",

I mean, keep watching those anime. Why you gotta complain about how OP the lead is? I mean, aren't the leads supposed to have golden fingers that make them all-powerful?

            "content": "By the reviews here, it seems this series did not really meet the audience's favor. However, before getting started in analizing it let's make it clear that, in my opinion, while it's not a masterpiece, it's got it's fair share of enjoyment and I've watched far worse stuff than this. \r\nIf you just want to know whether it deserves to be watched or not, short answer is: yes, watch it. It will entertain you enough and make you want to see a second season (which will probably be made, since the comic is really succesful in China).\r\nNow, as I said \"China\", you will probably bethinking: is this guy trolling, as when we say \"chinese cartoons\" to say anime? Well no, this time I'm serious, this series is based on a chinese comic and the studio producing it, Haoliners, is chinese. Animation was outsourced to a Japanese studio, it seems, but the show was originally broadcasted in chinese and the version we have on Crunchyroll is a re-dub in Jap. And it's not like chinese studios can't animate themselves, they're actually getting bigger since a big name like Shinichi Watanabe (known for Excel Saga) has now cooperated with Haoliners themselves on a (at the moment I'm writing) now airing chinese animated show called \"To Be Hero\".\\n\\n\r\nClosing this digression on chinese animation, let's talk about this show, starting from it's story. \\n\r\nWhile it's not anything revolutionary or innovative, HnS gives us a quite engaging oriental-style martial arts story, with the main character, Cho Soran, as the only \"trump card\". For basically this whole first season he is not heroic or something, he's only a universitary student who wants to get a good job, make money, and get a girl in order to get rid of his virginity (not an heroic aim, huh?). However, his \"private parts\" are locked by a seal which can be broken only by a girl who really loves him. I would have liked to see a better use of this rule, but at least in the first series they almost only used it for comical parts. We'll se him learn to use his powers better to deal with a quite uncomfortable situation: being the heir to a mysterious power that everybody wants, and being chased after by an evil organization.\\n\\n\r\nAlways by the side of our MC, we'll find Hoho, the tipical \"silent and strange girl with a misterious past\", and while her character is quite cliche, the relationship between the two of them is quite interesting, along with her past.\\n\\n\r\nArt style wasn't anything to remember, but it wasn't bad either. Character design was overall good, with the MC, Hoho, and the white-haired, white-dressed powerful martial artist (can't remember his name) as it's peaks.\\n\\n\r\nSound was maybe one of the best things: OST quite fits well every scene, and the main girl is dubbed by Saori Hayami, one of my favorite female voice actors ever, which does a great job here in giving to a not greatly written character a bit more of a personality. Atsushi Tamaru also did well in dubbing the MC, and I can say the same for basically every character. Obviously I'm talking about the japanese dub, haven't heard the chinese one. The OP and ED are both pretty good, I expecially liked the \"djenty\" intro the OP has. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what to say about this series? It's not bad, while something about the story is not clear yet, it's because it's just the first season. In fact it seems that the end of the series is only the beginning of the \"serious stuff\". Some gags are out of place and not all fighting scenes are really epic, but it will entertain you enough until the end, and you'll probably want to see how it goes on. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot, you may enjoy it.",

            "content": "Before writing down anything here, I\u2019d first like to say that all audiences should go to watch the unedited completed version of this anime which has a half-hour-long 11th episode and 43-min-long 12th episode AS WELL AS THE ORIGENAL MANGA that has already been updated to nearly 200 episodes. Plus if you can speak fluent Chinese I highly recommend you to watch the Chinese cover and you can discover more unique sides of this anime.\r\nTo begin with, I have to state that the anime is INDEED disappointing. The enjoyment and the overall score highly depend on my view to the original comic instead of theanimation. A few points of this anime were about to make me to drop the series. What came out first was the absence of so many frames that turned continuous scenes into some PowerPoint or \u2018moving manga\u2019 stuff. Apart from that, the sound effect was not adjusted just right and sometimes was not even simultaneous with the scene. What was more unforgivable, neither the storyboard nor the composition satisfied a sophisticated creation of animation. Despite all of these, I still feel thankful to all reviewers on MyAnimeList because you guys scored The Outcast much higher than Japan and China locally on average (6.64). When I checked the scores on Accessify.com (Japan) and Bangumi.tv (China), I was surprised that those who could watch the completed version and the most fabulous part of the animation scored it an average of mere 6. How low it is! What a pity!\\n\\n\r\nI was not trying to make you feel bad about this animation in the last paragraph, but I rather aimed to put the problems of this animation forward and then to suggest you not focusing so much on those defects. This animation is actually one of those \u2018big steps\u2019 of current Chinese anime production, and it marked a lot of brave attempts of Chinese artists even though the attempts might not have been so successful. Chinese creators were really trying their best to make an art piece as well as a commercial product that belongs to their culture, and they have showed us how fascinating an anime could possibly be if it was adapted to a different society (what I\u2019m referring to is the completed Chinese cover). Plenty problems of the animation were results of low investment, arrogance of Japan-side anime makers and discords between Chinese and Japanese directors. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation would only have pleased and enchanted a watcher if one had been able to settle down and be enthusiastic to learn about the background, because it had involved so many Chinese cultural as well as historical elements that had been alien to Japanese, let alone us Westerners. In the original unedited Chinese cover, the animators even used a Chinese folk song as an opening and for every single character they let them speak unique dialects like Mandarin (Zhang Chulan), Sichuan Mandarin (Feng Baobao), Chaozhou Mandarin, Cantonese etc. The 12-episode series also revealed us some history of China, for instance, the World War II, the period when the communist government was suppressing bandits, the golden age of Chinese pop songs and the return of Hong Kong. Chinese religions (Daoism and Chinese side Buddism), traditional weapons, philosophy, pop culture, literature and humours are also all merged organically in The Outcast, especially in the story after the end of episode 12 in manga. The Outcast banged us with decisiveness of Chinese and a story line that is so disjoint from what we normally call Anime: something that has gradually filled up with Moe, fan service, clich\u00e9, \u2018harem\u2019 of male characters and unrealistically kind people who doesn't kill to leave the enemies coming back with stronger powers.\\n\\n\r\nHence I highly recommend The Outcast, it should not be the edited animation but the complete version and manga though. It will open for you a new world and tell you a story of heroes and heroines that have new charms. COME AND WATCH OR READ! It is undoubtedly an unmissable great work for those who truly love ACGN and those who are interested in an exotic story!\\n",

            "content": "I don't understand why so many people give it a bad review, this anime is good. My only problem with it is that it only have 12 episodes and no manga to continue. \r\nI saw someone saying \"Chinese Zombie Stuff\", but only one character uses zombies as weapons, all the rest have different superpowers, and the story is about them, or more precisely about the grandfather of Chou Soran. \r\nI think the plot was cool, and the development was just right. I even like the characters, usually the emotionless steriotype still have some level of emotion, this one is really a psycopath. That doesn't meanshe is evil, she just don't understand what are feelings. She could be called a Tsundere, since she beats the main character, but different of all the Tsunderes out there, Soran, the beaten main character, gets to the point that he says, NO! And even knowing he could die, he still go away. This is taking matters more seriously outside the masoquist main character cliche, and I really like that. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked the tone the anime makes. It gets things serious but backs the humor just after and never gets the viewer in a despairate situation. I know this doesn't create tension, but it isn't bad by itself, and can still render some good fights. Damn, One Punch Man follow the same principle, and it is good. This of course, builds more tension to when the fights gets serious, but unfortunately it doesn't show, or it have a climax.\\n\\n\r\nThe big point for me is really the characters, even without much background, they are flashed out by their actions, not just steriotipicals characters copy and paste. And they do that without backing for when they were children, Suck that, Naruto!\\n\\n\r\nWhatever. I really liked it, and really would like a second season or manga to  follow, I hope it eventually happens, but with this average score, I doubt. It is pity.",

            "content": "First off, if by reading the synopsis you thought this was a show about zombies (a la Highschool of the Dead)...it's not. It's about \"Outsiders\"--seemingly ordinary people with extraordinary abilities. One of those Outsiders is a girl who can control zombies, but she is NOT the main character.\r\nSecondly, if you haven't started watching, I must pre-warn you of this part in the 1st episode which caused a fair number of people to give up in disgust. It's the scene where Houhou is trying to bury the MC, Soran, and he just sits there  like an idiot. Why doesn't he just get up and runaway? See, in the original webcomic (which I checked out), that pit is supposed to be much deeper than shown in the anime (it's over Soran's height even when he's standing up and he likely had to jump to get over its edge--at which point he was easily kicked backed down by Houhou.) For some reason, the anime depicts the pit as being really shallow, which makes this particular scene not credible...but I'd put this down to bad art, rather than bad writing.\\n\\n\r\n***Ratings***\\n\\n\r\n-- Plot/Pacing: B\\n\r\nAt first, the mystery behind Soran's background and the Outsider world in general made me anticipate each new episode, as I found myself wanting to know more about the Outsiders and the different organisations and to see the development of the various characters and their relationships. However, after the whole Outsiders thing was explained (episode 5), I felt it wasn't that big of a deal/reveal at all. Worse, the pace slowed considerably (around episode 7 onwards)--and it was already quite slow before. The comedy bits are also a bit overdone and can be quite jarring, but you kind of get used to them after awhile.\\n\\n\r\n-- Seiyu/Sound: B+\\n\r\nI'm watching the Japanese dub (with sub-par English subs.) I think the voice actors did a fairly decent job, giving the characters enough of their own life and personality, such as the indifferent Houhou, the slutty Natsuka, the cunning Lo Ryu, etc. The soundtrack is pretty much standard J-rock, but the OP managed to get stuck inside my head after awhile.\\n\\n\r\n-- Art/Animation: B\\n\r\nThe character designs are nothing out of the ordinary, and the quality of the art is inconsistent (from \"not bad\" to \"ugly/lazy.\") I don't know if it's just me but I felt there was a noticeable drop in the quality from episode 7 onwards.\\n\\n\r\n-- Bonus/Bias: +10%\\n\r\nI'm giving bonus points solely for the character of Fuu Houhou. Normally I detest those \"stoic\", emotionless-girl type of characters, but Houhou just seems different somehow...her messy hair, poor fashion sense, ignorance of societal norms and conventions, and her insane skill with kitchen knives and choppers all combine to give her a very unique appeal (read: \"moe.\") Her character significantly helped to sustain my interest in the series--and I know there are a number of people out there who feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\n***Additional  info***\\n\r\nThe original source is a Chinese webcomic and the anime is a collaboration between Chinese and Japanese producers. I watched the Japanese dub and a bit of the Chinese dub (just to compare), and I think the Japanese dub was produced first, the reason being that the animation matches the Japanese voices better, while it is a bit out-of-sync for the Chinese voices.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of differences in script, the Chinese one is more crude. For example, in one scene, a female character in the Japanese script says something like, \"it would be better if we were on a date\", while the Chinese script has her saying, \"it would be better if we were in bed\". The Chinese script also has more cussing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for English subtitles, unfortunately the fan-made one is very far from perfect. Some terms weren't translated at all. For example, the following terms:\\n\\n\r\n(1) Kinkou - literally \"golden light\". It's a visible aura manifested from one's inner energy. Soran's kinkou is supposed to protect him from harm.\\n\\n\r\n(2) Xiangxi ganshi - \"Xiangxi\" is the name of a place in China (where the practice of animating corpses to transport them was popular in the past), and \"ganshi\" literally means \"corpse-driver\". Ryu Kenken is referred to as a xiangxi ganshi--a person who knows how to manipulate corpses.",

If you ever wanted to experience pain I would recommend sitting on a bed of nails or walking into a fire because this show will actually rot away your soul.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nI won't lie when this show first came out I was sitting on the fence. It starts off as a zombie anime but then does a full 360 and turns into a superpowered Kung fu shitfest. The story pacing is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. (Yesthat's right ladies and gentlemen even worse than SAO.) I watched each week because I felt like it  was slightly interesting and the ingredients were there for something great. After week 12 of the anime, I sat waiting for the next episode to see how this little saga would conclude. But nothing came, yes that's right, they finished off this anime with a 3 episode flashback of Houhou's past.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad, it was very lazy styling and it didn't really do anything to leave an impression, I don't have anything to say about this really because it was neither good nor bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again sound wise there isn't really much to touch on.  The OP isn't bad but it doesn't really strike me as anything special, and sound wise through the episodes the little background music there is, is all pretty normal stuff. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the part which was rather hit and miss. The MC is made out as super OP and he doesn't really have any down points . The way he reacts in all situations is pretty much how you would expect someone to so that's fine. HouHou is an interesting one and once again is strong which is interesting. To be honest, if it weren't for the fact that it was enjoyable watching HouHou kick the crap out of people I would have dropped this.  As far as antagonists go I can only think of 2. One is a weak idiot who tries to kill HouHou, fails and then dies. The other was actually more interesting than the main cast. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a shred of hope for this season and it honestly disappointed me so badly. There were a few cliffhangers which were interesting but to be honest the only time I wanted another episode was to see if HouHou was alive or not. \\n\\n\r\nOveral 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is interesting and I feel that good things could come from this, the story never actually gets past the scene setting phase. I can not accept that someone would think that it's a good idea to air a half-assed anime like this.

            "content": "I'd recommend giving it a chance, with only 12 episodes for this season, what do you have to lose besides a few hours you would have spent being unproductive anyway? Personally I liked it obviously because I gave it an 8 overall and see a lot of potential if they continue beyond season 1.  I also liked the art and animation styles. The story follows Chou who is an \"Outsider\" (someone with supernatural abilities). He catches a lot of flack about being a virgin but is actually a straight up bada**. Like most anime the whole thing revolves around random bad guys popping upcomplicating the mc's life and pushing him to reveal more and more of just how far his potential goes. While it is a bit slower paced at points that is to try developing the back story and characters alongside the current events in the story. The humor does tend to revolve a lot around the fact Chou is a virgin and how to manipulate him because of that. But hey we all know what it was or is like to be a horny teen virgin desperately trying to solve that problem with anything that would sit still long enough to let us, and that's one of the things I enjoyed about the comedic moments. Also, there are SOME zombies and lets face it everyone loves zombies whether they admit it or not, but be warned its not just about zombies.",

Many reviews I have read complain about the slow pace of this show. Make no mistake this is not kung-fu action. This is in essence a drama with SOME action weaved into the plot. This is why I do not dislike the generic magic kung-fu concept, it's merely a small aspect to help drive the plot.\r\nArt - 7\r\nThe modern art style worked well with the concept of the show.\r\nCharacter - 3\r\nThe main characters are a little over the top. A hopeless virgin witha complete inability to make decisions and constantly jumps to conclusions. It also seemed like they didn't know what direction they wanted to go with the main character and so they pulled him in every direction... The writers inability to make an interesting main character is this show's major weakness. I honestly like the supporting characters more than the main characters, not a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nIts not perfect but keeps you engaged if you have an attention span longer than a goldfish\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nWould probably be a 9 if the main characters were likable.",

Story build up and background is pretty good and animation and  action is  cool , brought back memories really. The feel of classic like yu yu hakusho n flame of rekka etc mixing up with  modernanimation was a  treat and  i guarantee you will be looking forward to the next season  [if they are going to  make any] for sure.",

The title of the anime is spot on tho, Hitori no shit.\r\nI don't usually get triggered by anime, but this is a new low. \r\nWe follow in the footsteps of a \"virgin\" Chou Soran a heir to some powerful family. One sudden day the grave of his grandfather is pillaged and he has to find out why. On his way to his dear grandfathers grave, he finds goku, no wait i mean Fuu Houhou. Fuu just like Soran, are supernatural humans who can freely control their Ki and use Martial arts as their weapons,called outsiders. In a world filled with people like them Soran is extremely special and is headhunted by many evil organizations, but fret not, during the story you will find out why, but not really :)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is trying to be something original and to follow the whole martial arts ki-superpower thing to an extent that it's just horrid. What could have been key-parts of this anime ended up as dull battles with zero progress(not even one good battle at the end of the anime), a main character that is your typical young \"i want justice, i have this awesome superpower, i am stronger than you think\" attitude with no character progression. The other characters except our Fuu \"GOKU\" Houhou are so miniscule you won't even bother thinking about them as none even leave a single trace of impression.\\n\\n\r\nOh did i mention that there is comedy in this anime and most of it is about Soran being a virgin? I also feel that the mix the anime is trying to do between comedy and action, just can't be taken seriously, the comedy is slapstick and dry humor about being a virgin. Now the worst part is, this anime tries so hard to reach a Shounen level that is just dosen't know how to deal with the story, because there literally is none. \\n\\n\r\nThis is the new generation of anime, thats so horrible i can't even imagine why this got produced at all. With each episode you keep expeting, \"wow when is an amazing battle gonna start with our main character doing something really cool?\". Well don't bother. If a fight starts, it's 30 seconds long and in the end goku comes, kicks everyone and it's over. No fights last longer than 3min. \\n\\n\r\nThere is just nothing, this anime lacks soul. Nothing to captivate it's audience and being so damn slow paced, it even ended in a way so that they can get a season 2, if they sell well... Let's be honest, that will never happen. Or you will have to read the manga for the rest, but at this point if' the anime is this dissapointing, the manga will be as well. \\n\\n\r\nI Give it a solid 2! I would have given it a 1, but damn I just had to give it +1 for this crap to even leave the studio and reach the tv. Hurray, for Hitori no Shit. I honestly recommend this if you are on the verge of quitting anime, as this will definitevly seal the deal.",

            "content": "It seems like everyone forgot that another anime about psychics existed that isn\u2019t called Mob Psycho 100. This time it\u2019s a Chinese-Japanese led project fulfilling our dreams of being able to called this anime a Chinese cartoon. OK all jokes aside this series does have something interesting to offer as it incorporates both martial arts and psychic powers to give us a predominantly action focused show.\r\n***Note I\u2019ll be using the translated names as I watched the Japanese dubbed version with English subtitles.***\r\nThe start of this show at one point led me to think that it was another zombie apocalypse show like High School of theDead but only to realise that certain people can manipulate the corpses freely. Our main protagonist Chou Soran in the dead of night, is making a visit to his grandfather\u2019s grave only to find himself in a precarious situation with the moving corpses. Out of nowhere, he is saved in mesmerising fashion from a powerful women called Jo Houhou who is talented in every way possible. This is the first encounter between the main duo who later find themselves attending the same college, only to the dismay of Soran who was semi-traumatised from the earlier meeting.\\n\\n\r\nChou Soran is then made to be subservient to Houhou, after getting his ass handed to him while retaliating at the thought of being obedient to her. She then leads him to an organisation called the Express Delivery Company who are pretty much composed of psychics called \u2018Outsiders\u2019. The abilities between individuals vary from super strength, manipulating the elements to controlling the mental state of people through their emotions. The Express Delivery Company\u2019s main objective is to act as the police for these outsiders who are a minority but nevertheless still need to be monitored to avoid engaging in criminal activity. This makes sense as the regular police would get battered by attempting to deal with the psychics, so it\u2019s only natural that the Government made a subdivision to respond to these situations.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other groups who inhabit these individuals such as Zensei and Tengekai. The former is just a random collection of users with similar interests. They are the first group to provoke our main duo when it is revealed that they have possession of something close to Soran. The group are just bizarre and uncoordinated when they have a little kid in charge, a woman whose lust knows no bounds and some black guy (not race-wise) whose has no purpose despite having many cameos. Tengekai are more interesting as they at least have a proper hierarchy in place with its bureaucratic rules. The magnanimous leader of the organisation directly tries to recruit Soran, when it is known that he has acquired psychic abilities from a young age. His abilities obviously matured as he grew up around the presence of his grandfather who was a well-respected individual.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are not impressive by any standards when they don\u2019t have any unique selling points. Chou Soran resembles another shounen protagonist who tries to get past every obstacle through sheer power, only to realise its futile when facing much stronger outsiders who have fully mastered their powers. He doesn\u2019t really have any motivation whatsoever when all he thinks about is wanting a nice girlfriend, lamenting the fact that he is useless in that department. The girlfriend he desired for so long does happen only for events to change drastically.\\n\\n\r\nJo Houhou at first looks like another monotone girl and is a mirror for reflecting dreariness. The only time she shows any emotion is being violent towards Soran which is a feature found in most tsunderes but thankfully she does not follow that archetype. Her actions make me cringe at times when it feels like everything she does is robotic; to the point she is just a yes-man. The supporting cast of Jo San and Jo Yon don\u2019t really offer much as they are insistent on abiding by the rules of the company. They do participate in battles alongside the main duo but do not get sufficient characterisation for me to talk about them adequately.\\n\\n\r\nThis art style/animation aspect is something I wanted to avoid because it is obvious that it will end up being me giving a scathing attack on it, hence sounding like a diatribe. The animation is not comparable to the anime produced in Japan when series from a decade ago have similar or in fact better production values. There were instances when the fights looked visually appealing, through good usage of special effects but it did look choppy at times with the in-between animation needing further improvements. The colour scheme used throughout the show is very basic but does it job when trying to complement the appropriate background such as the countryside in rural China. The only information on the staff of this show is that Komatsu Arisa was the colour designer. I really hope someone updates the key staff involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound here is quite lacklustre with nothing of the soundtrack being memorable or worth noting to the point it is just abysmal. Good thing, the sound staff are confidential which makes it difficult to expose them for their average work. The opening and ending have been dubbed over and were quite the delight to listen to if that means anything. The voice actors used in this show aren\u2019t household names here in the anime community. The man who voiced Ayato from Asterix War is back to offer his voice for a complementary dull protagonist, truly befitting one must say. The wonderful voice of Hayami Saori is back, this time for Houhou which is a good match for her easy sounding speech patterns/mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is not really a must watch in any category and is a very average show at best with mediocre production values. I would probably give it more attention if the production committee put more dedication into it.\\n",

Personally I don't like the amount of fan service in todays anime. In my opinion, this anime would've been just fine without it. \r\nAt first glance, the plot seemed odd and different, but then by the second episode, things fell into place. It cleared up a lot of the, why is this like this or how come those things are doing this, etc., etc.. The groundwork has been laid with great action sequences, which have implied thatthey are only going to get a lot more action packed and suspenseful. The plot is starting to come together and can makes you start to guess what might happen next. Lastly the characters are not perfectly defined yet, but they are definitely starting to be and growth is starting to already take place at its own rate. You can start to feel yourself finding a point in liking the characters, which a lot of anime struggle with. Hitorinoshita - the outcast goes off its own drum beat and is definitely unique in more ways than its supernatural plots. I look forward to how it turns out.",

I, for one, enjoyed every second of the comedy aspect of this show. I have to say season 2 is remarkably better than season 1. \r\nThe fights are AWESOME! I love them. Especially in season 2. I was really impressed with howvaried the character design was and how even the characters in supporting roles get so much attention and even their own ending credit songs sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, people are not judging the anime as a standalone but comparing it to other great animes in a completely different genre and whining about how it's not like them. I mean, keep watching those anime. Why you gotta complain about how OP the lead is? I mean, aren't the leads supposed to have golden fingers that make them all-powerful? Gah!\\n\\n\r\nAnywho, I loved the art, music, fight choreo, story, characters, everything! It was a welcome surprise to me after Mo Zo Dao Shi. It's definitely not as good as MZDS.

            "content": "By the reviews here, it seems this series did not really meet the audience's favor. However, before getting started in analizing it let's make it clear that, in my opinion, while it's not a masterpiece, it's got it's fair share of enjoyment and I've watched far worse stuff than this. \r\nIf you just want to know whether it deserves to be watched or not, short answer is: yes, watch it. It will entertain you enough and make you want to see a second season (which will probably be made, since the comic is really succesful in China).\r\nNow, as I said \"China\", you will probably bethinking: is this guy trolling, as when we say \"chinese cartoons\" to say anime? Well no, this time I'm serious, this series is based on a chinese comic and the studio producing it, Haoliners, is chinese. Animation was outsourced to a Japanese studio, it seems, but the show was originally broadcasted in chinese and the version we have on Crunchyroll is a re-dub in Jap. And it's not like chinese studios can't animate themselves, they're actually getting bigger since a big name like Shinichi Watanabe (known for Excel Saga) has now cooperated with Haoliners themselves on a (at the moment I'm writing) now airing chinese animated show called \"To Be Hero\".\\n\\n\r\nClosing this digression on chinese animation, let's talk about this show, starting from it's story. \\n\r\nWhile it's not anything revolutionary or innovative, HnS gives us a quite engaging oriental-style martial arts story, with the main character, Cho Soran, as the only \"trump card\". For basically this whole first season he is not heroic or something, he's only a universitary student who wants to get a good job, make money, and get a girl in order to get rid of his virginity (not an heroic aim, huh?). However, his \"private parts\" are locked by a seal which can be broken only by a girl who really loves him. I would have liked to see a better use of this rule, but at least in the first series they almost only used it for comical parts. We'll se him learn to use his powers better to deal with a quite uncomfortable situation: being the heir to a mysterious power that everybody wants, and being chased after by an evil organization.\\n\\n\r\nAlways by the side of our MC, we'll find Hoho, the tipical \"silent and strange girl with a misterious past\", and while her character is quite cliche, the relationship between the two of them is quite interesting, along with her past.\\n\\n\r\nArt style wasn't anything to remember, but it wasn't bad either. Character design was overall good, with the MC, Hoho, and the white-haired, white-dressed powerful martial artist (can't remember his name) as it's peaks.\\n\\n\r\nSound was maybe one of the best things: OST quite fits well every scene, and the main girl is dubbed by Saori Hayami, one of my favorite female voice actors ever, which does a great job here in giving to a not greatly written character a bit more of a personality. Atsushi Tamaru also did well in dubbing the MC, and I can say the same for basically every character. Obviously I'm talking about the japanese dub, haven't heard the chinese one. The OP and ED are both pretty good, I expecially liked the \"djenty\" intro the OP has. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what to say about this series? It's not bad, while something about the story is not clear yet, it's because it's just the first season. In fact it seems that the end of the series is only the beginning of the \"serious stuff\". Some gags are out of place and not all fighting scenes are really epic, but it will entertain you enough until the end, and you'll probably want to see how it goes on. \\n\\n\r\nGive it a shot, you may enjoy it.",

            "content": "Before writing down anything here, I\u2019d first like to say that all audiences should go to watch the unedited completed version of this anime which has a half-hour-long 11th episode and 43-min-long 12th episode AS WELL AS THE ORIGENAL MANGA that has already been updated to nearly 200 episodes. Plus if you can speak fluent Chinese I highly recommend you to watch the Chinese cover and you can discover more unique sides of this anime.\r\nTo begin with, I have to state that the anime is INDEED disappointing. The enjoyment and the overall score highly depend on my view to the original comic instead of theanimation. A few points of this anime were about to make me to drop the series. What came out first was the absence of so many frames that turned continuous scenes into some PowerPoint or \u2018moving manga\u2019 stuff. Apart from that, the sound effect was not adjusted just right and sometimes was not even simultaneous with the scene. What was more unforgivable, neither the storyboard nor the composition satisfied a sophisticated creation of animation. Despite all of these, I still feel thankful to all reviewers on MyAnimeList because you guys scored The Outcast much higher than Japan and China locally on average (6.64). When I checked the scores on Accessify.com (Japan) and Bangumi.tv (China), I was surprised that those who could watch the completed version and the most fabulous part of the animation scored it an average of mere 6. How low it is! What a pity!\\n\\n\r\nI was not trying to make you feel bad about this animation in the last paragraph, but I rather aimed to put the problems of this animation forward and then to suggest you not focusing so much on those defects. This animation is actually one of those \u2018big steps\u2019 of current Chinese anime production, and it marked a lot of brave attempts of Chinese artists even though the attempts might not have been so successful. Chinese creators were really trying their best to make an art piece as well as a commercial product that belongs to their culture, and they have showed us how fascinating an anime could possibly be if it was adapted to a different society (what I\u2019m referring to is the completed Chinese cover). Plenty problems of the animation were results of low investment, arrogance of Japan-side anime makers and discords between Chinese and Japanese directors. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation would only have pleased and enchanted a watcher if one had been able to settle down and be enthusiastic to learn about the background, because it had involved so many Chinese cultural as well as historical elements that had been alien to Japanese, let alone us Westerners. In the original unedited Chinese cover, the animators even used a Chinese folk song as an opening and for every single character they let them speak unique dialects like Mandarin (Zhang Chulan), Sichuan Mandarin (Feng Baobao), Chaozhou Mandarin, Cantonese etc. The 12-episode series also revealed us some history of China, for instance, the World War II, the period when the communist government was suppressing bandits, the golden age of Chinese pop songs and the return of Hong Kong. Chinese religions (Daoism and Chinese side Buddism), traditional weapons, philosophy, pop culture, literature and humours are also all merged organically in The Outcast, especially in the story after the end of episode 12 in manga. The Outcast banged us with decisiveness of Chinese and a story line that is so disjoint from what we normally call Anime: something that has gradually filled up with Moe, fan service, clich\u00e9, \u2018harem\u2019 of male characters and unrealistically kind people who doesn't kill to leave the enemies coming back with stronger powers.\\n\\n\r\nHence I highly recommend The Outcast, it should not be the edited animation but the complete version and manga though. It will open for you a new world and tell you a story of heroes and heroines that have new charms. COME AND WATCH OR READ! It is undoubtedly an unmissable great work for those who truly love ACGN and those who are interested in an exotic story!\\n",

My only problem with it is that it only have 12 episodes and no manga to continue. \r\nI saw someone saying \"Chinese Zombie Stuff\", but only one character uses zombies as weapons, all the rest have different superpowers, and the story is about them, or more precisely about the grandfather of Chou Soran. \r\nI think the plot was cool, and the development was just right. I even like the characters, usually the emotionless steriotype still have some level of emotion, this one is really a psycopath. That doesn't meanshe is evil, she just don't understand what are feelings. She could be called a Tsundere, since she beats the main character, but different of all the Tsunderes out there, Soran, the beaten main character, gets to the point that he says, NO! And even knowing he could die, he still go away. This is taking matters more seriously outside the masoquist main character cliche, and I really like that. \\n\\n\r\nI also liked the tone the anime makes. It gets things serious but backs the humor just after and never gets the viewer in a despairate situation. I know this doesn't create tension, but it isn't bad by itself, and can still render some good fights. Damn, One Punch Man follow the same principle, and it is good. This of course, builds more tension to when the fights gets serious, but unfortunately it doesn't show, or it have a climax.\\n\\n\r\nThe big point for me is really the characters, even without much background, they are flashed out by their actions, not just steriotipicals characters copy and paste. And they do that without backing for when they were children, Suck that, Naruto!\\n\\n\r\nWhatever. I really liked it, and really would like a second season or manga to  follow, I hope it eventually happens, but with this average score, I doubt. It is pity.",

This isn't a game on steam where youread tons of reviews to determine whether it's a good game or not. For anime, ONLY YOUR OPINIONS MATTER! And I really hope everyone remembers that. So go ahead and watch the show, and don't be afraid of going in face first into a potential pile of shit because that's just part of the experience. \\n\\n\r\nAnd this is my OPINION.

            "content": "First off, if by reading the synopsis you thought this was a show about zombies (a la Highschool of the Dead)...it's not. It's about \"Outsiders\"--seemingly ordinary people with extraordinary abilities. One of those Outsiders is a girl who can control zombies, but she is NOT the main character.\r\nSecondly, if you haven't started watching, I must pre-warn you of this part in the 1st episode which caused a fair number of people to give up in disgust. It's the scene where Houhou is trying to bury the MC, Soran, and he just sits there  like an idiot. Why doesn't he just get up and runaway? See, in the original webcomic (which I checked out), that pit is supposed to be much deeper than shown in the anime (it's over Soran's height even when he's standing up and he likely had to jump to get over its edge--at which point he was easily kicked backed down by Houhou.) For some reason, the anime depicts the pit as being really shallow, which makes this particular scene not credible...but I'd put this down to bad art, rather than bad writing.\\n\\n\r\n***Ratings***\\n\\n\r\n-- Plot/Pacing: B\\n\r\nAt first, the mystery behind Soran's background and the Outsider world in general made me anticipate each new episode, as I found myself wanting to know more about the Outsiders and the different organisations and to see the development of the various characters and their relationships. However, after the whole Outsiders thing was explained (episode 5), I felt it wasn't that big of a deal/reveal at all. Worse, the pace slowed considerably (around episode 7 onwards)--and it was already quite slow before. The comedy bits are also a bit overdone and can be quite jarring, but you kind of get used to them after awhile.\\n\\n\r\n-- Seiyu/Sound: B+\\n\r\nI'm watching the Japanese dub (with sub-par English subs.) I think the voice actors did a fairly decent job, giving the characters enough of their own life and personality, such as the indifferent Houhou, the slutty Natsuka, the cunning Lo Ryu, etc. The soundtrack is pretty much standard J-rock, but the OP managed to get stuck inside my head after awhile.\\n\\n\r\n-- Art/Animation: B\\n\r\nThe character designs are nothing out of the ordinary, and the quality of the art is inconsistent (from \"not bad\" to \"ugly/lazy.\") I don't know if it's just me but I felt there was a noticeable drop in the quality from episode 7 onwards.\\n\\n\r\n-- Bonus/Bias: +10%\\n\r\nI'm giving bonus points solely for the character of Fuu Houhou. Normally I detest those \"stoic\", emotionless-girl type of characters, but Houhou just seems different somehow...her messy hair, poor fashion sense, ignorance of societal norms and conventions, and her insane skill with kitchen knives and choppers all combine to give her a very unique appeal (read: \"moe.\") Her character significantly helped to sustain my interest in the series--and I know there are a number of people out there who feel the same way.\\n\\n\r\n***Additional  info***\\n\r\nThe original source is a Chinese webcomic and the anime is a collaboration between Chinese and Japanese producers. I watched the Japanese dub and a bit of the Chinese dub (just to compare), and I think the Japanese dub was produced first, the reason being that the animation matches the Japanese voices better, while it is a bit out-of-sync for the Chinese voices.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of differences in script, the Chinese one is more crude. For example, in one scene, a female character in the Japanese script says something like, \"it would be better if we were on a date\", while the Chinese script has her saying, \"it would be better if we were in bed\". The Chinese script also has more cussing.\\n\\n\r\nAs for English subtitles, unfortunately the fan-made one is very far from perfect. Some terms weren't translated at all. For example, the following terms:\\n\\n\r\n(1) Kinkou - literally \"golden light\". It's a visible aura manifested from one's inner energy. Soran's kinkou is supposed to protect him from harm.\\n\\n\r\n(2) Xiangxi ganshi - \"Xiangxi\" is the name of a place in China (where the practice of animating corpses to transport them was popular in the past), and \"ganshi\" literally means \"corpse-driver\". Ryu Kenken is referred to as a xiangxi ganshi--a person who knows how to manipulate corpses.",

            "content": "Well what have we got here? it's the seasonal worst anime award time and you guessed it, Hitori no Shita wins that award hands down. If you ever wanted to experience pain I would recommend sitting on a bed of nails or walking into a fire because this show will actually rot away your soul.\r\nStory 2/10\r\nI won't lie when this show first came out I was sitting on the fence. It starts off as a zombie anime but then does a full 360 and turns into a superpowered Kung fu shitfest. The story pacing is probably one of the worst I have ever seen. (Yesthat's right ladies and gentlemen even worse than SAO.) I watched each week because I felt like it  was slightly interesting and the ingredients were there for something great. After week 12 of the anime, I sat waiting for the next episode to see how this little saga would conclude. But nothing came, yes that's right, they finished off this anime with a 3 episode flashback of Houhou's past.\\n\\n\r\nArt 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't bad, it was very lazy styling and it didn't really do anything to leave an impression, I don't have anything to say about this really because it was neither good nor bad. \\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOnce again sound wise there isn't really much to touch on.  The OP isn't bad but it doesn't really strike me as anything special, and sound wise through the episodes the little background music there is, is all pretty normal stuff. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 4/10\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the part which was rather hit and miss. The MC is made out as super OP and he doesn't really have any down points . The way he reacts in all situations is pretty much how you would expect someone to so that's fine. HouHou is an interesting one and once again is strong which is interesting. To be honest, if it weren't for the fact that it was enjoyable watching HouHou kick the crap out of people I would have dropped this.  As far as antagonists go I can only think of 2. One is a weak idiot who tries to kill HouHou, fails and then dies. The other was actually more interesting than the main cast. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI had a shred of hope for this season and it honestly disappointed me so badly. There were a few cliffhangers which were interesting but to be honest the only time I wanted another episode was to see if HouHou was alive or not. \\n\\n\r\nOveral 1/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story is interesting and I feel that good things could come from this, the story never actually gets past the scene setting phase. I can not accept that someone would think that it's a good idea to air a half-assed anime like this. Part of me wants to read the story to find out what happens but honestly, it's insulting to us as viewers what they have pulled with this. \\n\r\nSave your time and watch something else.\\n",

Personally I liked it obviously because I gave it an 8 overall and see a lot of potential if they continue beyond season 1.  I also liked the art and animation styles. The story follows Chou who is an \"Outsider\" (someone with supernatural abilities). He catches a lot of flack about being a virgin but is actually a straight up bada**. Like most anime the whole thing revolves around random bad guys popping upcomplicating the mc's life and pushing him to reveal more and more of just how far his potential goes. While it is a bit slower paced at points that is to try developing the back story and characters alongside the current events in the story. The humor does tend to revolve a lot around the fact Chou is a virgin and how to manipulate him because of that. But hey we all know what it was or is like to be a horny teen virgin desperately trying to solve that problem with anything that would sit still long enough to let us, and that's one of the things I enjoyed about the comedic moments. Also, there are SOME zombies and lets face it everyone loves zombies whether they admit it or not, but be warned its not just about zombies.",

This is why I do not dislike the generic magic kung-fu concept, it's merely a small aspect to help drive the plot.\r\nArt - 7\r\nThe modern art style worked well with the concept of the show.\r\nCharacter - 3\r\nThe main characters are a little over the top. A hopeless virgin witha complete inability to make decisions and constantly jumps to conclusions. It also seemed like they didn't know what direction they wanted to go with the main character and so they pulled him in every direction... The writers inability to make an interesting main character is this show's major weakness. I honestly like the supporting characters more than the main characters, not a good sign.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nIts not perfect but keeps you engaged if you have an attention span longer than a goldfish\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nWould probably be a 9 if the main characters were likable.",

Just babbling so might not be helpful.\r\nYou know, despite all the negative reviews I read about this anime, I have to say I am enjoying it. \r\nIt's slow in the sense that I understand the lead's situation, but it also sounds complicated which in a sense I cant imagine how it will end in just 12 episodes. \r\nI actually am really enjoying it right now considering I haven't watched any anime lately that has caught my attention. It's slightly unique in its own way. And I do have to admit that I might be captivated because of our female lead's voice actress. HahaI'm a fan of her voice and tend to like the anime she voices for like Snow White with the Red Hair. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly I do have to say nothing really awesome has happened, but if you're bored with nothing to watch, this isn't as horrible as it sounds. \\n\\n\r\nDon't watch this anime having expectations. I just found it and started watching it without knowing anything bout it. xD",
