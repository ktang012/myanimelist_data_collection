            "content": "\"Random\", \"Over-the-top\", \"Weird\", and \"Hilarious\" might be some of the descriptions one might come across when reading about the Arakawa Under the Bridge franchise. With the plot's groundwork having been laid out in the first season, Bridge x Bridge showcases more of its eclectic cast's daily life and misadventures with a little character development every now and then, if one pays attention. As Bridge x Bridge is the second season of the original Arakawa Under the Bridge, viewing of the first season is required for full enjoyment. That said, Bridge x Bridge will satisfy most fans of the first season with its ever quirky charactersand humorous hijinks. \\n\\n\r\nStory (no spoilers):\\n\r\nAforementioned, the story starts off where the first season left off in the banks of the river Arakawa. Bridge x Bridge seeks to develop character relationships whereas the previous season developed the background for the show. One strong point about Bridge x Bridge is that it is very consistent in its quality of humor and episodic storytelling. The bulk of the comedy revolves around the cast's interactions in their daily lives, their penchant for randomness, and Kou's reaction to everything around him from a normal man's point of view (in other words, it's the same as the previous season's type of humor). This approach might be hit-or-miss, depending on how much the viewers will take a liking to the characters, but it will still end up bringing some laugh out loud moments at least every now and then for most. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOh, where to begin. The personalities of Arakawa are what makes the show truly enjoyable. Each character has a unique and silly personality to his/herself that tends to create hilarious moments when combined. Bridge x Bridge gives more screentime to characters neglected previous season, including Billy, an ex-gangster, Jacqueline, his love interest, and Amazoness, a bulky woman with a personality of a schoolgirl. The show's main focus is comedy, so unfortunately, character development is pushed to the side apart from a few moments of the characters' pasts being revealed (especially Nino's). This is rather disappointing since the show offers so many mysteries and questions about its characters, yet answering very few. In this respect, Bridge x Bridge unfortunately brings less satisfaction in the previous season which delved in detail about Kou's history. Nonetheless, the characters are still a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: \\n\r\nThe animation in Bridge x Bridge is a typical SHAFT affair: usually passable with some moments of brilliance and occasionally being surreal. Notably absent from this season is the stock \"Kou blink\" animation used so often in last season, giving more time for actually animated scenes - always a nice thing. As for the art, Bridge x Bridge features a colorful style that will probably have no problem hooking your attention when you see it. Character designs are also quite nice on the eyes; every single character is visually distinctive from one another and their odd designs match their personality perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe OP \"COSMOS vs. ALIENS\" is a strange (but very charming) little song that might take some getting used to, while the ED \"Akai Coat\" is a nice indie rock tune. Both do a fine job of setting the mood for the show. Voice acting in this series is very well done: Kamiya Hiroshi's stern straight man voice for Kou Ichinomiya, Maaya Sakamoto's soft voice for Nino, Miyuki Sawashiro's sweet but haunting performance for Maria all gets top scores. As for the soundtrack, the music does well to match the mood of moment, which is usually quirky and sometimes over-the-top, but also with relaxing atmospheres that pop up every now and then (and the cold opening for every episode). Overall, SHAFT did a very nice job in the sound department. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nDespite the main plot progressing very slowly, a unique story with unique characters and even stranger presentation (as per SHAFT) are several reasons why Bridge x Bridge kept me excited every week to see a new episode. If you've enjoyed the first season, the second season is highly recommended as well. I'd recommend the entire Arakawa Under the Bridge series to anyone looking for an original, funny anime that isn't afraid to stand apart from the conventions of typical anime characters. \\n\\n\r\n(Helpful or Not Helpful, feedback on this review is very welcome)",

Slight character development spoilers ahead.\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge focuses more of the interactions between Riku/Kou and Nino than the underlying social commentary that the first season reflected in a community of people whom in most cases would be shunned by others. But who despite their superficial eccentricities are still more or less normal human beings inside, with all the flaws and strengths that encompasses, who find a home together in the middle of, yet separated from the judgmental eyes of society.\r\nIn some ways Riku/Kou is the most bizzare among them. But despite his constant attempts to separate himself from thegroup and establish himself as the only normal human being among them he eventually reaches a sort of acceptance of the situation, not out of necessity, but from honestly looking past the superficial attributes to the persons underneath the facade and finds people who aren't controlled by his father's egocentric, conceited outlook on life, and through that learns to see the fundamental flaw in his own reasoning.\\n\r\nThat in his constant attempts to imitate his father he has completely accepted his father's twisted world view and morality as his own, without ever questioning whether or not it is right. Neither objectively nor subjectively.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge, and prequiel, take the viewer on a journey, where we get to follow a deeply incomplete and arrogant man through a world that constantly challenges all of his convictions, most fundamental principles and ideology, in a battle against his own prejudice and maladaption.\\n\r\nA journey in which he learns the meaning of true happiness; trust; family; and love.",

            "content": "Wow, Im the first to review! Well, it's my first real review as well, still hope this will be to some help. NB this is MY review thus I'm expressing my OPINION. I just want people to understand why I really like this series.\r\n  This really is a continuation of the first series - Thus:\r\n   Story: 8\r\n  It takes a certain kind of humor to appreciate the storyline and humor really is the key to this series. It's wonderfully hilarious with free spirits that are not necessarily stupid, like most cartoon characters, but only different in their way of thinking. Evenif it's slice of life, you really feel like you're moving forward as you get to know the many different characters better and since it's made up of chapters which keeps it from getting stuck at some unimportant detail. The best things is that it doesn't feel like \"I've seen this 2000 times before\", their actions still surprise you and.. I got to tell you - it is SO refreshing to get out of school with characters beyond 16! Oh, and no ecchi ecchi harem in sight.\\n\\n\r\n  Art: 8\\n\r\n The characters are drawn rather simplistic. Instead, the artist has really spend a lot of time on the surrounding area. There are a lot of detailed shots of the river, the grass, the sky... It's evidently a part of the story - after all, there's a reason why so many people are spending their days at this specific riverbank and it feels more idyllic. Therefore this art style is good for this anime.\\n\\n\r\n  Sound: 7\\n\r\n The soundtrack for goes really well with the series. The op and ending are, in my opinion, better than the last one and it sets you in the right mood! The sound in the anime would however would not be anything I'd listen as it is. \\n\\n\r\n  Character: 8\\n\r\n The character that develop the most is Recruit. This is best seen during the first series. Yet here there has already been a sign of him growing as a man in love as well which is a huge step forward and thus it already deserves an 8. As the other characters actions still surprise me they never get boring and doesn't need as much development as Recruit. Slice of life doesn't really require as much of this either. \\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\n As this series always get my spirits up I have to call it great. It's outrageous in a good way. I really enjoy myself while watching this and can't wait for the next episode. In all honesty, it took me some episodes to get used enough to the humor to just lay back and enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall: 8\\n\r\n This is very good if you're inexplicably down, bored or high spirited. Its silly but not idiotic and it shows those small problems that can be huge to one person. No world(s) crisis, no school, no work just entertainment.",

            "content": "Well, I must say I'm a fan of the first season of Arakawa Under The Bridge. It had everything a good (not great) show must have: good characters, nice jokes, things you don't get to see in all anime... well I loved it, although, after all, I only gave it a 7. And why was that? Because Arakawa loses itself in the way. And for my own sadness, it's happening again with Arakawa in \"Bridge X Bridge\".\r\nI have nothing to say about the story, nor the art. The concept is still the same, brilliant idea, rich guy literally lives under a bridge. The art isbasicly equal to the one in season 1: simplistic yet enjoyable character design and backgrounds/cenarios. \\n\\n\r\nIn matter of sound, I only have good things to say about it. I'm obviously refering to the crazy what-the-hell-is-this-? opening song, \"Cosmos Vs. Alien\", that really made me laugh. It's just so wacky... But I love it.\\n\\n\r\n'Till now we should have all conditions for a seven or an eight, right? ... Right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters seem to have lost their charm (except for Billy, that guy really rocks). Ric acts more stupid than in season 1, but now his stupidity is, instead of funny, just really really sad. Hiroshi Kamiya's work in here is absolutely dispicable. I loved his performance in Durarara!!, as Izaya, but Ric's expressions are just silly, and he screems like an idiot. Maybe  I could have enjoy it if I wasn't a big fan of Bakemonogatari , but I just can't. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nHoshi has been singin' \"Himo\" so much that is no longer cool, but annoying. That's a perfect example of formula repetition, which often can destroy a good show.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's been stabbing Arakawa 2 like a madman is the pacing. My god, it just seems the episodes never end. When I think the episode's at 20 minutes already, it only goes at 9! And why? Because the rhythm is slow as hell!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2 made no sense. That Amazone gag was just laughble, in every single way. \\n\\n\r\nSo, I'm terribly disappointed with Arakawa Under The Bridge X Bridge. I score it as a 3, because it's not only bad stuff, as you may have noticed if you read the entire review. Yet, it's an insult to the manga and the first season of the show. And, as in Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin, i'm pretty sure the last episodes won't improve that much.",

            "content": "Unoriginal, Safe and linear compared to the first season are all true when talking about Arakawa Under The Bridge x Bridge. But WAIT! Before you instantly disregard this sequel you MUST know that in many ways Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge is better that it's predecessor and if you loved the first season, than I guarantee you that you will definitely love this season. You may be treading some familiar ground, but hey, who said that more of the same is a bad thing? Welcome back to the crazy, yet humbling place that is, Arakawa Under the Bridge! \r\nStory:\r\n(+) For starters, this is indeeda straight up sequel to the original, Arakawa Under the Bridge. This means that if you haven't seen that yet than I urge you to go back and watch that first before coming here; since there will be plenty of references to it's original that might strike you as odd rather than hilarious. For those who of you that have seen it, the story's no different: a story about the daily lives of all the people under the Arakawa Bridge doing more wacky endeavors, with a few new added characters to rattle up the bunch! What makes the story different however is that this series wanted to focus more on the relationship aspect between Ko and Nino since you didn't get a lot of that in the last season. Because of this, there is a more centered and focused story line between the two. This can make for some nice emotional scenes, and great Character development centered around our main lovers. It was very heartwarming when you can see the two characters grow because of each other. Furthermore, we definitely can't forget about the comedy. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to say that there was even MORE over the top comedy present here than the first season.  Since Ko is now use to life under the bridge, he gets involved  in even more crazy events which can honestly make some of the most hilarious scenes throughout the show. Another nice feature was to include comedic references to pop culture. Even though some might be unfamiliar, the way they handled it was comedy gold. GO KAMEARI!\\n\\n\r\n(-) As previously mentioned, this show can outright be unoriginal, safe, and linear and sadly most of these faults come from the story. as I stated, the creators of this show decided to go for a more linear over-arcing plot featuring our main characters. This turns the show from a show about acceptance into a more romance based series. Although it may be a nice addition to some, it loses the charm that it's predecessor had. I found the series had less hidden morals that people can really understand and relate with, and instead I found a show ONLY about the two characters. Another thing I should note was that this show remained constant throughout the series. There wasn't any situations where I truly felt any emotion for the characters, since all sub plot lines were able to conclude by the end of the episode. Therefore, I enjoyed the episodes as a whole, but wasn't urging to watch the next one like it's first season was so masterfully able to do. Another thing I should mention is the ending itself. Even though the ending finished on a nice and subtle note, by the end of the series there are still so many questions left unanswered and the big thing that has been leading up to the conclusion just never got fulfilled, making the closing as a whole anticlimactic. For a series that's not known for it's story, it's really saddening when they do try to include a solid plot but then don't faithfully end it the way it's led to be.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n(+) Once again Shaft was able to re-create the whole surrounding of silliness perfectly through its art. Everything you loved about the art is still there, right down to the colorful opening theme to the live action segments at the end (Now even more present!).\\n\\n\r\n(-) Since everything is the same in terms of art, you don't see any upgrade or further development because of it. The character designs still look the same and the Arakawa Bridge is definitely the same one you saw the last time. No extra detail was added and if you're not a fan of the silly art style then this is no different.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n(+) Continuing from the first season, all the sound effects are carried on here, and are ever so present now. Another worthy thing I should note is the opening, \"COSOMOS VS ALIEN\" and the ending, \"Akai Coat.\" Keeping it in the same tradition of the first season, the opening theme acts to show the whole over the top vibe that Bridge X Bridge has, while the ending theme gives the slow and emotionally serious tone that this sequel may drop on you time to time (Go Suneohair!). Oh and once again, Losers Wail makes it comedic return and might even make you chant it time to time! \"Himo Hi-\"\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n(+) The quirky comedic characters of the Arakawa Bridge are back and better than ever! Everything you loved (or hated) about the character are present and are once again reprising they're loved (or hated) roles. But now they're even more over the top! Since they are doing more extreme miscellaneous things, I would say that all the characters are even more energetic and crazy than they once were! Whether it's trying to bunk together for a week or all going on a diet to lose wait, the interactions between each character are still ever so comedically funny and can make up for some serious laughs. Second, the series even added more characters to this larger than life cast. An Amazoness and battle star defender (who's not really a space defender) are introduced and even though they have the least screen time, they still left an impression on me and I was laughing every minute they were on screen.\\n\\n\r\n(-) I think this is the one time I would probably say that Character Development would be a negative. Since as mentioned before, the series went for a more solid story line focusing on Nino and Ko. But that's really most of all we get. Sure they get TONS of character development, but in return most of the side characters lose screen time. You might get a little development from a few side characters, but most of the time, they're hardly the center of attention. In some ways this is a bit of a wasted opportunity since all these characters are interesting in their own rights and each deserved the attention. There was even more hints to future character development that ended up never getting it, particularly to The Amazoness. Stella is probably one of my favorite characters in the show, and her personality hardly ever shines off throughout the show!\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nWhen I look back on Arakawa Under the Bridge, I remember the first season for it's charm and the second for its comedy. Dropping such relatable themes and forgetting some of the side characters really puts this season a step back from it's original. It's also more of the same so if you seen the first season and you absolutely hated it, than this is not the right place to change your mind. Still, the enjoyment I had for this season is IMMENSE and was easily worth the time I spent with such amusing personalities. So, with one recommendation and one question I ask you, Will you come to Venus?  \\n\r\n8/10",

            "content": "This review will focus on pretty much both series since they ran in the same year. \r\nYoung business man, a future CEO of big conglomerate, falls from a bridge and is saved by mysterious blonde girl Nino. His family\u2019s motto is never be in debt to anyone. And as Nino saves his life, he becomes indebt to her. Trying to make up for it he asks her to wish for anything. And she wishes for love. Thus begins his crazy life under the bridge, amongst group of crazy people, where he may be the craziest. \r\nIf I had to sum up Arakawa it would be\u201cpoor man\u2019s Gintama with romance\u201d. Lots of different gag scenes, lots of references, lots of character gimmicks. Some of them good, some of them great, some annoying. This anime WILL make you laugh, but it can become boring at times. \\n\\n\r\nAkiyuki Shinbou\u2019s directing for me personally is hit or miss. Some of his techniques and styles are cool and interesting and some feel forced (earlier in the series, the eye shot got REALLY overused).  \\n\\n\r\nI would probably end up giving the series 6/10 if not for its production; which is great. We have A+ voice actors (with my beloved Maaya Sakamoto as Nino) who all do excellent job. Openings and Endings are very enjoyable and mash really well with the tone of the series (first opening is by far my favourite in terms of both visual structure and music itself).  When it comes to animation, Shinbou as always uses his specific style and mixes in lots of different stuff to achieve pretty impressive looking show (backgrounds are beautiful).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very enjoyable for what it is when it works, and watchable when it doesn\u2019t. \\n",

            "content": "*English is not my mother tongue. So, I hope everybody can understand this review. *\r\nNowadays, there are a lot of studios that are trying to recreate auspicious series from the past. However, they fail horribly in the process. One example of this, could be the last Anime directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (whom is the man responsible from animes like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, just to mention a few). Nevertheless, sometimes they come up with deep and involving stories. In fact, this is the case for Arakawa Under The Bridge.\r\nFirstly, let me introduce \"Shinbo Akiyuki\". This man is and educator in Shaft Studioand the reason why the Monogatari series is so popular. Besides, He developed a charismatic way to project actions and feelings through the screen. This style is so unique that it does not suit in every anime.  For instance, this type of direction is is close enough to what was introduced in the narrative changes from XX century. The reason why I say this is because there is a huge change between season 1 and 2. Notably, this second season is (as another reviewer said) \"Safe and linear\" compared to the previous one. The story came in a very compact way, which was nonexistent previously. Indeed, the majority of the animes directed by the man have this particular style of direction. Moreover, bear in mind that animes like Bakemonogatari, have nothing to do with Arakawa Under The Bridge. Although they have the same director they are oriented in a different way. As the saying goes, they are opposite sides of the same coin. This is why I think it deserves a 8/10 in story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, despite this change in the direction suits it genially, this adaptation fails in the same thing of the previous season. A point often overlooked in this series is the downgrade between scene and scene. As a result of this, sometimes the face of the characters looks disfigured. Under this circumstances, I have to give this anime a 7/10 in visuals. Indeed, it is a shame, because there are occasions where the director brings out what he did in Bakemonogatari and gives us some incredible shots. If you ask me, my personal favourite is when Nino's hair raises up and make strange forms, such as Araragi's.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as the art, the soundtrack and OST does not change that much between the two seasons. It stays with quiet guitar or piano solos and low rhythm blues. These pieces suits perfectly with the narrative of the cartoon. The opening and ending is decent enough. That's why I think it deserves a 8/10 in this area\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the two previous points, there`s a big change as regards in Character development. Furthermore, I felt this season they gave us a more detailed background story for every side character. The example I could tell you off the top of my head is what they made with Shiro and Hoshi. However, they not only developed side characters. But, they also expand the romance between Nino and Ric. As well as the story behind Nino`s past. The only thing I wish is that they would established a more adult relationship. Nevertheless, because of the great job done, I gave them a 9/10 in Characters.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my point of view, this is an incredible series, which every person who liked the work from Shinbo Akiyuki should watch. My final score for this series is a 9/10.\\n",

I was not expecting such enjoyment from watching this show, typically when they make a second seasons it would be boring and off-sense but this was extremely amazing show. \r\nThe story is no story because its the most amazing story in this anime that there is nothing to think about, just relax be comfy and unwind while watching Arakawa that will wipe away your daily-life troubles. (It worked for me -sometime-). Anyhow, this is the best comedy I have ever seen so far that makes me LMAOall the time. \\n\r\nThe characters are unique and weirdish which I really liked in this anime. Every episode was funnier than the previous one and there are some things I did not expect to exist in this anime but it was super fun. \\n\\n\r\nMy general recommendation if you like some laughter, to get over your depression daily-hard-life go and watch Arakawa because it's totally worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "So, Arakawa Under the Bridge....X BRIDGE!\r\nI'll be honest here, though I started watching this a long time after it aired, I'm surprised it got a second season. Shows like this, despite being rather entertaining usually don't get more than one season yet here we are. I was rather fond of the first season and I started this one soon after.\r\nStory:\r\nListen, I know this supposed to be a gag series but please, please, do not dangle what could be very interesting plot threads in front of my face and NOT resolve it! I had so many questions left over from the first season. Why were thesepeople under the bridge? Who are they really? What is up with\\n\r\nmayor? Are the characters' \"quirks and delusions\" real or are they really just crazy?\\n\\n\r\nNone of these questions got answered in this season and they never will, unless I read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThat's right, the way the show ends essentially tells the viewer to read the manga for answers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in comments of where I was watching the show, a person, thankfully for once, spoiled the ending to the manga and OH MY GOD. SUCH AN INTERESTING PLOT, THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN A SATISFACTORY ENDING TO THIS SERIES WAS REPLACED BY EPISODIC COMEDY IN THE FINAL SEASON.\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate comedy, and this show is genuinely funny, but...I wanted by questions to answered.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the episodic plots were good I guess. They were funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art's okay. It's not 100% perfect all the time but then again, I don't think that would really fit for a series like this. I liked the bright and vibrant colors and the character designs were memorable. I liked how at the end of each episode, there'd be nice fan art. There were also moments when the art became really pretty at just the right moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for the music, I wasn't that into the opening song but I have to admit that it's very fitting for the series. I liked the ending song better, Background music was okay but the music that plays whenever Nino and Ric/Ko have a sweet moment together is what I like best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters all serve their purpose to get the most laughs out of the audience. While I can't say there was an incredible amount of character development or that everyone's characterization is deeper than the sea, all of them are pretty likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe comedy is 10/10 no problem. This show got a lot of laughs out of me, however, as I said earlier in the Story section, they didn't use what would have been a very interesting plot. This lessened my enjoyment throughout the final four episodes as I realized that I wouldn't get the resolution I desired.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Watch it for the laughs, but if you're hoping for plot and character development, either look somewhere else or read the manga\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Why is the dad so understand about his son living undera bridge now? why doesnt he care as much as he did in the first season, and so on and so forth. honestly i could care less about the plot, if your familar with the frist season it continues on where it left off, and showing Rics and Ninos love flourish, it was beautiful but just one to many plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nIts HQ, Drawn very clean, And its quite well for the series, and it varies depending on the mood, I enjoyed the constant change to fit what was happening in the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is the part of the show that will draw you in. The Vast variety of characters, A crazed perfectionist, A silent beauty who belives shes from mars, a miltary man dressed as a nun, a dicator woman evil to the core, love sick star, a amazoness and many more characters. These characters were so well thought out, you can feel every characters emotions, and personalities. They are the most unique cast of characters youll ever meet, and i you dont like the characters than just turn of your tv, computer, ipad what ever your watching and find something else to watch. This anime is Extremely character based.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nif you want an easy short, funny,and simple anime this is the one for you.  but i you want something a bit more plot driven find something else. this show is or people who want to be entertained, and slightly moved emotianally but not think too hard.

            "content": "!!This review includes the first season!!\r\nAnd yet, another anime with no meaningful story line. More like it doesn\u2032t really have any. The first time I stumbled upon Arakawa Under the Bridge, I thought it was really great - guess I got my hopes up and got nothing. Nevertheless, I believe it gave me some good laughs, from what I can remember. I guess not all 'slice of life and comedy mix' anime are always that great, for me. Unlike Working!! which became one of my favorite slice-of-life and comedy mix anime. I wonder why this anime isn\u2032t tagged as Slice of Life.\r\nYes, story. Where isthe story? If I were you, I wouldn\u2032t search for it - because you will never ever find it; Arakawa Under the Bridge is just another slice-of-life with comedy anime that is lacking enough story and plot, but I guess you won\u2032t be needing any of those because you will have a good laugh out of it. But I can\u2032t really guarantee it, since the jokes and gags are merely boring, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge (x Bridge) consists of an awkwardly yet funny and crazy (at the same time) set of characters, which is most probably what you would consider as one of the 'strong' points in the anime, but without a plot, it wouldn\u2032t be any better.Here we have an i-don\u2032t-know-if-they\u2032re-really-a-couple couple Kou and Nino, yes, they are very awkward. I\u2032m not really sure if they really like each other, but let\u2032s just think they do. Let\u2032s leave it at that; We also have a Kappa Mayor, a Star-masked guitarist-singer, Hoshi; a Falcon, with a human body, a guy who only walks over white lines, a sadist farmer-lady, named Maria, and a transvestite guy nun who is referred to as Sister.\\n\\n\r\nWe still have heaps more crazy characters that are involved, but I guess mentioning them would be more crazier. Arakawa\u2032s set of characters is really great, they are very unique, and each of them have their own funny side to them with a pinch of mixed-personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Arakawa is its uniqueness on the characters, yes, they are in the recent time and era, but what\u2032s up with the falcon and kappa mayor and star head? From which planet are they from? Earth, my friend, they\u2032re from Earth. One thing I also like about Arakawa is the genre, Seinen, with Comedy and Romance. Whenever there\u2032s comedy, I always hope for Romance - but not everything comes the way I want them to. But this one has it, and I very much like the mix of genres so; In this case, you will most probably like the art together with the mix of the catchy intros and outros that fit the image and theme of the show perfectly well.\\n\\n\r\nBut the thing that I didn\u2032t like in Arakawa is its lack of Romance, it didn\u2032t even fully bloom. They shold\u2032ve deepen the love between the awkward yet funny couple more, so that we will truly agree on the fact that they truly love each other. But I guess it\u2032s impossible to happen based on Nino\u2032s personality and slowness when it comes to love. And I\u2032m guessing that the lack of romance is for the best, because Romance shall never conquer comedy Arakawa, it\u2032ll lose its taste.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Arakawa altogether, but not as much as how I enjoyed Working!! which is somehow closely the same as Arakawa in terms of their mix of genres, but both are different in a lot of aspects - one is the theme. Despite the lack of deep story, you\u2032ll get smiles in exchange. From this point on, watching shows with no plot but with comedy and slice of life is now my thing. So I guess you should try and loosen a bit, and free your self from overly-mainstream set of genres in a show from time to time. It isn\u2032t much a waste of time and effort, once you start to try it.",

Now for whatever reason you may have skipped the first season, fear not, as Arakawa does not have \"real true\" story to it, it does have some parts where you'll need to watch the first season in order to understand the second season it's not something that is a must-watch otherwise you'll be dumbfounded on what's happening. \r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThere isn't a \"real\" story to this anime, there isa bit of story hinted around each episode, however this anime is more specifically made for people who just enjoy watching whatever is set upon their screen without needing a lot of thinking to enjoy the series. If you just want to release some stress, laugh out loud in a way that you haven't for quite some time, then I highly recommend you watch this series, as I've found myself laughing out and \"legitimately rolling on the floor\" at how light-hearted this series really is. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite good, there are many times in the anime where the pictures used to describe how each character is feeling is well shown. Throughout the series, it looks as though the art stay's the same since first season and there isn't much change. Needless to say the \"title Under the bridge x bridge\" gives off the obviously hint of the story taking place mainly under a bridge.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound displayed for each scene matches almost perfectly, when a character is being serious, thinking, being totally random or displaying sadness, the background music suits the series quite well. The OP and ED themes are decent in my opinion, however they are well done since I've watched many series and never seen an OP or ED as unique as Arakawa's. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the best part of the entire series. Each character has their own unique personality with a few exceptions of them having the same traits. There is lots of times where the character will intentionally change their personality to fit the scene or match what another character is saying. \"Especially Nino, the main female protagonist.\" Now for the romance fans, unfortunately if you're looking for an extremely lovey-dovey type of anime, then I am sorry to say you'll be heavily disappointed. There IS definitely signs of romance everywhere, I think almost every single character in the anime has somebody else they love as \"Arakawa Under the Bridge\" is one giant family and although they are not blood-related each of them treats one another as if they were all really born from the same family. There is however, definitely a few kissing scenes but I'll keep it at that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a nice, easy laidback and a random anime, I recommend Arakawa to you. I often found myself laughing a lot during the series and smiling almost every episode. Each episode has a lot of randomness and I think this anime may actually relieve stress for people who are under stress from their daily lives, so I highly recommend this to people who are stressed from whatever is happening and would enjoy a good laugh now and then. If you've watched the first season then I recommend watching the second season for sure. This series definitely had flaws and mistakes in certain scenes/episodes but it's just such an original and light-hearted series I just couldn't criticize it. Overall I hope you'll consider watching this anime, and enjoy it as much as I did, and if you haven't watched the first season check it out first!\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you look at my entire score you see that my overall score really isn't an average of the others. I'll break down why I gave the score within this review and try to show you how an anime that has great elements might not have the best score.\r\nEnjoyment: If you came here for laughs you'll surely receive them. Season 2 continues the pure enjoyment you got out of the first season with jokes and nonsense littered throughout every episode. The writers rarely miss their mark and when they do the moment is brief and still gives you a small smile. Many people will enjoyArakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge, it's hard for you not to. If you let yourself sit down and enjoy the ridiculous ride you'll leave there feeling good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: They introduce one new character that you see here from there. She is just as ridiculous as the other members and never feels forced. She might be strange but that's the overall reason for her to be there. All other characters do develop to a good amount. You feel that they're more refined, adding a few details here and there. You see Ko (Ric) start to accept the situation she's in and a few side characters really do get their spotlight which is fairly nice. It's not perfect though. Sometimes it feels like the show focuses literally on their main shtick. While they're never irritating it can get boring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nSound: That opening was outstanding. It was great in a different way from the first season. You'll see a lot of same but different and it really shows with the music.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It feels like the production value was boosted for the second season. It's not something you'll keep in your mind forever but the characters themselves are done in such a unique way that it's hard to forget their faces.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Argh the story isn't bad but it feels like they tried to make a plot, made it interesting and then forgot about it. I think that's the problem, it wasn't that there was no story but there was a lot of buildup with no climax. It was good and all but the ending separated good from great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: All the elements separately stood out on their own. The only problem is that by the end of the show it left me unsatisfied with the ending, frustrated even. Great characters that were great on their own but combined with the story left me wanting more than I got. Sound that worked real well on its own but every once in a while felt out of place. Art that was beautiful but sometimes didn't match my feeling about the story. It was good and I might want to watch it again but it's not AMAZING.",

            "content": "They are so back with more of their weird antics and hilarious activities.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nIt is even better while the previous season is more of an introduction; this season brings not only more laughter but also more of the romance between the two lead characters. Well, not that I love less the previous one. It is really amazing how the comedy and parody is well balance with the serious scenarios of the story. I just love it whenever you see a serious scene then suddenly you realize that you are already laughing your hearts out. I am genuinely amazed with seriesthat can manage to balance the entire fundamental of their genres with their storyline. It is just genius. Plus, compared to the previous season, the romance between Ric and Nino are more explored. Though, there are moments when I forget that this is also a romantic comedy but the thing is, they still manage to show that the love story part is still definitely a concrete plot in the storyline. It is not just a small part on the main plot of the story. In fact, most of the time it influences the flow of the story. Lastly, again with the amazing originality of the series. It is absolutely commendable considering that originality is one of the most important qualities that a series should have if you really want to compete with today\u2019s huge line-up of amazing animes and manga. This is what I always say in every review that uniqueness and originality is definitely one of the must have of any type of story. It gives you a huge edge from others and can make you keep up with the competition. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nWith new season comes new characters. As if the whole hilarious gang wasn\u2019t enough, the laughter is doubled with the arrival of new characters. Setting aside the new characters, we get to love more of the previous characters when their lives outside the bridge reveals. Now, we finally understand that they are not just weird people who just pop out under the bridge but they actually have a genuine background. Well, except of course with Nino and the Mayor whose identities are so much as a mystery. Though both of their identities are slightly hinted, it is still an absolute mystery.  Nino;  if she is a genuine Venusian or not and how is it related to her dreams? Well, despite her weirdness and everything else, she\u2019s genuinely in love with Ric and would show it in her own way of affection. On the other hand, Mayor is hinted to be a big shot and has a strong connection with the Japan government. The questions are;  why is he protecting Nino, how is he related to Nino, what is his real identity, and why the hell is he a KAPPA? Well, because of that it still gives you an exciting feeling and you just can\u2019t help but anticipate what will happen next. Ric, on the other hand, becomes weird as well like everyone else, while in the previous season he preferred to reason out with the weirdness of the whole gang but in this sequel, he just goes along with their antics and sometimes does his own weird antics. He definitely looks happier. Though, sometimes I really wonder if he is really a big shot outside the bridge. I guess, almost all of them if not a big shot but definitely a strong and reliable individual outside the bridge. Plus, Ric and Nino seem to genuinely care and love each other. Even though it started as just a laughable suggestion, their love of each other is really pure and true. And let\u2019s not forget that all of them are hilarious which is very rare nowadays. I mean, it is rare that in a single series all the characters can really be hilarious compare to others where usually the lead or few of the supporting characters are the only source of comic relief. In this series, all as in all of them are hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SEIYUS\\n\r\nWith one of the best animation of today, the series\u2019 animation is amazingly done. It is fun, cool and beautiful. And of course, added with the gathering of the most magnificent seiyus of today, the series is almost perfect.  Almost all my favorite seiyus are here like Maaya Sakamoto, Keiji Fujiwara, Takehito Koyasu, Miyuki Sawashiro, and Yuichi Nakamura. Of course, two of the most talented seiyus when it comes to comedy are also here, Tomokazu Sugita and Yu Kobayashi. Their talents when it comes with playing their voices in comedy is just the most hilarious among all the seiyus of today. And let\u2019s not forget the seiyu of Ric, Hiroshi Kamiya who is known for his talent with his deliverance of amazing lines of every characters that he portrays. He is an expert with serious lines and cool monologues. Though, I know he already portrayed a slightly comedic character before, in this series he just leveled up his talent with his hilarious deliverance of comedic lines. It just shows his versatility with his career. Now why seiyus are very important? Their talents are the key on making the character effective and their lines are memorable considering that personalities of the characters and dialogues are a very important criteria in making an amazing story.\\n\\n\r\nWith that all said, this series is definitely one of the few which will leave a strong impression to any viewers and will still be remembered after so many years. This is also one of the few that I personally want to see the continuation in the anime form. I just love it. \\n",

            "content": "I have watched the first season, so you can say, I'll be writing this review for the whole series' sake.\r\nEverybody agrees that Arakawa Under the Bridge is crazy. Not crazy bad though, but crazily funny. I mean, a show starring a star-headed singer, a talking kappa(a mayor at that), an ex-soldier nun, and an outrageously-gorgeous, weird Venusian(Nino claims she's one), a sadistic man-hater, and little red riding hood should not be considered normal, right? All this craziness were bonded perfectly in Arakawa. I first thought that Arakawa would totally waste my time, but then I watched a couple of episodes from the previous season. Andguess what? It's pretty hillarious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTired of shounen series? Tired of unnecessary bouncing breasts? Tired of difficult deep plots? Tired of lazy-ass producers who produce shitty shites? Tired of your life? Watch Arakawa Under the Bridge!\\n\r\nA show that doesn't have any complex plot. Yes, that's how Arakawa is. Just sit back and enjoy the show. It's a different kind of RomCom, a lot different from the ones airing these days, Arakawa doesn't offer any fan-service at all. It's like a sit-com to be exact... Or not? But nevertheless, it's honestly hilarious. Seinen's part of its genre, and I assume you know what that means(Seinen = Shounen for 18 and up)? Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't contain gory stuff(only Sister's never ending blood gushing out). Nope. Definitely not. I'd say its a Seinen because of the tiny bit adult comedy it has; it's really an itsy bit part of what the show is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8\\n\r\nIchinomiya Ko, our MC, is the scion of Ichinomiya Company, one of the world's foremost firms(of course, its only in the show... Silly). Fed with a silver spoon in his mouth; he never faced any problem when he was a kid. He now lives under the bridge that crosses Arakawa. Why? Because of Nino, a girl who says she's an Venusian. Ko fell for Nino and decided to live under the bridge, too(they're a couple now, though) That... Is really just one of the many happenings in Arakawa, but most of the time, an episode contains a lot of humor unrelated to that. A show that's so laid back it doesn't have any complicated plot happening into it. That's one of the many beauties of Arakawa Under the Bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nDigital Shaft rarely makes ugly art. But they do often make eye zoom-ins and head tilts. Arakawa's art is great; it was fully detailed in every aspect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nCrazy characters, out-of-this-world looks? Heck, that describes Arakawa's whole cast. The only one who has common sense is Ko. And because of that, Arakawa's cast exceeds other characters. They're crazy, so they have their own personality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 9\\n\r\nI love Suneohair. Period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7\\n\r\nYou might not get the jokes in the show. Why? Because some of them are Japanese puns, which is very hard to translate in English. But it doesn't mean you're gonna get bored watching the show. The lack of common sense from the characters would surely make you laugh. I really enjoyed Arakawa Under the Bridge X Bridge. The only drawback for me is that they cut short Nino's past. God, that made me pissed. The lack of privy time for Ko and Nino dissapointed me, too. But nevertheless, Arakawa is one funny interesting show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge X Bridge. A nonchalant show that doesn't rely on providing fanservice to gain viewers. It's really relaxing watching this kinds of series. Shows like Arakawa are a rarity these days. The blending of romance, comedy, a bit of idiotness, and mysteriousness(in case of Nino's identity). And for that reason, I give Arakawa a well-deserving 8. It does not have definite plot but it won't dissapoint anyone. It's well crafted; Digital Shaft made another great show. I do hope a season 3 comes out.\\n",

This second season promises to resolve or at least significantly advance the Nino subplot with the first & third episodes but then largely drops it. In between the usual gags, it introduces two new characters, and concludes without much more development.\r\nThe OP/ED are visually clever and interesting, and a number of scenes capture the classic _Arakawa_ humor: episode 09's wabi-sabi tea ceremony was hilarious, the shonen & Kinnikuman parodies in ep 10 were amusing, and ep12/13 answer the burning question of which of the characters wouldwin in a fight while demonstrating how to use societal ills to herd sheep. On the down side, many plot threads from season 1 are almost completely dropped (Chief's machinations in the background to protect the riverbank, the protagonist's father's disapproval, the debt allergy) and others progress much less than justified by the time spent on them (going to Venus) which feels like a bit of a betrayal, and the 2 new characters are deeply unfunny wastes of time (Amazoness and Captain mean that ep2/5/8/11, a third of the season!, are a chore to sit through). On net, I wound up not enjoying it nearly as much as I had season 1 where all the gags and characters were fresh and which avoided the missteps of season 2.",

            "content": "\"Random\", \"Over-the-top\", \"Weird\", and \"Hilarious\" might be some of the descriptions one might come across when reading about the Arakawa Under the Bridge franchise. With the plot's groundwork having been laid out in the first season, Bridge x Bridge showcases more of its eclectic cast's daily life and misadventures with a little character development every now and then, if one pays attention. As Bridge x Bridge is the second season of the original Arakawa Under the Bridge, viewing of the first season is required for full enjoyment. That said, Bridge x Bridge will satisfy most fans of the first season with its ever quirky charactersand humorous hijinks. \\n\\n\r\nStory (no spoilers):\\n\r\nAforementioned, the story starts off where the first season left off in the banks of the river Arakawa. Bridge x Bridge seeks to develop character relationships whereas the previous season developed the background for the show. One strong point about Bridge x Bridge is that it is very consistent in its quality of humor and episodic storytelling. The bulk of the comedy revolves around the cast's interactions in their daily lives, their penchant for randomness, and Kou's reaction to everything around him from a normal man's point of view (in other words, it's the same as the previous season's type of humor). This approach might be hit-or-miss, depending on how much the viewers will take a liking to the characters, but it will still end up bringing some laugh out loud moments at least every now and then for most. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nOh, where to begin. The personalities of Arakawa are what makes the show truly enjoyable. Each character has a unique and silly personality to his/herself that tends to create hilarious moments when combined. Bridge x Bridge gives more screentime to characters neglected previous season, including Billy, an ex-gangster, Jacqueline, his love interest, and Amazoness, a bulky woman with a personality of a schoolgirl. The show's main focus is comedy, so unfortunately, character development is pushed to the side apart from a few moments of the characters' pasts being revealed (especially Nino's). This is rather disappointing since the show offers so many mysteries and questions about its characters, yet answering very few. In this respect, Bridge x Bridge unfortunately brings less satisfaction in the previous season which delved in detail about Kou's history. Nonetheless, the characters are still a joy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: \\n\r\nThe animation in Bridge x Bridge is a typical SHAFT affair: usually passable with some moments of brilliance and occasionally being surreal. Notably absent from this season is the stock \"Kou blink\" animation used so often in last season, giving more time for actually animated scenes - always a nice thing. As for the art, Bridge x Bridge features a colorful style that will probably have no problem hooking your attention when you see it. Character designs are also quite nice on the eyes; every single character is visually distinctive from one another and their odd designs match their personality perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nThe OP \"COSMOS vs. ALIENS\" is a strange (but very charming) little song that might take some getting used to, while the ED \"Akai Coat\" is a nice indie rock tune. Both do a fine job of setting the mood for the show. Voice acting in this series is very well done: Kamiya Hiroshi's stern straight man voice for Kou Ichinomiya, Maaya Sakamoto's soft voice for Nino, Miyuki Sawashiro's sweet but haunting performance for Maria all gets top scores. As for the soundtrack, the music does well to match the mood of moment, which is usually quirky and sometimes over-the-top, but also with relaxing atmospheres that pop up every now and then (and the cold opening for every episode). Overall, SHAFT did a very nice job in the sound department. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nDespite the main plot progressing very slowly, a unique story with unique characters and even stranger presentation (as per SHAFT) are several reasons why Bridge x Bridge kept me excited every week to see a new episode. If you've enjoyed the first season, the second season is highly recommended as well. I'd recommend the entire Arakawa Under the Bridge series to anyone looking for an original, funny anime that isn't afraid to stand apart from the conventions of typical anime characters. \\n\\n\r\n(Helpful or Not Helpful, feedback on this review is very welcome)",

Slight character development spoilers ahead.\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge focuses more of the interactions between Riku/Kou and Nino than the underlying social commentary that the first season reflected in a community of people whom in most cases would be shunned by others. But who despite their superficial eccentricities are still more or less normal human beings inside, with all the flaws and strengths that encompasses, who find a home together in the middle of, yet separated from the judgmental eyes of society.\r\nIn some ways Riku/Kou is the most bizzare among them. But despite his constant attempts to separate himself from thegroup and establish himself as the only normal human being among them he eventually reaches a sort of acceptance of the situation, not out of necessity, but from honestly looking past the superficial attributes to the persons underneath the facade and finds people who aren't controlled by his father's egocentric, conceited outlook on life, and through that learns to see the fundamental flaw in his own reasoning.\\n\r\nThat in his constant attempts to imitate his father he has completely accepted his father's twisted world view and morality as his own, without ever questioning whether or not it is right. Neither objectively nor subjectively.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge, and prequiel, take the viewer on a journey, where we get to follow a deeply incomplete and arrogant man through a world that constantly challenges all of his convictions, most fundamental principles and ideology, in a battle against his own prejudice and maladaption.\\n\r\nA journey in which he learns the meaning of true happiness; trust; family; and love.",

            "content": "Wow, Im the first to review! Well, it's my first real review as well, still hope this will be to some help. NB this is MY review thus I'm expressing my OPINION. I just want people to understand why I really like this series.\r\n  This really is a continuation of the first series - Thus:\r\n   Story: 8\r\n  It takes a certain kind of humor to appreciate the storyline and humor really is the key to this series. It's wonderfully hilarious with free spirits that are not necessarily stupid, like most cartoon characters, but only different in their way of thinking. Evenif it's slice of life, you really feel like you're moving forward as you get to know the many different characters better and since it's made up of chapters which keeps it from getting stuck at some unimportant detail. The best things is that it doesn't feel like \"I've seen this 2000 times before\", their actions still surprise you and.. I got to tell you - it is SO refreshing to get out of school with characters beyond 16! Oh, and no ecchi ecchi harem in sight.\\n\\n\r\n  Art: 8\\n\r\n The characters are drawn rather simplistic. Instead, the artist has really spend a lot of time on the surrounding area. There are a lot of detailed shots of the river, the grass, the sky... It's evidently a part of the story - after all, there's a reason why so many people are spending their days at this specific riverbank and it feels more idyllic. Therefore this art style is good for this anime.\\n\\n\r\n  Sound: 7\\n\r\n The soundtrack for goes really well with the series. The op and ending are, in my opinion, better than the last one and it sets you in the right mood! The sound in the anime would however would not be anything I'd listen as it is. \\n\\n\r\n  Character: 8\\n\r\n The character that develop the most is Recruit. This is best seen during the first series. Yet here there has already been a sign of him growing as a man in love as well which is a huge step forward and thus it already deserves an 8. As the other characters actions still surprise me they never get boring and doesn't need as much development as Recruit. Slice of life doesn't really require as much of this either. \\n\\n\r\n  Enjoyment: 9\\n\r\n As this series always get my spirits up I have to call it great. It's outrageous in a good way. I really enjoy myself while watching this and can't wait for the next episode. In all honesty, it took me some episodes to get used enough to the humor to just lay back and enjoy the ride.\\n\\n\r\n  Overall: 8\\n\r\n This is very good if you're inexplicably down, bored or high spirited. Its silly but not idiotic and it shows those small problems that can be huge to one person. No world(s) crisis, no school, no work just entertainment.",

            "content": "Well, I must say I'm a fan of the first season of Arakawa Under The Bridge. It had everything a good (not great) show must have: good characters, nice jokes, things you don't get to see in all anime... well I loved it, although, after all, I only gave it a 7. And why was that? Because Arakawa loses itself in the way. And for my own sadness, it's happening again with Arakawa in \"Bridge X Bridge\".\r\nI have nothing to say about the story, nor the art. The concept is still the same, brilliant idea, rich guy literally lives under a bridge. The art isbasicly equal to the one in season 1: simplistic yet enjoyable character design and backgrounds/cenarios. \\n\\n\r\nIn matter of sound, I only have good things to say about it. I'm obviously refering to the crazy what-the-hell-is-this-? opening song, \"Cosmos Vs. Alien\", that really made me laugh. It's just so wacky... But I love it.\\n\\n\r\n'Till now we should have all conditions for a seven or an eight, right? ... Right?\\n\\n\r\nWell, the characters seem to have lost their charm (except for Billy, that guy really rocks). Ric acts more stupid than in season 1, but now his stupidity is, instead of funny, just really really sad. Hiroshi Kamiya's work in here is absolutely dispicable. I loved his performance in Durarara!!, as Izaya, but Ric's expressions are just silly, and he screems like an idiot. Maybe  I could have enjoy it if I wasn't a big fan of Bakemonogatari , but I just can't. Sorry.\\n\\n\r\nHoshi has been singin' \"Himo\" so much that is no longer cool, but annoying. That's a perfect example of formula repetition, which often can destroy a good show.  \\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that's been stabbing Arakawa 2 like a madman is the pacing. My god, it just seems the episodes never end. When I think the episode's at 20 minutes already, it only goes at 9! And why? Because the rhythm is slow as hell!\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2 made no sense. That Amazone gag was just laughble, in every single way. \\n\\n\r\nSo, I'm terribly disappointed with Arakawa Under The Bridge X Bridge. I score it as a 3, because it's not only bad stuff, as you may have noticed if you read the entire review. Yet, it's an insult to the manga and the first season of the show. And, as in Seikimatsu Occult Gakuin, i'm pretty sure the last episodes won't improve that much.",

            "content": "Unoriginal, Safe and linear compared to the first season are all true when talking about Arakawa Under The Bridge x Bridge. But WAIT! Before you instantly disregard this sequel you MUST know that in many ways Arakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge is better that it's predecessor and if you loved the first season, than I guarantee you that you will definitely love this season. You may be treading some familiar ground, but hey, who said that more of the same is a bad thing? Welcome back to the crazy, yet humbling place that is, Arakawa Under the Bridge! \r\nStory:\r\n(+) For starters, this is indeeda straight up sequel to the original, Arakawa Under the Bridge. This means that if you haven't seen that yet than I urge you to go back and watch that first before coming here; since there will be plenty of references to it's original that might strike you as odd rather than hilarious. For those who of you that have seen it, the story's no different: a story about the daily lives of all the people under the Arakawa Bridge doing more wacky endeavors, with a few new added characters to rattle up the bunch! What makes the story different however is that this series wanted to focus more on the relationship aspect between Ko and Nino since you didn't get a lot of that in the last season. Because of this, there is a more centered and focused story line between the two. This can make for some nice emotional scenes, and great Character development centered around our main lovers. It was very heartwarming when you can see the two characters grow because of each other. Furthermore, we definitely can't forget about the comedy. As a matter of fact, I would go as far as to say that there was even MORE over the top comedy present here than the first season.  Since Ko is now use to life under the bridge, he gets involved  in even more crazy events which can honestly make some of the most hilarious scenes throughout the show. Another nice feature was to include comedic references to pop culture. Even though some might be unfamiliar, the way they handled it was comedy gold. GO KAMEARI!\\n\\n\r\n(-) As previously mentioned, this show can outright be unoriginal, safe, and linear and sadly most of these faults come from the story. as I stated, the creators of this show decided to go for a more linear over-arcing plot featuring our main characters. This turns the show from a show about acceptance into a more romance based series. Although it may be a nice addition to some, it loses the charm that it's predecessor had. I found the series had less hidden morals that people can really understand and relate with, and instead I found a show ONLY about the two characters. Another thing I should note was that this show remained constant throughout the series. There wasn't any situations where I truly felt any emotion for the characters, since all sub plot lines were able to conclude by the end of the episode. Therefore, I enjoyed the episodes as a whole, but wasn't urging to watch the next one like it's first season was so masterfully able to do. Another thing I should mention is the ending itself. Even though the ending finished on a nice and subtle note, by the end of the series there are still so many questions left unanswered and the big thing that has been leading up to the conclusion just never got fulfilled, making the closing as a whole anticlimactic. For a series that's not known for it's story, it's really saddening when they do try to include a solid plot but then don't faithfully end it the way it's led to be.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\n(+) Once again Shaft was able to re-create the whole surrounding of silliness perfectly through its art. Everything you loved about the art is still there, right down to the colorful opening theme to the live action segments at the end (Now even more present!).\\n\\n\r\n(-) Since everything is the same in terms of art, you don't see any upgrade or further development because of it. The character designs still look the same and the Arakawa Bridge is definitely the same one you saw the last time. No extra detail was added and if you're not a fan of the silly art style then this is no different.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\n(+) Continuing from the first season, all the sound effects are carried on here, and are ever so present now. Another worthy thing I should note is the opening, \"COSOMOS VS ALIEN\" and the ending, \"Akai Coat.\" Keeping it in the same tradition of the first season, the opening theme acts to show the whole over the top vibe that Bridge X Bridge has, while the ending theme gives the slow and emotionally serious tone that this sequel may drop on you time to time (Go Suneohair!). Oh and once again, Losers Wail makes it comedic return and might even make you chant it time to time! \"Himo Hi-\"\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\n(+) The quirky comedic characters of the Arakawa Bridge are back and better than ever! Everything you loved (or hated) about the character are present and are once again reprising they're loved (or hated) roles. But now they're even more over the top! Since they are doing more extreme miscellaneous things, I would say that all the characters are even more energetic and crazy than they once were! Whether it's trying to bunk together for a week or all going on a diet to lose wait, the interactions between each character are still ever so comedically funny and can make up for some serious laughs. Second, the series even added more characters to this larger than life cast. An Amazoness and battle star defender (who's not really a space defender) are introduced and even though they have the least screen time, they still left an impression on me and I was laughing every minute they were on screen.\\n\\n\r\n(-) I think this is the one time I would probably say that Character Development would be a negative. Since as mentioned before, the series went for a more solid story line focusing on Nino and Ko. But that's really most of all we get. Sure they get TONS of character development, but in return most of the side characters lose screen time. You might get a little development from a few side characters, but most of the time, they're hardly the center of attention. In some ways this is a bit of a wasted opportunity since all these characters are interesting in their own rights and each deserved the attention. There was even more hints to future character development that ended up never getting it, particularly to The Amazoness. Stella is probably one of my favorite characters in the show, and her personality hardly ever shines off throughout the show!\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Enjoyment:\\n\r\nWhen I look back on Arakawa Under the Bridge, I remember the first season for it's charm and the second for its comedy. Dropping such relatable themes and forgetting some of the side characters really puts this season a step back from it's original. It's also more of the same so if you seen the first season and you absolutely hated it, than this is not the right place to change your mind. Still, the enjoyment I had for this season is IMMENSE and was easily worth the time I spent with such amusing personalities. So, with one recommendation and one question I ask you, Will you come to Venus?  \\n\r\n8/10",

His family\u2019s motto is never be in debt to anyone. And as Nino saves his life, he becomes indebt to her. Trying to make up for it he asks her to wish for anything. And she wishes for love. Thus begins his crazy life under the bridge, amongst group of crazy people, where he may be the craziest. \r\nIf I had to sum up Arakawa it would be\u201cpoor man\u2019s Gintama with romance\u201d. Lots of different gag scenes, lots of references, lots of character gimmicks. Some of them good, some of them great, some annoying. This anime WILL make you laugh, but it can become boring at times. \\n\\n\r\nAkiyuki Shinbou\u2019s directing for me personally is hit or miss. Some of his techniques and styles are cool and interesting and some feel forced (earlier in the series, the eye shot got REALLY overused).  \\n\\n\r\nI would probably end up giving the series 6/10 if not for its production; which is great. We have A+ voice actors (with my beloved Maaya Sakamoto as Nino) who all do excellent job. Openings and Endings are very enjoyable and mash really well with the tone of the series (first opening is by far my favourite in terms of both visual structure and music itself).  When it comes to animation, Shinbou as always uses his specific style and mixes in lots of different stuff to achieve pretty impressive looking show (backgrounds are beautiful).\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very enjoyable for what it is when it works, and watchable when it doesn\u2019t. \\n",

So, I hope everybody can understand this review. *\r\nNowadays, there are a lot of studios that are trying to recreate auspicious series from the past. However, they fail horribly in the process. One example of this, could be the last Anime directed by Shinichiro Watanabe (whom is the man responsible from animes like Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo and Ergo Proxy, just to mention a few). Nevertheless, sometimes they come up with deep and involving stories. In fact, this is the case for Arakawa Under The Bridge.\r\nFirstly, let me introduce \"Shinbo Akiyuki\". This man is and educator in Shaft Studioand the reason why the Monogatari series is so popular. Besides, He developed a charismatic way to project actions and feelings through the screen. This style is so unique that it does not suit in every anime.  For instance, this type of direction is is close enough to what was introduced in the narrative changes from XX century. The reason why I say this is because there is a huge change between season 1 and 2. Notably, this second season is (as another reviewer said) \"Safe and linear\" compared to the previous one. The story came in a very compact way, which was nonexistent previously. Indeed, the majority of the animes directed by the man have this particular style of direction. Moreover, bear in mind that animes like Bakemonogatari, have nothing to do with Arakawa Under The Bridge. Although they have the same director they are oriented in a different way. As the saying goes, they are opposite sides of the same coin. This is why I think it deserves a 8/10 in story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, despite this change in the direction suits it genially, this adaptation fails in the same thing of the previous season. A point often overlooked in this series is the downgrade between scene and scene. As a result of this, sometimes the face of the characters looks disfigured. Under this circumstances, I have to give this anime a 7/10 in visuals. Indeed, it is a shame, because there are occasions where the director brings out what he did in Bakemonogatari and gives us some incredible shots. If you ask me, my personal favourite is when Nino's hair raises up and make strange forms, such as Araragi's.\\n\\n\r\nAs well as the art, the soundtrack and OST does not change that much between the two seasons. It stays with quiet guitar or piano solos and low rhythm blues. These pieces suits perfectly with the narrative of the cartoon. The opening and ending is decent enough. That's why I think it deserves a 8/10 in this area\\n\\n\r\nUnlike the two previous points, there`s a big change as regards in Character development. Furthermore, I felt this season they gave us a more detailed background story for every side character. The example I could tell you off the top of my head is what they made with Shiro and Hoshi. However, they not only developed side characters. But, they also expand the romance between Nino and Ric. As well as the story behind Nino`s past. The only thing I wish is that they would established a more adult relationship. Nevertheless, because of the great job done, I gave them a 9/10 in Characters.\\n\\n\r\nFrom my point of view, this is an incredible series, which every person who liked the work from Shinbo Akiyuki should watch. My final score for this series is a 9/10.\\n",

I was not expecting such enjoyment from watching this show, typically when they make a second seasons it would be boring and off-sense but this was extremely amazing show. \r\nThe story is no story because its the most amazing story in this anime that there is nothing to think about, just relax be comfy and unwind while watching Arakawa that will wipe away your daily-life troubles. (It worked for me -sometime-). Anyhow, this is the best comedy I have ever seen so far that makes me LMAOall the time. \\n\r\nThe characters are unique and weirdish which I really liked in this anime. Every episode was funnier than the previous one and there are some things I did not expect to exist in this anime but it was super fun. \\n\\n\r\nMy general recommendation if you like some laughter, to get over your depression daily-hard-life go and watch Arakawa because it's totally worth watching. \\n\\n\r\nCheers!",

            "content": "So, Arakawa Under the Bridge....X BRIDGE!\r\nI'll be honest here, though I started watching this a long time after it aired, I'm surprised it got a second season. Shows like this, despite being rather entertaining usually don't get more than one season yet here we are. I was rather fond of the first season and I started this one soon after.\r\nStory:\r\nListen, I know this supposed to be a gag series but please, please, do not dangle what could be very interesting plot threads in front of my face and NOT resolve it! I had so many questions left over from the first season. Why were thesepeople under the bridge? Who are they really? What is up with\\n\r\nmayor? Are the characters' \"quirks and delusions\" real or are they really just crazy?\\n\\n\r\nNone of these questions got answered in this season and they never will, unless I read the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThat's right, the way the show ends essentially tells the viewer to read the manga for answers.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, in comments of where I was watching the show, a person, thankfully for once, spoiled the ending to the manga and OH MY GOD. SUCH AN INTERESTING PLOT, THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN A SATISFACTORY ENDING TO THIS SERIES WAS REPLACED BY EPISODIC COMEDY IN THE FINAL SEASON.\\n\\n\r\nI don't hate comedy, and this show is genuinely funny, but...I wanted by questions to answered.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the episodic plots were good I guess. They were funny.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe art's okay. It's not 100% perfect all the time but then again, I don't think that would really fit for a series like this. I liked the bright and vibrant colors and the character designs were memorable. I liked how at the end of each episode, there'd be nice fan art. There were also moments when the art became really pretty at just the right moment.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAs for the music, I wasn't that into the opening song but I have to admit that it's very fitting for the series. I liked the ending song better, Background music was okay but the music that plays whenever Nino and Ric/Ko have a sweet moment together is what I like best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe characters all serve their purpose to get the most laughs out of the audience. While I can't say there was an incredible amount of character development or that everyone's characterization is deeper than the sea, all of them are pretty likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThe comedy is 10/10 no problem. This show got a lot of laughs out of me, however, as I said earlier in the Story section, they didn't use what would have been a very interesting plot. This lessened my enjoyment throughout the final four episodes as I realized that I wouldn't get the resolution I desired.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Watch it for the laughs, but if you're hoping for plot and character development, either look somewhere else or read the manga\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Why is the dad so understand about his son living undera bridge now? why doesnt he care as much as he did in the first season, and so on and so forth. honestly i could care less about the plot, if your familar with the frist season it continues on where it left off, and showing Rics and Ninos love flourish, it was beautiful but just one to many plot holes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10 \\n\r\nIts HQ, Drawn very clean, And its quite well for the series, and it varies depending on the mood, I enjoyed the constant change to fit what was happening in the situation.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nThis is the part of the show that will draw you in. The Vast variety of characters, A crazed perfectionist, A silent beauty who belives shes from mars, a miltary man dressed as a nun, a dicator woman evil to the core, love sick star, a amazoness and many more characters. These characters were so well thought out, you can feel every characters emotions, and personalities. They are the most unique cast of characters youll ever meet, and i you dont like the characters than just turn of your tv, computer, ipad what ever your watching and find something else to watch. This anime is Extremely character based.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:8\\n\r\nif you want an easy short, funny,and simple anime this is the one for you.  but i you want something a bit more plot driven find something else. this show is or people who want to be entertained, and slightly moved emotianally but not think too hard.

            "content": "!!This review includes the first season!!\r\nAnd yet, another anime with no meaningful story line. More like it doesn\u2032t really have any. The first time I stumbled upon Arakawa Under the Bridge, I thought it was really great - guess I got my hopes up and got nothing. Nevertheless, I believe it gave me some good laughs, from what I can remember. I guess not all 'slice of life and comedy mix' anime are always that great, for me. Unlike Working!! which became one of my favorite slice-of-life and comedy mix anime. I wonder why this anime isn\u2032t tagged as Slice of Life.\r\nYes, story. Where isthe story? If I were you, I wouldn\u2032t search for it - because you will never ever find it; Arakawa Under the Bridge is just another slice-of-life with comedy anime that is lacking enough story and plot, but I guess you won\u2032t be needing any of those because you will have a good laugh out of it. But I can\u2032t really guarantee it, since the jokes and gags are merely boring, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge (x Bridge) consists of an awkwardly yet funny and crazy (at the same time) set of characters, which is most probably what you would consider as one of the 'strong' points in the anime, but without a plot, it wouldn\u2032t be any better.Here we have an i-don\u2032t-know-if-they\u2032re-really-a-couple couple Kou and Nino, yes, they are very awkward. I\u2032m not really sure if they really like each other, but let\u2032s just think they do. Let\u2032s leave it at that; We also have a Kappa Mayor, a Star-masked guitarist-singer, Hoshi; a Falcon, with a human body, a guy who only walks over white lines, a sadist farmer-lady, named Maria, and a transvestite guy nun who is referred to as Sister.\\n\\n\r\nWe still have heaps more crazy characters that are involved, but I guess mentioning them would be more crazier. Arakawa\u2032s set of characters is really great, they are very unique, and each of them have their own funny side to them with a pinch of mixed-personalities.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like about Arakawa is its uniqueness on the characters, yes, they are in the recent time and era, but what\u2032s up with the falcon and kappa mayor and star head? From which planet are they from? Earth, my friend, they\u2032re from Earth. One thing I also like about Arakawa is the genre, Seinen, with Comedy and Romance. Whenever there\u2032s comedy, I always hope for Romance - but not everything comes the way I want them to. But this one has it, and I very much like the mix of genres so; In this case, you will most probably like the art together with the mix of the catchy intros and outros that fit the image and theme of the show perfectly well.\\n\\n\r\nBut the thing that I didn\u2032t like in Arakawa is its lack of Romance, it didn\u2032t even fully bloom. They shold\u2032ve deepen the love between the awkward yet funny couple more, so that we will truly agree on the fact that they truly love each other. But I guess it\u2032s impossible to happen based on Nino\u2032s personality and slowness when it comes to love. And I\u2032m guessing that the lack of romance is for the best, because Romance shall never conquer comedy Arakawa, it\u2032ll lose its taste.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching Arakawa altogether, but not as much as how I enjoyed Working!! which is somehow closely the same as Arakawa in terms of their mix of genres, but both are different in a lot of aspects - one is the theme. Despite the lack of deep story, you\u2032ll get smiles in exchange. From this point on, watching shows with no plot but with comedy and slice of life is now my thing. So I guess you should try and loosen a bit, and free your self from overly-mainstream set of genres in a show from time to time. It isn\u2032t much a waste of time and effort, once you start to try it.",

            "content": "The sequel to the \"random\" \"awkward\" and \"hilarious\" series of Arakawa under the bridge. Not too much has changed since the last season, it's still the same randomness involved with a few tweaks here and there. Now for whatever reason you may have skipped the first season, fear not, as Arakawa does not have \"real true\" story to it, it does have some parts where you'll need to watch the first season in order to understand the second season it's not something that is a must-watch otherwise you'll be dumbfounded on what's happening. \r\nStory - 7/10\r\nThere isn't a \"real\" story to this anime, there isa bit of story hinted around each episode, however this anime is more specifically made for people who just enjoy watching whatever is set upon their screen without needing a lot of thinking to enjoy the series. If you just want to release some stress, laugh out loud in a way that you haven't for quite some time, then I highly recommend you watch this series, as I've found myself laughing out and \"legitimately rolling on the floor\" at how light-hearted this series really is. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite good, there are many times in the anime where the pictures used to describe how each character is feeling is well shown. Throughout the series, it looks as though the art stay's the same since first season and there isn't much change. Needless to say the \"title Under the bridge x bridge\" gives off the obviously hint of the story taking place mainly under a bridge.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound displayed for each scene matches almost perfectly, when a character is being serious, thinking, being totally random or displaying sadness, the background music suits the series quite well. The OP and ED themes are decent in my opinion, however they are well done since I've watched many series and never seen an OP or ED as unique as Arakawa's. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the best part of the entire series. Each character has their own unique personality with a few exceptions of them having the same traits. There is lots of times where the character will intentionally change their personality to fit the scene or match what another character is saying. \"Especially Nino, the main female protagonist.\" Now for the romance fans, unfortunately if you're looking for an extremely lovey-dovey type of anime, then I am sorry to say you'll be heavily disappointed. There IS definitely signs of romance everywhere, I think almost every single character in the anime has somebody else they love as \"Arakawa Under the Bridge\" is one giant family and although they are not blood-related each of them treats one another as if they were all really born from the same family. There is however, definitely a few kissing scenes but I'll keep it at that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a nice, easy laidback and a random anime, I recommend Arakawa to you. I often found myself laughing a lot during the series and smiling almost every episode. Each episode has a lot of randomness and I think this anime may actually relieve stress for people who are under stress from their daily lives, so I highly recommend this to people who are stressed from whatever is happening and would enjoy a good laugh now and then. If you've watched the first season then I recommend watching the second season for sure. This series definitely had flaws and mistakes in certain scenes/episodes but it's just such an original and light-hearted series I just couldn't criticize it. Overall I hope you'll consider watching this anime, and enjoy it as much as I did, and if you haven't watched the first season check it out first!\\n\\n",

            "content": "If you look at my entire score you see that my overall score really isn't an average of the others. I'll break down why I gave the score within this review and try to show you how an anime that has great elements might not have the best score.\r\nEnjoyment: If you came here for laughs you'll surely receive them. Season 2 continues the pure enjoyment you got out of the first season with jokes and nonsense littered throughout every episode. The writers rarely miss their mark and when they do the moment is brief and still gives you a small smile. Many people will enjoyArakawa Under the Bridge x Bridge, it's hard for you not to. If you let yourself sit down and enjoy the ridiculous ride you'll leave there feeling good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: They introduce one new character that you see here from there. She is just as ridiculous as the other members and never feels forced. She might be strange but that's the overall reason for her to be there. All other characters do develop to a good amount. You feel that they're more refined, adding a few details here and there. You see Ko (Ric) start to accept the situation she's in and a few side characters really do get their spotlight which is fairly nice. It's not perfect though. Sometimes it feels like the show focuses literally on their main shtick. While they're never irritating it can get boring after a while.\\n\\n\r\nSound: That opening was outstanding. It was great in a different way from the first season. You'll see a lot of same but different and it really shows with the music.\\n\\n\r\nArt: It feels like the production value was boosted for the second season. It's not something you'll keep in your mind forever but the characters themselves are done in such a unique way that it's hard to forget their faces.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Argh the story isn't bad but it feels like they tried to make a plot, made it interesting and then forgot about it. I think that's the problem, it wasn't that there was no story but there was a lot of buildup with no climax. It was good and all but the ending separated good from great.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: All the elements separately stood out on their own. The only problem is that by the end of the show it left me unsatisfied with the ending, frustrated even. Great characters that were great on their own but combined with the story left me wanting more than I got. Sound that worked real well on its own but every once in a while felt out of place. Art that was beautiful but sometimes didn't match my feeling about the story. It was good and I might want to watch it again but it's not AMAZING.",

            "content": "They are so back with more of their weird antics and hilarious activities.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nIt is even better while the previous season is more of an introduction; this season brings not only more laughter but also more of the romance between the two lead characters. Well, not that I love less the previous one. It is really amazing how the comedy and parody is well balance with the serious scenarios of the story. I just love it whenever you see a serious scene then suddenly you realize that you are already laughing your hearts out. I am genuinely amazed with seriesthat can manage to balance the entire fundamental of their genres with their storyline. It is just genius. Plus, compared to the previous season, the romance between Ric and Nino are more explored. Though, there are moments when I forget that this is also a romantic comedy but the thing is, they still manage to show that the love story part is still definitely a concrete plot in the storyline. It is not just a small part on the main plot of the story. In fact, most of the time it influences the flow of the story. Lastly, again with the amazing originality of the series. It is absolutely commendable considering that originality is one of the most important qualities that a series should have if you really want to compete with today\u2019s huge line-up of amazing animes and manga. This is what I always say in every review that uniqueness and originality is definitely one of the must have of any type of story. It gives you a huge edge from others and can make you keep up with the competition. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nWith new season comes new characters. As if the whole hilarious gang wasn\u2019t enough, the laughter is doubled with the arrival of new characters. Setting aside the new characters, we get to love more of the previous characters when their lives outside the bridge reveals. Now, we finally understand that they are not just weird people who just pop out under the bridge but they actually have a genuine background. Well, except of course with Nino and the Mayor whose identities are so much as a mystery. Though both of their identities are slightly hinted, it is still an absolute mystery.  Nino;  if she is a genuine Venusian or not and how is it related to her dreams? Well, despite her weirdness and everything else, she\u2019s genuinely in love with Ric and would show it in her own way of affection. On the other hand, Mayor is hinted to be a big shot and has a strong connection with the Japan government. The questions are;  why is he protecting Nino, how is he related to Nino, what is his real identity, and why the hell is he a KAPPA? Well, because of that it still gives you an exciting feeling and you just can\u2019t help but anticipate what will happen next. Ric, on the other hand, becomes weird as well like everyone else, while in the previous season he preferred to reason out with the weirdness of the whole gang but in this sequel, he just goes along with their antics and sometimes does his own weird antics. He definitely looks happier. Though, sometimes I really wonder if he is really a big shot outside the bridge. I guess, almost all of them if not a big shot but definitely a strong and reliable individual outside the bridge. Plus, Ric and Nino seem to genuinely care and love each other. Even though it started as just a laughable suggestion, their love of each other is really pure and true. And let\u2019s not forget that all of them are hilarious which is very rare nowadays. I mean, it is rare that in a single series all the characters can really be hilarious compare to others where usually the lead or few of the supporting characters are the only source of comic relief. In this series, all as in all of them are hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SEIYUS\\n\r\nWith one of the best animation of today, the series\u2019 animation is amazingly done. It is fun, cool and beautiful. And of course, added with the gathering of the most magnificent seiyus of today, the series is almost perfect.  Almost all my favorite seiyus are here like Maaya Sakamoto, Keiji Fujiwara, Takehito Koyasu, Miyuki Sawashiro, and Yuichi Nakamura. Of course, two of the most talented seiyus when it comes to comedy are also here, Tomokazu Sugita and Yu Kobayashi. Their talents when it comes with playing their voices in comedy is just the most hilarious among all the seiyus of today. And let\u2019s not forget the seiyu of Ric, Hiroshi Kamiya who is known for his talent with his deliverance of amazing lines of every characters that he portrays. He is an expert with serious lines and cool monologues. Though, I know he already portrayed a slightly comedic character before, in this series he just leveled up his talent with his hilarious deliverance of comedic lines. It just shows his versatility with his career. Now why seiyus are very important? Their talents are the key on making the character effective and their lines are memorable considering that personalities of the characters and dialogues are a very important criteria in making an amazing story.\\n\\n\r\nWith that all said, this series is definitely one of the few which will leave a strong impression to any viewers and will still be remembered after so many years. This is also one of the few that I personally want to see the continuation in the anime form. I just love it. \\n",

            "content": "I have watched the first season, so you can say, I'll be writing this review for the whole series' sake.\r\nEverybody agrees that Arakawa Under the Bridge is crazy. Not crazy bad though, but crazily funny. I mean, a show starring a star-headed singer, a talking kappa(a mayor at that), an ex-soldier nun, and an outrageously-gorgeous, weird Venusian(Nino claims she's one), a sadistic man-hater, and little red riding hood should not be considered normal, right? All this craziness were bonded perfectly in Arakawa. I first thought that Arakawa would totally waste my time, but then I watched a couple of episodes from the previous season. Andguess what? It's pretty hillarious.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTired of shounen series? Tired of unnecessary bouncing breasts? Tired of difficult deep plots? Tired of lazy-ass producers who produce shitty shites? Tired of your life? Watch Arakawa Under the Bridge!\\n\r\nA show that doesn't have any complex plot. Yes, that's how Arakawa is. Just sit back and enjoy the show. It's a different kind of RomCom, a lot different from the ones airing these days, Arakawa doesn't offer any fan-service at all. It's like a sit-com to be exact... Or not? But nevertheless, it's honestly hilarious. Seinen's part of its genre, and I assume you know what that means(Seinen = Shounen for 18 and up)? Don't get me wrong though, it doesn't contain gory stuff(only Sister's never ending blood gushing out). Nope. Definitely not. I'd say its a Seinen because of the tiny bit adult comedy it has; it's really an itsy bit part of what the show is.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : 8\\n\r\nIchinomiya Ko, our MC, is the scion of Ichinomiya Company, one of the world's foremost firms(of course, its only in the show... Silly). Fed with a silver spoon in his mouth; he never faced any problem when he was a kid. He now lives under the bridge that crosses Arakawa. Why? Because of Nino, a girl who says she's an Venusian. Ko fell for Nino and decided to live under the bridge, too(they're a couple now, though) That... Is really just one of the many happenings in Arakawa, but most of the time, an episode contains a lot of humor unrelated to that. A show that's so laid back it doesn't have any complicated plot happening into it. That's one of the many beauties of Arakawa Under the Bridge.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt : 8\\n\r\nDigital Shaft rarely makes ugly art. But they do often make eye zoom-ins and head tilts. Arakawa's art is great; it was fully detailed in every aspect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters : 8\\n\r\nCrazy characters, out-of-this-world looks? Heck, that describes Arakawa's whole cast. The only one who has common sense is Ko. And because of that, Arakawa's cast exceeds other characters. They're crazy, so they have their own personality.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic : 9\\n\r\nI love Suneohair. Period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : 7\\n\r\nYou might not get the jokes in the show. Why? Because some of them are Japanese puns, which is very hard to translate in English. But it doesn't mean you're gonna get bored watching the show. The lack of common sense from the characters would surely make you laugh. I really enjoyed Arakawa Under the Bridge X Bridge. The only drawback for me is that they cut short Nino's past. God, that made me pissed. The lack of privy time for Ko and Nino dissapointed me, too. But nevertheless, Arakawa is one funny interesting show.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8\\n\r\nArakawa Under the Bridge X Bridge. A nonchalant show that doesn't rely on providing fanservice to gain viewers. It's really relaxing watching this kinds of series. Shows like Arakawa are a rarity these days. The blending of romance, comedy, a bit of idiotness, and mysteriousness(in case of Nino's identity). And for that reason, I give Arakawa a well-deserving 8. It does not have definite plot but it won't dissapoint anyone. It's well crafted; Digital Shaft made another great show. I do hope a season 3 comes out.\\n",

            "content": "Straight sequel to _Arakawa_: continues the slice-of-life+tsukkomi/boke humor with a bit of plot in moving forward the protagonist's relationship. This second season promises to resolve or at least significantly advance the Nino subplot with the first & third episodes but then largely drops it. In between the usual gags, it introduces two new characters, and concludes without much more development.\r\nThe OP/ED are visually clever and interesting, and a number of scenes capture the classic _Arakawa_ humor: episode 09's wabi-sabi tea ceremony was hilarious, the shonen & Kinnikuman parodies in ep 10 were amusing, and ep12/13 answer the burning question of which of the characters wouldwin in a fight while demonstrating how to use societal ills to herd sheep. On the down side, many plot threads from season 1 are almost completely dropped (Chief's machinations in the background to protect the riverbank, the protagonist's father's disapproval, the debt allergy) and others progress much less than justified by the time spent on them (going to Venus) which feels like a bit of a betrayal, and the 2 new characters are deeply unfunny wastes of time (Amazoness and Captain mean that ep2/5/8/11, a third of the season!, are a chore to sit through). On net, I wound up not enjoying it nearly as much as I had season 1 where all the gags and characters were fresh and which avoided the missteps of season 2.",
