            "content": "No spoilers, except just one: this show is a spectacular train-wreck. If you like good science fiction, beware: this show begins extremely well but manages to destroy everything it built up and trample on its viewer's expectations in every way imaginable in its final episodes.\r\nAfter hearing that this was an anime that had heavy parallels to Arrival, and watching the first five episodes, the sci-fi buff in me was ecstatic. Here was a mature, well-written and absolutely gorgeous looking and sounding sci-fi anime that was headed in a direction that didn't seem hackneyed. It was thought-provoking and sparked a lot of discussion among the viewership.It was a potential masterpiece, I thought.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the series progressed, anime tropes that had no business appearing in a mature narrative such as this started popping up left and right for no good reason like some rash, creating a very jarring experience, and culminating in an ending that left many wondering how something with so much potential had ended up like this. It became incoherent to the point where one has to wonder whether the author's original vision was altered by others in the creative team to appeal to a larger crowd - one that wouldn't be watching this series in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10): The first half was a solid take on first contact, and the plot was genuinely creative and gripping at the same time. The last quarter was an unmitigated disaster for the most part. I don't think any other show with such a promising beginning has bombed so hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.5/10): Ah, this is something that the plot couldn't touch, and does deserve a favourable mention: the characters and several other parts are in 3DCG, and it pretty much sets an industry standard to how 3DCG should look. At no point did it look awkward or badly animated - on the contrary, some CG-heavy scenes ranged from beautiful to downright jaw-dropping.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8.5/10): Another thing the story could not completely spoil was the soundtrack, which was great. If there is one good thing that came from this show, it's that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10): Just like the plot, the main characters start out with great promise, but end up getting development that is frankly appalling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10): This reflects the effect of the ending more than anything - it leaves a very bad taste, especially because the first half was so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10. Tl;dr: You are probably better off pretending this doesn't exist. That, unfortunately, is the right answer.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 3\r\nSeikaisuru Kado begins with an intriguing premise: An alien arrives on Earth bearing gifts to advance humanity. To ease communication between the alien and the government, a gifted negotiator offers his services. Over time, the alien and negotiator learn about each other and become friends, overcoming their many differences. Meanwhile, the alien's gifts are so vastly powerful and beyond human understanding, that they threaten existing international resource and power relations. Soon, the bigger, more concerning question looms: Why?\r\nThat's a lot to work with, and the first 8-9 episodes actually do quite well in exploring these ideas. However, if you're after intelligent, well-considered, or satisfactoryanswers, you will most likely be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, \"disappointed\" is the word I'd use to describe my feelings about this series as a whole. Many of the issues raised in earlier episodes are resolved by way of shoehorned deux ex machinas, then explained away in empty words as to sound somehow profound or meaningful. While I understood the reasoning behind the solutions and how they had to be done, there was little-to-no lead-up and foreshadowing, making them seem overly-convenient, and leave no satisfaction in the resolution. In essence, poor execution: It felt as though the writers wrote themselves into a corner, had trouble resolving everything in the space of a few episodes, or handed the reins over to shallow mahou shoujo writers altogether.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAs a fully CG-based series, Toei did surprisingly well (see: earlier efforts in the sad CG transformation sequences in Sailor Moon Crystal). While it was apparent that impactful action sequences are beyond the reaches of the overly smooth and measured pace of their CG animation, the need itself was rendered obsolete due to the setting and cast of white-collar characters, and it even enhanced the otherworldly quality of the alien. By nature of CG animation, the quality could only be consistent throughout, but overall visual interest is lost through over-reliance on it where there could be better angles or compositions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI actually remember very little of the background tracks, but since nothing stood out to me as being particularly out-of-place either, I'll give this a pass. The opening and ending themes are actually quite lovely and help conjure a sense of wonder at the vast universe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nFirst of all, I was very impressed by the variety of character designs; the old and young, physically imposing and frail, big and small, etc... Even the main character doesn't look terribly outstanding, which lends weight to his professional nature. That said, most of the recurring cast are attractive young people, which kind of ruins that thought. I had trouble taking the main girl seriously, for many, many reasons. The alien's design was appropriately strange, and subtly differentiated him as a whole other species, even while taking a human form.\\n\\n\r\nDesign aside, I appreciated the developing relationship between the negotiator and the alien; in particular, the alien's growing attachment to his new friend manifested through subtle glances and not-so-subtle keeping of mementos. The relationship felt believable through their attempts to overcome cultural, linguistic, technological, etc... differences. The love interest, while soundly and reasonably developed as a character, on the other hand, felt lacking in chemistry by comparison, considering her importance in the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOn a separate note, for all that the negotiator was set up to be one of the best in his field, he does very... little... negotiating...?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nDespite my enjoyment of earlier episodes, the conclusion was poorly done. I spent episodes 9-12 mostly feeling confused and in disbelief over every nonsensical turn of events, disappointed at the waste of potential, and the waste of my time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nOnly the first 8 episodes and a few technical aspects manage to redeem this series. Good job effing it up, Toei.",

            "content": "A battle of words and ideas between the finest diplomats of Japan and a being from another dimension that comes from a cube.  \r\nPlease be aware that there are slight spoilers in character analysis and story analysis. \r\nOnce every anime season there is a chance you will encounter an anime that has a premise that is completely new and hasn\u2019t been seen before and one that completely engrosses you in both its setting and story and can keep you entertained until the end. In this case Seikaisuru Kado certainly fits that bill as its one anime that I have yet to get bored offand indeed continues to intrigue me episode by episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise behind Seikaisuru Kado is a relative straightforward one but one that is exceedingly rare within the anime industry. When you think of aliens or being from another dimension visiting the planet most people would imagine that ok this is going to be an action anime that focuses on the soldiers pushing the alien back right. Not so in this case. The main premise of this anime is diplomacy and how new technology that is gifted by an alien should be used and viewed and whether is it right for humanity as a race to use it. The combination of Diplomacy between the alien and the people of Japan and their relationship with the countries of the world with regards to the alien and his gifts I felt was interesting as was seeing the effects of the gifts on humanity as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s Theme of focusing on diplomacy as well as focusing on the larger picture of humanity as a race and not individual countries I felt was an interesting one and this was one anime that really hooked me in when I saw the trailer for it.\\n\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado\u2019s main story takes place within modem day japan and follows life of Shindou Kojiro a veteran diplomat of the Japanese Governments ministry of foreign affairs who whether by chance or not becomes the first person to meet an alien from another dimension and from there act as the intermediary between him and humanity. The overall story focuses on the negotiation between the alien being ZaShuNina and the government of Japan which is watched by countries around the world and ZaShuNina\u2019s attempt to help humanity by providing certain gifts. \\n\\n\r\nKojiro Shindou \\n\\n\r\nKojiro Shindou voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroaki Miura is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A veteran negotiator from the governments Ministry of foreign affairs Shindou is a calm, collected and composed person that thanks to his many years of service to the ministry has a detailed knowledge of not just how Japanese society works but also how governments and countries around the world work as well. As a result of both his experience and knowledge Shindou is well liked by his co-workers and well respected by them and by his superiors. Apart for being calm and composed which is no doubt his prominent trait Shindou is also a smart man and well versed in making quick decisions after finding out all the information that he needs for a given situation. Shindou seems to be a person that takes great pride in being a diplomat and seems to value the job that he has immensely which is best exemplified by the fact that he\u2019s always eager to see things to an end which indicates that he is also very dutiful as well.  As a result of this personality Shindou is someone that understands how negotiations work on an intimate level and as such he will always try to get the best deal for both sides of one. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that Shindou also has a softer personality that he shows when he\u2019s not in diplomat mode and is used when he\u2019s interacting with friends and family. Unlike when he\u2019s in diplomatic mode Shindou\u2019s other personality tends to be softer and more respectful but at the same time have less pressure behind his words. In this personality Shindou seems to be a bit of a joker and will often use humor to deal with people that are either too serious, nervous or uptight. This is best seen in his first meeting with Saraka.  As a main character and the main protagonist of the series Shindou develops and forms a relationship with many different characters in the series as part of his new role with his relationship with ZashuNina and Saraka being the most important. Both of these relationships I felt were pretty well done and were built on the most important element that any negotiation would need to have which in this case is trust. Shindou\u2019s relationship with ZaShuNina is arguably one of the cornerstones of this series and forms an important part of the overall plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\n In the beginning of the series Shindou as a result of being on the plane that ZashuNina absorbed was the first human that he encountered and as a result of both ZashuNina\u2019s curious and inquisitive nature and Shindou\u2019s sense of responsibility and adaptability they soon established a bond that is built on understanding and trust. As the series progresses it can be seen that Shindou\u2019s advice and observations are highly valued by ZashuNina and that there was a genuine bond of friendship that had been forged between them. Their relationship from the outside could be seen as something akin to that of a normal friendship though naturally one that transcends the human race. Though as later events occur I do wonder whether this bond was indeed real or not. Still I felt that the relationship between the two and the effect that it had on the overall plot was both well developed and was integrated very well into the main plot. As a character Shindou I felt was an excellent character as despite a veteran diplomat that was accustomed to dealing with fellow humans Shindou was due to his personality able to adapt well to the most unusual of situations and be able to act as the link between the people of Japan and ZashuNina which arguably made him one of the most important person on Earth at the time of the event. At the same time Shindou\u2019s compassionate personality while certainly not on the level of Saraka\u2019s also served as great qualities that ensured that his decisions while logical also ensured that he also thinks of the effects that it will have on normal humans as well. All in all, I felt that Hiroaki Miura really did an excellent job voicing the character of Shindou. \\n\\n\r\nSaraka \\n\\n\r\nSaraka Tsukai voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Digimon Adventure Tri fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main heroine of the series. A negotiator that works for the Japanese governments Ministry of foreign affairs that handles Japan\u2019s relationship with other countries Saraka is an intelligent, fast thinking and composed person that looks and behaves similarly to Shindou. Despite working in the same ministry Saraka and Shindou never met before the events of the plot. Like Shindou Saraka adapts a mask of professionalism when she\u2019s working as a negotiator that is both composed and reserved yet this mask does sometimes break when she\u2019s exposed to situations that resonate with her humorous personality. This aspect of her I felt was quite funny and helps differentiate her with Shindou who rarely laughs. Despite being young Saraka is both earnest and hardworking and treats her duties seriously which indicates how she got to her position and rank at her age. Indeed, while Saraka and Shindou have not met each other before the events of the plot it can be seen that he has at least heard of her. Like Shindou when Saraka is in diplomat mode she tends to be overly serious and uptight at times that manifests in a variety of ways. When under a lot of stress which in the series is actually quite often Saraka\u2019s overly serious personality manifests in the form of lectures to people that tries to remind them how important this is. Rather than reassuring others this seems to have the opposite effect on her which I felt was rather funny. As a result of her uptight personality when dealing with people that have a humorous side to them such as Shindou Saraka can be embarrassed quite easily which has the effect of causing her to look rather cute as she blushes quite heavily when she is. \\n\\n\r\nLike Shindou Saraka\u2019s personality outside of her role as a diplomat is very different to what you will expect from her but the difference here is that in this series Saraka\u2019s personality outside of her role is explored more so than Shindou\u2019s. Saraka\u2019s normal personality is akin to that of a free spirit and is one that loves to learn new things and explore similar to explorers of old and can be said to be similar to an adventurer. As a result of this personally Saraka has a rather interesting view of how evolution and human evolution should be handled that contrasts a great deal with her role in the story. Saraka is of the belief that evolution should be natural and that it should be left to advance at its own pace and not meddled with which contrasts a great deal with the gifts that ZashuNina brings to the table and makes for interesting conversations between her and Shindou. This belief of hers I felt was interesting not just because it serves as the opposite to ZashuNina\u2019s role in the story but also because this kind of belief is not often seen in anime as well. As a result of this belief Saraka is very firm in her belief that human evolution should be left to them and them alone and that they should only advance when they are ready for change. This causes a number of plat developments and revelations in the overall plot that were surprising. Saraka\u2019s determination to protect human dignity that was used as her reason for her beliefs I felt was really appropriate and fitted well with her personality of always putting the needs of humanity first. A prominent trait of Saraka is the fact that she has a great deal of empathy and as a result she is rather sensitive to the feelings and emotions of people around her and as a result she tends to have a more sympathetic view of people that have views that are not in line with what the majority of people think which I think was interesting as it contrasts both the official position and also Shindou\u2019s personality as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character Saraka in addition to being the main heroine and female lead also functioned as a contrast to the main character and Protagonist of Shindou and helped in showing him a side of the argument that was different to the logical side of things that he was accustomed to. On his own the character of Shindou though a very capable negotiator was a person that leaned on the side of logic a bit too heavily and as a result it can be said that he did view feelings and the larger picture of the human race as readily as he should. Considering the stakes for the whole race I feel that this is something that he should be more invested in. The addition of Saraka though and her partnership with Shindou as negotiators for both ZashuNina and the government respectively I felt really helped matters as this allowed them to interact more with each other. This had the effect of allowing Saraka to not just share her concerns to Shindou but also allow her to show him the feelings of others as well as the larger picture of the human race that he had missed when he received the job. As a result, this allowed Shindou to both be logical but at the same time more understanding of the feelings and concerns of others and more importantly the concerns for the human race as a whole. All in all, I felt that the character of Saraka was one that was well designed and had a clear defined role in the series. The contrast that she had with Shindou I felt was pretty well done. In a way, I felt that as a character Saraka functioned very similarly to a female version of Shindou though one that had both empathy and a belief that was unique to her. The relationship between Shindou and Saraka is one of the main points in the overall plot of this series and I felt that it was pretty well done. From the beginning of the series it was apparent that between the two there was a great deal of chemistry between the two as both had an equal amount of respect of each other. As the series progresses and both learn more about each other this is only intensified the bond. The idea that both characters changing as both learned more about each other is not anything new but the fact that Shindou learned a to be a bit more empathic and more human thanks to Saraka\u2019s advice and her beliefs I felt was done quite well and ultimately helped in ensuring that he had the conviction to stand against ZaShuNina when the time came. The idea that the two as a result of their shared beliefs actually becoming a couple was something that I thought was executed pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThe true nature of Saraka however I felt was a pretty good twist and one that came at a really opportune time with the plot line. I felt that Mao Ichimichi really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Saraka. \\n\\n\r\nZa Shunina \\n\\n\r\nZaShuNina whose full name is Yaha Kui ZashuNina who in this series is voiced by veteran voice actor Takuma Terashima of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and Log horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main antagonist of the series. A being from a separate space time that arrived on Earth on a cube shaped object in a most dramatic fashion ZashuNina despite looking like a human being is in fact an alien. ZashuNina adapts two different persona\u2019s that he makes use of in the series which is markedly different from each other though certain traits from one side do transfer to the other side. In his default persona that is used from the start of the series ZashuNina is a calm and quiet person that seems to adapt a neutral stance with regards to his relationship with humanity. Though powerful it can be seen that at this point in his personality ZashuNina acts somewhat like a child as still learning about humanity and its customs which I felt was interesting and kept it within this anime\u2019s main theme of diplomacy. As the series progresses and as ZaShuNina meets new people and learns more about humanity via dialogue and books and media his knowledge of humanity grows and from there the plot moves into the gifts that he is willing to provide to humanity. Though stemming from his second personality and his overall goal the gifts that ZaShuNina provides to humanity do stem from the many limits and struggles that his observations of humanity has told him and these gifts I felt were pretty well thought out and designed as each was created solely to address one issue that is dire to humanity. From a civilian point of view, it\u2019s easy to see why people want to use these gifts so much and why countries around the world are so willing to integrate these into the workings of their countries. I guess its human nature that they will believe everything that someone will say if that person appears to be benign to them and at the same able to help the race advance. \\n\\n\r\nZaShuNina\u2019s second personality was revealed near the end of the series and was anything but benign and indeed was a personality that I didn\u2019t really expect him to have. In this personality which I would imagine is his true nature ZashuNina in a departure from his first personality is a calculating, determined and ruthless person that\u2019s also deceitful and well versed at subterfuge. While his initial personality can be described to be that of a child this new personality can be seen to be that of an adult and a scheming one as well. In this personality ZashuNina is very determined to enact his own master plan and his own designs for humanity even if it meant that it will cost them dearly in terms of life. Indeed, from ZashuNina\u2019s initial personality only his hunger for knowledge which can be said to be his prominent trait is transferred from that personality to this one. In the beginning of the series though I did have suspicions that ZaShuNina would be the main villain for the series the gradual transformation from a benign alien that was seen as a great inventor by humanity to a villain that was dead set on uplifting humanity so that they can provide him with knowledge was so unexpected that it shook even me. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of ZaShuNina I felt was a really interesting character and made a pretty good villain for the series. The character of ZaShuNina I felt was a very well-designed character that underwent great changes in his behavior and personality as the series went on. Indeed, the changes were such that it\u2019s almost as if there actually two people that have the same name but yet differing personalities in them. Due to this it was not easy to see what his motivations and aims were in the series until his true plan was revealed which I think was the point of this.  I felt that Takuma Terashima really did an excellent job of portraying the character of ZaShuNina and that this character contributed greatly to how excellent this story was. \\n\\n\r\nKanata Shinawa \\n\\n\r\nKanata Shinawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Kugimiya is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Shindou and Saraka\u2019s allies in the series. A genius level scientist that works at one of the many research labs that the government manages and oversees Kanata is despite her young age an excellent scientist that apart from being smart is also hyperactive and positive and indeed can spend her days researching new things without a care in the world. Though eccentric and tending to get way too immersed in her analysis\u2019s Kanata is someone that is more than willing to help others if the request itself is something that hasn\u2019t been done before. Kanata is someone that loves to challenge the unknown. While certainly eccentric and easily excited Kanata\u2019s main personality trait is her determination to figure out and determine how something actually works and when combined with her childish wonder at new things this is something that actually makes her pretty endearing. While representing the science side of the story Kanata due to her positive nature is also able to cheer people up with her attitude which I felt was pretty funny to see. Though young it can be seen that her superiors and fellow scientists at the lab trust her immensely due to her intellect and determined nature. Though only a support character I felt that Rie Kugimiya really did a great job at portraying the character of Kanata and that she brought not just intelligence but also determination to the field that proves that human intelligence is also something that should not be underestimated.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the art that was used for this series I felt that the environments that used and shown in the series was pretty well done with the interior of Kado being especially impressive. The character designs for the characters in this series I felt was also pretty well done with ZaShuNina\u2019s design despite taking the form of a human also looked like a hybrid that\u2019s between a human and an alien. The other environments such as Haneda airport, the Diet building and Saraka and Shindou\u2019s home towns I felt were also well done. With regards to the animation because this series isn\u2019t actually a true action anime the animation in the series is focused more on the showing of how the gifts actually work which I felt was well done and showed just how powerful they were. It wasn\u2019t until much later in the series that the anime featured combat scenes and I felt that these were done pretty well especially the fights between Saraka and ZaShuNina and the final fight in the end. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening and ending themes for the series being especially strong. The opening theme for the series which was called Tabiji was sung by the character of Saraka Tsukai through her seiyuu Mao Ichimichi and I felt that this song along with its visuals did a pretty good job of setting the mood for the series while also showing the evolution of humanity through its visuals. The ending theme for this series which was called Eien No Kotae which was sung by Haruca had a more positive tone to it that for some reason had a calming presence to it. Individual scene music I felt was pretty well done throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the series I felt was excellent throughout the series with each of the characters that were featured in the series being portrayed to the best of their respective seiyuu\u2019s ability. In particular the characters of Koujirou Shindou, Saraka Tsukai and Yaha Kui ZaShuNina who were portrayed by Hiroaki Miura, Mao Ichimichi and Takuma Terashima respectively I felt did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. In addition the characters of Kanata, Takumi Gonnou and the Japanese prime minister Kouzou Inutaba who was portrayed by Rie Kugimiya, Takuya Kirimoto and Hiroshi Naka I felt also did a great job portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall, I thought that Kado the right answer as it is called in the west was a pretty good anime that was actually interesting and indeed was something that really surprised me because it provoked a lot of interesting questions into the world that we live in. it\u2019s not every day that an anime would feature so many real-world questions and challenges inside it though and use that as part of its main plot. The strong points that made Kado the right answer such an excellent anime in my opinion was its interesting theme and the fact that it made use of real world problems as part of it, strong story that provoked questions about the current world, excellent characters, Excellent animation and voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing to address is the theme of the show. The main theme of the show apart from contact with an alien race also lies inside the realm of negotiation and diplomacy. At the same time, another thing that was part of this series theme was the gifts that the main villain provided that was designed to help humanity as a race overcome some of the challenges that they currently face. The inclusion of real world problems like energy, time and transporting objects I felt was really interesting and the way that it was revealed to humanity was both intelligent and well done as the thought that any of the three problems that beset them and limit them can be dealt with these gifts will surely find a lot of people who is willing to use them. The main theme of this series however is undoubtedly that of diplomacy and negotiation which I felt was interesting and was a well-designed move on the creator\u2019s part. In animes that feature contact with beings from either parallel dimension such as this one or aliens from other planets or galaxies the line largely lies with either fighting a war to defend the planet or forcefully integrate their resources into your own race with diplomacy largely being ignored or at least seeing limited use. As such it was actually pretty refreshing to see that this anime\u2019s main theme while also dealing with aliens makes use of diplomacy as its main theme. Though like most people I have limited knowledge on the concept of diplomacy and negotiation I felt that depiction that negotiation is built on a degree of trust that was shown between Shindou and ZashuNina was really well done. Watching the two of them gradually learn about each other and at the same time cooperate to create gifts that would benefit humanity as a race while also forging a bond built on trust was something that was nice to see and begs the question why isn\u2019t this concept used more in anime. I felt that the diplomacy side of things in the anime was pretty well done and was a pretty accurate portrayal of how negotiations between parties actually take place even though this party to which Saraka and Shindou talk with is far from anything that both have encountered in their careers. A real game changer there lol. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series is another strong point and was one that I felt was done really well. In line with the main theme of the series the overall storyline focuses on first the introduction of the alien being to the world via his most dramatic entrance on to the planet by literally landing on one of Japan\u2019s busiest airports followed by his gradual reveal of what he was and what he represented. The gradual evolution of ZaShuNina\u2019s role from that of an unknown life form to that of a major celebrity and then to his reveal of the gifts that he is willing to gift to humanity I felt was pretty well done.  The concept of using the relationship that he has forged with the government of japan and use this to determine the challenges that face the race as a whole I felt was interesting and played alone with the theme of diplomacy as diplomacy and negotiation is always focused on understanding what the other party needs and providing what they want versus what you yourself want from the. The gradual transformation of this relationship as well as ZaShuNina as a character I felt was pretty well done. Arguably the transformation of ZaShuNina from a benign alien being to one that proved to be a scheming and manipulative alien being that had his own nefarious plan was also well done as was the twist of Saraka\u2019s identity as well. Indeed, transformation and twists also changed the dynamic of the story near the end but in a good way I think. One thing about the overall story that really interested me though was the fact that ZaShuNina\u2019s entrance and the effects that he has is not limited to Japan on its own and indeed affects humanity as a whole. As a result, when deciding on his next moves ZaShuNina and Shindou had to consider the larger effects that bind the world namely its structure. In the world that we live in its easy to see that even as a race humanity is not united entity and that we are divided in both culture, countries and borders that are unique to each country. Though logically it can be said that ZaShuNina and Shindou could have used international organisations like the UN to get the gifts to the people of various countries there also lies the next problem. Humanity as a race is as diverse as a rainbow that while also giving us strength and unity also creates problems like greed and control and points to the fact can these governments and organisations really get the gifts to the people and not hog them for themselves. Its issues like this that really make the story worth investing in as it provokes some really interesting views on the world that we live in. With regards to this question I loved how they actually ended up bypassing them entirely and solving the problem their way.  The true purpose and plan of ZaShuNina\u2019s however doesn\u2019t come into play until much later in the series but it was done in such a way that it really could be said to be one of the best twists that I seen in an anime for a long time. The clash of ideas and convictions that served as the main plot in that part of the series I felt was pretty well done and loved how Saraka and Shindou\u2019s relationship as well as their shared beliefs were used as the main plot here. The clash of ideas between them and ZaShuNina was something that I was looking forward too and was something that was excellently done. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of things that I felt really stood out in this series with the first being how well thought out and how well executed both the twists in the story and the plans to counter them were created. A great example of the latter is the last plan that Shindou and Saraka used to finally put a stop to ZaShuNina in the end. The thought that they had made use of the same tech that he himself had created for his plan to engineer his destruction was funny and had no small amount of irony to it as well. The ending fight which led into the ending itself I felt was pretty well done and demonstrated the fact that when humanity and the anisotropic being work together they can even beat someone as formidable as ZaShuNina. Though the cost of victory was indeed high I felt that as a race humanity can still learn to advance but at a suitable pace and not losing sight of what makes them human. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a while since I seen an anime that in addition to having an excellent theme and story as well as excellent characters and voice acting was able to provoke some really interesting questions that I had never once thought off.  All in all, Kado the right answer was really one of the best animes for this season because it was intelligent and made use of real world issues in a way that only served to enhance its main plot line. The core lesson for Kado the right answer is naturally that while advancement in tech is important whats more important that that is that we should never lose sight of our own unique identity that makes us human when doing it. And probably not trust every alien that shows up on the planet as well. \\n\\n\\n",

Universal communication/clarity - toward understanding\r\n1. Endless power source\r\n2. Resources & technology un-restricting living\r\n3. Un-breakable food supply\r\n4. Plentiful water supply.\r\n5. Goal for exploration & progress of interests (ones not of control)\r\n(So far 0-1 have been accomplished -rest are just logical)\\n\\n\r\nJapan is picked for its abundance of 'Heart' - plentiful & communicable, to relay offered assistance in above.\\n\\n\r\nIf true, once money, control, programmed differences {inadvertently Kado is a singular god yet no god... so who is his creator?}, needs, misunderstanding & disparity are rendered to no real consequence ... will humanity behave well? (love, fight & fight for love?) How governing is the flip-side of love (hate)?\\n\r\nAll will change. \\n\\n\r\nOffered a perfect solution or hope of many, can societal habit or survival even once obsolete be relearned?\\n\\n\r\nA proffered dream, yes people will take yet will they give too?\\n\r\nOnly the heart of each, of all, will tell.\\n\\n\r\nI look forward to seeing this show develops :)\\n\\n\r\n- - - - -      Loving this show; so:                -Additional - \\n\\n\r\nI continue & may surmise at end, spoilers will now be somewhat unavoidable\\n\\n\r\nEpisode  04:\\n\\n\r\nThe right answer ((( - is never easy; even with it, many will oppose forever out of fear However the unimaginable dream from real restraints can be achieved with the right people involved. :)  We only hold ourselves back.\\n\r\nStill impressed, well thought & envisioned - production values are very worthy (music 8-9 art 8, voice 9)\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6:\\n\\n\r\nVisually again the artwork is mesmerising around Kado, its movement was stunning. \\n\r\nMusically the background music is both apt, fresh & evocative, employed strategically well. This is a production of value.\\n\\n\r\nIn the story line elements of helping humanity to be better/optimal along with heart/compassion sit well till the end of this episode. A question of the entities intent and existential relationship to Kado, to us is brought up along with the disquieting thought 'humanity will not need to sleep'.  \\n\r\nIt could be useful but does this mean not able to sleep? If so will we be human anymore without our ability to dream? \\n\r\nHave we now a hint of a darker consequence for humanity? Does the all powerful entity wish to help as he sees fit or turn us more into something like him? \\n\\n\r\nTo answer this double edged caution we need to watch more, this series certainly keeps you comming back and wondering....'what will develope next?'\\n\r\nNicely done.  \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6.5 = Recap\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7:\\n\\n\r\nThis show gets very interesting & without too drastic a cliffhanger, though a mild one at the end of this it is more Intrigue.\\n\r\nI will aim to keep this short as these episodes each have plenty to think about/enjoy. \\n\r\nI am back rooting for Kado after episode 6's worrying end. We can sleep if wished & still sleep elsewhere (trying no to place too many spoilers).  It shows the mind behind this story keeps revealing a different aproach & challenges.\\n\r\nTotally refreshing. Yet as indicated... are we ready? \\n\r\nSo far the 'Right answer' has been implemented in a cordial & revolutionary way; each episode a gift. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8:\\n\\n\r\nGlad there is now a convincing voice for dissent - good or bad, the idea is too strong to leave running riot. The Sansa, what would you choose? \\n\r\nHumanity fears change whilst dreams of progress & free advancement. It happens as quick as you want but without our contemplation. Now there is a third gift spoken as the fourth? We worry again as the word destruction tantalises. \\n\r\nThis series does not disappoint.\\n\r\nAs above - we are dealing now with No.s  0, 2 & 5.\\n",

I didn't expect this anime would have been as good as it was and at least for the first 75% of the series I thought the show was very consistent.\r\nThe way how the story was constructed along with its premise, allowed the show to have a great base from where the story could go in a multitude of directions. The direction the show eventually went wasn't one that I personally got a lot of satisfaction from but it was still to the point whereoverall the anime still felt enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe art is a blend between 2D/3D and surprisingly I thought that it was handled extremely well. There wasn't many instances where I thought that the animation suffered because of the use of the 3D. Kudos to Toei Animation in that regard.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was phenomenal and I thought that it was able to enhance many moments from the show.\\n\r\nThe characters were great although in the final moments of the series, the way certain characters were developed could have been different in my personal opinion. In the end certain elements of the show felt a bit rushed but it didn't detract too much from my overall feeling of the anime.\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado is a anime with an interesting premise and I thought that it did a very good job on delivering on that premise.\\n",

Art for alien parts is eye-candy; terrestrial, ordinary, at least by comparison.  Characters have actual character but it's too soon to know what if any development will occur.  I have some concerns about the alien being too powerful and too benevolent, but further plot developments may put  twists into the initial situation -- I like what I've seen so much that an original twist or two might even be in store.(By 'original' I mean not something like a simple good/bad flip.)",

            "content": "Note: This review contains spoilers. Also, don't pay too much attention to the rating I gave here.\r\nNegotiation. Getting what's in your interest is the goal of negotiations. But defeating your opponent and temporarily gaining what you want will always come back to bite you in the long term. What's best for you is giving both parties something in their interest. That sounds easy, but it's extremely difficult in fact.\r\nThere isn't just one answer, for one thing. We aren't God. We'll never know what was right and what was the right answer for our whole life. But, even if we don't know, we just have tokeep looking.\\n\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado features Kojirou Shindo, a Japanese negotiator working for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, encountering Yaha-kui zaShunina, a godlike existence presented as an anisotropic being coming from outside the universe. Thematically speaking, this series is about the meeting of two existences (Humans and Anisotropic being), two different levels of technology, from how will try to interact with each other up to how one existence will influence the other.\\n\r\nOn the one hand, there is Humanity being confronted to an upper being, overwhelmed by the technology of the anisotropic they get their hand on with zaShunina's offerings on multiple levels. On the other hand, there is zaShunina, representing the anisotropic beings, is interested in Humans and all the information they represent, being their mean of communicating, how they react due to his appearance, and try to act as a human to understand them (4th episode when he's reading for example). It's revealed he's trying to give humans a sense of the anisotropic also for his own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Seikaisuru Kado is attractive due to its attempt to confront both parts on an ideological debate rather than a threatening approach. At first, the story depicts how Shindo acts as a negotiator between zaShunina and humanity since he agrees with zaShunina's goal of making the mankind advance. He ends up becoming the representative of the anisotropic being to present and rephrase zaShunina's idea for the rest of the world so that a mutual understanding can be set up.\\n\r\nThe first part of the show (~8 episodes) resolves around mankind confronted to the discovery of new and unknown technologies. But getting your hand on a new technology ain't that simple, and especially with an unknown one. It makes you raise questions as the legitimacy of using it (Tools ain't good or evil, only their users are. Should we change the society to rely on something we don't understand yet?), its impact on the world, be it at an economical level (with the Wam), or at a societal and psychological level (with the Sansa). \\n\r\nConfronting to those questions, three points of view are depicted between zaShunina, Shindo and Saraka. zaShunina believes that accepting those technologies and spreading them as soon as possible is the right answer. Tsukai Saraka is totally opposed to zaShunina's ideology as she believes humans should progress \"naturally\", by themselves, and not by forcing it. Humanity have to be ready to accept such an evolution. Between the two of them lies Shindo. He's not opposed to a sudden evolution of the world. As a negotiator, he seeks what should benefit humans. He weights up the pros and cons and act on what he thinks to be the best solution. In episode 0, he proves himself [to us] to be able to solve a problem by suggesting an idea leading to a better outcome, and that he doesn't fear the concept of evolution.  \\n\r\nMedia is also a strong element in this first part as it's present as the tool to bypass governments decisions (be it with the Japanese conference or Setten) by letting the people made their own choice. It's a tool praised by zaShunina himself as he believed that everyone should think for themselves as what's supposed to be good or evil. Media happened to have a greater influence than politicians since it's the way they used to \"force\" the knowledge to spread regardless of the governments' will. (As an aside, the first episode of Black Mirror gave an interesting idea of the impact of media.)\\n\\n\r\nThe second part of the show (eps 9-12) is about zaShunina being influenced by humans and how his interested got redirected from mankind to Shindo. zaShunina being more and more human is not something unusual since it already started some episodes ago. In addition to act as one, zaShunina displayed emotions since the end of the 6th episodes, be it with its facial expressions who changed from its original stern one and the use of obscure concepts such as like and dislike (episode 7). The last episode completely confirms this change with zaShunina being sad, angry and surprised (and even the two last ones at the same time), etc. I wouldn't go so far as to say zaShunina got corrupted by human's nature, but the fact its personality changed in contact to Shindo and him looking disinterested from humanity gaining a sense of the anisotropic is what made this second part interesting.\\n\r\nWhile the first part of the show was about mankind interacting with an anisotropic being, the second is focused on Shindo confronting zaShunina as individuals. zaShunina beaks off the talks with Shindo when he refuses to come with him to the anisotropic. Shindo is no longer a negotiator between the humans and the anisotropic being, but the one zaShunina was showing affection and the one he wanted to bring outside the universe. As for Shindo, zaShunina ain't simply an anisotropic being, but a friend for him. A friend he will put his life on the line to try to correct him or else, he will stay in the wrong. Their confrontation represents both their disagreement as individuals/friends (or more for zaShunina) and as an anisotropic being and a human negotiator.\\n\r\nIn episode 10, it is mentioned the problem lied in zaShunina wanting to reach the one right answer with humanity by bringing them to the anisotropic so they won't die (as a species) billion years latter while the humans won't accept to perform such a sacrifice because it's also a part of a human life to live the best they can in the time they are given. Similarly to episode 0, Shindo ends up satisfying the two parts by proving the two existences could evolve in a way zaShunina didn't even consider.\\n\r\nIn the end, with the disappearance of zaShunina along with Kado, the anisotropic technology stop working. It's also a warning about the backlash of wanting to rely on something you don't master or develop yourself as the question was raised earlier. To complete the conclusion of this story, the series ends up explaining what matters the most is to know you can  still advance farther and to set a goal to lead your way.\\n\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado got its pros and cons. You may not like how the story turned out, especially for the second part and the twist they choose to do. Still, this series was worth being watched for all the thematics it grasped even if a lot of idea could have been more developed.\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado doesn't provide the right answer, it makes yourself pondering at what the right answer should be for all the problem it raises. After all, to constantly think is the only right answer in the world.",

            "content": "Disappointing.\r\nIf I were to describe this anime it one word, it would be disappointing. What started off as a beautiful political journey pushed by science and philosophy, within episodes became generic and predictable.\r\nStory: 4\r\nAs said before, the story idea and story itself were fantastic. The pace was perfect - not too slow to bore us, but not to fast to make us super confused. There were many new terms used, but, for the most part, were explained in a way that was easy to understand, or simply didn't take away from the overall experience. Each episode was a joy - wanting to know what wouldtake place next; what would the media do? how would the UN react? would the people revolt to the changes? e.t.c Really, there was so much potential to be had in the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut then episode 9 came, and all was lost. Was it because they had to rush? - after all, it was an original which had no manga or novel as a true backbone. Maybe they thought the viewers would prefer it this way. Perhaps it was a matter of one person placing their terrible ideas on the table. I don't know, but I do know that the result was devastating. Politics? Gone. The people and their opinions? Gone. The influence of the media? Gone. Subliminal philosophy which made you think regardless of whether you wanted to or not? Gone.  All the amazing things that have been built up until now? Absolutely gone; disappeared. Or, rather, replaced. And by utterly predictable 'romance' and the generic tropes one would expect of an 'arrival sci-fi', caused by one annoying 'girl' who feels the world should be dictated by herself and herself alone.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\\n\r\nActually outstanding. The art was magical. Toei really outdid themselves here. Managing to mix 3D and 2D in such a smooth, barely noticeable way, the animation style was new and fresh. The character designs were easy on the eyes and this quality remained constant throughout the whole anime. The use of patterns and symmetry in both the OP, anime and ED, was incredibly fitting - it really evoked a sense of the 'anisotropic' and of incomprehensible, alien thoughts. Honest kudos to the studio here - it was breath taking. A shame that the latter part of the story put it to waste.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nAgain, magical. The timing has been great, regardless of what point in the plot we were in. I can't remember anything particularly spell-binding, or so perfectly suitable to the animation that it made me repeat said scene several times. The OP and ED were the same as the overall art - made in such a way to not use actual human languages or words, but to simply evoke ideas using music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we are, at last. Shindo - the negotiator who stood between the anisotropic and humanity('universe'). He was essentially a translator for everything, but was also our eyes into the world as he was always the first to see the new items brought to humanity. Shindo was an interesting character; he wasn't made to be anything special and had the nice balance of being a human and being a calm, collected government official. His relationship with Shu(zaShunina) was most intriguing to watch - it was clearly a mutual adoration; Shindo was interested in the anistortopic and Shu was interested in Shindo himself who he walked side-by-side with in the advancement of humanity. It was made very easy to see why these two were put together as a 'team' - they have a nice dynamic and would honestly be interesting to watch together regardless of setting.\\n\\n\r\nShu, himself, was an interesting specimen. He's treated like a baby or a sheltered person, who has all the knowledge in the world, but no actual experience to go with it(note; babies don't have all the knowledge in the world, but he's like a baby in that he's new to the world). It's a joy to see his stoic expression and general countenance fade to smiles and expressions fitting what he was actually feeling. We know that he reads books to enable him to understand human culture more, which, again, has influence on his expressions and actions. The cool thing with his arms were also nice - adding a feature to outwardly show how different he was to the world. Shu was a great character. Towards the end, I didn't like where his character alignment was going, as he had to switch roles for the sake of plot convenience. However, he still remained a nice character - he learnt even more emotions, made his motivations clear, e.t.c This adorable anisotropic creature really was the biggest delight of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Tsukai Saraka, the generic-creator. Honestly, Saraka would've made a far better side-character. Her motivations were sound; her actual personality was believable; seeing how she balanced family and her tsundere-like nature with her work personality was fine. What wasn't okay, however, was what she did to the plot. Honestly, this character single-handedly turned what was amazing and unique into a pile of generic tropes and predictability. What should've been Shindo and Shu, the representations of humanity and the anisotropic, getting to know and understand each other and their values, in turn helping each other develop and advance like in a symbiotic relationship, turned into something else entirely. Saraka would've worked far better as the simple human girl with simple, straightforward, human values, contrasting with that of Shindo's and Shu's, who wouldn't get her way because the plot would be far more flavourful that way.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the actual side characters. They do well to fuel the plot, from the Prime Minister to the childish scientist( whom everyone seemed to hate for some reason which eludes me). They were believable, yes, including the childish scientist, who mirrors actual scientists, and honestly didn't cause any discrepancies. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nAgain, my enjoyment greatly deteriorated as more episodes passed by, due to the absolute 180 in plot and genres. However, everything else was still mostly great, so I couldn't lower my score that much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.6\\n\\n\r\n6 was probably too harsh considering it only had one terrible factor, and 7 was too high because of that said terrible factor, so no rounding done here. The anime was - has been - a joy, for the most part. It was simply pulled down by the last few episodes, which are currently influencing my review the most. I haven't finished yet, and there is the possibility that my score will change depending on how this goes(hopefully it'll be higher because I don't want to leave this anime bitter). I definitely recommend watching this, however be prepared for the utter drop in story quality towards eps 8-10 at the least.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, forgive my typos, I was too lazy to re-read.",

            "content": "Honestly, one of the best anime of the season. The story is exquisite, the characters are for the most part very likeable, the CG is eye candy and the soundtrack both for the opening/ending and for the ost of the anime is honestly amazing.\r\nInitially, I was a bit thrown off by the CG in the anime but the art style blended it in quite well so it's easy to lose sight of it. The animations for the humans are still quite robotic in comparison for the animation used for Kado and other non-living things. Which I do admit is rather frustrating at times but itdoes not take away my enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is rather unique for an anime, this sense of diplomacy and formality gives a breath of fresh air to many anime viewers such as myself. It's refreshing to see an anime which does not feature teenagers in a High School. This storyline is currently making you question humanity as a whole with its various array of questions and choices. Definitely check out this anime is deep stories are your style. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; This anime's plot, art, soundtrack and characters are amazing. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "When there exists many assured commercial and critical successes sustaining a company or studio money, sometimes they would want to take risks. Maybe they'd hire more auteur directors, try original story concepts or do something to aim for a new crowd that wouldn't previously enjoy their work. That was likely the thought of Toei Animation, when in addition to their successes with Dragon Ball Super and the juggernaut One Piece, they decided to create Kado- The Right Answer, an all CGI original sci fi series having debates about such complex topics such as the ethics of humanity and how prepared they would be for suddeninstantaneous advancements in technology. This wasn't Toei's first time doing this. They released the widely beloved Mononoke series which felt above the norm, and to my knowledge 2013's Kyousou Giga was considered to be an overlooked classic as well. However for Kado, it feels like it was so close to establishing its identity and maturity firmly, only for that potential to be wasted and lead into something annoyingly typical.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, although not the most original at first glance, starts seeming to come into its own. A giant shiny multicolored cube falls from the sky onto an airport about to take off, including two workers with skill in diplomacy, for which Episode 0 established: \\n\r\nKojirou Shindou and Shuuhei Asano. We start by seeing the government of Japan trying to handle this foreign presence of the cube and then by seeing those trapped inside it interacting with the being naming itself Yaha-kui zaShunina, which would later be called the Anisotropic for convenience. Later on we get to meet more characters, including skilled foreign diplomat Tsukai Saraka, Japan's prime minister, news reporters and Kanata Shinawa, an eccentric scientist girl who understands the alien technology the most. While not the most concrete characterization, they seem to work fine for this portion of the story, as it becomes all about seeing these diverse reactions and showing how these mature people see the different suggestions the alien brings up to advance humanity's functions. The people would be of greater understanding of each other and the universe regardless of what choice they picked. The story, while not that investing, seemed atypical and fairly grounded and mature despite the supernatural entity. Does it continue these ideas it set forth until the end of the show though? Not exactly....... \\n\\n\r\nSee, at around the halfway point, Saraka snaps out of her professional attitude to have a Tsundere moment that main character Shindou brings up and it's at this point when things start to fall into typical anime-ness. A few more moments like this come up, we get some comedy involving a festival episode and then Saraka goes on a massive speech on why humanity is amazing  and the world is amazing and that everyone is perfect! This was the point where I lost faith in the show. It made it seem like this professional diplomat character turned into a typical over-idealized anime heroine, saying things that felt contradictory to the morally gray nature of certain debates earlier. That's not the only thing that happens though. The anisotropic itself goes from wanting to and considering collaboration with humanity and technology to.....wanting to backstab the main character and absorb all of humanity for his own goals. Not only does this completely go against any attempt at character development the conversations might've had earlier, but combined with Saraka's over idealistic speech completely ruins their sense of moral ambiguity we saw previously for the past 7-8 episodes or so. \\n\\n\r\nThen, in an unexpected twist with zero buildup, Saraka ALSO turns out to be an alien, the simple bonding relationship between her and Shindou turns into a love which lacks the proper pacing in itself, and Shindou and zaShunina have a punching battle which ends in the death of Shindou, the defeat of the alien and more idealistic speeches about humanity. Therefore, we end our Seinen story with a climax that wouldn't be out of place in your average battle Shonen.\\n\\n\r\nThis feels contradictory to the intentions from the beginning. If your idea is to create a unique product that will stand out from the genericness that seems to overtake the market, why decide to take the cliche route out anyways? It's like if an elegant ice skater near the end of his routine decided to swap out from rollerblades, slipping on a loose banana peel and falling flat on his face. Kado's overall execution simply comes off as ineffective at best and extremely jarring at worst. With the intriguing concepts so much time was put into meaning very little by the end of it, Kado feels like a wasted effort on the story front. Too much time was spent on the mature debating to accept the high tension stakes of the climax, so when a character you appreciate literally has his life on the line, you'd like him, but not care enough to that extent that we're concerned for his safety in an actual fight we'd not seen animated before.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, as far as animation goes, it was actually one of the show's greatest strengths. Yes, including the CGI. Many have often seen CGI animation as an unfortunate crutch, especially when it comes to anime, with the new Berserk adaptation being one of the standout examples of its badness. However, this show not only decides to not have excessive movements with the CGI, but use it to convey the slight movements and body language of those in arbitration in a faster way than traditional animation. And unlike say, Ajin, the frame rate didn't feel too fast for its own good, so the choppiness that could've been there was not. The best part of the animation though, was the background art inside the Kado itself. With the liquid gold exterior and the many different shapes formed, the director was allowed a lot of perspective shots to sell the out-there nature of the series. That said, if the show ever reverts back to 2D animation....it looks BAD, like, really choppy and generic looking. Still, the good outweighs the bad and the animation overall benefited the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound...didn't really do it either way. The OP was nice, the ED was nice, and background music was functional but unmemorable. Moving on to the biggest disappointment, the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character,  Kojirou Shindo, is the one who gets the most screentime and has the overall importance. He's a skilled debator who ends up siding with the anisotropic in his goals to advance humanity's nature. While it is interesting to see why he continues to side with the alien for every debate topic that comes up in the early episode, the \"bromance\" there felt like it happened too fast for me to fully buy. Agreeing with the alien was one thing, but siding with it for every possible option felt like an extreme. Still, he's the character we get to know the best and most of his decisions are shown fairly well in context. We like him enough? Sure. Do we care about him enough that his DEATH could leave an impact? Not to that extent, the story of Kado didn't feel like it was building up to such a thing. Character death was such a foreign concept, and the show seemed to favor logical over emotional. The character's resolution is sound but the full extent of the story does him about as much harm as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe alien zaShunina also started off the story fairly interesting. With an ever growing view of humanity and technology could benefit or hinder humanity's potential depending on its use, it was interesting to see him propose his morally gray views, rather than simply wanting to take over the world and eliminate humanity. Sadly, that's exactly what the final quarter of the series ends up doing. His betrayal of Shindou makes it too easy for the audience to choose to go against him, and his final scene has him too easily see the positiveness of humans and have a typical villain angry face breakdown scene. Therefore a possibly interesting and deep character was turned into your average everyday bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nEven with him though, easily the character most affected by this change in tone and direction is Tsukai Saraka. I already mentioned before how her Tsundere moment was the first crack in its foundation of something above the norm, but it's even more jarring if you consider her largely professional position and debating skills seen prior. Sure, you could argue that the Tsundere moment was to show she had more sides to her than just her professional life, but you start seeing more and more of these moments, as well as her speech about why humanity is special and amazing and start to lose faith in that confident and mature image. The show near its end tried to build an ever lasting romance between her and Shindou which....really doesn't work. They did know each other very early on in the series, but at that point, they were mature negotiators who collaborated in their field of work, not lovers. The transition to this could've been handled far worse but still feels too far out of left field to care about. Even when her insane faith makes more sense with the twist of her true identity, it felt unnecessary, and in the last three episodes her character takes steps too drastic from the first nine episodes. Saraka is probably my biggest disappointment in the show, particularly for the fact that they tried to force a Renton/Eureka esque romance in a show or place where it didn't belong and mean little to her professional foundation.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everyone else? Well, there ARE other characters, like the aforementioned quirky scientist girl, Japan's Prime Minister, News Reporters, and other high diplomatic from other countries, but in the end, everything comes down to these three and the rest don't have a lasting impact. We never get to see the end goal of their views because of the forced tonal change of the ending. Even Shuuhei Asano, who seemed like he would be an interesting character at the start as Shindou's partner, devolved to running away and crying without doing anything that felt substantial compared to his partner. It's sad how much the story's alternate direction sacrifices the foundation of so many characters for the sake of hasty rewrites. \\n\\n\r\nEND OF SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the way Kado ultimately played out was like a massive disappointment with a sudden and out of place payoff that I didn't expect, want, or ask for. So much that was built up, debated, and foreshadowed meant nothing but idealistic schmaltz. I might've gained something from the show if it didn't awkwardly switch tracks near the end and kept up the debate angle, but despite trying to stand out, all it did was shoot itself in the foot to become another forgettable title that won't be remembered over the next few years quite so fondly.",

            "content": "Minor spoilers ahead\r\nStory:\r\nSo our story starts with a very interesting set-up, a being from another dimension - the anisotropic - comes to Earth and wants to advance humanity and help them find the right answer.\r\nThis leads to a couple of interesting questions:\r\nIs it a good thing for humanity to advance through the help of outside forces?\r\nWill humanity be able to handle this much advancement at once?\r\nWhat are the consequences for the world?\r\nWho is this anisotropic being and why does he do what he does?\r\nAnd what is the right answer?\r\nThese questions are the driving forces behind the story of Kado - the right answer and it'sup to humanity to find out the right answer to these.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all the premise was very interesting and for most of the episodes the execution was great. \\n\r\nThe problem with this story was the twist in its final episodes, while I liked the reveal of what the anisotropic being is and why he does things, it took this show in a very different direction than I thought it would go. It started of with a lot of these deeper, philosophic questions about humanity and ends with well... something quite different.\\n\r\nThe final episode was horribly rushed and the ending was very unsatisfying. I don't want to give it away but the way the Main Characters story finished was just very anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime uses a lot of CG, especially for its characters. If you're really bothered by this then it might bother you in this show as well.\\n\r\nFor me however it worked very well, the CGI was obvious but it was executed in a way that it didn't feel out of place at all. If this is the future of CGI in anime then I'm up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of beautiful wide shots of Kado and its surroundings in this show, especiall the proportions of Kado in comparison with other objects was handled exceptionally. It really felt huge. The inside of Kado was also designed beautifully and was one of the highlights of the show from an artistic point of view.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't anything that special, but I think that was the point, it was a show that was set in reality so everybody looks like an ordinary person, except for the anisotropic being whose design I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Seikaisuru Kado was a highlight of this show. The opening and also the ending were just awesome. Especially the opening, I never skipped this one. Though in general the OST was quite good. It added a lot to the series and made a lot of moments feel bigger.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nShindou, Koujiro\\n\\n\r\nShindou is the protagonist of Kado, he's a negotiator for the Japanese Government and the person who also negotiates with the anisotropic being.\\n\r\nHe's a very likeable and interesting guy, worthy of being a protagonist. His interactions with his co-worker Hanamori would've been enough for me to watch a slice-of-life show with them just doing their negotiations.\\n\r\nHe goes through some interesting character development over the course of this show, I just wish the end of his story arc wouldn't have been so anti-climactic.\\n\\n\r\nYaha-kui zaShunina\\n\\n\r\nThe anisotropic being who wants to  advance humanity. His deisgn was great and I really liked the concepts of the anisotropic he brought to this world. He was a very interesting and mysterious character right until the final episodes. It was interesting to see him change due to the influence humanity had on him.\\n\\n\r\nTsukai, Saraka\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead of this show. At first she felt a little out of place in this show. Her typical anime antics just didn't fit with the otherwise serious world of Seikaisuru Kado. But she was a nice and sweet girl and she grew on me. It was interesting to see her become so important later on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm a bit disappointed with this show. I really enjoyed everything until the twist and was ready to rate this 9/10. But the twist of this show first drove it into a direction that was only okay instead of great and then the final episode happened and I won't give away the ending but it was a huge letdown for me and some of it felt like an asspull to me.\\n\r\nI'd still recommend this show for it's great 10 episodes!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Up to episode 7, the show keeps piling up evidence that the author is incredibly naive about political and economic issues, and is focusing the whole show in the idea the world is undergoing a \"revolution\" caused by Kado. In episode 7, they introduce the Samsa device that allows people to become aware of their multidimensional selves, thus eliminating the need for sleep. When the Japanese government representatives are discussing this, all they are thinking about is how this would improve human productivity, without a thought for the fact that it's precisely excess productivity caused by excess population that is leading the environment to acatastrophic failure in the relatively near future. Also, it's ignoring the psychological issues, the boredom factor and other problems. It seems that the show is just trying to say - like a good Japanese - that people would be able to work a lot more, and is not aware that it's precisely this overdedication to work that causes so many psychological and social problems to Japanese individuals, including the overly high suicide rate (not the only factor, but a major contributor), and entirely disregarding the idea that people in other cultures DO NOT live for their jobs. The only moment the show approaches this problem is when they question whether rapid development would lead to happiness, when actually survival is far more of a pressing issue here. The wam would already lead to disastrous disruptions in the economic structure of the world. Add that to billions of people having too much time in their hands and/or companies pushing them to work more, thus speeding up the exhaustion of natural resources, and the anisothropic's gifts look increasingly like a curse to me. The only one that seems to realize this is Saraka.\\n\r\nAnd then the show throws everything out the window in the last three episodes. After Sayaka became God (she even has a halo, for fuck's sake!) and Shindo falls in love with her for no reason at all, and poor Za Shunina becomes \"the villain who wants to destroy the world for no reason\", everything the series had of good simply vanished to be replaced by the most boring and predictable ending possible. I should have seen this a mile off. The childish scientist (portraying scientists like children who are unaware of the social world around them is one of the most appalling misconceptions I know, on part with portraying engineers as socially-retarded nerds and soldiers as sadistic murderers) and the tsundere negotiator (seriously, how did she get that job with a personality like that?!?) were already giving terrible warning signs that the authors behind the story were not taking their plot as serious sci-fi. Also, for reasons I mentioned above, the plot's whole outlook on the problems created by the contact with the anisothropic was naive at best, so it did not come as a surprise for me that the screwed up the series completely by creating that stupid, cliche ending.\\n\r\nFinally, at no point did the CGI animation become pleasant to me. I was always watching the series IN SPITE of the terrible animation. Compare this to something like The Incredibles and you'll understand what I mean. Yes, one is a feature film with a huge budget. But honestly, I don't care. If you're going to make it CGI, that's what you should go for. American CGI TV series are also terrible, for the same reasons: stiff character movement and constantly bland and unconvincing facial expressions. Kado was the only good thing on the animation side, and the only thing that should have been CGI.\\n\r\nMusic: forgettable. I really can't recall a single song or theme from the anime after watching it.\\n\r\nSound design: good, but nothing exceptional. The sound is not a truly integral part of the story, but merely \"sound effects\". For comparison, see how the sound design is incredibly meaningful and integral to the narrative in Serial Experiments Lain, where even the sudden moments of silence have a profound impact in a scene.\\n\r\nAs a whole: very mediocre and totally forgettable series. Nothing to hate or make a fuss about. It had potential as an idea and wasted it because most writers of anime are not good at writing actual sci-fi (Shin Sekai Yori being the one notable exception of the past then years, as far as I know - after all, Gundam is not sci-fi, just as Star Wars is not sci-fi, but rather space opera).",

            "content": "*spoiler alert*\r\nIt's truly been a while since I've seen such a spectacular trainwreck.\r\n8 episodes of a slow-burn sci-fi with first contact, politics, technology and negotiations become shitty fantasy drivel. The way the genre shift and twists are executed is so terrible I don't even know what this author was trying to accomplish. \r\nI mean if a romance was going to be the main point/solution instead of you know science and negotiations then maybe they should have spend some time developing that instead of spending 2/3 of the shows building the mcs' relationship only to destroy it in one scene so a character with like 3scenes in that 2/3rd can win. And you know what's funny? It doesn't even matter why she's right. Naturalism and fuck yeah humanity is right by default because look the other guy spilled his spaghetti, snapped and went yandere so you have no choice now. Besides conveniently enough she's a cute mahou shoujo so why wouldn't you pick her? What are you gay? That's obviously not the right answer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd more importantly I sure hope you didn't think you think for once we'd avoid the evil technology/progress cliche. Or that we'd actually solve things by talking which by the way is literally Shindo and Saraka's job and they are supposed to be awesome at it. Because tough luck, I'm returning all the alien gifts and here have some fucking energy swords, disney healing kisses, and a shonen final battle with a deus ex machina instead. You know if it weren't for that end I might have accepted that mess but it was far too wacky and shits on every point this show seemed to be trying to make.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously is Shindo a high-functioning sociopath? Did someone play too much fe14? Did that hack of an author just wanted a hax mahou shojo in a school uniform and then wrote everything else? Is the right answer being a xenophobe/technophobe? Was this merely a terribly elaborate prank against that bully of a seiyuu? \\n\\n\r\nIn any case if you want a gary-stu with a harem ntr ing evil aliens with magic watch an actual battle harem since they are usually honest about what they are from the start instead of pretending to be serious.",

            "content": "After hearing lots of praise for Seikaisuru Kado, I finally decided to give it a go. And I was not disappointed... well at least for the first few episodes. Everything started going downhill after the second half. The anime introduced itself as a spectacular sci-fi mature type of anime; however, it trailed off and the sci-fi aspect was completely lost, in my opinion, when the romance was forcibly put into the anime. I especially hate it when a random side character is given a 'main role' for the sake of advancing the plot. \r\n[Story] -- 5: Mediocre \r\nSpeaking of the plot, as I mentioned before,I had a hard time following it after a few episodes. There were so many plot holes and so many questions left unanswered. If the anime had gone more into the sci-fi genre, instead of delving into the shitty characters, a lot of the questions may have been explored and even answered. That would have left us with a greater understanding of the anisotropic. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters] [Spoilers] -- 2: Dreadful\\n\r\nThe characters were atrocious in this anime. The crazy scientist girl was literally there because 'plot convenience.' The creator[s] never even considered giving her any development as a character. Then we have that guy who's a part of the media - again, plot convenience. They were only there to spread the Sansa - they merely existed for the Sansa and that's pretty much it. Then we have Hanamori and Saraka. I don't even know why Hanamori is there. He got so little screen time, that I'm surprised I still remember his name. Saraka is also there for the plot convenience. Like, Shindo got to know that girl for like a few days, and then they fall in love? This bullshit romance between Saraka and Shindo resulting in the disgusting ending, which gives me more reasons to hate Saraka. She became a main character in fucking 3 episodes. She is most definitely the worst of all the characters. Then we have zaShunina, who is lovable and is comparable to a child who is still understanding the ways of the world. Then they just HAD to make zaShunina the bad guy. You have no idea how big of a mistake that was. The anime could have gone in SO many directions! We could have seen much more. This type of anime doesn't need a bad guy to continue the story. There were already many options from the start. What if Shindo had agreed to go to the anisotropic with zaShunina? What if there was a different objective or a different \"right answer?\" What if the Wams were actually distributed to the other countries? What if the Sansa did not have it's same effect through the television and the only way was for one to see it for him/herself  in real life? The anime could have explored all sorts of questions, and I bet there are more.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] -- 7: Good\\n\r\nOh no! It is 3-D animation, the enemy of anime! Honestly, that's what I thought at first as well. However, I got used to it after a few episodes, and I must admit, the visuals were pretty nice. But even after watching Seikaisuru Kado, I still dislike the appearance of 3-D animation in anime...\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 7: Good\\n\r\nNothing much to say here. The voice actors did a great job, and the OSTs were average. Not the best, not the worst. (Did not mention the opening/ending because I did not listen to them.)\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 4: Decent\\n\r\nI did look forward to each episode, whether it be because I was legitimately looking forward to the episode or because I was looking forward to shitting on it.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 5: Mediocre\\n\r\nIt's meh. Just another anime with great potential gone wrong. Adding everything up, it's just average. Nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\n[SHOULD YOU WATCH?]\\n\r\nNo. Unless you're a sucker for forced romance and sci-fi anime gone wrong.\\n\\n\r\n***Thank you for reading. I will appreciate any feedback, since it is my first time writing a review.***\\n",

            "content": "Ah This show, I thought this might be the one show that would prove to me that Toei as an animation studio isn't as bad as I thought it was, after all, every reboot/sequel of a show they've done recently has looked bottom of the barrel cheap (with sailor moon crystal season 3 being a weird exception) and their only good shows this past decade only make up for looking cheap with impeccable or eccentric art design and directing (kyousugiga, Mononoke) so when i see there first real attempt at a 3d show actually look decent I had some hope. add that to the showspremise of a more serious first contact with higher beings science fiction story and you got yourself an interesting show with some potential. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about what ruined the show in detail Ill talk about what grabbed my attention about this show in the first place. questioning the ideas of certain human concepts like war, the formation of borders and countries, and the gap between developed and impoverished nations from an outsiders perspective is inherently interesting. This begs the question from that outsider \"if humanity is capable of being the dominant species why isn't it as a species able to put aside their interests as nations and unify as a world nation capable of solving world problems more efficiently?\". It also asks of whether help from an outside source to artificially kick-start human productivity through alien technology is indeed even the right move or would our reliance on it be harmful should it ever just vanish out of thin air as well as the ethics of tampering with the natural state of the world as it stands and just letting humanity progress at its own pace. \\n\r\nNow aside from a lot of technobabble about the devices used to raise these questions, this show does at the very least a good job of getting the viewer to think about this type of subject matter. Add to that very adult characters and the tone of the show staying serious and morally ambiguous for the first 9 episodes and you got yourself a good thought provoking type of show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunatly the last three episodes ruin the whole idea of what the show was building towards and instead throws away all interesting discussion and intrigue the show could have had as mentioned by other reviewers, In favor of out of nowhere deus ex machinas, little to no setup to some of the more dramatic moments and plot twists, and terrible writing that throws out the serious tone and gray morality in favor of creating a contrived as hell scenario for a \"humans are good/outsiders are bad\" type of conflict. And to top it all off the show doesn't have the guts to stick with whatever impact the new technologies introduced could have on the world long term so it just hits a magic reset button to make people incapable of using any of it or interact with the people who made them so it basically wastes your time as viewer by not really exploring these ideas deeper or predicting how humanity would really progress with the advanced tech and plays it too safe.  Because of that the whole buildup of what \"The Right Answer\" was in the title was thrown away so it fell flat on it's face. \\n\\n\r\nIn short this show is a waste of time with OK 3d CGI but in a couple of years even the CGI will be dated and I don't recommend anybody to watch this only to be disappointed.",

            "content": "(Not spoiler-free)\r\nAt episode 0-2 I thought this anime had great potential. Shindo is an extremely relatable and well-rounded character, though I would have liked to know about his personal background. What really pulled the enjoyment factor up for this anime for me was watching ZaShunina grow and become steadily more human, and at the same time, Shindo's relationship with him.\r\n In the middle episodes there is a lot of 'let's stall this as far as possible' which really is not the way to go for a 12 ep arc - probably why the plot twist seems to have come OUT OF NOWHERE. There is adecided lack of relationship development between Saraka and Shindo, not nearly enough about Kado's inside and Shindo's work inside, and a very over-simplified summary of the benefits of the devices to the world. \\n\\n\r\nI would have liked more international meetings, and maybe side-plots to introduce the effect of the devices on humanity. Instead, though we're talking about important concepts such as giving power to humanity which they could possibly abuse, you're forced to go through Shindo meeting his mother, a camera guy getting recruited by a Google anime knockoff brand and a festival where ZaShunina buys a turtle. I think the producers need to set a tone - and stick to it. There is a lot of confusion about the general direction the poorly developed plot takes. Personally, I hate the canon ship and I think it would have been much better and more realistic to leave Saraka as a human who is mildly irritating. Not nearly enough physics/ actual serious science - this could have been thrilling. If another studio had produced it or it had better funding, no doubt it could have been a smashing success like Steins;Gate.",

            "content": "Saikasuru Kado. What can I say? This is easily the most disappointing show of the year. The ending of the show really messes so much up it isn\u2019t fun. It has been a while that I have seen a show or read a book that started out this good and then crashed and burned like Kado. It is even worse than \u201cLangoliers\u201d by Stephen King which created an amazing atmosphere a great mystery and had a laughable ending. Why is it worse? Because in the case of Kado, it was not just that the ending was weak. This was Donna of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d.  \r\nAnimation\u2013 7\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t very fond of the CGI-only animation but it actually sort of worked here because of the otherworldliness of Yaha and Kado and the CGI emphasised their alien qualities nicely. In the case of the human characters, it would have been great if they had been animated the old-fashioned way. Maybe a mix of both with a heavier emphasis on CGI would have been good but since the CGI was actually pretty well done a 7 it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nKado is about First Contact and in the beginning, the show does so many things right that I could have shed a tear. I wondered why it was compared with \u201cArrival\u201d. They are not really similar but both \u201cArrival\u201d and \u201cKado\u201d are about communication and language and so much more. It debates the pros and cons of natural to sudden technological advancement. How would the media handle a first encounter with aliens? How about the political and economic impact of technology that is so far removed from what we know? The show was smart, the pacing was great, the ideas were fascinating but halfway through something changed. Maybe they ran out of ideas, maybe some people wanted to have a say. I don\u2019t know what happened but whatever it was, it was not good and the show suffered massively and received a very stupid deus ex machina ending. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes most of the episodes, especially the first arc (8 episodes), the show would receive either a 9 or 10 but that ending deserves nothing less than a big fat zero, so all in all 5. This is why this show is so frustrating. It had so much potential but Yaha, who had been cool and composed suddenly became downright human and emotional. I adored the developing relationship (in a way undefinable \u2013 Friendship? Love? Something more profound?) between Shindou and Yaha and in my eyes, it was not just a simple friendship and then the finale happened. Talk about badly handled. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 10\\n\r\nThe music is utterly gorgeous and it is my favourite score of the year so far (and this also includes scores like \u201cMary Magdalene\u201d by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannson). \u5ca9\u4ee3\u592a\u90ce already did a great job with A.I.C.O. but outdid himself with the help of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The OP and ED did not only fit perfectly with the images but are also very, very beautiful. There is even a beautiful operatic Aria included (\u30e4\u30cf\u30af\u30a3\u30b6\u30b7\u30e5\u30cb\u30ca\u4f1d ~Diva Version~). Do buy it. It is totally worth it!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6\\n\r\nAgain a solid ten in the beginning but with an ending like that- 6 is generous. \\n\\n\r\nI hate this show. I love this show. I loved it so much but I hate it for being such a massive let-down at the end. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I can say I am confident in my current opinions on this series. I'll skip over my personal praise and jump to the individual aspects of this series so far however.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI am a writer, and am pursuing writing as a very possible career, and have watched quite a bit of anime so far. It is what I pull a lot of inspiration and lessons from, and has been a great way of improving my quality and skills as a writer. Taking in this series and what it has to offer, from just the episodes so far I've learneda great lesson in writing; adding uniqueness to your story that has not been seen in other people's stories before. This may be a spoiler, but what occurs in Kado when the cube makes contact is not what you'd expect, which is massive destruction or the emergence of aliens or robots or any other evil foreign entity, but rather the cube setting down almost perfectly and a human emerge which, so far, has not been hostile whatsoever. Breaking barriers of what the viewer expects is great and usually tough to achieve as a writer, but so far Mado Nozaki has done an amazing job with the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is actually a surprising score for myself to give, as I generally hate CG/CGI animations, although I've completely lost concern and care for the CGI in Kado so far. The backgrounds and other objects aside from the humans all appear to not be CG/CGI, at least to me, and the humans actually blend very well with them. Also, did I mention how stunning the cube, Kado, has been so far? Its shifting colors and movements are, as another reviewer stated, eye candy, and I've enjoyed every chance I've got to look at Kado. Japan's scenery is also portrayed very well in the series so far, and we have yet to see if the series will extend further to other countries/areas.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI love music and sound effects in anime, and the music is nothing short of a masterpiece so far. The opening gives off eerie yet majestic vibes, and the singer expresses the greatness of what Kado: The Right Answer has to offer. The ending, despite many skipping over it, is actually very good also, and you can even hear the Japanese oriental sounds mixed in near the beginning (pardon me if I termed that incorrectly). Aside from that, from what we've heard songwise in the series so far, almost all of it has been majestic and attractive to the ears, at least mine, and they've done a fantastic job on the sound effects for Kado, the elements of the world, and even the little things such as echoing footsteps and rolling WAM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nSo far the characters have been all-around great, with not that many cliches, troupes, or copy-paste characters. And there will always be some underlying similarities between how characters act in anime, as we all are humans and similar in our personalities and reactions. But the characters that most stand out to me are the main-main ones, such as Shindou and zaShunina. Shindou has this very stern and down-to-the-point personality, one that we don't normally see as often if at all, probably because it's hard for most writers to execute well. However Mado has done superb with Shindou and his interaction in the world so far, and everything Shindou says or does intrigues me. This is the same with zaShunina also. I expected zaShunina to come to Earth with some evil plan, whether that be direct or underlying, and when that didn't happen I expected him to come to spread or share an insane idea or religious belief, both of which he did not do either. I am closely analyzing zaShunina whenever he says something, and am waiting to find out what his true intentions are if he even has any, which honestly at this point I'm somewhat convinced he's a character type I have never seen in anime or any other form of media for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about all I have for my review, and I do hope it helped. I highly recommend you give this series a try if you have not yet done so, as I believe it truly offers a story and idea that has never been seen in anime yet, at least in my experience of watching it.",

            "content": "Spoiler Free:\r\nI was prepared to give this anime a 9/10 until I hit around episode 9. It managed to raise my expectations extremely high for the better first half- and then it took all of its amazing potential and shattered it. I stopped at episode 10 after seeing the impending train wreck and decided to read summaries of the last two instead of wasting time. \r\nAs a science fiction fan who enjoys the like of Arthur C. Clark and Frank Herbert, the beginning concepts for this anime were right up my alley. They even seemed a bit new - at least, they were something I'dnever seen before. The nature of this series seemed very fresh on the anime scene, breaking a lot of predictability. At least, that's what it seemed it was doing until it totally destroyed the integrity of the entire first half of the show by doing a 180 with its theme and becoming unbearably predictable and shallow (Not really that shallow compared to a lot of anime. Even with its disappointment at the end, it's a decent anime altogether, it's simply the sheer amount of potential this anime wastes that causes me to dislike it particularly.) People who have seen this show - you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThis 180 is the sole thing that ruined the anime for me - a big thing. Other things relating to the overall production seemed decent. I'm not a fan of the animation style, but it's surprisingly easy to get used to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, unless you want to be incredibly disappointed, STOP this anime around episode 8. Duck out while it's still good. Play with the ideas it's presented. If you really like this show from episode 8 and prior, 9 and onward will be nothing more than depressing.\\n",

            "content": "No spoilers, except just one: this show is a spectacular train-wreck. If you like good science fiction, beware: this show begins extremely well but manages to destroy everything it built up and trample on its viewer's expectations in every way imaginable in its final episodes.\r\nAfter hearing that this was an anime that had heavy parallels to Arrival, and watching the first five episodes, the sci-fi buff in me was ecstatic. Here was a mature, well-written and absolutely gorgeous looking and sounding sci-fi anime that was headed in a direction that didn't seem hackneyed. It was thought-provoking and sparked a lot of discussion among the viewership.It was a potential masterpiece, I thought.\\n\\n\r\nBut as the series progressed, anime tropes that had no business appearing in a mature narrative such as this started popping up left and right for no good reason like some rash, creating a very jarring experience, and culminating in an ending that left many wondering how something with so much potential had ended up like this. It became incoherent to the point where one has to wonder whether the author's original vision was altered by others in the creative team to appeal to a larger crowd - one that wouldn't be watching this series in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nStory (3/10): The first half was a solid take on first contact, and the plot was genuinely creative and gripping at the same time. The last quarter was an unmitigated disaster for the most part. I don't think any other show with such a promising beginning has bombed so hard.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8.5/10): Ah, this is something that the plot couldn't touch, and does deserve a favourable mention: the characters and several other parts are in 3DCG, and it pretty much sets an industry standard to how 3DCG should look. At no point did it look awkward or badly animated - on the contrary, some CG-heavy scenes ranged from beautiful to downright jaw-dropping.\\n\\n\r\nSound (8.5/10): Another thing the story could not completely spoil was the soundtrack, which was great. If there is one good thing that came from this show, it's that. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10): Just like the plot, the main characters start out with great promise, but end up getting development that is frankly appalling. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10): This reflects the effect of the ending more than anything - it leaves a very bad taste, especially because the first half was so enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 4/10. Tl;dr: You are probably better off pretending this doesn't exist. That, unfortunately, is the right answer.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 3\r\nSeikaisuru Kado begins with an intriguing premise: An alien arrives on Earth bearing gifts to advance humanity. To ease communication between the alien and the government, a gifted negotiator offers his services. Over time, the alien and negotiator learn about each other and become friends, overcoming their many differences. Meanwhile, the alien's gifts are so vastly powerful and beyond human understanding, that they threaten existing international resource and power relations. Soon, the bigger, more concerning question looms: Why?\r\nThat's a lot to work with, and the first 8-9 episodes actually do quite well in exploring these ideas. However, if you're after intelligent, well-considered, or satisfactoryanswers, you will most likely be disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, \"disappointed\" is the word I'd use to describe my feelings about this series as a whole. Many of the issues raised in earlier episodes are resolved by way of shoehorned deux ex machinas, then explained away in empty words as to sound somehow profound or meaningful. While I understood the reasoning behind the solutions and how they had to be done, there was little-to-no lead-up and foreshadowing, making them seem overly-convenient, and leave no satisfaction in the resolution. In essence, poor execution: It felt as though the writers wrote themselves into a corner, had trouble resolving everything in the space of a few episodes, or handed the reins over to shallow mahou shoujo writers altogether.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nAs a fully CG-based series, Toei did surprisingly well (see: earlier efforts in the sad CG transformation sequences in Sailor Moon Crystal). While it was apparent that impactful action sequences are beyond the reaches of the overly smooth and measured pace of their CG animation, the need itself was rendered obsolete due to the setting and cast of white-collar characters, and it even enhanced the otherworldly quality of the alien. By nature of CG animation, the quality could only be consistent throughout, but overall visual interest is lost through over-reliance on it where there could be better angles or compositions.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI actually remember very little of the background tracks, but since nothing stood out to me as being particularly out-of-place either, I'll give this a pass. The opening and ending themes are actually quite lovely and help conjure a sense of wonder at the vast universe.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nFirst of all, I was very impressed by the variety of character designs; the old and young, physically imposing and frail, big and small, etc... Even the main character doesn't look terribly outstanding, which lends weight to his professional nature. That said, most of the recurring cast are attractive young people, which kind of ruins that thought. I had trouble taking the main girl seriously, for many, many reasons. The alien's design was appropriately strange, and subtly differentiated him as a whole other species, even while taking a human form.\\n\\n\r\nDesign aside, I appreciated the developing relationship between the negotiator and the alien; in particular, the alien's growing attachment to his new friend manifested through subtle glances and not-so-subtle keeping of mementos. The relationship felt believable through their attempts to overcome cultural, linguistic, technological, etc... differences. The love interest, while soundly and reasonably developed as a character, on the other hand, felt lacking in chemistry by comparison, considering her importance in the conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nOn a separate note, for all that the negotiator was set up to be one of the best in his field, he does very... little... negotiating...?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nDespite my enjoyment of earlier episodes, the conclusion was poorly done. I spent episodes 9-12 mostly feeling confused and in disbelief over every nonsensical turn of events, disappointed at the waste of potential, and the waste of my time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5\\n\r\nOnly the first 8 episodes and a few technical aspects manage to redeem this series. Good job effing it up, Toei.",

            "content": "A battle of words and ideas between the finest diplomats of Japan and a being from another dimension that comes from a cube.  \r\nPlease be aware that there are slight spoilers in character analysis and story analysis. \r\nOnce every anime season there is a chance you will encounter an anime that has a premise that is completely new and hasn\u2019t been seen before and one that completely engrosses you in both its setting and story and can keep you entertained until the end. In this case Seikaisuru Kado certainly fits that bill as its one anime that I have yet to get bored offand indeed continues to intrigue me episode by episode. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise behind Seikaisuru Kado is a relative straightforward one but one that is exceedingly rare within the anime industry. When you think of aliens or being from another dimension visiting the planet most people would imagine that ok this is going to be an action anime that focuses on the soldiers pushing the alien back right. Not so in this case. The main premise of this anime is diplomacy and how new technology that is gifted by an alien should be used and viewed and whether is it right for humanity as a race to use it. The combination of Diplomacy between the alien and the people of Japan and their relationship with the countries of the world with regards to the alien and his gifts I felt was interesting as was seeing the effects of the gifts on humanity as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime\u2019s Theme of focusing on diplomacy as well as focusing on the larger picture of humanity as a race and not individual countries I felt was an interesting one and this was one anime that really hooked me in when I saw the trailer for it.\\n\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado\u2019s main story takes place within modem day japan and follows life of Shindou Kojiro a veteran diplomat of the Japanese Governments ministry of foreign affairs who whether by chance or not becomes the first person to meet an alien from another dimension and from there act as the intermediary between him and humanity. The overall story focuses on the negotiation between the alien being ZaShuNina and the government of Japan which is watched by countries around the world and ZaShuNina\u2019s attempt to help humanity by providing certain gifts. \\n\\n\r\nKojiro Shindou \\n\\n\r\nKojiro Shindou voiced by veteran voice actor Hiroaki Miura is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A veteran negotiator from the governments Ministry of foreign affairs Shindou is a calm, collected and composed person that thanks to his many years of service to the ministry has a detailed knowledge of not just how Japanese society works but also how governments and countries around the world work as well. As a result of both his experience and knowledge Shindou is well liked by his co-workers and well respected by them and by his superiors. Apart for being calm and composed which is no doubt his prominent trait Shindou is also a smart man and well versed in making quick decisions after finding out all the information that he needs for a given situation. Shindou seems to be a person that takes great pride in being a diplomat and seems to value the job that he has immensely which is best exemplified by the fact that he\u2019s always eager to see things to an end which indicates that he is also very dutiful as well.  As a result of this personality Shindou is someone that understands how negotiations work on an intimate level and as such he will always try to get the best deal for both sides of one. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s important to note that Shindou also has a softer personality that he shows when he\u2019s not in diplomat mode and is used when he\u2019s interacting with friends and family. Unlike when he\u2019s in diplomatic mode Shindou\u2019s other personality tends to be softer and more respectful but at the same time have less pressure behind his words. In this personality Shindou seems to be a bit of a joker and will often use humor to deal with people that are either too serious, nervous or uptight. This is best seen in his first meeting with Saraka.  As a main character and the main protagonist of the series Shindou develops and forms a relationship with many different characters in the series as part of his new role with his relationship with ZashuNina and Saraka being the most important. Both of these relationships I felt were pretty well done and were built on the most important element that any negotiation would need to have which in this case is trust. Shindou\u2019s relationship with ZaShuNina is arguably one of the cornerstones of this series and forms an important part of the overall plot of the series.\\n\\n\r\n In the beginning of the series Shindou as a result of being on the plane that ZashuNina absorbed was the first human that he encountered and as a result of both ZashuNina\u2019s curious and inquisitive nature and Shindou\u2019s sense of responsibility and adaptability they soon established a bond that is built on understanding and trust. As the series progresses it can be seen that Shindou\u2019s advice and observations are highly valued by ZashuNina and that there was a genuine bond of friendship that had been forged between them. Their relationship from the outside could be seen as something akin to that of a normal friendship though naturally one that transcends the human race. Though as later events occur I do wonder whether this bond was indeed real or not. Still I felt that the relationship between the two and the effect that it had on the overall plot was both well developed and was integrated very well into the main plot. As a character Shindou I felt was an excellent character as despite a veteran diplomat that was accustomed to dealing with fellow humans Shindou was due to his personality able to adapt well to the most unusual of situations and be able to act as the link between the people of Japan and ZashuNina which arguably made him one of the most important person on Earth at the time of the event. At the same time Shindou\u2019s compassionate personality while certainly not on the level of Saraka\u2019s also served as great qualities that ensured that his decisions while logical also ensured that he also thinks of the effects that it will have on normal humans as well. All in all, I felt that Hiroaki Miura really did an excellent job voicing the character of Shindou. \\n\\n\r\nSaraka \\n\\n\r\nSaraka Tsukai voiced by veteran seiyuu Mao Ichimichi of Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio and Digimon Adventure Tri fame is one of the main characters of the series and serves as the main heroine of the series. A negotiator that works for the Japanese governments Ministry of foreign affairs that handles Japan\u2019s relationship with other countries Saraka is an intelligent, fast thinking and composed person that looks and behaves similarly to Shindou. Despite working in the same ministry Saraka and Shindou never met before the events of the plot. Like Shindou Saraka adapts a mask of professionalism when she\u2019s working as a negotiator that is both composed and reserved yet this mask does sometimes break when she\u2019s exposed to situations that resonate with her humorous personality. This aspect of her I felt was quite funny and helps differentiate her with Shindou who rarely laughs. Despite being young Saraka is both earnest and hardworking and treats her duties seriously which indicates how she got to her position and rank at her age. Indeed, while Saraka and Shindou have not met each other before the events of the plot it can be seen that he has at least heard of her. Like Shindou when Saraka is in diplomat mode she tends to be overly serious and uptight at times that manifests in a variety of ways. When under a lot of stress which in the series is actually quite often Saraka\u2019s overly serious personality manifests in the form of lectures to people that tries to remind them how important this is. Rather than reassuring others this seems to have the opposite effect on her which I felt was rather funny. As a result of her uptight personality when dealing with people that have a humorous side to them such as Shindou Saraka can be embarrassed quite easily which has the effect of causing her to look rather cute as she blushes quite heavily when she is. \\n\\n\r\nLike Shindou Saraka\u2019s personality outside of her role as a diplomat is very different to what you will expect from her but the difference here is that in this series Saraka\u2019s personality outside of her role is explored more so than Shindou\u2019s. Saraka\u2019s normal personality is akin to that of a free spirit and is one that loves to learn new things and explore similar to explorers of old and can be said to be similar to an adventurer. As a result of this personally Saraka has a rather interesting view of how evolution and human evolution should be handled that contrasts a great deal with her role in the story. Saraka is of the belief that evolution should be natural and that it should be left to advance at its own pace and not meddled with which contrasts a great deal with the gifts that ZashuNina brings to the table and makes for interesting conversations between her and Shindou. This belief of hers I felt was interesting not just because it serves as the opposite to ZashuNina\u2019s role in the story but also because this kind of belief is not often seen in anime as well. As a result of this belief Saraka is very firm in her belief that human evolution should be left to them and them alone and that they should only advance when they are ready for change. This causes a number of plat developments and revelations in the overall plot that were surprising. Saraka\u2019s determination to protect human dignity that was used as her reason for her beliefs I felt was really appropriate and fitted well with her personality of always putting the needs of humanity first. A prominent trait of Saraka is the fact that she has a great deal of empathy and as a result she is rather sensitive to the feelings and emotions of people around her and as a result she tends to have a more sympathetic view of people that have views that are not in line with what the majority of people think which I think was interesting as it contrasts both the official position and also Shindou\u2019s personality as well. \\n\\n\r\nAs a character Saraka in addition to being the main heroine and female lead also functioned as a contrast to the main character and Protagonist of Shindou and helped in showing him a side of the argument that was different to the logical side of things that he was accustomed to. On his own the character of Shindou though a very capable negotiator was a person that leaned on the side of logic a bit too heavily and as a result it can be said that he did view feelings and the larger picture of the human race as readily as he should. Considering the stakes for the whole race I feel that this is something that he should be more invested in. The addition of Saraka though and her partnership with Shindou as negotiators for both ZashuNina and the government respectively I felt really helped matters as this allowed them to interact more with each other. This had the effect of allowing Saraka to not just share her concerns to Shindou but also allow her to show him the feelings of others as well as the larger picture of the human race that he had missed when he received the job. As a result, this allowed Shindou to both be logical but at the same time more understanding of the feelings and concerns of others and more importantly the concerns for the human race as a whole. All in all, I felt that the character of Saraka was one that was well designed and had a clear defined role in the series. The contrast that she had with Shindou I felt was pretty well done. In a way, I felt that as a character Saraka functioned very similarly to a female version of Shindou though one that had both empathy and a belief that was unique to her. The relationship between Shindou and Saraka is one of the main points in the overall plot of this series and I felt that it was pretty well done. From the beginning of the series it was apparent that between the two there was a great deal of chemistry between the two as both had an equal amount of respect of each other. As the series progresses and both learn more about each other this is only intensified the bond. The idea that both characters changing as both learned more about each other is not anything new but the fact that Shindou learned a to be a bit more empathic and more human thanks to Saraka\u2019s advice and her beliefs I felt was done quite well and ultimately helped in ensuring that he had the conviction to stand against ZaShuNina when the time came. The idea that the two as a result of their shared beliefs actually becoming a couple was something that I thought was executed pretty well. \\n\\n\r\nThe true nature of Saraka however I felt was a pretty good twist and one that came at a really opportune time with the plot line. I felt that Mao Ichimichi really did an excellent job in portraying the character of Saraka. \\n\\n\r\nZa Shunina \\n\\n\r\nZaShuNina whose full name is Yaha Kui ZashuNina who in this series is voiced by veteran voice actor Takuma Terashima of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei and Log horizon fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main antagonist of the series. A being from a separate space time that arrived on Earth on a cube shaped object in a most dramatic fashion ZashuNina despite looking like a human being is in fact an alien. ZashuNina adapts two different persona\u2019s that he makes use of in the series which is markedly different from each other though certain traits from one side do transfer to the other side. In his default persona that is used from the start of the series ZashuNina is a calm and quiet person that seems to adapt a neutral stance with regards to his relationship with humanity. Though powerful it can be seen that at this point in his personality ZashuNina acts somewhat like a child as still learning about humanity and its customs which I felt was interesting and kept it within this anime\u2019s main theme of diplomacy. As the series progresses and as ZaShuNina meets new people and learns more about humanity via dialogue and books and media his knowledge of humanity grows and from there the plot moves into the gifts that he is willing to provide to humanity. Though stemming from his second personality and his overall goal the gifts that ZaShuNina provides to humanity do stem from the many limits and struggles that his observations of humanity has told him and these gifts I felt were pretty well thought out and designed as each was created solely to address one issue that is dire to humanity. From a civilian point of view, it\u2019s easy to see why people want to use these gifts so much and why countries around the world are so willing to integrate these into the workings of their countries. I guess its human nature that they will believe everything that someone will say if that person appears to be benign to them and at the same able to help the race advance. \\n\\n\r\nZaShuNina\u2019s second personality was revealed near the end of the series and was anything but benign and indeed was a personality that I didn\u2019t really expect him to have. In this personality which I would imagine is his true nature ZashuNina in a departure from his first personality is a calculating, determined and ruthless person that\u2019s also deceitful and well versed at subterfuge. While his initial personality can be described to be that of a child this new personality can be seen to be that of an adult and a scheming one as well. In this personality ZashuNina is very determined to enact his own master plan and his own designs for humanity even if it meant that it will cost them dearly in terms of life. Indeed, from ZashuNina\u2019s initial personality only his hunger for knowledge which can be said to be his prominent trait is transferred from that personality to this one. In the beginning of the series though I did have suspicions that ZaShuNina would be the main villain for the series the gradual transformation from a benign alien that was seen as a great inventor by humanity to a villain that was dead set on uplifting humanity so that they can provide him with knowledge was so unexpected that it shook even me. \\n\\n\r\nThe character of ZaShuNina I felt was a really interesting character and made a pretty good villain for the series. The character of ZaShuNina I felt was a very well-designed character that underwent great changes in his behavior and personality as the series went on. Indeed, the changes were such that it\u2019s almost as if there actually two people that have the same name but yet differing personalities in them. Due to this it was not easy to see what his motivations and aims were in the series until his true plan was revealed which I think was the point of this.  I felt that Takuma Terashima really did an excellent job of portraying the character of ZaShuNina and that this character contributed greatly to how excellent this story was. \\n\\n\r\nKanata Shinawa \\n\\n\r\nKanata Shinawa voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Rie Kugimiya is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Shindou and Saraka\u2019s allies in the series. A genius level scientist that works at one of the many research labs that the government manages and oversees Kanata is despite her young age an excellent scientist that apart from being smart is also hyperactive and positive and indeed can spend her days researching new things without a care in the world. Though eccentric and tending to get way too immersed in her analysis\u2019s Kanata is someone that is more than willing to help others if the request itself is something that hasn\u2019t been done before. Kanata is someone that loves to challenge the unknown. While certainly eccentric and easily excited Kanata\u2019s main personality trait is her determination to figure out and determine how something actually works and when combined with her childish wonder at new things this is something that actually makes her pretty endearing. While representing the science side of the story Kanata due to her positive nature is also able to cheer people up with her attitude which I felt was pretty funny to see. Though young it can be seen that her superiors and fellow scientists at the lab trust her immensely due to her intellect and determined nature. Though only a support character I felt that Rie Kugimiya really did a great job at portraying the character of Kanata and that she brought not just intelligence but also determination to the field that proves that human intelligence is also something that should not be underestimated.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nWith regards to the art that was used for this series I felt that the environments that used and shown in the series was pretty well done with the interior of Kado being especially impressive. The character designs for the characters in this series I felt was also pretty well done with ZaShuNina\u2019s design despite taking the form of a human also looked like a hybrid that\u2019s between a human and an alien. The other environments such as Haneda airport, the Diet building and Saraka and Shindou\u2019s home towns I felt were also well done. With regards to the animation because this series isn\u2019t actually a true action anime the animation in the series is focused more on the showing of how the gifts actually work which I felt was well done and showed just how powerful they were. It wasn\u2019t until much later in the series that the anime featured combat scenes and I felt that these were done pretty well especially the fights between Saraka and ZaShuNina and the final fight in the end. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening and ending themes for the series being especially strong. The opening theme for the series which was called Tabiji was sung by the character of Saraka Tsukai through her seiyuu Mao Ichimichi and I felt that this song along with its visuals did a pretty good job of setting the mood for the series while also showing the evolution of humanity through its visuals. The ending theme for this series which was called Eien No Kotae which was sung by Haruca had a more positive tone to it that for some reason had a calming presence to it. Individual scene music I felt was pretty well done throughout the series. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for the series I felt was excellent throughout the series with each of the characters that were featured in the series being portrayed to the best of their respective seiyuu\u2019s ability. In particular the characters of Koujirou Shindou, Saraka Tsukai and Yaha Kui ZaShuNina who were portrayed by Hiroaki Miura, Mao Ichimichi and Takuma Terashima respectively I felt did an excellent job portraying their respective characters. In addition the characters of Kanata, Takumi Gonnou and the Japanese prime minister Kouzou Inutaba who was portrayed by Rie Kugimiya, Takuya Kirimoto and Hiroshi Naka I felt also did a great job portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall, I thought that Kado the right answer as it is called in the west was a pretty good anime that was actually interesting and indeed was something that really surprised me because it provoked a lot of interesting questions into the world that we live in. it\u2019s not every day that an anime would feature so many real-world questions and challenges inside it though and use that as part of its main plot. The strong points that made Kado the right answer such an excellent anime in my opinion was its interesting theme and the fact that it made use of real world problems as part of it, strong story that provoked questions about the current world, excellent characters, Excellent animation and voice acting. \\n\\n\r\nFirst thing to address is the theme of the show. The main theme of the show apart from contact with an alien race also lies inside the realm of negotiation and diplomacy. At the same time, another thing that was part of this series theme was the gifts that the main villain provided that was designed to help humanity as a race overcome some of the challenges that they currently face. The inclusion of real world problems like energy, time and transporting objects I felt was really interesting and the way that it was revealed to humanity was both intelligent and well done as the thought that any of the three problems that beset them and limit them can be dealt with these gifts will surely find a lot of people who is willing to use them. The main theme of this series however is undoubtedly that of diplomacy and negotiation which I felt was interesting and was a well-designed move on the creator\u2019s part. In animes that feature contact with beings from either parallel dimension such as this one or aliens from other planets or galaxies the line largely lies with either fighting a war to defend the planet or forcefully integrate their resources into your own race with diplomacy largely being ignored or at least seeing limited use. As such it was actually pretty refreshing to see that this anime\u2019s main theme while also dealing with aliens makes use of diplomacy as its main theme. Though like most people I have limited knowledge on the concept of diplomacy and negotiation I felt that depiction that negotiation is built on a degree of trust that was shown between Shindou and ZashuNina was really well done. Watching the two of them gradually learn about each other and at the same time cooperate to create gifts that would benefit humanity as a race while also forging a bond built on trust was something that was nice to see and begs the question why isn\u2019t this concept used more in anime. I felt that the diplomacy side of things in the anime was pretty well done and was a pretty accurate portrayal of how negotiations between parties actually take place even though this party to which Saraka and Shindou talk with is far from anything that both have encountered in their careers. A real game changer there lol. \\n\\n\r\nThe overall story of the series is another strong point and was one that I felt was done really well. In line with the main theme of the series the overall storyline focuses on first the introduction of the alien being to the world via his most dramatic entrance on to the planet by literally landing on one of Japan\u2019s busiest airports followed by his gradual reveal of what he was and what he represented. The gradual evolution of ZaShuNina\u2019s role from that of an unknown life form to that of a major celebrity and then to his reveal of the gifts that he is willing to gift to humanity I felt was pretty well done.  The concept of using the relationship that he has forged with the government of japan and use this to determine the challenges that face the race as a whole I felt was interesting and played alone with the theme of diplomacy as diplomacy and negotiation is always focused on understanding what the other party needs and providing what they want versus what you yourself want from the. The gradual transformation of this relationship as well as ZaShuNina as a character I felt was pretty well done. Arguably the transformation of ZaShuNina from a benign alien being to one that proved to be a scheming and manipulative alien being that had his own nefarious plan was also well done as was the twist of Saraka\u2019s identity as well. Indeed, transformation and twists also changed the dynamic of the story near the end but in a good way I think. One thing about the overall story that really interested me though was the fact that ZaShuNina\u2019s entrance and the effects that he has is not limited to Japan on its own and indeed affects humanity as a whole. As a result, when deciding on his next moves ZaShuNina and Shindou had to consider the larger effects that bind the world namely its structure. In the world that we live in its easy to see that even as a race humanity is not united entity and that we are divided in both culture, countries and borders that are unique to each country. Though logically it can be said that ZaShuNina and Shindou could have used international organisations like the UN to get the gifts to the people of various countries there also lies the next problem. Humanity as a race is as diverse as a rainbow that while also giving us strength and unity also creates problems like greed and control and points to the fact can these governments and organisations really get the gifts to the people and not hog them for themselves. Its issues like this that really make the story worth investing in as it provokes some really interesting views on the world that we live in. With regards to this question I loved how they actually ended up bypassing them entirely and solving the problem their way.  The true purpose and plan of ZaShuNina\u2019s however doesn\u2019t come into play until much later in the series but it was done in such a way that it really could be said to be one of the best twists that I seen in an anime for a long time. The clash of ideas and convictions that served as the main plot in that part of the series I felt was pretty well done and loved how Saraka and Shindou\u2019s relationship as well as their shared beliefs were used as the main plot here. The clash of ideas between them and ZaShuNina was something that I was looking forward too and was something that was excellently done. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a number of things that I felt really stood out in this series with the first being how well thought out and how well executed both the twists in the story and the plans to counter them were created. A great example of the latter is the last plan that Shindou and Saraka used to finally put a stop to ZaShuNina in the end. The thought that they had made use of the same tech that he himself had created for his plan to engineer his destruction was funny and had no small amount of irony to it as well. The ending fight which led into the ending itself I felt was pretty well done and demonstrated the fact that when humanity and the anisotropic being work together they can even beat someone as formidable as ZaShuNina. Though the cost of victory was indeed high I felt that as a race humanity can still learn to advance but at a suitable pace and not losing sight of what makes them human. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a while since I seen an anime that in addition to having an excellent theme and story as well as excellent characters and voice acting was able to provoke some really interesting questions that I had never once thought off.  All in all, Kado the right answer was really one of the best animes for this season because it was intelligent and made use of real world issues in a way that only served to enhance its main plot line. The core lesson for Kado the right answer is naturally that while advancement in tech is important whats more important that that is that we should never lose sight of our own unique identity that makes us human when doing it. And probably not trust every alien that shows up on the planet as well. \\n\\n\\n",

Universal communication/clarity - toward understanding\r\n1. Endless power source\r\n2. Resources & technology un-restricting living\r\n3. Un-breakable food supply\r\n4. Plentiful water supply.\r\n5. Goal for exploration & progress of interests (ones not of control)\r\n(So far 0-1 have been accomplished -rest are just logical)\\n\\n\r\nJapan is picked for its abundance of 'Heart' - plentiful & communicable, to relay offered assistance in above.\\n\\n\r\nIf true, once money, control, programmed differences {inadvertently Kado is a singular god yet no god... so who is his creator?}, needs, misunderstanding & disparity are rendered to no real consequence ... will humanity behave well? (love, fight & fight for love?) How governing is the flip-side of love (hate)?\\n\r\nAll will change. \\n\\n\r\nOffered a perfect solution or hope of many, can societal habit or survival even once obsolete be relearned?\\n\\n\r\nA proffered dream, yes people will take yet will they give too?\\n\r\nOnly the heart of each, of all, will tell.\\n\\n\r\nI look forward to seeing this show develops :)\\n\\n\r\n- - - - -      Loving this show; so:                -Additional - \\n\\n\r\nI continue & may surmise at end, spoilers will now be somewhat unavoidable\\n\\n\r\nEpisode  04:\\n\\n\r\nThe right answer ((( - is never easy; even with it, many will oppose forever out of fear However the unimaginable dream from real restraints can be achieved with the right people involved. :)  We only hold ourselves back.\\n\r\nStill impressed, well thought & envisioned - production values are very worthy (music 8-9 art 8, voice 9)\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6:\\n\\n\r\nVisually again the artwork is mesmerising around Kado, its movement was stunning. \\n\r\nMusically the background music is both apt, fresh & evocative, employed strategically well. This is a production of value.\\n\\n\r\nIn the story line elements of helping humanity to be better/optimal along with heart/compassion sit well till the end of this episode. A question of the entities intent and existential relationship to Kado, to us is brought up along with the disquieting thought 'humanity will not need to sleep'.  \\n\r\nIt could be useful but does this mean not able to sleep? If so will we be human anymore without our ability to dream? \\n\r\nHave we now a hint of a darker consequence for humanity? Does the all powerful entity wish to help as he sees fit or turn us more into something like him? \\n\\n\r\nTo answer this double edged caution we need to watch more, this series certainly keeps you comming back and wondering....'what will develope next?'\\n\r\nNicely done.  \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 6.5 = Recap\\n\\n\r\nEpisode 7:\\n\\n\r\nThis show gets very interesting & without too drastic a cliffhanger, though a mild one at the end of this it is more Intrigue.\\n\r\nI will aim to keep this short as these episodes each have plenty to think about/enjoy. \\n\r\nI am back rooting for Kado after episode 6's worrying end. We can sleep if wished & still sleep elsewhere (trying no to place too many spoilers).  It shows the mind behind this story keeps revealing a different aproach & challenges.\\n\r\nTotally refreshing. Yet as indicated... are we ready? \\n\r\nSo far the 'Right answer' has been implemented in a cordial & revolutionary way; each episode a gift. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 8:\\n\\n\r\nGlad there is now a convincing voice for dissent - good or bad, the idea is too strong to leave running riot. The Sansa, what would you choose? \\n\r\nHumanity fears change whilst dreams of progress & free advancement. It happens as quick as you want but without our contemplation. Now there is a third gift spoken as the fourth? We worry again as the word destruction tantalises. \\n\r\nThis series does not disappoint.\\n\r\nAs above - we are dealing now with No.s  0, 2 & 5.\\n",

I didn't expect this anime would have been as good as it was and at least for the first 75% of the series I thought the show was very consistent.\r\nThe way how the story was constructed along with its premise, allowed the show to have a great base from where the story could go in a multitude of directions. The direction the show eventually went wasn't one that I personally got a lot of satisfaction from but it was still to the point whereoverall the anime still felt enjoyable.\\n\r\nThe art is a blend between 2D/3D and surprisingly I thought that it was handled extremely well. There wasn't many instances where I thought that the animation suffered because of the use of the 3D. Kudos to Toei Animation in that regard.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was phenomenal and I thought that it was able to enhance many moments from the show.\\n\r\nThe characters were great although in the final moments of the series, the way certain characters were developed could have been different in my personal opinion. In the end certain elements of the show felt a bit rushed but it didn't detract too much from my overall feeling of the anime.\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado is a anime with an interesting premise and I thought that it did a very good job on delivering on that premise.\\n",

Art for alien parts is eye-candy; terrestrial, ordinary, at least by comparison.  Characters have actual character but it's too soon to know what if any development will occur.  I have some concerns about the alien being too powerful and too benevolent, but further plot developments may put  twists into the initial situation -- I like what I've seen so much that an original twist or two might even be in store.(By 'original' I mean not something like a simple good/bad flip.)",

            "content": "Note: This review contains spoilers. Also, don't pay too much attention to the rating I gave here.\r\nNegotiation. Getting what's in your interest is the goal of negotiations. But defeating your opponent and temporarily gaining what you want will always come back to bite you in the long term. What's best for you is giving both parties something in their interest. That sounds easy, but it's extremely difficult in fact.\r\nThere isn't just one answer, for one thing. We aren't God. We'll never know what was right and what was the right answer for our whole life. But, even if we don't know, we just have tokeep looking.\\n\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado features Kojirou Shindo, a Japanese negotiator working for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, encountering Yaha-kui zaShunina, a godlike existence presented as an anisotropic being coming from outside the universe. Thematically speaking, this series is about the meeting of two existences (Humans and Anisotropic being), two different levels of technology, from how will try to interact with each other up to how one existence will influence the other.\\n\r\nOn the one hand, there is Humanity being confronted to an upper being, overwhelmed by the technology of the anisotropic they get their hand on with zaShunina's offerings on multiple levels. On the other hand, there is zaShunina, representing the anisotropic beings, is interested in Humans and all the information they represent, being their mean of communicating, how they react due to his appearance, and try to act as a human to understand them (4th episode when he's reading for example). It's revealed he's trying to give humans a sense of the anisotropic also for his own good.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise of Seikaisuru Kado is attractive due to its attempt to confront both parts on an ideological debate rather than a threatening approach. At first, the story depicts how Shindo acts as a negotiator between zaShunina and humanity since he agrees with zaShunina's goal of making the mankind advance. He ends up becoming the representative of the anisotropic being to present and rephrase zaShunina's idea for the rest of the world so that a mutual understanding can be set up.\\n\r\nThe first part of the show (~8 episodes) resolves around mankind confronted to the discovery of new and unknown technologies. But getting your hand on a new technology ain't that simple, and especially with an unknown one. It makes you raise questions as the legitimacy of using it (Tools ain't good or evil, only their users are. Should we change the society to rely on something we don't understand yet?), its impact on the world, be it at an economical level (with the Wam), or at a societal and psychological level (with the Sansa). \\n\r\nConfronting to those questions, three points of view are depicted between zaShunina, Shindo and Saraka. zaShunina believes that accepting those technologies and spreading them as soon as possible is the right answer. Tsukai Saraka is totally opposed to zaShunina's ideology as she believes humans should progress \"naturally\", by themselves, and not by forcing it. Humanity have to be ready to accept such an evolution. Between the two of them lies Shindo. He's not opposed to a sudden evolution of the world. As a negotiator, he seeks what should benefit humans. He weights up the pros and cons and act on what he thinks to be the best solution. In episode 0, he proves himself [to us] to be able to solve a problem by suggesting an idea leading to a better outcome, and that he doesn't fear the concept of evolution.  \\n\r\nMedia is also a strong element in this first part as it's present as the tool to bypass governments decisions (be it with the Japanese conference or Setten) by letting the people made their own choice. It's a tool praised by zaShunina himself as he believed that everyone should think for themselves as what's supposed to be good or evil. Media happened to have a greater influence than politicians since it's the way they used to \"force\" the knowledge to spread regardless of the governments' will. (As an aside, the first episode of Black Mirror gave an interesting idea of the impact of media.)\\n\\n\r\nThe second part of the show (eps 9-12) is about zaShunina being influenced by humans and how his interested got redirected from mankind to Shindo. zaShunina being more and more human is not something unusual since it already started some episodes ago. In addition to act as one, zaShunina displayed emotions since the end of the 6th episodes, be it with its facial expressions who changed from its original stern one and the use of obscure concepts such as like and dislike (episode 7). The last episode completely confirms this change with zaShunina being sad, angry and surprised (and even the two last ones at the same time), etc. I wouldn't go so far as to say zaShunina got corrupted by human's nature, but the fact its personality changed in contact to Shindo and him looking disinterested from humanity gaining a sense of the anisotropic is what made this second part interesting.\\n\r\nWhile the first part of the show was about mankind interacting with an anisotropic being, the second is focused on Shindo confronting zaShunina as individuals. zaShunina beaks off the talks with Shindo when he refuses to come with him to the anisotropic. Shindo is no longer a negotiator between the humans and the anisotropic being, but the one zaShunina was showing affection and the one he wanted to bring outside the universe. As for Shindo, zaShunina ain't simply an anisotropic being, but a friend for him. A friend he will put his life on the line to try to correct him or else, he will stay in the wrong. Their confrontation represents both their disagreement as individuals/friends (or more for zaShunina) and as an anisotropic being and a human negotiator.\\n\r\nIn episode 10, it is mentioned the problem lied in zaShunina wanting to reach the one right answer with humanity by bringing them to the anisotropic so they won't die (as a species) billion years latter while the humans won't accept to perform such a sacrifice because it's also a part of a human life to live the best they can in the time they are given. Similarly to episode 0, Shindo ends up satisfying the two parts by proving the two existences could evolve in a way zaShunina didn't even consider.\\n\r\nIn the end, with the disappearance of zaShunina along with Kado, the anisotropic technology stop working. It's also a warning about the backlash of wanting to rely on something you don't master or develop yourself as the question was raised earlier. To complete the conclusion of this story, the series ends up explaining what matters the most is to know you can  still advance farther and to set a goal to lead your way.\\n\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado got its pros and cons. You may not like how the story turned out, especially for the second part and the twist they choose to do. Still, this series was worth being watched for all the thematics it grasped even if a lot of idea could have been more developed.\\n\r\nSeikaisuru Kado doesn't provide the right answer, it makes yourself pondering at what the right answer should be for all the problem it raises. After all, to constantly think is the only right answer in the world.",

            "content": "This anime story is similar to the recent hollywood movie \"The Arrival\". The anime so far looks interesting. I think the CG in the anime is great for non-living things but human animation is still jerky and robotic. But i think its a lot better than other anime with CG like the recent Berserk. \r\nThe differences between the hollywood movie \"The Arrival\" and the anime is the shape/form of the technology the alien species transfer. In the movie the alien gifts humans a language that can alter time and stuff where as in the anime it is more of a solid tangible looking thing calledKado.\\n\\n\r\nOverall the anime looks very interesting and the art is superb especially the fractals in the Kado technology. I think we should watch this anime. I watched till episode 3 and my score for this anime is 9/10. 9 because of the slightly lame looking animated people.",

            "content": "Disappointing.\r\nIf I were to describe this anime it one word, it would be disappointing. What started off as a beautiful political journey pushed by science and philosophy, within episodes became generic and predictable.\r\nStory: 4\r\nAs said before, the story idea and story itself were fantastic. The pace was perfect - not too slow to bore us, but not to fast to make us super confused. There were many new terms used, but, for the most part, were explained in a way that was easy to understand, or simply didn't take away from the overall experience. Each episode was a joy - wanting to know what wouldtake place next; what would the media do? how would the UN react? would the people revolt to the changes? e.t.c Really, there was so much potential to be had in the story.\\n\\n\r\nBut then episode 9 came, and all was lost. Was it because they had to rush? - after all, it was an original which had no manga or novel as a true backbone. Maybe they thought the viewers would prefer it this way. Perhaps it was a matter of one person placing their terrible ideas on the table. I don't know, but I do know that the result was devastating. Politics? Gone. The people and their opinions? Gone. The influence of the media? Gone. Subliminal philosophy which made you think regardless of whether you wanted to or not? Gone.  All the amazing things that have been built up until now? Absolutely gone; disappeared. Or, rather, replaced. And by utterly predictable 'romance' and the generic tropes one would expect of an 'arrival sci-fi', caused by one annoying 'girl' who feels the world should be dictated by herself and herself alone.\\n\\n\r\nArt:10\\n\\n\r\nActually outstanding. The art was magical. Toei really outdid themselves here. Managing to mix 3D and 2D in such a smooth, barely noticeable way, the animation style was new and fresh. The character designs were easy on the eyes and this quality remained constant throughout the whole anime. The use of patterns and symmetry in both the OP, anime and ED, was incredibly fitting - it really evoked a sense of the 'anisotropic' and of incomprehensible, alien thoughts. Honest kudos to the studio here - it was breath taking. A shame that the latter part of the story put it to waste.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8 \\n\\n\r\nAgain, magical. The timing has been great, regardless of what point in the plot we were in. I can't remember anything particularly spell-binding, or so perfectly suitable to the animation that it made me repeat said scene several times. The OP and ED were the same as the overall art - made in such a way to not use actual human languages or words, but to simply evoke ideas using music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\r\nAnd here we are, at last. Shindo - the negotiator who stood between the anisotropic and humanity('universe'). He was essentially a translator for everything, but was also our eyes into the world as he was always the first to see the new items brought to humanity. Shindo was an interesting character; he wasn't made to be anything special and had the nice balance of being a human and being a calm, collected government official. His relationship with Shu(zaShunina) was most intriguing to watch - it was clearly a mutual adoration; Shindo was interested in the anistortopic and Shu was interested in Shindo himself who he walked side-by-side with in the advancement of humanity. It was made very easy to see why these two were put together as a 'team' - they have a nice dynamic and would honestly be interesting to watch together regardless of setting.\\n\\n\r\nShu, himself, was an interesting specimen. He's treated like a baby or a sheltered person, who has all the knowledge in the world, but no actual experience to go with it(note; babies don't have all the knowledge in the world, but he's like a baby in that he's new to the world). It's a joy to see his stoic expression and general countenance fade to smiles and expressions fitting what he was actually feeling. We know that he reads books to enable him to understand human culture more, which, again, has influence on his expressions and actions. The cool thing with his arms were also nice - adding a feature to outwardly show how different he was to the world. Shu was a great character. Towards the end, I didn't like where his character alignment was going, as he had to switch roles for the sake of plot convenience. However, he still remained a nice character - he learnt even more emotions, made his motivations clear, e.t.c This adorable anisotropic creature really was the biggest delight of the series for me.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Tsukai Saraka, the generic-creator. Honestly, Saraka would've made a far better side-character. Her motivations were sound; her actual personality was believable; seeing how she balanced family and her tsundere-like nature with her work personality was fine. What wasn't okay, however, was what she did to the plot. Honestly, this character single-handedly turned what was amazing and unique into a pile of generic tropes and predictability. What should've been Shindo and Shu, the representations of humanity and the anisotropic, getting to know and understand each other and their values, in turn helping each other develop and advance like in a symbiotic relationship, turned into something else entirely. Saraka would've worked far better as the simple human girl with simple, straightforward, human values, contrasting with that of Shindo's and Shu's, who wouldn't get her way because the plot would be far more flavourful that way.\\n\\n\r\nLastly, the actual side characters. They do well to fuel the plot, from the Prime Minister to the childish scientist( whom everyone seemed to hate for some reason which eludes me). They were believable, yes, including the childish scientist, who mirrors actual scientists, and honestly didn't cause any discrepancies. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\\n\r\nAgain, my enjoyment greatly deteriorated as more episodes passed by, due to the absolute 180 in plot and genres. However, everything else was still mostly great, so I couldn't lower my score that much.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.6\\n\\n\r\n6 was probably too harsh considering it only had one terrible factor, and 7 was too high because of that said terrible factor, so no rounding done here. The anime was - has been - a joy, for the most part. It was simply pulled down by the last few episodes, which are currently influencing my review the most. I haven't finished yet, and there is the possibility that my score will change depending on how this goes(hopefully it'll be higher because I don't want to leave this anime bitter). I definitely recommend watching this, however be prepared for the utter drop in story quality towards eps 8-10 at the least.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, forgive my typos, I was too lazy to re-read.",

The story is exquisite, the characters are for the most part very likeable, the CG is eye candy and the soundtrack both for the opening/ending and for the ost of the anime is honestly amazing.\r\nInitially, I was a bit thrown off by the CG in the anime but the art style blended it in quite well so it's easy to lose sight of it. The animations for the humans are still quite robotic in comparison for the animation used for Kado and other non-living things. Which I do admit is rather frustrating at times but itdoes not take away my enjoyment of the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot itself is rather unique for an anime, this sense of diplomacy and formality gives a breath of fresh air to many anime viewers such as myself. It's refreshing to see an anime which does not feature teenagers in a High School. This storyline is currently making you question humanity as a whole with its various array of questions and choices. Definitely check out this anime is deep stories are your style. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR; This anime's plot, art, soundtrack and characters are amazing. Definitely worth a watch.",

            "content": "When there exists many assured commercial and critical successes sustaining a company or studio money, sometimes they would want to take risks. Maybe they'd hire more auteur directors, try original story concepts or do something to aim for a new crowd that wouldn't previously enjoy their work. That was likely the thought of Toei Animation, when in addition to their successes with Dragon Ball Super and the juggernaut One Piece, they decided to create Kado- The Right Answer, an all CGI original sci fi series having debates about such complex topics such as the ethics of humanity and how prepared they would be for suddeninstantaneous advancements in technology. This wasn't Toei's first time doing this. They released the widely beloved Mononoke series which felt above the norm, and to my knowledge 2013's Kyousou Giga was considered to be an overlooked classic as well. However for Kado, it feels like it was so close to establishing its identity and maturity firmly, only for that potential to be wasted and lead into something annoyingly typical.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\\n\\n\r\nThe plot, although not the most original at first glance, starts seeming to come into its own. A giant shiny multicolored cube falls from the sky onto an airport about to take off, including two workers with skill in diplomacy, for which Episode 0 established: \\n\r\nKojirou Shindou and Shuuhei Asano. We start by seeing the government of Japan trying to handle this foreign presence of the cube and then by seeing those trapped inside it interacting with the being naming itself Yaha-kui zaShunina, which would later be called the Anisotropic for convenience. Later on we get to meet more characters, including skilled foreign diplomat Tsukai Saraka, Japan's prime minister, news reporters and Kanata Shinawa, an eccentric scientist girl who understands the alien technology the most. While not the most concrete characterization, they seem to work fine for this portion of the story, as it becomes all about seeing these diverse reactions and showing how these mature people see the different suggestions the alien brings up to advance humanity's functions. The people would be of greater understanding of each other and the universe regardless of what choice they picked. The story, while not that investing, seemed atypical and fairly grounded and mature despite the supernatural entity. Does it continue these ideas it set forth until the end of the show though? Not exactly....... \\n\\n\r\nSee, at around the halfway point, Saraka snaps out of her professional attitude to have a Tsundere moment that main character Shindou brings up and it's at this point when things start to fall into typical anime-ness. A few more moments like this come up, we get some comedy involving a festival episode and then Saraka goes on a massive speech on why humanity is amazing  and the world is amazing and that everyone is perfect! This was the point where I lost faith in the show. It made it seem like this professional diplomat character turned into a typical over-idealized anime heroine, saying things that felt contradictory to the morally gray nature of certain debates earlier. That's not the only thing that happens though. The anisotropic itself goes from wanting to and considering collaboration with humanity and technology to.....wanting to backstab the main character and absorb all of humanity for his own goals. Not only does this completely go against any attempt at character development the conversations might've had earlier, but combined with Saraka's over idealistic speech completely ruins their sense of moral ambiguity we saw previously for the past 7-8 episodes or so. \\n\\n\r\nThen, in an unexpected twist with zero buildup, Saraka ALSO turns out to be an alien, the simple bonding relationship between her and Shindou turns into a love which lacks the proper pacing in itself, and Shindou and zaShunina have a punching battle which ends in the death of Shindou, the defeat of the alien and more idealistic speeches about humanity. Therefore, we end our Seinen story with a climax that wouldn't be out of place in your average battle Shonen.\\n\\n\r\nThis feels contradictory to the intentions from the beginning. If your idea is to create a unique product that will stand out from the genericness that seems to overtake the market, why decide to take the cliche route out anyways? It's like if an elegant ice skater near the end of his routine decided to swap out from rollerblades, slipping on a loose banana peel and falling flat on his face. Kado's overall execution simply comes off as ineffective at best and extremely jarring at worst. With the intriguing concepts so much time was put into meaning very little by the end of it, Kado feels like a wasted effort on the story front. Too much time was spent on the mature debating to accept the high tension stakes of the climax, so when a character you appreciate literally has his life on the line, you'd like him, but not care enough to that extent that we're concerned for his safety in an actual fight we'd not seen animated before.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, as far as animation goes, it was actually one of the show's greatest strengths. Yes, including the CGI. Many have often seen CGI animation as an unfortunate crutch, especially when it comes to anime, with the new Berserk adaptation being one of the standout examples of its badness. However, this show not only decides to not have excessive movements with the CGI, but use it to convey the slight movements and body language of those in arbitration in a faster way than traditional animation. And unlike say, Ajin, the frame rate didn't feel too fast for its own good, so the choppiness that could've been there was not. The best part of the animation though, was the background art inside the Kado itself. With the liquid gold exterior and the many different shapes formed, the director was allowed a lot of perspective shots to sell the out-there nature of the series. That said, if the show ever reverts back to 2D animation....it looks BAD, like, really choppy and generic looking. Still, the good outweighs the bad and the animation overall benefited the series. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound...didn't really do it either way. The OP was nice, the ED was nice, and background music was functional but unmemorable. Moving on to the biggest disappointment, the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character,  Kojirou Shindo, is the one who gets the most screentime and has the overall importance. He's a skilled debator who ends up siding with the anisotropic in his goals to advance humanity's nature. While it is interesting to see why he continues to side with the alien for every debate topic that comes up in the early episode, the \"bromance\" there felt like it happened too fast for me to fully buy. Agreeing with the alien was one thing, but siding with it for every possible option felt like an extreme. Still, he's the character we get to know the best and most of his decisions are shown fairly well in context. We like him enough? Sure. Do we care about him enough that his DEATH could leave an impact? Not to that extent, the story of Kado didn't feel like it was building up to such a thing. Character death was such a foreign concept, and the show seemed to favor logical over emotional. The character's resolution is sound but the full extent of the story does him about as much harm as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe alien zaShunina also started off the story fairly interesting. With an ever growing view of humanity and technology could benefit or hinder humanity's potential depending on its use, it was interesting to see him propose his morally gray views, rather than simply wanting to take over the world and eliminate humanity. Sadly, that's exactly what the final quarter of the series ends up doing. His betrayal of Shindou makes it too easy for the audience to choose to go against him, and his final scene has him too easily see the positiveness of humans and have a typical villain angry face breakdown scene. Therefore a possibly interesting and deep character was turned into your average everyday bad guy.\\n\\n\r\nEven with him though, easily the character most affected by this change in tone and direction is Tsukai Saraka. I already mentioned before how her Tsundere moment was the first crack in its foundation of something above the norm, but it's even more jarring if you consider her largely professional position and debating skills seen prior. Sure, you could argue that the Tsundere moment was to show she had more sides to her than just her professional life, but you start seeing more and more of these moments, as well as her speech about why humanity is special and amazing and start to lose faith in that confident and mature image. The show near its end tried to build an ever lasting romance between her and Shindou which....really doesn't work. They did know each other very early on in the series, but at that point, they were mature negotiators who collaborated in their field of work, not lovers. The transition to this could've been handled far worse but still feels too far out of left field to care about. Even when her insane faith makes more sense with the twist of her true identity, it felt unnecessary, and in the last three episodes her character takes steps too drastic from the first nine episodes. Saraka is probably my biggest disappointment in the show, particularly for the fact that they tried to force a Renton/Eureka esque romance in a show or place where it didn't belong and mean little to her professional foundation.\\n\\n\r\nAs for everyone else? Well, there ARE other characters, like the aforementioned quirky scientist girl, Japan's Prime Minister, News Reporters, and other high diplomatic from other countries, but in the end, everything comes down to these three and the rest don't have a lasting impact. We never get to see the end goal of their views because of the forced tonal change of the ending. Even Shuuhei Asano, who seemed like he would be an interesting character at the start as Shindou's partner, devolved to running away and crying without doing anything that felt substantial compared to his partner. It's sad how much the story's alternate direction sacrifices the foundation of so many characters for the sake of hasty rewrites. \\n\\n\r\nEND OF SPOILERS\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, the way Kado ultimately played out was like a massive disappointment with a sudden and out of place payoff that I didn't expect, want, or ask for. So much that was built up, debated, and foreshadowed meant nothing but idealistic schmaltz. I might've gained something from the show if it didn't awkwardly switch tracks near the end and kept up the debate angle, but despite trying to stand out, all it did was shoot itself in the foot to become another forgettable title that won't be remembered over the next few years quite so fondly.",

            "content": "Minor spoilers ahead\r\nStory:\r\nSo our story starts with a very interesting set-up, a being from another dimension - the anisotropic - comes to Earth and wants to advance humanity and help them find the right answer.\r\nThis leads to a couple of interesting questions:\r\nIs it a good thing for humanity to advance through the help of outside forces?\r\nWill humanity be able to handle this much advancement at once?\r\nWhat are the consequences for the world?\r\nWho is this anisotropic being and why does he do what he does?\r\nAnd what is the right answer?\r\nThese questions are the driving forces behind the story of Kado - the right answer and it'sup to humanity to find out the right answer to these.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all the premise was very interesting and for most of the episodes the execution was great. \\n\r\nThe problem with this story was the twist in its final episodes, while I liked the reveal of what the anisotropic being is and why he does things, it took this show in a very different direction than I thought it would go. It started of with a lot of these deeper, philosophic questions about humanity and ends with well... something quite different.\\n\r\nThe final episode was horribly rushed and the ending was very unsatisfying. I don't want to give it away but the way the Main Characters story finished was just very anticlimactic.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime uses a lot of CG, especially for its characters. If you're really bothered by this then it might bother you in this show as well.\\n\r\nFor me however it worked very well, the CGI was obvious but it was executed in a way that it didn't feel out of place at all. If this is the future of CGI in anime then I'm up for it.\\n\\n\r\nThere were a lot of beautiful wide shots of Kado and its surroundings in this show, especiall the proportions of Kado in comparison with other objects was handled exceptionally. It really felt huge. The inside of Kado was also designed beautifully and was one of the highlights of the show from an artistic point of view.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs weren't anything that special, but I think that was the point, it was a show that was set in reality so everybody looks like an ordinary person, except for the anisotropic being whose design I really enjoyed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Seikaisuru Kado was a highlight of this show. The opening and also the ending were just awesome. Especially the opening, I never skipped this one. Though in general the OST was quite good. It added a lot to the series and made a lot of moments feel bigger.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nShindou, Koujiro\\n\\n\r\nShindou is the protagonist of Kado, he's a negotiator for the Japanese Government and the person who also negotiates with the anisotropic being.\\n\r\nHe's a very likeable and interesting guy, worthy of being a protagonist. His interactions with his co-worker Hanamori would've been enough for me to watch a slice-of-life show with them just doing their negotiations.\\n\r\nHe goes through some interesting character development over the course of this show, I just wish the end of his story arc wouldn't have been so anti-climactic.\\n\\n\r\nYaha-kui zaShunina\\n\\n\r\nThe anisotropic being who wants to  advance humanity. His deisgn was great and I really liked the concepts of the anisotropic he brought to this world. He was a very interesting and mysterious character right until the final episodes. It was interesting to see him change due to the influence humanity had on him.\\n\\n\r\nTsukai, Saraka\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead of this show. At first she felt a little out of place in this show. Her typical anime antics just didn't fit with the otherwise serious world of Seikaisuru Kado. But she was a nice and sweet girl and she grew on me. It was interesting to see her become so important later on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'm a bit disappointed with this show. I really enjoyed everything until the twist and was ready to rate this 9/10. But the twist of this show first drove it into a direction that was only okay instead of great and then the final episode happened and I won't give away the ending but it was a huge letdown for me and some of it felt like an asspull to me.\\n\r\nI'd still recommend this show for it's great 10 episodes!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Up to episode 7, the show keeps piling up evidence that the author is incredibly naive about political and economic issues, and is focusing the whole show in the idea the world is undergoing a \"revolution\" caused by Kado. In episode 7, they introduce the Samsa device that allows people to become aware of their multidimensional selves, thus eliminating the need for sleep. When the Japanese government representatives are discussing this, all they are thinking about is how this would improve human productivity, without a thought for the fact that it's precisely excess productivity caused by excess population that is leading the environment to acatastrophic failure in the relatively near future. Also, it's ignoring the psychological issues, the boredom factor and other problems. It seems that the show is just trying to say - like a good Japanese - that people would be able to work a lot more, and is not aware that it's precisely this overdedication to work that causes so many psychological and social problems to Japanese individuals, including the overly high suicide rate (not the only factor, but a major contributor), and entirely disregarding the idea that people in other cultures DO NOT live for their jobs. The only moment the show approaches this problem is when they question whether rapid development would lead to happiness, when actually survival is far more of a pressing issue here. The wam would already lead to disastrous disruptions in the economic structure of the world. Add that to billions of people having too much time in their hands and/or companies pushing them to work more, thus speeding up the exhaustion of natural resources, and the anisothropic's gifts look increasingly like a curse to me. The only one that seems to realize this is Saraka.\\n\r\nAnd then the show throws everything out the window in the last three episodes. After Sayaka became God (she even has a halo, for fuck's sake!) and Shindo falls in love with her for no reason at all, and poor Za Shunina becomes \"the villain who wants to destroy the world for no reason\", everything the series had of good simply vanished to be replaced by the most boring and predictable ending possible. I should have seen this a mile off. The childish scientist (portraying scientists like children who are unaware of the social world around them is one of the most appalling misconceptions I know, on part with portraying engineers as socially-retarded nerds and soldiers as sadistic murderers) and the tsundere negotiator (seriously, how did she get that job with a personality like that?!?) were already giving terrible warning signs that the authors behind the story were not taking their plot as serious sci-fi. Also, for reasons I mentioned above, the plot's whole outlook on the problems created by the contact with the anisothropic was naive at best, so it did not come as a surprise for me that the screwed up the series completely by creating that stupid, cliche ending.\\n\r\nFinally, at no point did the CGI animation become pleasant to me. I was always watching the series IN SPITE of the terrible animation. Compare this to something like The Incredibles and you'll understand what I mean. Yes, one is a feature film with a huge budget. But honestly, I don't care. If you're going to make it CGI, that's what you should go for. American CGI TV series are also terrible, for the same reasons: stiff character movement and constantly bland and unconvincing facial expressions. Kado was the only good thing on the animation side, and the only thing that should have been CGI.\\n\r\nMusic: forgettable. I really can't recall a single song or theme from the anime after watching it.\\n\r\nSound design: good, but nothing exceptional. The sound is not a truly integral part of the story, but merely \"sound effects\". For comparison, see how the sound design is incredibly meaningful and integral to the narrative in Serial Experiments Lain, where even the sudden moments of silence have a profound impact in a scene.\\n\r\nAs a whole: very mediocre and totally forgettable series. Nothing to hate or make a fuss about. It had potential as an idea and wasted it because most writers of anime are not good at writing actual sci-fi (Shin Sekai Yori being the one notable exception of the past then years, as far as I know - after all, Gundam is not sci-fi, just as Star Wars is not sci-fi, but rather space opera).",

            "content": "*spoiler alert*\r\nIt's truly been a while since I've seen such a spectacular trainwreck.\r\n8 episodes of a slow-burn sci-fi with first contact, politics, technology and negotiations become shitty fantasy drivel. The way the genre shift and twists are executed is so terrible I don't even know what this author was trying to accomplish. \r\nI mean if a romance was going to be the main point/solution instead of you know science and negotiations then maybe they should have spend some time developing that instead of spending 2/3 of the shows building the mcs' relationship only to destroy it in one scene so a character with like 3scenes in that 2/3rd can win. And you know what's funny? It doesn't even matter why she's right. Naturalism and fuck yeah humanity is right by default because look the other guy spilled his spaghetti, snapped and went yandere so you have no choice now. Besides conveniently enough she's a cute mahou shoujo so why wouldn't you pick her? What are you gay? That's obviously not the right answer. \\n\\n\r\nAnd more importantly I sure hope you didn't think you think for once we'd avoid the evil technology/progress cliche. Or that we'd actually solve things by talking which by the way is literally Shindo and Saraka's job and they are supposed to be awesome at it. Because tough luck, I'm returning all the alien gifts and here have some fucking energy swords, disney healing kisses, and a shonen final battle with a deus ex machina instead. You know if it weren't for that end I might have accepted that mess but it was far too wacky and shits on every point this show seemed to be trying to make.\\n\\n\r\nSeriously is Shindo a high-functioning sociopath? Did someone play too much fe14? Did that hack of an author just wanted a hax mahou shojo in a school uniform and then wrote everything else? Is the right answer being a xenophobe/technophobe? Was this merely a terribly elaborate prank against that bully of a seiyuu? \\n\\n\r\nIn any case if you want a gary-stu with a harem ntr ing evil aliens with magic watch an actual battle harem since they are usually honest about what they are from the start instead of pretending to be serious.",

            "content": "After hearing lots of praise for Seikaisuru Kado, I finally decided to give it a go. And I was not disappointed... well at least for the first few episodes. Everything started going downhill after the second half. The anime introduced itself as a spectacular sci-fi mature type of anime; however, it trailed off and the sci-fi aspect was completely lost, in my opinion, when the romance was forcibly put into the anime. I especially hate it when a random side character is given a 'main role' for the sake of advancing the plot. \r\n[Story] -- 5: Mediocre \r\nSpeaking of the plot, as I mentioned before,I had a hard time following it after a few episodes. There were so many plot holes and so many questions left unanswered. If the anime had gone more into the sci-fi genre, instead of delving into the shitty characters, a lot of the questions may have been explored and even answered. That would have left us with a greater understanding of the anisotropic. \\n\\n\r\n[Characters] [Spoilers] -- 2: Dreadful\\n\r\nThe characters were atrocious in this anime. The crazy scientist girl was literally there because 'plot convenience.' The creator[s] never even considered giving her any development as a character. Then we have that guy who's a part of the media - again, plot convenience. They were only there to spread the Sansa - they merely existed for the Sansa and that's pretty much it. Then we have Hanamori and Saraka. I don't even know why Hanamori is there. He got so little screen time, that I'm surprised I still remember his name. Saraka is also there for the plot convenience. Like, Shindo got to know that girl for like a few days, and then they fall in love? This bullshit romance between Saraka and Shindo resulting in the disgusting ending, which gives me more reasons to hate Saraka. She became a main character in fucking 3 episodes. She is most definitely the worst of all the characters. Then we have zaShunina, who is lovable and is comparable to a child who is still understanding the ways of the world. Then they just HAD to make zaShunina the bad guy. You have no idea how big of a mistake that was. The anime could have gone in SO many directions! We could have seen much more. This type of anime doesn't need a bad guy to continue the story. There were already many options from the start. What if Shindo had agreed to go to the anisotropic with zaShunina? What if there was a different objective or a different \"right answer?\" What if the Wams were actually distributed to the other countries? What if the Sansa did not have it's same effect through the television and the only way was for one to see it for him/herself  in real life? The anime could have explored all sorts of questions, and I bet there are more.\\n\\n\r\n[Art] -- 7: Good\\n\r\nOh no! It is 3-D animation, the enemy of anime! Honestly, that's what I thought at first as well. However, I got used to it after a few episodes, and I must admit, the visuals were pretty nice. But even after watching Seikaisuru Kado, I still dislike the appearance of 3-D animation in anime...\\n\\n\r\n[Sound] 7: Good\\n\r\nNothing much to say here. The voice actors did a great job, and the OSTs were average. Not the best, not the worst. (Did not mention the opening/ending because I did not listen to them.)\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 4: Decent\\n\r\nI did look forward to each episode, whether it be because I was legitimately looking forward to the episode or because I was looking forward to shitting on it.\\n\\n\r\n[Overall] 5: Mediocre\\n\r\nIt's meh. Just another anime with great potential gone wrong. Adding everything up, it's just average. Nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\n[SHOULD YOU WATCH?]\\n\r\nNo. Unless you're a sucker for forced romance and sci-fi anime gone wrong.\\n\\n\r\n***Thank you for reading. I will appreciate any feedback, since it is my first time writing a review.***\\n",

            "content": "Ah This show, I thought this might be the one show that would prove to me that Toei as an animation studio isn't as bad as I thought it was, after all, every reboot/sequel of a show they've done recently has looked bottom of the barrel cheap (with sailor moon crystal season 3 being a weird exception) and their only good shows this past decade only make up for looking cheap with impeccable or eccentric art design and directing (kyousugiga, Mononoke) so when i see there first real attempt at a 3d show actually look decent I had some hope. add that to the showspremise of a more serious first contact with higher beings science fiction story and you got yourself an interesting show with some potential. \\n\\n\r\nBefore I talk about what ruined the show in detail Ill talk about what grabbed my attention about this show in the first place. questioning the ideas of certain human concepts like war, the formation of borders and countries, and the gap between developed and impoverished nations from an outsiders perspective is inherently interesting. This begs the question from that outsider \"if humanity is capable of being the dominant species why isn't it as a species able to put aside their interests as nations and unify as a world nation capable of solving world problems more efficiently?\". It also asks of whether help from an outside source to artificially kick-start human productivity through alien technology is indeed even the right move or would our reliance on it be harmful should it ever just vanish out of thin air as well as the ethics of tampering with the natural state of the world as it stands and just letting humanity progress at its own pace. \\n\r\nNow aside from a lot of technobabble about the devices used to raise these questions, this show does at the very least a good job of getting the viewer to think about this type of subject matter. Add to that very adult characters and the tone of the show staying serious and morally ambiguous for the first 9 episodes and you got yourself a good thought provoking type of show.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunatly the last three episodes ruin the whole idea of what the show was building towards and instead throws away all interesting discussion and intrigue the show could have had as mentioned by other reviewers, In favor of out of nowhere deus ex machinas, little to no setup to some of the more dramatic moments and plot twists, and terrible writing that throws out the serious tone and gray morality in favor of creating a contrived as hell scenario for a \"humans are good/outsiders are bad\" type of conflict. And to top it all off the show doesn't have the guts to stick with whatever impact the new technologies introduced could have on the world long term so it just hits a magic reset button to make people incapable of using any of it or interact with the people who made them so it basically wastes your time as viewer by not really exploring these ideas deeper or predicting how humanity would really progress with the advanced tech and plays it too safe.  Because of that the whole buildup of what \"The Right Answer\" was in the title was thrown away so it fell flat on it's face. \\n\\n\r\nIn short this show is a waste of time with OK 3d CGI but in a couple of years even the CGI will be dated and I don't recommend anybody to watch this only to be disappointed.",

            "content": "(Not spoiler-free)\r\nAt episode 0-2 I thought this anime had great potential. Shindo is an extremely relatable and well-rounded character, though I would have liked to know about his personal background. What really pulled the enjoyment factor up for this anime for me was watching ZaShunina grow and become steadily more human, and at the same time, Shindo's relationship with him.\r\n In the middle episodes there is a lot of 'let's stall this as far as possible' which really is not the way to go for a 12 ep arc - probably why the plot twist seems to have come OUT OF NOWHERE. There is adecided lack of relationship development between Saraka and Shindo, not nearly enough about Kado's inside and Shindo's work inside, and a very over-simplified summary of the benefits of the devices to the world. \\n\\n\r\nI would have liked more international meetings, and maybe side-plots to introduce the effect of the devices on humanity. Instead, though we're talking about important concepts such as giving power to humanity which they could possibly abuse, you're forced to go through Shindo meeting his mother, a camera guy getting recruited by a Google anime knockoff brand and a festival where ZaShunina buys a turtle. I think the producers need to set a tone - and stick to it. There is a lot of confusion about the general direction the poorly developed plot takes. Personally, I hate the canon ship and I think it would have been much better and more realistic to leave Saraka as a human who is mildly irritating. Not nearly enough physics/ actual serious science - this could have been thrilling. If another studio had produced it or it had better funding, no doubt it could have been a smashing success like Steins;Gate.",

            "content": "Saikasuru Kado. What can I say? This is easily the most disappointing show of the year. The ending of the show really messes so much up it isn\u2019t fun. It has been a while that I have seen a show or read a book that started out this good and then crashed and burned like Kado. It is even worse than \u201cLangoliers\u201d by Stephen King which created an amazing atmosphere a great mystery and had a laughable ending. Why is it worse? Because in the case of Kado, it was not just that the ending was weak. This was Donna of \u201cDoctor Who\u201d.  \r\nAnimation\u2013 7\\n\r\nI wasn\u2019t very fond of the CGI-only animation but it actually sort of worked here because of the otherworldliness of Yaha and Kado and the CGI emphasised their alien qualities nicely. In the case of the human characters, it would have been great if they had been animated the old-fashioned way. Maybe a mix of both with a heavier emphasis on CGI would have been good but since the CGI was actually pretty well done a 7 it is.\\n\\n\r\nStory \u2013 5\\n\r\nKado is about First Contact and in the beginning, the show does so many things right that I could have shed a tear. I wondered why it was compared with \u201cArrival\u201d. They are not really similar but both \u201cArrival\u201d and \u201cKado\u201d are about communication and language and so much more. It debates the pros and cons of natural to sudden technological advancement. How would the media handle a first encounter with aliens? How about the political and economic impact of technology that is so far removed from what we know? The show was smart, the pacing was great, the ideas were fascinating but halfway through something changed. Maybe they ran out of ideas, maybe some people wanted to have a say. I don\u2019t know what happened but whatever it was, it was not good and the show suffered massively and received a very stupid deus ex machina ending. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes most of the episodes, especially the first arc (8 episodes), the show would receive either a 9 or 10 but that ending deserves nothing less than a big fat zero, so all in all 5. This is why this show is so frustrating. It had so much potential but Yaha, who had been cool and composed suddenly became downright human and emotional. I adored the developing relationship (in a way undefinable \u2013 Friendship? Love? Something more profound?) between Shindou and Yaha and in my eyes, it was not just a simple friendship and then the finale happened. Talk about badly handled. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \u2013 10\\n\r\nThe music is utterly gorgeous and it is my favourite score of the year so far (and this also includes scores like \u201cMary Magdalene\u201d by J\u00f3hann J\u00f3hannson). \u5ca9\u4ee3\u592a\u90ce already did a great job with A.I.C.O. but outdid himself with the help of the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. The OP and ED did not only fit perfectly with the images but are also very, very beautiful. There is even a beautiful operatic Aria included (\u30e4\u30cf\u30af\u30a3\u30b6\u30b7\u30e5\u30cb\u30ca\u4f1d ~Diva Version~). Do buy it. It is totally worth it!\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6\\n\r\nAgain a solid ten in the beginning but with an ending like that- 6 is generous. \\n\\n\r\nI hate this show. I love this show. I loved it so much but I hate it for being such a massive let-down at the end. \\n",

            "content": "This is my first review, but I can say I am confident in my current opinions on this series. I'll skip over my personal praise and jump to the individual aspects of this series so far however.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI am a writer, and am pursuing writing as a very possible career, and have watched quite a bit of anime so far. It is what I pull a lot of inspiration and lessons from, and has been a great way of improving my quality and skills as a writer. Taking in this series and what it has to offer, from just the episodes so far I've learneda great lesson in writing; adding uniqueness to your story that has not been seen in other people's stories before. This may be a spoiler, but what occurs in Kado when the cube makes contact is not what you'd expect, which is massive destruction or the emergence of aliens or robots or any other evil foreign entity, but rather the cube setting down almost perfectly and a human emerge which, so far, has not been hostile whatsoever. Breaking barriers of what the viewer expects is great and usually tough to achieve as a writer, but so far Mado Nozaki has done an amazing job with the series.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThis is actually a surprising score for myself to give, as I generally hate CG/CGI animations, although I've completely lost concern and care for the CGI in Kado so far. The backgrounds and other objects aside from the humans all appear to not be CG/CGI, at least to me, and the humans actually blend very well with them. Also, did I mention how stunning the cube, Kado, has been so far? Its shifting colors and movements are, as another reviewer stated, eye candy, and I've enjoyed every chance I've got to look at Kado. Japan's scenery is also portrayed very well in the series so far, and we have yet to see if the series will extend further to other countries/areas.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI love music and sound effects in anime, and the music is nothing short of a masterpiece so far. The opening gives off eerie yet majestic vibes, and the singer expresses the greatness of what Kado: The Right Answer has to offer. The ending, despite many skipping over it, is actually very good also, and you can even hear the Japanese oriental sounds mixed in near the beginning (pardon me if I termed that incorrectly). Aside from that, from what we've heard songwise in the series so far, almost all of it has been majestic and attractive to the ears, at least mine, and they've done a fantastic job on the sound effects for Kado, the elements of the world, and even the little things such as echoing footsteps and rolling WAM.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nSo far the characters have been all-around great, with not that many cliches, troupes, or copy-paste characters. And there will always be some underlying similarities between how characters act in anime, as we all are humans and similar in our personalities and reactions. But the characters that most stand out to me are the main-main ones, such as Shindou and zaShunina. Shindou has this very stern and down-to-the-point personality, one that we don't normally see as often if at all, probably because it's hard for most writers to execute well. However Mado has done superb with Shindou and his interaction in the world so far, and everything Shindou says or does intrigues me. This is the same with zaShunina also. I expected zaShunina to come to Earth with some evil plan, whether that be direct or underlying, and when that didn't happen I expected him to come to spread or share an insane idea or religious belief, both of which he did not do either. I am closely analyzing zaShunina whenever he says something, and am waiting to find out what his true intentions are if he even has any, which honestly at this point I'm somewhat convinced he's a character type I have never seen in anime or any other form of media for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nThat's about all I have for my review, and I do hope it helped. I highly recommend you give this series a try if you have not yet done so, as I believe it truly offers a story and idea that has never been seen in anime yet, at least in my experience of watching it.",

It managed to raise my expectations extremely high for the better first half- and then it took all of its amazing potential and shattered it. I stopped at episode 10 after seeing the impending train wreck and decided to read summaries of the last two instead of wasting time. \r\nAs a science fiction fan who enjoys the like of Arthur C. Clark and Frank Herbert, the beginning concepts for this anime were right up my alley. They even seemed a bit new - at least, they were something I'dnever seen before. The nature of this series seemed very fresh on the anime scene, breaking a lot of predictability. At least, that's what it seemed it was doing until it totally destroyed the integrity of the entire first half of the show by doing a 180 with its theme and becoming unbearably predictable and shallow (Not really that shallow compared to a lot of anime. Even with its disappointment at the end, it's a decent anime altogether, it's simply the sheer amount of potential this anime wastes that causes me to dislike it particularly.) People who have seen this show - you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nThis 180 is the sole thing that ruined the anime for me - a big thing. Other things relating to the overall production seemed decent. I'm not a fan of the animation style, but it's surprisingly easy to get used to. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, unless you want to be incredibly disappointed, STOP this anime around episode 8. Duck out while it's still good. Play with the ideas it's presented. If you really like this show from episode 8 and prior, 9 and onward will be nothing more than depressing.\\n",

All the amazing plot, the potential, the description of how their world was, how it was introduced/told to the viewers was good. But then they decide to throwall of those in the freaking trash bin and make it a classic drama/romance/fantasy what ever the hell it is cliche. Suddenly we get the MC hook up with some girl we barely got any information on(gave her a backstory at episode 10) apart from being considered as an equal to him. and hoho behold said girl is also a higher being that so called fell from the higher dimentions just because of the irrational thought of falling inlove with the human race.

If you've answered yes to either of these questions, than Kado might be an interesting and thought provoking series to watch.\r\nUnfortunately the important word in the previous sentence is \"might\". Generally I try to describe the good in an anime, in the hopes of getting people to watch and form their own opinions. However in this case I think I should take the time to warn you in the hopes of saving you from disappointment. \r\nKado is a mostly good series. It has a strong castof unique adult characters, splendid art and sound design, coupled with a fascinating \"first contact\" style sci-fi story. Most of this goes to shit by the end though. This show is an excellent example of a train-wreck. It takes its core sci-fi elements, philosophical questions, smart characters, and kills them all one by one.\\n\\n\r\nI give this anime a 6/10.

The beginning sets you up with a conflict of technological advancement vs conservatism. It asks the questions related to change. Then, midway through, this show turns into a mahou shoujo romance between Shindo and Saraka. Instantly, Shindo changes his philosophical stance to match Saraka's. The show then becomes a one sided competition between the yaoi pairing bond between zaShunina and Shindo vs Shindo and Saraka's superluminal romance bond. In the end, there is even a Deus Ex Machinawho magically, through whatever contrived plotholes, comes with powers to make Saraka's side win. I call this bullshit.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\r\nMost characters were 1-dimensional. Shindo and Saraka included for the most part. They're just maybe 1.5 rather than 1.0. The dynamics going on with Shindo doesn't make any sense but you can possibly just blame that on the fact that Saraka is a canon Sue who twisted the original story concept.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nEverything looks pretty decent.

            "content": "Sci-fi stories have as of late become more action-oriented or filled with fantasy-tropes, straying far from being speculative stories about our future and how we might change over time. This is why Kado came in like a welcome breath of classic air, bringing up the interesting questions that the genre is well-known for.\r\nBeing interesting alone was however not enough to make this series great.\r\nWe start our journey of interdimensional exploration with some rather slow pacing, sometimes used well to flesh out characters, other times to waste an episode on watching the futuristic paint dry. Yet it keeps you hooked by introducing crazy concepts, such aswhat might happen if humanity was given brand new life-changing technologies. Sadly, it only scratches the surface of its own premise, seemingly more interested in just raising questions instead of actually exploring them. The effects these new technologies are having on humanity are never shown.\\n\\n\r\nWith more episodes this series could've done much more. Heck, with better planning and pacing the series already had the potential to do more. What it all boils down to is one question, should humanity try to advance faster, or should it take its time to get wherever it's going? Despite a flashy and crazy climax, the anime predictably enough seems to lean for a more conservative and clich\u00e9 answer, one that wastes the story's potential.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to praise Kado for anything, it would be on the technical side. It managed to successfully blend 2D animation and CGI in a way that didn't make my eyes want to flee in terror, which is quite the feat.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not great, I can't say I regret watching Kado, since it was different from most anime being made today. My hopes would be that this could encourage more stories with complex ideas in the future, but with more polish.",

            "content": "Here are my SPOILER FREE two cents on Seikaisuru Kado. I starting jotting down my thoughts after the third episode in order to write the best review possible, so I\u2019ve had a lot of time to ponder on this.\r\nAnimation:\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, I really don\u2019t care for the animation. I don\u2019t like cgi-blend. The art style in episode 0 was superb, which made the art style for the rest of the series kind of a bummer. However, this is my personal opinion. \r\nStory:\r\nHere\u2019s what I love about the story. Despite the fact that it\u2019s just about as sci-fi as sci-fi can be,the way it plays out is weirdly...accurate. I feel like humanity\u2019s response to zaShunina in this show is realistically how humanity would respond to this kind of event. The central protagonist isn\u2019t some hot blooded 17 year old Chosen One with the fate of the world in his hands. It\u2019s a government negotiator. A bureaucrat. Everything is disputed politically and diplomatically. Even the UN gets involved here. As complex and fantastical as it can be at times, this story is told practically. \\n\\n\r\nTheme wise, the show focused the most on one thing: humanity, humanity, humanity. When the UN gets involved of the dispute over what to do with the resources zaShunina has given Japan, zaShunina says something that I think sums up the central conundrum of this show: \u201cI came here to help humanity, not countries.\u201d Coming together as humans despite national borders isn\u2019t exactly the conflict in the story here\u2014it\u2019s asking whether or not we\u2019re even capable of doing so. \\n\\n\r\nThat is, until the story gets turned backwards and upside down in a plot twist that made me jump up from my couch and start shouting at my tv. But that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say on that. You\u2019ll just have to see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple reasons why I knocked a few points off my score here, because it could very easily have been a 10. One is simply that I tend to be a tough critic so, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. Second was the animation. I just couldn\u2019t get used to it and I didn\u2019t think it looked good. And last was a combination of a few different inconsistencies.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cCan we trust Yaha-kui zaShunina? Does he really have humanity\u2019s best interest at heart?\u201d This is something I was asking with every episode, but curiously, the show itself only touched on this question from time to time. So when you\u2019re watching it, make sure you ask yourself that. You might be surprised at the answer. \\n\\n\r\nBut to that I add my greatest criticism\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThis show is considerably more plot driven than it is character driven. It\u2019s not that the characters are weak or even bad. But when you have a plot this complex and, in my opinion, magnificent, if your characters aren\u2019t equally as strong then the story they exist in is going to overshadow them and swallow them whole. This was the problem with Kado, and big time.\\n\\n\r\nShindo is...Shindo. As you watched the show you\u2019ll see that everyone admires him immensely. There\u2019s not a person who dislikes him. And he\u2019s a nice guy. I don\u2019t really have anything bad to say about him. But that\u2019s just it. Despite how everyone goes on and on about how exceptional he is, he\u2019s annoyingly average to me. In the last couple episodes his heroic characteristics start to shine though, so by the end of the series he turned out to be a good protagonist. It just took too long to get there\\n\\n\r\nTsukai Saraka was quite the interesting character. At first I didn\u2019t like her all that much. They tried to make her, a government employee, come across as a tsundere-like character. Why? Why on earth would a show like this need a tsundere?? Anyway, you see a different side of her in episode 7 and from then on I respected her a lot. By the end of the show she was my favorite character. I just don\u2019t understand why she was portrayed as she was initially. Perhaps it was strategic, but it sure got on my nerves. \\n\\n\r\nHanamori was funny, and definitely the \u201chow the hell did I get caught up in this?\u201d character in the series. Yet he turned out to be crucial to the plot, and I always appreciate it when a show makes the comic relief more significant than you might think they are.\\n\\n\r\nDr. Shinawa was also another favorite of mine. Sincerely eccentric is how I\u2019d sum her up. I always loved her contributions to the story. \\n\\n\r\nAnd Yaha-kui zaShunina. Man oh man. Definitely the most impressive development wise. ESPECIALLY by the last episode. His development seemed a bit too rushed in my opinion, but it was still mostly consistent with the pace of the show. I went back and forth between distrusting him and loving him, and often found myself at a weird equilibrium between the two. And I loved it.\\n\\n\r\nI think there was at least an earnest effort to have strong characters, so I\u2019ll give them that. It just didn\u2019t quite work. They focused too much on the story to really give the characters their day in the sun. \\n\\n\r\nSo, here are the cliff notes\\n\\n\r\n- Watch episode 0\\n\r\n- Rewatch episodes if you can, it\u2019ll help a lot\\n\r\n- Think really hard about the questions the show asks\\n\r\n- More plot driven than character driven\\n\r\n- But the characters are sincere\\n\r\n- The plot is slow to build but pays off well\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d give it a 7.5 if I could, that\u2019s what it is in my heart of hearts. It deserves a watch, and despite my criticisms, I highly recommend it.\\n\\n",

            "content": "!First Things First There Will Be Spoilers, You Have Been Warned!\r\nI'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. This anime had so much potential and I stand by my belief that things could've been improved even a little by allowing it a 24 episode run time rather than 12, but should nothing of the story and development change that'd all be for naught in the end.\r\nFor me this anime wasn't a complete waste of time, I seriously enjoyed it up to episode 8 and actually wouldn't have minded if they ended it there, went on a month long hiatus then came back with a fully fleshed outand well thought through ending instead of the crap shack we got instead. The visuals, the music and the characters for the most part were fantastic, even the story started out well being sort of like the CG anime equivalent of Arrival (excellent film, I highly recommend watching it), but as with a lot of ambitious projects they just couldn't seem to figure out how to appropriately end the series without royally fucking it up.\\n\\n\r\n(From here on excuse me if I rant a little, the ending is about my only qualm with Kado).\\n\\n\r\nFor starters, Shindo, zaShunina and even Saraka (whom I didn't like that much anyway) were good characters in their own right. It made sense that the 40D alien boi had no understanding of human concepts and emotions, it made sense that Shindo wouldn't be at all shocked by making contact with an alien because that's his character, and it made sense that at least one of the main cast would be opposed to this and encompassed that side of humanity's reaction which was what Saraka represented. But all semblence of development was completely throw out the window when things started coming to a climax.\\n\r\nShindo I'm not so hung up on apart from the fact that he's praised by the Prime Minister for being able to walk his own path, yet the power of boners makes him follow along with Saraka's wishes like a dog in heat. Or how his amazing negotiator skills are scrapped in favour of needless violence, yay! //throws up\\n\r\nNow here's where I start getting annoyed; Saraka was a character that, as I said, I didn't like (and I could also sadly tell where they were going with her character the second I saw her because she's the only other character in the whole anime with red eyes bar zaShunina). The reason being was not because she was written badly but because we stood on opposites sides of the argument, something I consider excellent writing for a character. She represented the cautious and fearful side of humanity, our distrusting nature towards a deal that feels too good to be true, the most basic and instinctual fear of even the most simple of creatures; fear of the unknown. This however is completely ruined by one simple fact...she's not human. She is fearful because she has knowledge of what zaShunina might do and what he is capable of, the complete opposite of humanity who fear what they don't understand. Her character could have had so much more depth and meaning if they'd just kept her human, but instead they reduced her to typical tsundere waifu material and only worth a damn for her womb.\\n\r\nNow comes zaShunina, the biggest clich\u00e9 insult to me since I really loved his character (for reasons I shall make clear a little later on). From how much anime and movies and series I've watched over the years I've become really damn good at telling where a story is going to head (not to toot my own horn there, just fact), which is why I'm happily surprised when media does something I didn't expect. For all intensive purposes, Kado was heading the latter direction at first, being something I'm not unfamiliar with but something I don't see often, so it's refreshing, but unfortunately it started running down the road of predictability far too fast, tripped up and dropped its own plot down the storm drain. I have no doubt that zaShunina was intended to be the quote unquote \"bad guy\" of the series, but I highly doubt it was intended to be this blunt about it. All of the development he'd gone through was utterly trashed when the decision was made to have him turn psychotic, I find it hard to believe that A) he, who has never been remotely human in his life, could learn to be human in a month when it takes us humans years to learn to do that and B) a highly intelligent 40D being would become emotionally unstable. It felt messy, rushed and above all else out of character.\\n\\n\r\nThe other part of things that upset the fandom was of course the queerbaiting. I won't talk too much about it but I will say this; it was noticeable and disgusting. I have no idea why having a gay couple in a regular anime is so bad that they have to kill them off for it, just having a non-hetero couple in your anime does not make it a BL/GL or a yaoi/yuri, it makes it a wholesome and relatable story to a minority often overlooked in the media. I have watched anime made in the 90s do a better job representing the LGBT community than our supposed \"world of equality\" nowadays.\\n\\n\r\nNow...for the part that pissed me off the most about the ending.\\n\r\n...I'm sorry but...for being a heavily science(ish) based anime...HOW THE FUCK DID THEY MESS UP BASIC MATH?\\n\r\n0 + 0.5 does not equal 2 for fuck's sake, there is no way that a human being and an Anisotoron who is essentially human and abandoned almost all her power could produce a being more powerful than a whole, pureblooded Anisotoron. That. Is. Not. How. Biology. Works.\\n\r\nAnd don't give me that \"She's a Anisotoron, she can alter things\" because she has next to no power anymore, she threw away her power to be born and live as a regular human being, retaining only as much as she needed to survive I suppose. To use an extreme example, a normal healthy human and a human with a hereditary degenerative disease /does not/ produce a child with the cure to cancer. It does not work like that. What happened in Kado was, say it with me now;\\n\\n\r\nPLOT CONVENIENCE.\\n\\n\r\nThey could not figure out a way to end this anime, so they asspulled, and I think this is what annoyed me the most.\\n\r\nI have my own story and headworld, I've had it for years now and I share it with my partner. Between us we have created a wide universe rich with lore and mysteries in equal amounts, and the \"God among men\" situation is one I am very familiar with. This is why Kado appealed to me, it was like watching an anime that had parts of my own headworld lore in it and that was fascinating to see come to life before my eyes. I and my partner sorted the problems of having OP characters in a very simple way; the God-level characters in our headworld are /passive observers/. They don't fight, they don't interfere with \"lesser beings\", they are simply there to see to it that the universe is running smoothly and that there are no beings getting too powerful and causing chaos. The only time they clash is with each other in their own pocket dimensions, well away from any collateral damage. We asked ourselves why they shouldn't be antagonists and the answer was simple;\\n\r\n\"Beings with enough power to create universes are wise enough to know that their power should be used to protect the weak, not cause conflict.\"\\n\\n\r\nToo many writers create God-level characters and then slap human concepts onto them as if beings of that level would share our beliefs. None of mine and my partner's God-level characters have human emotions, they have a set of emotions that are like human ones but not the same and can copy human emotions if they want be can't really feel it. None of them have \"morals\" because those were things made by humans in the first place, they have an understanding of the concept of \"right\" and \"wrong\" but again these are human concepts that humans made to judge the actions of other humans, so they feel no need to adhere to these rules, they won't chastise someone for murder nor congratulate someone for saving a life, they simply acted and that is that. This is represented beautifully by one of my God-level characters who apologizes to others but never means it, he understands that whatever he did is seen as \"wrong\" but he himself sees no problem, so when he apologizes to others you can tell it's insincere.\\n\\n\r\nMore and more writers are exploring deeper and out-there concepts, but we must understand that these things cannot ever be fully quantified by our own look on the universe and everything within it, and I believe this is where Kado ultimately failed what it set out to accomplish.",

If we all are satisfied, are we just beings that crave for more information or experiences? What in essence are we if we all could live forever and without worries? Would we go about exploring the universe to satisfy our craving for knowledge and experience? We would essentially become what the anisotropic are...\\n\\n\r\nall this questions are explored in the anime, and makes us think and wonder about the answers.\\n\r\nSo to fully appreciate the story of this anime you need to have knowledge or be familiar with how politics works in real life and be curios about philosophical questions about humanity.\\n\r\nThe reason why i really enjoyed this anime is because of that, it includes, i would say, a taste of how politics really are and with the addition of philosophical questions. Also, I learned a few new things thanks to watching this anime, like for example what are anisotropic environments.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, this anime deserves a high score because of its well thought out presentation of these questions that the story allowed for the viewer to grasp and be intrigued by.",

            "content": "This anime started off with a lot of promise in the first episode and it seemed like it was gonna be a mature (Or at least not childish) anime involving a lot of politics and tense diplomatic negotiations. It was far from it, I was really disappointed that it turned out so terrible but I wasn't really surprised considering a huge chunk of anime suffer from the things I found bad about this anime.\r\nLet's start off with the story.\r\nThe story had so much promise but it fell short in almost every aspect. The story itself could have been bearable if they fixed one or twothings. Those things being Character and not having so much tropes ruining the atmosphere and \"tension\" of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nPersonally disliked it but for 3DCG they did good.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nNot much to say really, had some alright sound and a nice soundtrack. I think a few of the SFX were stock sounds but they could have been just really similar to what I've heard in other anime so who knows.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem with this anime is the characters every character is so very droll and uninspired. This anime would've been a lot better if they managed to make you give a shit about anyone in the show. I can't even find myself hating the characters either, they are so boring and bland that they aren't likable but they aren't really unlikable other than a few \"quirks\" here and there. \\n\\n\r\nThe most annoying and boring characters are the MC and the Science chick. The MC is just boring as all hell with the typical can-do attitude every generic anime MC has. The science chick (I forget her name) is so chock full of annoying and boring tropes to make her seem so quirky that it's actually grating. She's one of the few characters who will get any reaction out of you, it's just not the reaction they wanted.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt was mediocre, but it could have been worse. That's really the only \"compliment\" I can give it. Overall this anime is like a 5/10. It's just such a \"safe\" anime. They take no real risks to spice things up and it has all these tropes and boring characters. It really is the epitome of mediocracy  \\n",

            "content": "Kado: The Right Answer offers up a unique premise for an alien-focused anime in that rather than the series being a typical action title focused on conflict between humanity and alien invaders, the series is instead focused on diplomacy and the questions that can arise if humanity suddenly gained abilities and technologies that it may not be ready to accept. These issues are present when human negotiator Kojiro Shindo takes on the job to work with the alien being, Yaha-kui zaShunina, in trying to express and comprehend the gifts that zaShunina provides to advance humanity's evolution.\r\nIn the issue of diplomacy, Kado focuses on the interactionsbetween Shindo and zaShunina, as Shindo serves as a mediator between the Japanese government and zaShunina in working out the interests of both parties. Besides mediator, Shindo also serves as a sort of confidante to zaShunina who expresses his desires for what he would like to bring for humanity with his gifts and Shindo even gets first exposure to them before the rest of humanity. Still in spite of this diplomacy and zaShunina's apparent benevolence, hints are dropped in early episodes that his motives may not be as benevolent as they would seem on the surface and this gradually becomes more clear as episodes progress into Kado's second half. Even then, the series does enough to develop a character dynamic between Shindo and zaShunina throughout the series where Shindo's interactions with the alien being affect him mentally in leading up to the show's finale.\\n\\n\r\nThe other matter in the series, humanity's being unprepared for rapid advancements, gets explored in how the world would respond to such changes and zaShunina's influence in offering them. As zaShunina deliberately chose Japan as the starting point for introducing his technology to humanity, these developments don't exactly make the other countries of the world enthused as they grill political pressure on Japan to share whatever they are provided from the start of the series. The Japanese government also gradually starts to express concern with the rapid advancement in zaShunina's progression of the abilities he bestows upon humanity as Shindo communicates the alien's goals and trying to come up with measures to minimize the effect this would have on the populace at large. Also as mentioned earlier, zaShunina's motives with providing humanity's rapid evolution not being so benevolent contributes to developments in this element of the series as the tools he provides for the advancement serve as components for the plans he has in place.\\n\\n\r\nI feel I should also address two rather controversial elements to Kado that need addressing, the first of which being in the form of the character of Saraka Tsukai, the Japanese government's own negotiator opposed to zaShunina's devices being bestowed upon humanity. There are some rather surprising revelations about her character that get revealed in the show's second half that some fans have assumed to be a deus ex machina of some sort. Granted the series doesn't provide any proper foreshadowing that hint to the revelations coming about. But at the same time, her concerns about zaShunina were brought about in earlier episodes and hints of zaShunina not being so benevolent were shown at points in earlier episodes as well. In addition, a case can be made where her stance on humanity's evolution is a representation of a naturalistic stance in allowing humanity's evolution to happen with time rather than speeding things up as zaShunina is attempting to bring about.\\n\\n\r\nThe second and most recent element would come in the form of the show's ending. Again, some may argue how it came about would be a kind of deus ex machina since hints of how the events come about were not hinted to in the anime's prior episode. I would argue in this particular case, enough was fleshed out in earlier episodes about the capabilities of the anisotropic where what came about was not necessarily so out of nowhere, especially with what is revealed about Tsukai. It also meshes up with the naturalistic views on evolution that Tsukai favors since the interactions between humanity and the anisotropic bring about a potential new path in evolution for both species rather than the rapid advancement that zaShunina was forcing about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I can kind of see where the events of Kado's second half may cause viewers of the series to be divided in their reception of it with some of the major seemingly sudden developments that I brought up above. Still, I feel that there was enough fleshed out and explored within earlier episodes of the series where the developments didn't completely come out of nowhere and made enough sense once you picked apart the hints alluded from earlier episodes. The series offers a rather engaging and solid exploration of debating about following a natural path of evolution or attempting to speed up the process, and creates some engaging chemistry in the interactions between Shindo and zaShunina with their growing relationship that eventually turns confrontational due to their differing ideologies on human evolution. Kado won't be for those that prefer their anime to be on the more action-heavy side. But if you are looking for a unique sci-fi title, Kado is an easy recommendation I would make.",

Please do not expect easy going high school anime based 13 - 18 teenagers mentality, neither plenty of action stuff or gayness. \r\nWhat you can find in Kado is interesting philosophy about universe creation, plenty of information based on physics, especially quantum theory, awsome psychedelic animation combined with splendid music. Also well done and lovely main and supporting characters, romancefor straight shippers (I love gay too but it just doesnt fit much into this kind of plot - species of the same gender can not reproduce...) funny scenes and every atributes what  quality anime shoud have.\\n\\n\r\nEven when you can get impression the develepmont is slow, each next episede provides you a lot of interesting information and takes you to higher level, as far as you are able to follow it. (reason why so many started to dislike Kado at some point)\\n\\n\r\nI can say this is the best sci-fi I saw in last 15 years of my life. Every simple details in this anime are connected and all the progres is absolutely logical, if you have sufficient background information  to understad. \\n\\n\r\nSo if you are the one interested about how and why was this universe created, about humans and their purpose of life, or if you aleready have som psychedelic experience, love fractals and all psy- conected stuf, you will love this unique piece of art created in extra high quality.\\n\\n\r\nI want to say thank you, creators of this anime, watching your work took me out of ordinarity of my everyday life and made me feel happy.\\n\\n\r\nPF: Watched the last ep recently, the end was obvious and didnt surprised me at all.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime I definitely feeled like watching Matrix movies 15 years ago, especially the last episode Yahakui vs. Shindo == Neo vs. Agent.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Everything about this anime is perfect - the intro and exit music, the design and pacing, the graphics are unreal crazy beautiful, and the characters are enjoyable.  The premise is very interesting - an alien being shows up without being detected by any nation's defense systems. It's weird ass space vehicle is called Kado and it sets down on a Japanese airport, absorbing a plane full of people in the process.  It just so happens that a highly ranked government negotiator is on the plane and he becomes the surrogate representative to the world for this alien being.\r\nBeyond the artistry of the graphics,I find it interesting how the reactions of people are being depicted. Granted, we only see a small population compared to the world.  The power plays being depicted are probably true to form in many ways, especially for governments. For instance, the alien offers a source for unlimited, sustainable, and non-polluting energy to share with everyone. But the United Nation lead countries want to take possession and decide how the power source should be used, who should have it, and of course the power utility brokers don't want it to be shared. \\n\\n\r\nThe ethical and moral dilemmas being portrayed are deep. What gives Setten Company the right to expose the world to mind altering technology just because it is offered by the alien?  Why isn't anyone questioning why the alien being has suddenly appeared on Earth, alone. \\n\\n\r\nI'm looking forward to seeing how some of my questions are answered and how the characters will be changed - both the alien being changed by exposure to Earth humanity and by the humans as they receive technology light-years beyond our capability of understanding.  I think this show is well done on many levels and is one of my current favorites.",

The ending in particular was very disappointing to me due to the abundance of tired anime tropes the series had done well to avoid or keep understated so far. \r\nThere is also no room left to explore the wider implications of anisotropic tech that earlier episodes seemed to promise. \r\nRegarding the Art,I will say that the anisotropic structures were rendered very well and were unmistakably alien. The music was also very good (especially that opening) and gave an inspiring vibe.\\n\\n\r\nIt's up to you whether - knowing what you know now - you'll still want to pick up KADO. It's a difficult series to rate numerically because those first few episodes really are very good, while those in the other half are uninspiring to say the least. I take a dimmer view of the overall series because it raised my expectations only to dash them, whereas some worse series at least show you what you're in for.",

I mean, come on, some \"higher dimensional\" being that comes into our average world to speed up our progress as a human race? I had to see how they would play this out realistically. I wasn't bored a single second of the anime because of how well they portrayed how an authentic government would handle something like that and anything this potential threat provided. So in that regard, the story lived up exactly to how it describesin MAL's synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and sounds were pretty decent, nothing to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I had a problem with in this anime was the ugly CGI and the ending. They mix the typical animation with CGI the majority of the time. CGI is ugly when you use it on main and supporting characters, but for special scenes with lights slapping everyone in the face and magical pewpew beams it looks really well, so I guess I can't complain.\\n\r\nIn the end it didn't turn out like Berserk's CGI animation, so I'm really thankful.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending could have been done better. It was like they just gave up trying to explain stuff and slapped something together to be Edgelord-worthy.\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr Good anime worth a watch if you like realistic first-encounter stuff, but has an ending that isn't the best, but NOT enough to judge the entire anime negatively.",

            "content": "This is one of the unusual anime I saw this year.\r\nI have not seen any anime that tries to touch questions that involve entire humanity for quite some time. In a sense, the anime on occasion gives impression similar to what I experienced when I watched Ghost in the Shell for the first time. Still...\r\nIt does not reach the same level, even though it obviously tries, and on occasion managed to make me feel as if I had a chance to take a look at something vast, big, alien.... or I don't know, it is hard to describe. \r\nDetailed breakdown below:\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nIt starts out extremelywell, however, it goes through series of ups and downs later, and has wildly varying quality. Some scenes are done in magnificient fashion, yet at the next moment it manages to present some sort of sub-par event that is rather mundane and is not as well executed as what you saw before. So, it is a bit of a rollercoaster ride. One thing you see something amazing, and then ext thing, something mediocre. I also didn't quite agree with some of the events, some of the ideas and some of the outcomes of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn a related note, the anime features fully adult cast, and is not set in school Which is great.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10:\\n\r\nThe anime uses mix of CG and traditional drawings. Half of it is performed as a full-cg render, then suddenly in the middle it starts using hand-drawn sprites, then continues using mixed approach. The CG looks great and reminds me of Sidonia No Kishi - it is the newer well executed style that blends very well with traditional animation. The use of CG is fully justified by the huge number of people, objects present in the anime, and various alien looking constructs, including kado itself. I think in the future we'll see more of this art style. I enjoyed it a lot, but there were a few scenes which were exectued less elegantly, and in some cases of hand-drawn characters they could use a bit more detail. \\n\\n\r\nStill, it looks good, and some of the moment were amazing.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10:\\n\\n\r\nI really liked the primary theme of kado that plays now and then. It had a feeling of \"magnificance\" to it, and was pleasant to listen to. The soundtrack fits the anime perfectly, without mismatching music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10:\\n\r\nSurprisingly, characters are not that great. Saraka Tsukai is incredibly well done, and the most believable, most sympathetic and most amusing character out of entire cast. The rest however, is less interesting more stereotypical, and suffers from a \"carton cutout\" syndrome. Basically, all moments involving Saraka were enjoyable, while in case of other characters, behaviors and interactions are less believable, more anime-like, somewhat cliched. Also, protagonist himself has a problem of not displaying too much information.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10:\\n\r\nWell, I liked it. The anime surprised it, but I think it could've been greater. Some of the moments presented in it were odd, and the story itself doesn't fully deliver what it could've been. Some of the story turns in the middle were quite cliched, and though I didn't quite see them coming, they weren't that greed.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10:\\n\r\nUnusual, interesting, and more \"smart\" anime that tackles difficult and BIG questions... except that it has couple of flaws, fails to deliver satisfying outcome in some cases, and some story turns are slightly underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching it, and would love to see more of stuff like this. So, It is recommended to watch this one. Even though it is not a masterpiece, it is a step in a right direction, and it is not bad.",

The score through out is pleasant and leaves moments feeling epic complementing stunning visuals of realistic scenery mixed with mesmerizing objects of the anisotropic.\r\nThe storyline plays out initially as an aliens from another world vibe with Yaha-kui zaShunina, an anisotropic being, a being from the 37th or so dimension, landing on an airportin Japan to spread knowledge of the anisotropic. The things he shows humanity offer in depth psychological insights for many syfy powers/abilities/inventions and what they mean for life as we know it. Later there are twists and unexpected happenings that improve upon the deep story, and honestly I just love the ending \\n\\n\r\nThe refreshing take on a realistic approach to first contact along with the many stunning parts of this anime make it a solid 9 for me and a personal favorite from this season.",

            "content": "*Review of first 6 episodes*\r\nWant to watch a non-hentai \"adult\" anime with a well-written story that takes your intelligence seriously? In a season very light on good original shows, Kado: The Right Answer may well be the best non-sequel of the season. Here's why:\r\n-Story- \r\nOn the surface Kado is a show about alien first contract. However, as the title suggests, the real emphasis of this anime is about whether humanity will choose \"The Right Answer\" - progress - or fail to grasp the opportunity because of infighting and reluctance to change. \r\nWhat makes Kado great is the quality of the writing. There's just enough tensionand mystery without descending into drama. The fact it is an entirely original story means that the episode to episode progression is mostly smooth with new reveals and information at a steady pace. \\n\\n\r\nThe reaction to the alien arrival is, unlike many alien stories and perhaps anime in general, realistic, nuanced, and intelligent. The reaction of the Japanese government, the public, and the international community to events seem close to what might actually happen. It is clear that a good amount of thought went into writing this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe only major flaw in Kado as of ep 6 is that in the most recent episode, there's kind of a cop-out regarding the reveal at the end of ep 5. This is the only time I've felt disappointed about the progression of the story. \\n\\n\r\n-Art- \\n\\n\r\nKado is a CGI anime which certainly will put some people off, but it probably works better here than it has in most anime in the past. The show is mostly people sat around talking to eachother, so there's less of the usual jerky animations associated with anime CGI. The models, especially yaShunina's, look fairly good. Overall Kado isn't a visual marvel but it's animation does the job. \\n\\n\r\n-Sound-\\n\\n\r\nThe nature of the story means the VAs don't get much chance to emote, but so far they all sound fine. The only annoying VA is the scientist girl, but that aspect of her character is I think intentional. The OP is pretty unique for an anime and sets the tone very well. \\n\\n\r\n-Overall- \\n\\n\r\nDespite its visuals and not being based on any source material, Kado is gaining more and more of a following and recognition, atleast in the western fandom - and for good reason. If the plot summary interests you at all, you owe it to yourself to atleast check out this very novel anime. \\n\\n",

            "content": "This story is 100% either love or hate it, there is no in between really. The following review may contain spoilers but the series is very difficult to review without such so I will try not to spoil too much but you have been warned.\r\nThe story starts out very solid but I wouldn't really give it a high score for its beginning, very fun and interesting to watch at the start but largely you feel it beginning to drag along as if feeling it becomes somewhat repetitive. Of course this changes drastically in the last part of the anime which is hands down a fantasticswitch up to make the anime not a standard 6/10 anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is an incredible way to explain first contact, a lot of the science is obviously bogus as we can't expect authors to all be PhD's in physics. But it perfectly mixes semi-fantasy with semi-sci fi. As the beginning will show it is not a standard sci-fi more advanced civilization but a being closer to god than man. This is where the premise really does an excellent job of trying to world build the idea of what zaShunina really is, it starts out as an excellent poltics meets science meets magic story but quickly it becomes apparent that isn't the main premise and thank god for it cause it was truly getting stale.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending itself is a masterfully crafted thing, using all the foreshadowing in the world to truly bring about the idea and leaves so much open to interpretation allowing a story that you can barely wrap your head around feel much more satisfying, nothing is worse than a complicated ending but being told exactly how things ended, that being said I wouldn't mind an OVA explaining a little bit of what happened to cause the ending (you'll know what I mean when you get there.).  The biggest issue I have with the end is Yukika who, although somewhat foreshadowed, seemed poorly implemented thought that could be because they had few episodes left to work with without making it obvious what the ending would be.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters really truly developed which is a lot more than can be said for a lot of series, you can feel the characters changing before your eyes each episode and opening up to let you peer inside and see what makes them tick, zaShunina above them all. Though Saraka's character was very stale and remained largely unchanged and somewhat boring, I didn't truly like her development as it seemed to have a huge focus and little results, though she was far from a bad character.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is great, a mixture of Haloesque music mixed with classical fantasy hymns. Played in the perfect tone at the right times.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is where it somewhat falls flat in my opinion, many praised the art and true it is far above what many CG series manage to do *cough* Berserk *cough* but that is like saying a man in a wheel chair is more mobile than a rotting corpse. The non-human CG is great and has incredible visuals and even the human CG is bearable but far from incredible, also the constant switching between classic drawn anime and CG was irritating and I would've much preferred only Kado be CG and perhaps the artifacts, everything else should have been drawn including zaShunina and his various powers. The fregonics CG being the only exception.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I loved this series, no 2nd hand embarrassment from having to watch cringe worthy characters, no obscene and out of control drama, just a nice sit back and enjoy action and political series with a touch of human emotion drama. I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't a teenager not even a year out of high school who thinks they are a physics grad student already and wants to complain the direction of its 'science' any person that thinks the science was great to begin with is just an idiot that wanted to think that, the science started off pretty bad and ended the same way because it was never meant to be a true science based series, it leans more towards fantasy and tales of gods and princesses than it does sci fi.",

But the other characters were poorly developed, especially like Agate who for some reason the show keeps cutting to but never did anything that develop the plot.  Other characters are there for no reason (Ritsu) or just tropes for trope sake (Kanata). But I gave it a 7 because the art was good and music was nice plus the concept was thought out even if the execution left something to be desired.",

Nothing about herrole in the plot was good. The more Saraka is featured the worse the story got, and she poisoned the depth of the anti-Imperialist subtext that allowed me to choke down that abrupt, unsatisfying ending.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the CG is dynamic, subtle, and well-utilized.

Everything may seem serious and require you to think a little bit along the show. But the pacing is easy enough for you to be relaxed and enjoying the show. With mind-blowing surprises here and there to keep you interested. This is definitely the strongest point of this show.\r\nArt: 8\r\nIts another 3d series, and it's actually good. Unlike other 3d series from before like Berserk and Ajin, there is a huge leap in quality for this show. The movement looks more natural, face expression and lip-syncalso much more accurate. Although the character design still pales in comparison with the high budget 3d movies, but for a tv show this is much better than before.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, choosing 3d for this show is the right answer (no pun intended). Because the sci-fi part of this show, also with our Alien friend nature and demeanor. Using a hand-drawn animation might be hard if not at least looks weird, hence the 3d.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nSince most of the time of the show spent with characters talking in a serious situation, there are hardly any BGM at all. It is a serious show after all. But that Op-Ed sounds really otherworldly and its mesh up nicely with the show so there is at least something to tell.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nA strong willed MC that working as a public servant and being praised as the miracle worker. An Alien that is a walking ball of mysteries. The heroine that may appear as a typical tsundere but actually has a deeper meaning to it. Also with various sub-character spread across the government, military and press and even scientist. This show has a lot of variety of people with their own personality and thoughts which is good.\\n\\n\r\nExcept, this may be a minor thing, but as a non-Japanese this may look a bit weird and biased to see that potrayal on Japs government being so clean and un-corrupted while the people of foreign organization like UN being treated as the greedy one.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nPersonally, i hate boring things like politics. But this show has shown me interesting stuff in sci-fi and philosophy that got me hooked into it until the end. Also probably because of those surprises that keeps popping up time to time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nMind-blowing sci-fi stuff, cool 3d animation and characters that full of mystery and surprises. If you like one \\n\r\nof them, you will definitely enjoy this.",

            "content": "*This review contains a bit of spoilers* \r\nKADO is a fascinating piece of science fiction. Have you ever thought about the progression of humanity? As a species, we have slowly evolved in terms of technology, morality, and politics that has helped us become \u201cbetter\u201d people. What if humanity could advance greatly in just a short span of time? KADO has that answer. What makes this anime so interesting is that it covers many topics on how humanity could advance, using special tools that further enhance human capabilities. \r\nIt\u2019s not just that, the more interesting part of KADO is how humanity and the main characters reactto having such growth. Each character has a unique personality explores a side of KADO that hooked me fully, ranging from news coverage, to researching, to handling negotiation for this mysterious gift for humanity. This will become clear once you have watched the anime yourself, I do not want give away much away. This blend of covering human advancement topics with the reactions to KADO is what makes the anime a seriously intriguing watch.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime I feel the community is severely undervaluing. Just because the last episodes of KADO have a dramatic shift in direction, it does not mean the anime can be immediately and conclusively be called bad. I can see where complaints come from, and to some extent, I agree. BUT! Truthfully, although I *somewhat* understand the themes of KADO, the last episodes were still VERY interesting enough with how the directing and dialogue was handled. These episodes do connect to the human advancement themes KADO has had right from the start with how the main characters and humanity grows throughout these 12 episodes once things are put together.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless if you think the last episodes of KADO was good or bad, I think we can agree that KADO did bring VERY interesting discussion! I would go as far as saying that it is nearly as much of a classic as Evangelion. Between the two, the themes of morality and human progression, I find KADO to be more interesting since it covers a more refreshing territory. Although, we'll see how people treat it the next couple of years to see if KADO becomes a cult classic. In this generation of anime fans, we\u2019re constantly cycling through new interesting anime season by season, we forget and move on to things quickly without gaining a sense of appreciation of what makes each anime valuable in its own right. Hopefully, the \u201cmajor\u201d anime fans of the community will continue to hold on to KADO for a new generation to discuss.\\n\\n\r\nI've come to a point where I find over-exaggerated emotional outburst opinions not interesting anymore, regardless how detailed it may be. This is more on the negative opinion side. If it's so easy to be negative, then we lose sight on the more interesting aspects of things. Negativity brings unneeded attention as well opinions that SEEM substantial, but in the root, do not go into deeper than emotional reaction.\\n\\n\r\nIt's why we have a life cycle of negative outbursts, never fixing the root of the problem, but quietly setting it aside, having no growth. IMO, if we wanna become better people, we have to set aside negative emotions and openly explore why certain things are so interesting. The more open you are to allowing discussion, the more curious you become in exploring many things in life, it makes life more worth it. This is why I find KADO so intriguing, because it gets you to think about a lot of things and the overall anime itself.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s a few things I wanted from the anime, was that it would explore Saraka more. Perhaps this was left for interpretation, or maybe it is that I have to watch the anime again to really understand Saraka more and why she kept her secret for so long. That\u2019s another thing, there are so many things worth talking about in KADO, it easily is worth a re-watch to further explore what the anime is trying to convey. There\u2019s also the inconsistency of CG and 2D. It\u2019s nothing jarringly bad, but it can be a bit distracting when a scene transitions from 2D to 3D. The whole anime should have been 3D the whole time through.\\n\\n\r\n*SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I personally think KADO should be hailed as an anime classic for how it really gets people to deeply discuss its themes and how human society can advance forward in the future. It is worth the watch regardless how the anime ends. Once you\u2019ve finish the anime, you have to let me know your thoughts and your opinion on the matter. Do you personally agree? KADO is a rarity that I find to be seriously intriguing and should be passed down to a newer generation of anime fans. I believe that is the right answer.",

            "content": "SPOILERS are contained within, but I tried to keep them limited to small sentences with big caps before.\r\nOkay okay okay, here's another review for an anime I think may have been misunderstood. I feel this is becoming a bad habit of mine! I will try to keep this spoiler free, but it's hard to discuss my opinion of the anime without bringing to light certain aspects of the anime.\r\nFirst of all I want to say that I can truly understand where many of the negative reviews (or even just the 4's and 5's) are coming from. The plot does take a rather sharp, and inmy opinion, pretty much un-guessable turn around episode 10. I know it threw me for a spin, and I can see why people were so frustrated by this seemingly random change in the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs many have mentioned, the first 8-9 episodes are pretty incredible the premise feels original, zaShunina is awe-inspiring yet inspires every curious bone in our bodies, the pacing is on the slow side, but steady, and filled with plenty of, \"whoa, holy shit really?\" moments. \\n\\n\r\nThen the big twist happens, and everyone suddenly seems like different people, almost literally (wink wink), the motives of zashunina are explained and feel, well, a little arbitrary, a little random, and kinda dumb. But the show does explain it if you pay attention. WARNING SPOILERS COMING zashunina is said to have in innate desire driving him to seek knowledge, and to seek more than he can process. In many ways it seems similar to our desire to eat. We need it, it drives us, and yet even when we've eaten we want more, and more, and more. Always hungry, never satisfied. I'd like to think that zaShunina, as an immortal being, has been 'never satisfied' for basically eternity, and then suddenly meets humanity, and is like an old man suddenly seeing the Fountain of Youth or something. \\n\\n\r\nI guess that's mostly what I want to say in this review the last episodes are a climax of an inevitable struggle between the two protagonists desires, neither can give in, and, as is so human, it leads to conflict. I think this is masterful of the show to do. SPOILERS!!!! Even as zaShunina brings humanity closer to the anisotropic, he is inevitably dragged closer to being human. \\n\\n\r\nAnd that's really what the show was about right? Not some 'Arrivals' esq anime about first contact, but an intense exploration into our own reality. Can there be more? Or is everything reduced down to 0's and 1's? I know I don't believe it is, I think there's more, maybe that makes me biased to like this shows ending, but hey, that's all opinions are right? \\n\\n\r\nSo hats off to a show that did a marvellous job exploring questions that have plagued the greatest minds of scientists, philosophers and garbage men since the dawn of man, with what tools they had and no more answers than we have.",

            "content": "*spoilers*\r\nStory: 6/10 \r\nIn the beginning, the plot is quite heavy which was about anisotropic beings creating things for humanity advancement and all that debating. Later on, it turned out to be saving humanity from anisotropic? That's when things went downhill for me. \r\nArt: 10/10\r\nTruly amazing visuals for the characters and the background scenaries. Everything was beautiful and really pleasing to the eyes for a CGI anime. \r\nSound: 10/10\r\nMusic was really good in this anime, ending, opening, for showing suspense, etc.\r\nThe seiyuus did a good job expressing the emotions for the characters, especially for zaShunina in the last episode. Extremely well done, felt so much emotionscoming from him.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development really came a long way, especially for zaShunina. Saraka was second. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally didn't like Saraka since the beginning I saw her. A tsundere debater and she turned out to be an anisotropic being, which was shocking.\\n\\n\r\nShindo was really smart and definitely one of my favourite characters. Tried his best to understand zaShunina and teaching him lots of things about humanity.\\n\\n\r\nzaShunina started off with no signs of expressions but later started showing more emotions like a human being after the 2nd or 3rd last episode which was great and very happy to see. The last episode was the best in how he expresses his feelings for Shindo and the cycle of emotions that he showed after Hanamori and Yukika appeared. Was 100% spot on, love it! My heart broke in a million pieces for zaShunina ;-; \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nIt started off really great and got me hooked to it but ended to be such a huge disappointment. 2 of my favourite characters died and it felt like it was rushed. Lots of unexpecting turn of events but they just had to make zaShunina the bad guy huh. Hated that concept/idea. \\n\\n\r\nEnding was pretty horrible and not what I expected. I have never disliked an ending so much. It had me go \"What? Ok ...\" I'm still so so upset about zaShunina's death. I feel that they could've made the fight end by him not dying? Not really for Shindo because he had to die in order to save humanity and buy time for Yukika. \\n\\n\r\n(Still would've preferred that Shindo didn't need to die and go by an alternative ending of Shindo leaving for the anisotropic world with zaShunina).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime had so much potential but the creators had to ruin it after making Saraka the main character and went off the wrong direction instead of focusing on the main plot, or at least what I expected this anime to be, which is sci-fi about \"humanity advancement\" and no romance at all. Sadly during the last few episodes, there was romance involved, which makes me want to forget them but I can't due to zaShunina's character development as a whole, it was splendid.\\n\\n\r\nSigh, like the majority of the viewers, it was great while it lasted. Wouldn't really recommend this for plot but you might like it either way, in terms of character development and art. Think the type of audience for this is for adult anime lovers.",

It also enables zaShunina to transfer between both worlds. It is owned by Yaha-kui zaShunina -- his goal is to advanced the world. Earlier in the series, Shindo has tried to negotiate with zaShunina to release him and everyone in the plane. This has led for the Japanese government to take action and eventually let Shindo become to spokesperson and negotiator for zaShunina. He has a few gifts from his world that he wants to share with the world. Manyof the world leaders (including the UN) to be skeptical. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nYaha-Kui zaShunina - A being from another universe, has a mysterious vibe that really makes you wonder about his state of mind and his true intentions, and owner of Kado.\\n\r\nShindo Kojiro - Negotiator for Foreign Affairs of the Japanese Government (very well-known), determined, kind, reasonable and understanding.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nReally interesting, enjoyed it. Loved political involvement with the UN & the government. The truth pertaining to humanity because some of the references they mentioned relates to our everyday crisis around the world. It is a really in-depth story (especially in the first few episodes) containing Political, Sci-Fi, and a lot of truth involving humanity. It has a bit of shocking twists and a lot of cliff hangers in the end & a lot of pondering with the characters.",

This is my first ever review as I felt a lot of reviews were fairly controversial, I just felt I should add my 2 cents in this.\r\nFirst the story I loved it. This anime to me was very unique. Alot of people seem to complain that the ending was lack luster. Plot holes. Etc Etc. But I think people forget a lot of animes are just filled with these. Now there are a few plot holes and 'Plot twist' that come from know where as people say isn't completely true,  they are slight build ups andI noticed them instantly. I didn't understand them fully because they are subtle such as 'What was that glare for?' \\n\\n\r\nI never found the plot holes to be incredibly big 'deal breakers' just a few rushed solutions. This anime did an AMAZING job at making they're characters have personality. I felt they were all unique. There isn't huge tropes like 'Tsundere'  saying \"Baka Baka Baka\" every sentence. \\n\\n\r\nThe ending did fall a bit short not to say it was BAD it just wasn't what you would expect from it i could say last few episodes were fairly more 'anime' then the rest of the show. But it ENDED, which a lot animes don't do anymore.. they just keep it open so you read the manga/lightnovel. I didn't have a problem with the ending I liked it, it could of been better, although it was way more 'This is an anime' type ending in the later episodes which was a little disappointing as they did an AMAZING JOB at keeping this anime ORIGINAL, and UNIQUE.\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry if this wasn't the best review this is my first ever review. I loved this anime tho. It was fresh to me and completely different from that 'No personality MC/ Otaku who gets all the girls and his own harem/ trope. \\n\\n\r\nI really wish I could give a better review but spoilers I feel can ruin it.  But I don't think the rating it got is deserved and should be higher. Anyone on the fence should give this a chance.",

            "content": "TLDR at this time is to wait until this show is finished before starting it or rating it. It's really balancing on a knife's edge right now and has the capacity to either finish strong or completely fuck everything that made it great with the most recent episode.\r\nSo I'm going to separate 2 different iconic aspects of the show which is something I don't usually do. The animation, and the story/premise. So the first thing I'm going to talk about that is of note is the animation. The animation is all CGI for the most part that uses cell shading to give the appearance of2D characters. This is honestly the best integration of CGI in a an anime that I've ever seen. The anime industry has been making great strides in doing this starting from Aku no Hana and Kingdom in 2013, and Kado really nailed it. The integration isn't perfectly seamless naturally. You can still tell that all the characters have 3D shapes but it certainly isn't jarring like what we've seen in the past and ends up working really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe second big aspect is the story. The premise is actually fantastic. Kado deals with many philosophical concepts associated with meeting a new more advanced form of alien life which seeks to fast forward humanity's growth. Firstly this is great, because for once we actually have a show that explores interaction with a benevolent alien species, not a blindly evil one, but the real thing that makes it great is the philosophical questions these interactions pose. How fast should civilization advance? Are our current political constructs more detrimental than they are helpful to the progress of mankind? For example, if humanity is given the opportunity to have unimaginable power, would it actually help us, or would it just make us destroy ourselves like nuclear weapons did. These are the questions Kado explores, and it does it very well for the most part. Kado is 100% the most thought provoking show of the season IMO, and I'm really excited to see where it goes.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I give it a 7? Honestly it was  going on an 8-9 for me until a recent turn in the series made me question if it was going to be able to keep true to what made it great. And honestly I don't think it will be able to with the direction it's going and will devolve into something much more base than it could be. I'm hoping to be proven wrong but these last few episodes will decide whether Kado will be a show to remember, or a show that will fade into obscurity after the season is done.\\n",

            "content": "Kado: The Right Answer has a great story that sometimes makes no sense to myself but I am not huge into that type. I love the aspect of it all and the dynamic all the characters had. I watched the dub and the voices were pretty good though sometimes the words were off from the mouths. That didn't matter much to me. \r\nThe story is about a man who is a great negotiator and ends up working for the white haired man for the greater good of the world. The plot has a ton of twists and turns that made every episode feel so shortbecause you just wanted to keep watching. Each episode made you wanting more and honestly I watched all 14 episodes in like 2 days. I would have watched them all in 1 if I could. \\n\\n\r\nThe part that gets a bit weird for me is the animation. Nothing against CG since it's work is just as hard. However, it didn't fit well with the characters. The cube and moments of things it was perfect. But for the characters it just seemed weird and stiff. Their movements were not fluid and the color was off from everything else around them. They couldn't emote very well so a lot of the times they looked emotionless or only slightly shocked, sad, etc. I get wanting to do the CG for the cube and all the details but maybe not for the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAnother odd thing was that it was only the main ones. All the others were drawn and even in the start of the anime they were drawn. This mix of both and going back and forth took me out of it sometimes. It's not that it's fully bad but maybe when CG gets better this risk could be taken. I think now it was a new thing I've seen myself personally but I just don't think CG is advanced enough to be mixed seamlessly into drawn. \\n\\n\r\nI found myself getting excited whenever I saw the drawn bits because they were so well done. I found myself getting hyped when I saw the CG of the cube moving and it's counterparts. The drawing parts are absolutely beautiful and I loved eventually seeing how they all look drawn. \\n\\n\r\nThe plot is what kept me into the anime when the animation made me feel a bit off. Everyone worked so hard on the anime, you can tell, even despite it's flaws it's a beautiful anime that keeps you stuck to your seat wanting more. It makes you think one thing, then change your mind, then change your mind again back later on. I prefer shorter animes but this one made me wish there was more. \\n\\n\r\nEven though I wished there was more it was rounded out perfectly. You didn't know too much about the characters but that didn't matter as much. I found myself pulling for the main guy and loving him so much. I even loved the white haired man and all his mannerisms up to the end. It's a beautiful constructed anime that if you don't mind the CG parts which is most of it then I say give it a go.",
