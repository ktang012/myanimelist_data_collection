            "content": "Grab a seat, sit back, and relax. Shokugek no Souma (Food Wars) is back and that means, fans are in for more treat and foodgasms. From the series that bought you excitement of cooking and extravagant culinary arts, the second season has a lot to offer as well and it\u2019s no understatement.\r\nFirst things first, the sequel is a direct continuation from the first and thus, the story connects from established characters and storytelling. Therefore, there\u2019s no reason to watch the second plate without tasting the first. Do note that there\u2019s also no recap so the second season really gets straight to the meat of thestory. That\u2019s a good thing anyway. Who wants to listen to boring narrative of recapping? Rather, the second season dives into the main course as the tournament (Fall Elections) gets underway. If you remember, main male protagonist Souma is an inspiring cook chef who wants to follow his father\u2019s footsteps into the culinary world. As a guy who is never afraid of challenges, it\u2019s interesting to see how he fares against his competition. The first of those is Alice Nakiri (Erina\u2019s cousin) and we see how both sides demonstrate their talent. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s often interesting about Shokugeki no Souma is often the clash of ideals because characters come from so many different backgrounds. For instance, Erina and Alice were both raised in a high class society so they lack understanding about people from below their class. This also adapts the way how Souma responds. If fans took notice, Souma often uses his own creative ideas to craft food rather than using fancy or stylish ingredients from the start. The point is that with so many ways characters can use to build on their talent, the second season capitalizes on them to make them memorable. Souma\u2019s talents aren\u2019t the only one being highlighted as characters returning from season one such as Megumi, Ryou, Akira, Hisako, and others get their own moments. Every one of these characters has their own cooking style so seeing them demonstrate what they\u2019ve learned shows their strengths and weaknesses. The season does a decent job at that through colorful explanation of the food making process while injecting humorous moments and details. Don\u2019t worry, if you\u2019re starving for some fan service because of the foodgasm, there\u2019s also that too.\\n\\n\r\nAs the titular character, Souma is still the face that gets the most highlight. In particular, his personal rivalry against one competitor named Subaru is something to remember. It\u2019s not because of what\u2019s at stake but because of Souma\u2019s willingness to take on the challenge. As I mentioned before, Souma is a daredevil. He likes challenges and often takes them for reasons beyond personal interest. Also do note that Souma isn\u2019t unbeatable and he does take a major loss. However, it\u2019s important that Souma is the type of guy that also learns from his mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of mistakes, I guess a season condensed into a single just one cour will result in what people call \u201crushing\u201d. Yes, the first season ran for 2-cour length of 24 episodes while the second season is only about half the length. What does that mean? It basically means material will be skipped to get straight to the main meat of the show. The first few episodes had me worried me a bit especially in the early stages. However, it doesn\u2019t destroy the storytelling altogether if you look carefully. In essence, the condensing is probably done to get the story flowing more or capture the more important elements of the manga. In particular, the second half of the season really gets intense with high level competition. Of course, there are still lots of room for humor and breathers in between. Just know that season 2 is much more about competition. Some of the final few episodes affirms Souma\u2019s motivation to improve himself and we get more background storytelling about his character.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, J.C. Staff is responsible for the anime production. The visual quality remains more or less the same as fans may remember. There are occasionally awkward camera angles but in most parts works well. It\u2019s noticeable that with the variety of themes offered during the tournament (bento, seafood, ramen, etc), the staff is able to capture the thrill of that. Fan service seems to be tamer compared to the first season especially in the early episodes but they are still there to make the fans droll. Meanwhile, the soundtrack remains somewhat less noticeable. While the theme songs are quite catchy, it just feels like the OST is overshadowed by other factors of the season. Voice mannerism still works quite well though in terms of delivery. One of the more noticeable character is a woman who speaks in broken Japanese which can be quite amusing to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe gimmick of Shokugeki no Souma has been a clever one. Taking the idea of making food and transforming it into something so colorful is what makes the show special. It\u2019s essentially a satire with characters using their talent to make food better than appear. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a clever joke and emphasizes more on how characters deliver their talent. The second season offers plenty of moments with these rivalries and moments you\u2019ll have hard time forgetting. We might not appreciate every humorous joke or foodgasm they throw at us. However, it\u2019s still enough to show that Food Wars remains a must-watch on the bucket list.",

            "content": "Order up!...AGAIN!\r\nShokugeki no Souma 2nd Plate left off where the first season did with the Autumn Election and it really ramps up the tension for Souma to be in the Elite Ten if winning the tournament.\r\nLA's views on the Shokugeki no Souma of the previous season was nothing but awe as to how cool and awesome the anime franchise which is essentially Iron Chef: The Anime with food porn and gasms which makes it weirdly unique to it and 2nd Plate may still have the same flavor (huhu) as the original season, but it both makes it great and falls under the same problems ofthe shounen genre and the original season did.\\n\\n\r\nFor what a food shounen anime comes in, this season still brings out some form of meaning this tournament and Shokugeki's this Election as well as the Stagaire has as well as make some of the more main cast members with the little screentime they had and ramps them up to be both badass and develop them further. Easy examples are Megumi Todokoro, the shy chef and Akira Hayama, the spice master and surprisingly enough Souma's development as a chef.\\n\\n\r\nBefore moving onto what's wrong with this season...the technical features.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, the animation is overall decent to the vibrantly flashy character designs as well as the tournament aesthetics, where the animation shines once again goes to the food, making you just drool at looking the gorgeously delicious food (by the way...HAVE FOOD WHILE WATCHING SHOKUGEKI...you'll be hungry if you don't) and is where most of the detail of the animation comes from. The animation overall is decent on par with the original season.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting at best can get overly hammy typical from the first season what with the more heated battles and wacky crazy contestants going against one another and really the voice cast were utterly great and added to the atmosphere be it a heated battle or the characters explaining about the food or how good it tasted due to how it was made, LA just can't put a favourite voice actor as the ENTIRE cast was great!. \\n\\n\r\nNow what's really wrong with this season?...well just by looking at the episode count in comparison to the original really says it all, 24 to 12...some of the Shokugeki battles gets rather rushed...to be precise, the tournament battles that are not important to the characters are like this, examples as Takumi Aldini vs. Subaru Mimasaka or Souma vs. Alice Nakiri, sure the \"meaning or theme\" is still shown, but the rushed portion comes in when these battles' food prep and \"how to make\" are skimmed over just to finish the battle before the episode ends. Now this comes off as both good and bad as with the season's episode count, they kinda DO want to hurry it along, but bad as feels rushed. Nonetheless, 2nd Plate even with it's rushed zigzag pacing isn't enough for LA to hate this season. The last problem and LA's own personal opinion is that LA knows that Souma gets the most screentime in this season, but LA wanted more of ERINA NAKIRI!!!, small flaw but LA knows why the focus is on Souma.\\n\\n\r\nEven the character development's zigzagged pacing gets a pass as even with this huge of a cast and the rushed Shokugeki battles, the combatants are still presented and developed even to the point even Souma's win record turns his character development even better as even he evolves as a character and not your typical \"always win main protagonist\" type. In terms of character development like Souma's screentime compared to the rest, Souma has the majority of the focus especially when it comes to Souma's battles in the Autumn Election, but he really has the majority of the focus come Stagaire. But for Souma's opponents as well as other contestants going against on another during the Election, they to during their battles brought up their development as a chef or personal developments again easy examples are Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending which brought to a finish the Stagaire mini arc, and really LA MUST point out that the Stagaire arc was one of thee best arc in Shokugeki no Souma, as it went more into the realistic look at restaurant and trying to be the better chef using new methods they learned. Ni no Sara by all means with it's strengths and flaws, it was on form, not all the way through but it still had the flavour and intensity of the original season and LA LOVED Ni no Sara for that...what else is there to say but...\\n\\n\r\nLA wanted more...LA wants a 3rd Plate for all LA cares...",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma returns after an extremely successful 1st season... and it is just as entertaining as the previous edition. \r\nShokugeki no Souma has been one of my favorite series for some time. Why? It's because it so damn entertaining. Where it might lack in the story, it makes it up for its consistent entertainment found in every single episode. That's not to say the story is bad however, as I find it quite fun and solid. Don't like ecchi? Well, as much as others like to say it, the show isn't ALL about those ridiculous 'foodgasms'. It also involves a good amount of emotions,fun 'battle'(cooking) scenes, and decent amount of development. In fact, I'd honestly like it just as much without the foodgasm scenes. The amount of effort and detail they put into the food and cooking is enough to make even the viewers craving for the food. And all things considered, this is how you do a proper cooking anime, making viewers hungry for more and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the 2nd season is just as amazing as the first. Although having a slightly rushed first episode, it manages to pick back up the original pace without too much dragging and rushing. he fast-paced cooking scenes are animated so fluidly and the whole show is just an eye-catcher in terms of the characters and the food. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, it does get rushed a bit in the later episodes again, but not too much. This kind of problem could have been fixed if the anime was 2 cour but unfortunately it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the music is one of my favorite aspect of the anime adaptation. Along with the animation, it just adds so much more to the scenes, especially the cooking scenes. Also really liked the fact that they still kept a couple of great osts from the first season as well. OP/ED are worth checking out as well, although I still prefer the 1st season ones.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great, but nothing too amazing i'd say. Each VA's fit their roles well, and big props to the VA's who had to do the foodgasms, because they sell it hilariously well. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the characters look like your typical shounen stereotypes. However, the thing that makes me actually like these characters are that every single character are just entertaining to watch, as in no annoying characters whatsoever imo. The character interactions are great, and it does have a good amount of developments throughout the story. They have a bit of depth in them, and all of them are just really likable. For me, the best part of the series is the protagonist, Yukihira Souma. He is such a smooth MC: not annoying, boring or anything of that matter. He's the one that brings all the comedy, entertainment and the intensity of the show together. At times he's just straight up ridiculous and silly, but he also has this serious/badass side, and that's when you know shit is about to go down. Overall, the characters might seem like shounen cliches, but the cast makes it up for being very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of Shokugeki no Souma are a great, entertaining watch for anyone. Unfortunately, since it's only 13 episodes, some contents from the manga are indeed skipped, and the pacing is a bit inconsistent at times. But even without the skipped parts, the story is still tied well together. Some of you might not like it if you aren't that into the concept of foodgasms but it's still worth the watch purely for the entertainment it effortlessly brings on the table.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma was a big surprise for many for 2015. What initially seemed like a weird mix of shounen, cooking and ecchi turned out to be one of the most interesting and suspenseful anime of the year. It ended up being one of the most popular anime of the year. With the first season ending incomplete, the second season\u2019s role was to finish up what was started. Although the second season never reaches the heights of the first season due to its really fast pacing and lack of buildup, but even with a flawed adaptation, Shokugeki no Souma is some of the best funyou\u2019ll have this year. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story continues off right from where the first season ended. After the Autumn Election preliminaries in the first season, the series starts off with the quarterfinals, focusing on the characters that managed to get to this point. So basically, this season starts off straight into the action. The thing is that the writing in general is fairly unpredictable, unlike the first season of the anime. Maybe the one who you\u2019ve expected to win may not. The previous series focused more on Souma and his journey in learning more about cooking. This season focuses more on all of the finalist and what cooking and victory means too them. But the series still doesn\u2019t forget about Souma as he\u2019s on a journey to find his own style of cooking. The season is comprised of two different arcs. The first nine episodes are the rest of the Autumn Elections arc that was left incomplete in the first season. The last four episodes is the entirety of the Stagiaire arc. Now, the series would have been a lot better if they had time to build situations up, but the rushed adaptation prevents to do so. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThose who are familiar with the first season will feel home with the second season. Back to some more shounen-style cooking with over-the-top reactions and, of course, foodgasms. The style remains the same as the previous season, but unfortunately the same can\u2019t be said about the pacing of this season. When the episode count of 13 episodes was announced and the PVs teased the Stagiaire arc, red flags were being raised. I knew that the adaptation won\u2019t be as good as I was hoping it to be, but I wished that I would be proven wrong. Sadly, that wasn\u2019t the case here. What should\u2019ve been done in 19 or so episodes ends up being done in 13. The rest of the Autumn Elections arc should\u2019ve been done in 15 episodes, but it was pushed into 9. That means that roughly each episode adapted 4-5 chapters, which is not ideal for a manga series that has a fair amount of dialogue. A manga adaptation of JoJo can get away with that, but not Shokugeki no Souma. Due to the fast pacing, many moments that should\u2019ve felt tense don\u2019t end up feeling so, and the lack of buildup makes you feel less interested in the matches. The most ideal adaptation would\u2019ve been the rest of the Autumn Elections arc, the Stagiaire arc, and the arc after that, all being adapted in a two-cour series. But unfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. \\n\r\nPresentation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nWith the second season, you\u2019ll be seeing the old characters back in action, but you\u2019ll be seeing some new characters too, particularly a finalist you probably haven\u2019t seen yet. Shokugeki no Souma had a fairly huge cast, and most of the characters ended up being either memorable, interesting and hilarious. The series revolves around Yukihira Souma and how he uses his skills to succeed in the world of cooking. But it\u2019s not just about him doing, but also about him learning. And we also have many returning characters like Tadokoro Megumi, Nakiri Erina, and many more. But a good chunk of the series mainly focuses on the finalists of the Autumn Elections, which are Souma, Megumi, Alice, Kurokiba, Hayama, Takumi, Mimasaka, and Hisako. And this season develops on those characters more than they did in the last season. You\u2019ll be seeing backstories for characters like Kurokiba, Hayama, and Alice, and they add more of a meaning to these matches. These characters end up feeling more complex than just a simple rival. And knowing what these characters value the most makes you not just cheer for one person.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art quality is basically the same as the previous season, and just like the previous season, there aren\u2019t any noticeable quality drops. Shokugeki no Souma\u2019s art style is quite simplistic and is the one you would typically see in a typical school comedy. But more detailing is put for things of greater value, like the dishes in the series. Just like the previous season, comedic moments would be shown using chibi-looking characters and that helps add to the humor of the show. The foodgasms fanservice look just as good as the previous season. The backgrounds look quite nice, though most of the backgrounds in the series is more in buildings rather than outside. When compared to the manga\u2019s art, it is a little lacking as some facial reactions can look more badass in the manga. But that\u2019s a situation evert anime has since a still panel from a manga enables the mangaka to put more details than an animated scene where each frame needs detailing. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations quality is also the same as the first season, and just like its art quality, it\u2019s quite consistend throughout and there\u2019s barely any quality drops. Never once did it seem like they were saving budget and cutting it short, and the same went for the first season too. The animations for the cooking moments look pretty good. The animation quality is pretty much what you would expect from J.C. Staff at this point. It\u2019s nothing mind-blowing, but it\u2019s not like as if an anime like these needs animations like that. My only concern is that outdoor backgrounds can look a little static, but most of the anime is taken place within buildings anyways. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast remains the same in the second season. The voice acting in the first season was excellent, however most of the seiyuu are pretty unknown. Souma is voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and he does a great job as the confident, yet curious protagonist. His effort here is of course nowhere near the level of his role as Petelgeuse in Re:Zero, but it\u2019s not like as if that\u2019s necessary. Megumi is voiced by Takahashi Minami again and she does a very good job, even if her role wasn\u2019t as important as it was in the first season. Taneda Risa returns to do Erina, but just like Megumi, there\u2019s not much of her to begin with. However, characters like Hayama and Kurokiba play a bigger role in this season and their seiyuu do a very good job. Okamoto Nobuhiko knows how to do raging characters well, so he did a great job as Kurokiba. And Suwabe Junichi did a great job as the composed, yet focused Hayama. Overall, the returning cast does a great job again with their characters. The \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music was mostly excellent in the first season and the same can go for this season too. The OP, \u201cROUGH DIAMONDS\u201d, is a very good song made by SCREEN mode. The music for the OP sounds like something you would hear from a battle shounen anime, but it\u2019s not like Shokugeki isn\u2019t as intense as a battle shounen. The ED,\t \u201cSnow Drop\u201d, was done the really loved and popular band, nano.RIPE. Though it might not be their best, but the song is pretty good. I\u2019m not a big fan of the band\u2019s vocalist though. The soundtrack for this anime is the same as the soundtrack used in the first season. Though I haven\u2019t noticed if there\u2019s any track that is new in the series. My favorite one (just like the last season), \u201cFood Battle Start!\u201d, is used very well in the anime to create suspense. Some of the over-dramatic music used when the dishes are being judged adds to the absurdness of the series too. \\n\r\nMusic: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nEven with the lackluster adaptation, I found it very hard not to enjoy the second season of Shokugeki no Souma. With more shounen-style cooking, mouth-watering dishes, over-the-top foodgasmic reactions, epic one-liners and references to other series, it\u2019s got everything I expect from a sequel to Shokugeki no Souma. Although what should\u2019ve been Shokugeki\u2019s best arc ended up being one of its weakest do to a rushed adaptation and lack of buildup. But the characters are developed just as effectively as they were in the manga. I still enjoyed this season, and it\u2019s one of my favorite of the year, but what could\u2019ve been amazing only manages to be great and nothing more.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shokugeki no Souma, chances are that you have already watched this season. But if you haven\u2019t then you should do so. The supporting character are more developed than before and are now much more complex as characters. Even Souma got more development as his goal from reaching the top got turned into finding his own style of cooking. And you get what you know and love from the first season too. However, the really rushed adaptation makes this season lack the intensity and buildup the last season. It\u2019s quite disappointing that the manga\u2019s best arc got a not so good adaptation. But even with the lackluster adaptation, there a lot of find in the second season of Shokugeki no Souma.\\n\\n\r\n+ The shounen-style, over-the-top cooking, and foodgasms are back.\\n\r\n+ Supporting characters are well-developed and some receive proper backstories.\\n\r\n+ The great background music used in the first season is back and new OP and ED are very good. \\n\r\n+ Souma is developed more as a protagonist who needs to find his own style of cooking.\\n\r\n- Very rushed as an adaptation and makes the series lack any proper buildup or intensity. \\n\r\n- Never reaches the heights of its first season, despite adapting the best moments from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "The only thing frying in this culinary show were my brain cells.\r\n*Character*\r\nSo you've got the main character, who is the greatest cook ever!  He's so good, no one can believe how good he is!  And he fights other cooks in cooking battles, and he always wins!  Except when he loses, but even when he loses we are still reminded that he's sooooo great!\r\nThen you've got this Meat Girl.  She's the BEST at meat!  Not as good overall as the main character, who is the greatest in the whole world, but she does have huge, and I mean HE-YUGE tatas.I'm talking boing boing boing sandbacks that will surely result in severe lower-back problems at a tragically young age.  Did I mention how ENORMOUS her boobs are?  She is never shown without her leopard-skin rag-bra.   Ever seen a porno staring Wilma Flinstone?  Me neither, but now you don't need to!  Now that I've covered her cleavage, I should probably move on to her number one character trait: that would be her boobs!\\n\\n\r\nMy other favorite character is Failure Girl.  Failure Girl is great because she can't succeed at anything.  Except when the main character believes in her, that is!  And then we're reminded of how great he is (did I mention he's the best ever?).  There's one scene later on in the show where, despite Failure Girl's absolute lack of any self confidence whatsoever, she manages to achieve a high score because she remembered a trick the Main Character taught her!  All of her achievements are attributed to him in some way.\\n\\n\r\nYou've got some other great characters, too.  There's your Stern White-Haired Godess, who has magical God-Taste powers (I'm not joking) and is always watching with contempt from afar as our Main Character proves himself time and time again to be the best.  There's the Hot Food Judge, whose entire set of dialog only consists of two lines: \"That looks disgusting, that can't possibly taste good!\" and \"I AM LITERALLY ORGASMING FROM THIS RICE!!!! [sexual squeal]\".\\n\\n\r\nYou've got Gay Dude, who frequently strips naked in the most inappropriate situations (as gay people do!).  He loves gardening!\\n\\n\r\nThere's Character Foil, the main enemy of Main Character, but really he's just Main Character with a different paint job and slightly less skills.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Cast Of Minor Characters Who Each Have Specific Shallow Character Traits, they kind of blur together.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nFor a show about food and the culinary arts, everything looks suspiciously like the fake plastic imitation meals that sit outside restaurants in Japan: colorless and dull, plasticy and off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nBut since most of the youngsters this show is targeted towards are only here for the boobs: rest assured! They're drawn as engorged as ever.\\n\\n\r\nMain Character looks like most main characters and has a great head of Main Character Hair.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI bet you didn't know this many sound effects for bouncing breasts existed!  And the orgasmic shrieks of bliss as the judges are overcome by the pleasure of eating Main Character's meals will leave you craving a bowl of udon for sure.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nYou may be wondering how the show remains interesting when its only plot device is an Anime Food Battle with no stakes and no purpose.  The answer is easy: it doesn't!  Anyone who has the intelligence to speak a human language should feel insulted that this show exists.  This show even eschews the traditional \"shounen\" plot progression where our hero wants to be the best at The Thing, so he works really hard all season to be good at The Thing, and then finally achieves The Thing (or doesn't, but learns a lot along the way!).  Instead, this show cuts right to the chase, and our hero starts out ALREADY best at The Thing!  All he has to do is prove it!  Again... and again... and again.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall*\\n\\n\r\nI would rather eat a bowl of nails than suffer through another 22 minute of this show.  Even the worst restaurant in the world would never serve up a slice of meat that stunk this bad.\\n",

            "content": "So much hype for such an overrated series that can't get proper development. I see how it is nowadays with people's liking (Not that my liking is any good, it's just a saying). Such mediocre and predictable storyline with many \"serious\" encounters that won't ever happen in real life.\r\nStory. 5\r\n- As for the story, i don't understand what's the point. From a realistic point of view, none of this could ever happen, from the fanservice that makes no sense to those serious glances. \r\nThere's no real story, it's just the main character trying to be a thug and one of the best chefs, by beingslow. Everything is the same as previous seasons with the fact that first season had a more creative storytelling. At this point everything is about food battles with no real meaning and a bunch of almost if not nude scenes, resulting in 0 progress done, like what happened with that first half? Nothing?. Even those TV cooking shows have a better growth.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 3\\n\r\nThe art was horrible from a certain distance (Season 2 was worse, trust me). The animation was poorly done but at least you could get the idea of what was going on, i'll give props on that. Only on close shots you could see a certain progress compared to bigger shots with a lot of people or just a few.\\n\r\nFaces were the worst on trying to mimic feelings, i fully understand they wanted to give a proper sensation of them, but they are too exagerated that they were not funny but rather unpleasant. On the other side, i find it funny that Souma never changes his uniform, not for cooking, not for being in the house, not for anything. While everyone else respects the rules on that.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 5 \\n\r\nI haven't been enjoying the OP and ED as much i would like, but it doesn't matter. The music is put on good placed and properly decreased the volume if someone was talking, but there is too much music in the show, of a 21 min. episode, at least 17 minutes have music in it. I don't really like that, i feel like they are trying to get me excited when i shouldn't be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 4\\n\r\nThere was no real progress from season 2 for the main characters, but rather there's a bit of development for support characters. Some of them have changed, some don't even appear anymore, and some of them is like they didn't even care to give them a proper development, you get to see everything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nThis is just an overrated show that didn't deserve my attention, but still got it. It's far from being the worst i've seen but it's certaintly bad and extremely predictable. The ending was a cliffhanger, with again, predictable decisions. The idea of adding a bad guy that would get the support of superior people is not new and not enjoyable. The series just keeps going down and down for me, nothing i can do though.",

            "content": "Having enjoyed the first season I was glad to hear we were getting more, but what we got wasn't more.  In the 2nd season of Shokugeki no Souma they've chosen to abandon anything resembling story or character development and given us a cooking competition.  The first 10 episodes are a series of duels with different characters we have no reason to care about and the final 3 episodes are \"restaurant rescue\" episodes.\r\nNow abandoning a story isn't necessarily bad.  I like cooking shows, I watch Beat Bobby Flay, Cuthroat Kitchen and many others, none of which have story or character development either.However much of what is said on Shokugeki no Souma is factually wrong and it's clear the writers of Shokugeki no Souma have never even seen a Michelin starred kitchen let alone been in one.  With food that are \"scent bombs\" that can instantly fill a stadium with aroma and where every bite causes an orgasmic clothing-destroying explosions in the judges, this show has as much to do with cooking as a bullet dodging anime has to do with fighting.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are we left with given there is no story and what they're doing is reality ignoring make believe?  We have a kid who is the best in the world kicking butt and saving adult run restaurants better than Gordan Ramsay could dream of.  In other words it's a chunibyou power trip with the magic being kitchen knife wielding skill rather than a sword or a spell.  But don't fret, huge breasted high school girls all admiring the main character are there too for people that want a touch of harem flavor in their otherwise flavorless show.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, there is really nothing here to watch.  Give the second season of Chef's Table a watch if you want to see some of the best chef's in the world at work, or Beat Bobby Flay, Knife Fight, Cuthroat Kitchen etc. a watch if you want to see a cooking competition.  Not only are they better, they're also real, not magical nonsense.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma's characters all have one goal: be the best chef. They all have different reasons for wanting to be the best, as the show will often remind you, but in the end their goals are one and the same. Perhaps that's what makes this second season of Shokugeki fall a bit flat. They're simply not progressing towards that goal for the majority of the show. It starts to make everything feel a bit pointless.\r\nThe majority of my complaints for this season come from the tournament arc:\r\n-It barely matters who wins.\r\nWinning the tournament simply shows that you are the best in the class. Whilethat definitely aligns with the characters' goals, it also has no significance in the grand scheme of things. The series often reminds the viewer that these are just students we're following by showcasing the alumni of the school who are successful chefs. These constant reminders doom the arc's conclusion into the winner believing they still have a way to go. Of course, the losing characters all have the same thought. If the characters aren't satisfied with the conclusion and there are no tangible results win or lose, it's tough to find purpose in the events. Contrast this with the first season when expulsion was the result for failure and you can see how the intensity was dialed down a notch.\\n\\n\r\n-The fights themselves are tough to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be a personal thing, but I'm not extremely well versed in cooking. When Hayama is describing all these spices that I last used to cure status conditions in Star Ocean, I'm stuck just trying to imagine how these things would taste. When you're watching an action show you can tell who's winning by how much damage each side has taken. In a sports show you look at the points. Winning conditions are easy to follow. In Shokugeki it's much more difficult to gauge who is winning the battle. In the tournament in particular, you're often relying on the judges' and crowd's reactions to tell you who's winning. The results of the fights could be switched and I would be none the wiser.\\n\\n\r\n-There's little forward impact on the characters (yet).\\n\\n\r\nThe arc gives a little motivation to Souma in the end, but by and large the cast is static. There's nothing inherently wrong with static characters. However, Shokugeki wants its characters to progress and get better at cooking. In that sense, it needs the characters to constantly improve. The best the arc does towards that is getting the characters to be more creative. In the short arc afterward we see some brief glimpses of the cast but no one besides Souma has seemed to change at all... and Souma is pretty much the same anyway. The tournament ends and it feels like the show is just like \"Welp, on to the next arc.\"\\n\\n\r\nTake my criticisms with a grain of salt. Obviously this season isn't a full adaptation of the manga. The results of the tournament might become more important later. It's the fact that there are little immediate results that makes the arc feel unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the following short arc brings the show back to its strength: high-pressure situations that aren't cooking battles. It puts the characters (but focusing on Souma) in a high-pressure situation in which they are quickly forced to improve or else face negative consequences. It's far more interesting and intense. I wish it had been longer.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation/sound... it's all basically the same as the first season. It's not so bad that you're going to complain. It's not so good that you're going to be awed. It's good enough to get the job done. Frankly, that's good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints about the tournament arc, it still had its moments of fun. Shokugeki's cast is fun to watch. So even if what the characters are doing isn't interesting, the cast's exaggerated personalities and silly reactions can make it enjoyable all the same. If you enjoyed the first season because of the cast interactions, then this season will not disappoint.",

Staff delivered once again in the art department, with quality animation and food that looks so good and tasty that you better not be eating in that moment or you will feel disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you liked Shokugeki, get ready for 13 more episodes of pure awesomeness, if you haven't watched the first season yet...

            "content": "I honestly wanted to enjoy the second season of Shokugeki no Souma much more than I did. Don't get me wrong.... it's good, but not as amazing as the first season. I'm a bit disappointed, but not all that surprised.\r\nI don't have much to say about the animation here. If you enjoyed the quality of the animation in the first season, you get the same thing here. I literally couldn't tell if there were any improvements, despite the fact that it's a new season.\r\nMusic for Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara is pretty good. The OP and ED are nice. I wouldn't say they're quiteas good as the first season though. The score for the rest of the show hasn't really changed. It's just as good as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems I had with this season was the story. As everyone already knows, the first season ended in a cliffhanger, which I was not too happy with. Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara continues exactly where the first season left off. At first, I was excited, but I after a few episodes in, I realized what was going on and became utterly disinterested in the series. There's little to no real story in Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara. No, instead it's pretty much one food battle after another. That's the majority of this season. It got tiring and boring after awhile. I mean, the jokes are still funny and everything, but I was hoping for some more character development and a story that dealt with self-discovery. That's not what this is. Not only that, but the ending was pretty disappointing as well. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, because the story suffered, so did the characters. They still have the same personalities as the first season, and they do grow, but not by much. As I said before, it's literally just one battle after another. With the first season, I felt like there was a lot of downtime between battles where we got to learn more about the characters and their past. Sure, that happens here, but not much. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I was pretty disappointed with Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara. It still has the humor and charm of the first season, yet, I definitely felt it was missing a lot of what made that first season so good. Would recommend as a time waster - not much else.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nAnyone who has seen \"Shokugeki no Souma\" knows perfectly well the qualities that Soma's and company's story possesses: gastronomy as a flag, humour in abundance, charismatic characters, competition and the desire to learn, a varied and quality soundtrack... In short, an anime clearly thematic (because it is) and worth a lot of money. The summary is simple: if you liked the first season, you'll enjoy this sequel, because it's still great and it still holds the keys that made its predecessor great.\r\n\"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" is basically a pure and clear sequel. In fact, it starts immediately after thelast scene we saw. So all those main features are kept intact, fortunately. I'm not going to expand on his qualities too much, because I already did it in the review of the first season (I encourage you to read it) and I think it would be repeat myself too much. What I will do is comment on the changes/new aspects that I think are worth mentioning, as usual I do in the sequels reviews.\\n\\n\r\nThe change that draws attention first of all in \"Ni no Sara\" is that it is a \"short season\", specifically 13 chapters, for the 25 that we enjoyed in the previous one. This has a very clear consequence: there is less time for frills and whirlpools. \"Ni no Sara\" comes straight to the point. I know there are people who like this quite a bit, but \"Shokugeki no Souma\" is an anime that, because of its characteristics, looks very good with the \"slice of life\" and those \"coexistence\" episodes in which we get to know and empathise more and more with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, despite having almost half the episodes, they have managed to develop and maintain their rhythm to perfection. The two different parts of the plot (autumn tournament on one side and practice on the other) work perfectly. The vibrant autumn tournament, full of surprises, sometimes fun and sometimes tense, is a true ode to gastronomy and cuisine in each of its clashes. Next, I found the arc of the practices so interesting that I would have liked to have seen more of them. They had enough material to do it. It has been a great respite after 7-8 episodes full of culinary battles one after the other, but at the same time it is a dose of reality in which they have managed to capture with surprising accuracy what it feels like to enter the kitchen of a restaurant as a novice.\\n\\n\r\nThe squad of characters is still as spectacular as ever, even better, as they've slightly reworked the ratio of protagonisms and appearances, to downplay the less interesting characters (like Aoki and Satou or Ibusaki) and begin to give way to others who emerge as key players in the plot, such as Megumi, Hayama and the duo Alice/Ryo.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that is still great is the music section. Most of the melodies are really known from the first season, but the level was so high, that obviously the BSO of \"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" is still a wonder: varied and of high quality. I can't say the same thing about opening and ending. In my opinion, they've lowered the level with them. . For this second season they have chosen two songs with stronger and more aggressive tones, metal style. I imagine it's to match the theme of the season (autumn tournament, fights everywhere), but honestly, I've really missed the OP1 and both endings (especially the second one, which is wonderful) of the first season. I think they fit in much better with the atmosphere of the series and the way in which \"Shokugeki no Souma\" conveys joy and good cheers.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nQuien haya visto \"Shokugeki no Souma\" sabe perfectamente las cualidades que atesora la historia de Soma y compa\u00f1\u00eda: la gastronom\u00eda como bandera, humor a raudales, personajes carism\u00e1ticos, competici\u00f3n y ganas de aprender, una banda sonora variada y de calidad... En definitiva, un anime claramente tem\u00e1tico (porque lo es) y que merece much\u00edsimo la pena. \\n\\n\r\n\"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" es b\u00e1sicamente una secuela pura y dura. De hecho, empieza inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de terminar la \u00faltima escena de su antecesora. As\u00ed que todas esas caracter\u00edsticas principales las mantiene intactas, por suerte. No voy a extenderme demasiado con sus cualidades, porque ya lo hice en la review de la primera temporada (os animo a leerla) y considero que ser\u00eda repetirme demasiado. Lo que har\u00e9 ser\u00e1, como de costumbre en los an\u00e1lisis sobre secuelas, comentar los cambios/nuevos aspectos que creo que son dignos de mencionar.\\n\\n\r\nEl cambio que llama la atenci\u00f3n en primer lugar en \"Ni no Sara\" es que es una \"temporada corta\", concretamente 13 cap\u00edtulos, por los 25 que disfrutamos en la anterior. Esto tiene una consecuencia muy clara: hay menos tiempo para florituras y remoloneos. \"Ni no Sara\" va al grano, directamente y sin rodeos. S\u00e9 que hay gente a la que esto le agrada bastante, pero \"Shokugeki no Souma\" es un anime al que por sus caracter\u00edsticas le sienta muy bien el \"slice of life\" y esos cap\u00edtulos \"de convivencia\" en los que vamos conociendo y empatizando cada vez m\u00e1s con los protagonistas.\\n\\n\r\nPor suerte, a pesar de tener casi la mitad de cap\u00edtulos, han sabido desarrollar y mantener el ritmo a la perfecci\u00f3n. Las dos partes diferenciadas de la trama (torneo de oto\u00f1o por un lado y pr\u00e1cticas por el otro) funcionan a la perfecci\u00f3n. El torneo de oto\u00f1o vibrante y repleto de sorpresas, a ratos divertido y a ratos tenso, una aut\u00e9ntica oda a la gastronom\u00eda y la cocina en cada uno de sus enfrentamientos. Seguidamente, el arco de las pr\u00e1cticas me ha parecido tan interesante que me habr\u00eda encantado que se hubieran explayado m\u00e1s con ello. Material ten\u00edan de sobra para hacerlo. Ha sido un respiro genial despu\u00e9s de 7-8 cap\u00edtulos repletos de batallas culinarias una detr\u00e1s de otra, pero a la vez una dosis de realidad en la que han sabido plasmar con sorprendente exactitud lo que se siente al entrar como novato en la cocina de un restaurante.\\n\\n\r\nEl plantel de personajes sigue tan espectacular como siempre, incluso algo mejor, ya que han retocado un poco el ratio de protagonismos y apariciones, para as\u00ed restar importancia a los personajes menos interesantes (como Aoki y Satou o Ibusaki) y empezar a darle cancha a otros que emergen como claves en la trama, como Megumi, Hayama y el d\u00fao Alice/Ryo.\\n\\n\r\nOtro aspecto que sigue siendo genial es el apartado musical. Realmente la mayor\u00eda de melod\u00edas son conocidas ya de la primera temporada, pero el nivel era tan alto que obviamente la BSO de \"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" contin\u00faa siendo una maravilla: variada y de calidad. No puedo decir lo mismo sobre opening y ending. En mi opini\u00f3n han bajado el nivel con ellos. Supongo que va a gustos, pero para m\u00ed es as\u00ed. Para esta segunda temporada han elegido dos canciones con tonos m\u00e1s fuertes y agresivos, estilo metal. Imagino que es para cuadrarlo con la tem\u00e1tica de la temporada (torneo de oto\u00f1o, combates por doquier), pero sinceramente, he echado much\u00edsimo de menos el OP1 y ambos endings (sobre todo el segundo, que es maravilloso) de la primera temporada. Creo que casan mucho m\u00e1s con el esp\u00edritu de la serie y con esa forma de transmitir alegr\u00eda y buen rollo que \"Shokugeki no Souma\" tiene.",

            "content": "First, I'm soooo excited to see shokugeki having another season. This is one of the things I considered when watching an anime, If there is a high probability of getting another season.. and I'm sure there will be another season next year.\r\n*********************************\r\nLet's start with the NEGATIVES:\r\n- I'm kinda disappointed that it will only have 13 episodes, but still, I think its fine as long as it will left me in awe every episodes.\r\n- The story is a LITTLE BIT fast-pacing. Particularly in episode 1 where they already began cooking, and the judges where already sitting in their chairs. Unlike in the manga, the judges whereshown coming from their cars, and the manga has a lot more cooking/prep scenes. BUT, I assure you, gradually, it is now turning into normal pacing again.\\n\\n\r\n- ECCHI, I know lot of people dropped this series because of the ecchi scenes.. but guys, look, you just need to be open-minded. What you are watching is a cooking anime, let the small things like this slide. IT IS THE STORY WHICH COUNTS.\\n\\n\r\n*********************************\\n\r\nNext are the POSITIVES:\\n\\n\r\n- OST, sh*t.. Shokugeki never failed to give us quality opening and ending songs! I love the opening so much, it was awesome! The scene where they are standing above their knives in the sky was priceless!! \\n\\n\r\n- Complete package, it will surely make you LAUGH! There was no boring episode, every scenes were all must-see. There is a little bit of romance, and that's why it is good because LOVE CAN DESTROY AN ANIME. Hahaha. There was also some touching scenes. And one thing for sure, every episode is full of SURPRISES!\\n\\n\r\n- ANIMATION, everyone, even the extras were all HANDSOME and PRETTY. There are also a wide variety of characters. And I must say, the character development of the mc and even the supporting characters are all top notch. They have their own expertise and identity. And also the foods, it made me crave for snacks every time I'm watching shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\n- TWISTS, it always have a twist one after another. New characters are making appearance every arc. Its full of fun and exciting events.\\n\\n\r\n- The best characteristic of this anime is the STORY. The concept and everything are all MASTERPIECES. \\n\\n\r\n********************************\\n\\n\r\nI just want to say to all people who dropped this anime.. Guys, you were all losing a great show. Give it another chance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to all the super fans out there, lets continue to support Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, I started a lot of threads in forums regarding who is the best girl (currently Tadokoro Megumi is leading), which supporting character needs to appear more (currently, Nakiri Alice is leading), which soundtrack is the best [currently, Spice (Season 1 Ed 1)  is leading].\\n\\n\r\nI hope I conveyed my love and support for shokugeki by writing this review.\\n\\n\r\n***************************************\\n\r\nThis section is not spoiler-free\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best character development i saw in anime was Megumi's. I honestly love how she represent common people who kept on struggling, waiting for their hidden talents to bloom. Yeah, she inspired me a lot. \\n\r\nParticularly in episode 2, damn, she really grew up a lot since season 1. \\n\r\nAlso, it was a good thing to do a Jojo parody on Megumi and Kurokiba's battle.\\n\\n\r\nI also loved the part when Souma defeated Subaru then the 99 knives were returned to their respective owners. \\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts for the final round between Souma, Kurokiba and Hayama is that i felt pissed off very much, not because Souma didn't won, but because a glory hunter like Hayama won. For those who did not read the manga yet, that guy is full of crap! Since season 1, i don't like that guy, and now that i learned that he's going to betray Souma, i want this guy dead.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I appreciate season 1 more than this season. Still, overall, this anime deserves a 10. I hope season 3 is already around the corner.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara\r\nArt/Characters: The art style is just like the previous season; that is to say it is impeccable. The sharp design and the detail of not only the people but of the food as well is really what makes this show stick out among the crowd. The way the food is presented and the flavors can be seen rather than just heard about drags me into this world of food and excitement. One of the best parts about this art is the amount of detail that the food has as a finished product. If layers are important to the composition ofthe dish, you better believe those layers will be present and they will be so eye catching you won\u2019t be able to take your eyes off of it. There is a healthy amount of fan-service in this season, as well as the previous season, but it was more male that female; that being said, do your best not to let the fan-service draw you away from this masterpiece of a show. The characters themselves are quite interesting if I do say so myself. Obviously Yukihara is up to his usually antics and everyone wants to see him in action, and the same goes for the people surrounding him, but the people I want to focus on are some characters that we haven\u2019t seen prior, like Mimasaka, a crazy stalker guy that takes down his opponents by making the exact same dish as them, but making it better, or the growth of a former teacher in the latter half of the season. Overall there was a lot of growth coming from the cast here, but the focus is primarily on Yukihara, with the others hardly making an appearance. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music that we hear throughout the show makes a splash and helps move the plot along just as much as any of the characters do. The opening is catchy and I find myself listening to it over and over again. As for the music that is in the background, it is refreshing to listen to exciting music to accompany excitement on the screen. And it isn\u2019t some generic music that they use over and over, but it is new and it fits the scene in just a spectacular way. The one song they do use over and over happens to be when Yukihara all of a sudden looks like he is about to take the lead in a challenge and it is both awesome and inspirational, and I find I can\u2019t get the smile off my face when I hear it. The sound direction itself went in a fantastic direction. Much like the previous season, we have sounds for food as well as images (and dare I say smells). We hear the sizzling of meat on the pan, the crunchiness of vegetables being bitten into, and the overwhelming sensation of smell when the food bursts out of an oven. This attention to detail is what brings me to love this show so much. \\n\\n\r\nStory: We pick up the story right at the beginning of the Finals for the Autumn Elections, and Yukihara is not even close to feeling the pressure. He was able to come in 2nd place, only behind Hayama, in the Block challenges, but now it is time for the best of the best. The thrilling conclusion to the Autumnal finals is underway and you do not want to miss the outcome. As for the second arc, we explore with Yukihara the depths of his own cooking and what really makes it great; and from one former professor, what he can do to make it better.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: FOOD WARS!!!!!!! Now that that is out of my system; this show is spectacular. I fell in love with the first season, and if you haven\u2019t read my season 1 review, I ended it mentioning that I was desperate for a second season, and I begin with this: I am desperate for a Third Season! Everything about this show screamed amazing. The Shokugeki\u2019s, the autumnal finals, and so much more, this show put me in the mindset that I want to be able to cook like that. Now, I am not a professional chef, and I never will be, but I have just enough cooking talent to see this show and want to try, even though I see the rigorous training and the extremely stressful environment might tear me to pieces. In all seriousness though, this show really made my top 2 of this season. The characters were fun and energetic, the art was spectacular, and just when I thought the story was predictable, there is something to trip me up and makes me wonder if I know anything about story. Shokugeki no Souma: No ni Sara is an amazing ride and an incredible squeal to the first season. If you have seen the first season and loved it, I am surprised if you haven\u2019t yet seen The Second Plate! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.7/10",

            "content": "I just can't get enough of this show. I feel I would become mentally ill if I don't get Season 3 by next week xD. ( but then i realize i am already mentally ill from all that waiting for Hunter x Hunter :3 )\r\nThe most praiseworthy thing about this show is the Character development. I just love watching Souma grow as he tries to figure the chef he needs to become and cook the food that only he can, not to forget all these badass cooking moments. Just how can a cooking show be this exhilarating? the whole atmosphere of the show just pullsme in. But watching the characters cook for only 13 episodes just doesn't satisfying my hunger. ( geddit? :3 ). It just doesn't cut it out for me. The next season has to be bigger and hopefully it comes fast. I am most probably going to continue the manga anyway tho.\\n\r\nComing to the Art and music, Of course it was great! Watching all that food made my stomach growl like crazy, it is so detailed and looks so delicious. The OP and ED are really good, I like the ED more, The beat is kinda generic but the vocal is very unique and i found myself listening to it on repeat. The visual in the ED deserves a mention too, they just add beauty to an already sublime feast. \\n\r\nFor my final rating, I'd give it a 8.5/10. Can't rate in decimal here, so 9/10.  \\n\r\nI only have a problem with the pacing and the length of the show, the length being the source of many flaws, like how many of the side characters or even the main ones like Megumi and Nakiri Alice didn't get as much screentime and some scenes were rushed. But overall that didn't ruin the thrill and enjoyment this show had to offer. Bring on the third plate!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI love Pizza Hut.\r\nMy brother and I used to always go down to the one close to us, sitting in the restaurant to talk and simply eat a tasty pie. Gooey cheese, flaky crust, greasy all around. The plastic, red cups filled with Pepsi, and a side order of the regular garlic and cheesy breadsticks, completed this delicious package \u2013 and made us feel entirely too full afterwards.\r\nIf I could eat just that whole meal for the rest of my life, I would. I would not say something similar for Shokugeki no Souma: Ni noSara, the sequel to Shokugeki no Souma. But I wouldn\u2019t mind having it every now and again.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThis season of Shokugeki starts literally where the first season left off. Souma, Megumi, and the rest of the crazy chefs are competing against one another in the heated Autumn Elections. Doing what they can to prove their culinary worth and take one more step forward towards those coveted seats and, ultimately, the top of Totsuki\u2019s food chain.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many sequels are arguably \u201conly\u201d for those who liked the originals or the prequels, it goes doubly so for this season of Shokugeki. For the first ten episodes are almost entirely dedicated to the food wars and almost nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nCompare this direction with the first season. The huge number of people met. The daily life at their dormitory. The intense training they received at the resort. The shake-up in the who, what, where, when, and why of the food wars themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis tournament arc creates a format that pushes Shokugeki down a path where its slow-roasting pot is filled with all manner of dishes. Sushi bento boxes. Turtle burgers. Mish-mashed meat stew. But it also creates an inherent problem for Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\nAll right, maybe not a problem, but it certainly affects what the anime wants to do or even can do. Due to the large focus on the tournament and the food, only a small portion is set aside for anything different. The same battles are almost always had, boiling down to everyone wanting to win the whole thing. The same characters almost always take part, cutting out or reducing the side cast to a hefty degree. The same reactions sprout forth with the director baring his chest or the judges going through yet another spiritual journey.\\n\\n\r\nEven the dialogue takes a hit. The anime does a lot to describe the huge number of foods created, and it gets points for going into meticulous detail. But the anime likes to swing back to umami this and umami that. It may be the case that umami does, indeed, make up nearly every grain, meat, and vegetable on the planet. But, again, this sameness only serves to turn these exciting wars into uninspired plates.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it\u2019s not exactly repetitive. The anime does just enough to mix up the different duels, like when Subaru (the stalker) forces his opponents to a Shokugeki or the finals turn into a three-way bout. And, to be fair, the food wars are the crux of the show, so it makes sense that they would receive the most attention. However, \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d (as Hayama would most likely say). Sticking to just the food wars over and over and over doesn\u2019t lend itself to a more diverse offering.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why the final arc of the season, the Stagiaire arc, ends everything on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nIt deviates away from the tournament, placing the students in a public setting. It reintroduces the rigor of the school (a joke that Souma points out) and just how tough graduating can be. It pairs specific characters together with the intention of camaraderie and mutual understanding. It makes the motivation more about improving themselves rather than simply winning. It gives Shokugeki the chance to blend in more of its slice-of-life, comedic moments given the down-to-earth presentation.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, this arc lasts for only three episodes, and, once these episodes are up, the arc officially concludes. Meaning it will not appear again should a third season eventually pop up. But, for its short stay, this arc performs much better than its Autumn Elections counterpart for being what Shokugeki always did best \u2013 using food as a means to an end rather than the end itself.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout both arcs, a theme on losing takes precedence. That losing isn\u2019t the end but rather the beginning. The audience sees it with Subaru and turning a new leaf. With Alice and Ryou in their constant duels since childhood. With Erina\u2019s secretary in how she does not feel worthy of following Erina. With Erina herself and how her position has pushed her away from nearly everyone. And, of course, with Souma and how he views his losses as more experience than he had before.\\n\\n\r\nNobody wants to lose. That\u2019s the obvious part. What is not so obvious is that losing leads to understanding. Of one\u2019s self and of the field they are in. So, while winning is the most ideal outcome, losing has its own merits, too. Because, although Totsuki may frown on failure, it is only through loss that these students achieve what is beyond their reach. Namely, a brimming, delicious future.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note. This season of Shokugeki lessens the total amount of ecchi content. The evil Subaru, the final round with its more serious tone, and the Stagiaire arc do not give the anime the opportunity to present its ridiculous sexual material, moving away from what made the series a standout to begin with. It does appear occasionally, but, when Alice rotates while naked or Megumi juts out her butt, the finesse, the inspiration just isn\u2019t there like it used to be.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki\u2019s art and animation remain at relatively the same quality as its first season. That is to say, it\u2019s pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nChief among its strengths are the imaginative scenes when the characters eat, the overall designs of the characters themselves, and the mouth-watering food on display.\\n\\n\r\nFor the imaginative scenes, they branch out per usual (unlike the ecchi content this time around). The judges have fun at the Souma Land amusement park. Hisako dresses up as a turtle. And Hayama duels Ryou with their own respective swords. Alongside Subaru\u2019s twisted depictions of the devil and villainy, Shokugeki adds its signature flavor to the various scenes once more.\\n\\n\r\nFor the character designs, they (obviously) do not change and, indeed, they do not need to since they are already quite attractive. Erina, Alice, Leonora, Megumi, and Hinako have the eyes, hair styles, and figures that are tough to say no to. And Kojirou, Gin, Hayama, Takumi, and Jouichirou are some combination of buff, handsome, and rugged.\\n\\n\r\nA special shout-out goes to Sonoka Kikuchi\u2019s design. Her long, pink hair with a side ponytail and ribbon, her big bust, her soft teal eyes, her white blouse with a contrasting black skirt, and her laced heels. Ultimately simplistic yet extremely eye-catching. She was only around for a little bit, but she always became the focal point whenever her beauty was on screen.\\n\\n\r\nFor the food itself, Shokugeki once again delivers a delicious, veritable buffet of goodies. Rice glistens, meat steams, and vegetables shine, creating a myriad of meals that make it almost impossible to watch the show on an empty stomach.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains the same, too. While the anime clearly puts almost all its attention on the artistry behind the imaginative scenes, character designs, and food, fileting, pouring, and cooking support the wars when the show is not trying to sell itself on looks alone. Plus, the reactions from the characters \u2013 be it elation at eating something exquisite or another funny face for comedic effect \u2013 further give Shokugeki a spoonful of animation.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki sets its cast up for many chances to experience growth as a person. The format \u2013 two chefs battling it out with cooking \u2013 provides the give-and-take necessary to let one learn from the other and vice versa. Then, when needed, the anime delves into the backstory during the cooking before getting into the juicy commentary on the food itself.\\n\\n\r\nA strong example of this character exploration is Hisako \u2013 who is arguably the best character that this second season plates.\\n\\n\r\nHisako (as both the academy and the audience know) is Erina\u2019s secretary. Hisako dotes on Erina as much as possible, doing everything in her power to make Erina\u2019s life a bountiful one. To this end, Hisako is content with following in Erina\u2019s huge shadow, wanting nothing more than to tail Erina as she continues onward to greatness.\\n\\n\r\nBut her duel with Hayama serves her a cold, spicy dish of reality. That gunning for second place will only ever hold her back. She loses without question to Hayama, and her sudden defeat causes her to step away from her role as Erina\u2019s right-hand girl due both to pride and a feeling of worthlessness.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not until the Stagiaire arc that she appears again. She just so happens to team up with Souma at a popular diner, and it is evident that the loss she took and the separation from Erina she has endured has deeply affected her.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, she looks down on Souma. Be it the fact that he irritates Erina or that she refuses to take orders from someone as \u201clow\u201d as him when she feels she is perfectly capable of handling herself, she does not see Souma as anything other than a nuisance. Simultaneously, she expresses her current state of mind in relation to Erina. That, \u201cIf a loser like me stays at her side, I\u2019ll demean her.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen the customers roll in, though, she starts to realize that she\u2019s out of her element more so than she would like to admit. And, once Souma begins to give her orders once more, she begrudgingly follows them. She is angry \u2013 angry at herself for being too weak.\\n\\n\r\nAs Hisako spends more time at the restaurant, she is content with the place and its staff. But, listening to Souma\u2019s thoughts and words, she discovers that something about the diner must change. She insists that, \u201cIf there is something you really want to pursue, you should cling to it without worrying about appearances!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it becomes apparent how wonderful of a parallel the restaurant is to Hisako\u2019s character. For she is exactly the same way. She has the potential to grow, the drive to change herself. To become the ideal that she could always be.\\n\\n\r\nWith the restaurant saved, her and Souma finally seem like friends. But Hisako\u2019s final talk with him solidifies their relationship. For Souma explains to her rather simply: become someone that can walk beside Erina instead of just behind her. Using her own words from earlier against her.\\n\\n\r\nAfter giving her the metaphorical With Heart manga series to deliver to Erina, she runs off with gusto. And, come the end of the season, Hisako takes her place not behind the person she has aided all this time. But rather right next to Erina, striving for her own ideal self as best she can.\\n\\n\r\nHisako represents the best that Shokugeki delivers. Other characters, however, are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCertain characters are set up well. In particular, Subaru, the show\u2019s new villain and resident, talking copycat. His style is frowned upon due to its lack of class, but it is fair within the rules of the academy. His later loss to Souma opens his eyes, teaching Subaru that his approach does not represent the chef that he himself has the power to be.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are given the stepping stones for later development. Namely, Takumi and Erina. Takumi\u2019s loss to Subaru serves not only to introduce Subaru\u2019s evil ways but also give Takumi the opportunity to go through some self-reflection. As for Erina, Shokugeki clearly has something in store for her in the future. For, at several points, like when Hisako leaves her or when she stares out at Souma and his friends all laughing and having fun together, Erina seems lonely at the top. That her abrasive attitude and inability to connect with people \u201cbeneath\u201d her has left her without the relationships she most likely craves.\\n\\n\r\nSome are simply given more. Ryou\u2019s tough upbringing and his constant food bouts with Alice give them and their relationship a stronger fork with which to lift. And Kojirou\u2019s time as mentor to Souma during his part of the Stagiaire demonstrates that he has overcome his mental block, maturing both as a chef and, more importantly, as a person.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one would be remiss to not speak about everyone\u2019s lovable protagonist: Souma. His friendly personality keeps him grounded and continues to gravitate others towards him. He even won the moral victory in the Autumn Elections when the other students finally begin to acknowledge him and his cooking.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s his willingness to put his career on the line for his \u201crival.\u201d His ability to bounce back with a smile on his face. His perseverance to better himself in the face of hardship and overwhelming pressure. Souma may not be a complex character, but he is certainly someone worth aspiring to be.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this statement more evident than in the new path he chooses to follow. His loss to Hayama in the finals of the Autumn Elections does not deter him. Rather, it reinvigorates his passion for cooking. He sees now that what he needs is not just to make great food \u2013 but to have a reason for making it.\\n\\n\r\nPutting it another way, he realizes he must find something that makes his cooking, his way of living, his own. Not his father\u2019s or someone else\u2019s at the academy. Just Souma\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nThis mentality is seen not only in Souma but also in every character. Hisako converts from cooking for Erina to cooking with Erina. Subaru changes from copying his opponents to taking on his own style. And Hayama (despite the heavy-handed, seconds-before-winning backstory) embodies this point, doing it all for Jun (calling back to Souma\u2019s father\u2019s early words on finding someone to cook for; possible foreshadowing for Souma eventually doing the same for Erina given the chemistry between them).\\n\\n\r\nYes, the anime teases a lot of the what-will-be with its characters. Yes, many of the side cast members are barely present in this season. And yes, most of them are a lot of build-up and backstory without largely noticeable changes. But they are no doubt a diverse group of chefs, friends, and people, crafting a strong set of characters suitable for the Totsuki brand.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Shokugeki had a stellar set of opening tracks and ending tracks that were filled with hype, fun, and catchy tunes. The OP and the ED for this visit are not as strong, but they have their positives.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP leans heavily on guitar and drums to rock its audience. The song never seems to stop, coinciding with the anime\u2019s own push and constant \u201caction.\u201d While the piano in the background is drowned out, and the vocalist does not have the best range imaginable, it\u2019s a cool piece that fits Shokugeki\u2019s style.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, it\u2019s the ED that comes out on top, though. It does use a similar set of guitar and drums when compared with the OP as the basis for its beat and its tone. But the ED has more going for it. A slightly more methodical approach. The emotion in the final stretch. And nano.RIPE\u2019s instantly recognizable vocals which add their unique sound to the mix.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack and the voice acting performances maintain their same level of high quality (which is to be expected, considering everything and everyone remains the same). The tracks are hyped up when they need to be, personable when they need to be, and grandiose when they need to be. And Nobuhiko Okamoto as Ryou, Chinatsu Akasaki as Alice, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Souma bring the fire, the cuteness, and the affability like an all-you-can-eat buffet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a shout-out to the various sound-effects. Sizzles, clanging pots, and chops ring out in the kitchens as each chef rushes to make their dish, adding weight and believability to these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nFor me, watching a sequel goes one of three ways: I like it more than the previous season, I like it about the same, or I like it less. Unfortunately for this one, it sits in the latter camp.\\n\\n\r\nA few reasons make this so.\\n\\n\r\nOne, Erina is hardly around. She is my favorite character in the show, so seeing this season focus about the bare minimum on her did not make me happy.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the reduction in the comedy and slice-of-life segments. The tournament got extra serious and dramatic, so it never felt as if the anime spent (or even could spend) time on more lighthearted material.\\n\\n\r\nThree, Souma didn\u2019t win. I feel like he has lost a lot: Erina\u2019s first taste of his food, the draw against Takumi, his near expulsion at the resort training area, his pseudo-loss in the makeshift Shokugeki with Kojirou. He has won smaller events, like with the karaage back at his hometown. But he has yet to win something big. So it seemed like it was high time for that to happen after almost forty episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Despite my gripes with the narrative\u2019s structure and my more personal issues here, I had a fun time with the series again. Souma is a cool guy to root for, the small, cute moments with Megumi and Alice had me laughing and smiling, and the food battles, even if they are no longer fresh, maintained their over-the-top mentality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, this season does not live up to the magic and interest that the first season cooked up.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara may be a teaspoon compared to the tablespoon that is its first season. But that does not mean it didn\u2019t bring something to the table. Some strong character introspections, a diverse visual palate, and impressive voice acting curtail some of the imperfections in this seasons\u2019 narrative. It\u2019s like eating Pizza Hut pizza without the breadsticks. Yea, it\u2019s yummy food, but it could have been even yummier.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, an overabundance of food wars counterintuitively takes away from the variety, intrigue, and ecchi content that made the plot fun to begin with, but a theme on losing and the Stagiaire arc are there to provide a meaty backbone\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, imaginative scenes, attractive character designs with emphasis on Sonoka Kikuchi\u2019s gorgeous look, mouth-watering food, and about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Hisako represents the cast at its best, and she, Souma, and the others highlight how individualism and personal goals lead to one\u2019s improvement\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, good OST, above average VA performances, and nice sound effects\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, less Erina, less slice-of-life, and still no major wins for Souma, but cute, silly, and hype moments are still had within this wacky series\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "This series is just concentrated entertainment.  It has every element and they are blended together in perfect harmony, much like (some of) the food that is prepared in the show.\r\n1. It's funny.  The chibi drawings in particular are cute and always at least get a smile out of me.  Everything in this show is so over the top that you have to laugh at it.  Sometimes it's just so stupid, but in a good way, because it doesn't take itself seriously.  There is no pretension here.\r\n2. It really energizes you.  There is constant competition, overcoming-of-challenges, people are gracious indefeat.  There's cliff hangers at all the right places, and just enough unpredictability.  Like any good sports anime, basically.  \\n\\n\r\n3. All the characters are lovable.  And it's not often that i say this about a series, but practically all of them are great here.  They're not too archetypal, nor do they have unrealistic gimmicks.  In this case, they usually have a food specialty and/or backstory that helps them stand out.  \\n\\n\r\n4. Endless eye candy.  The girls look cute, really cute.  They're consistently well drawn, often have big tits, and there is fan service a plenty.  It's forced as hell, but that is intentional, as it ends up looking like a parody of itself, and i can appreciate that.  But really it's the food that is the most pleasant to look at.  Detailed, colorful dishes and ingredients that are on par with Non Non Biyori's backgrounds in visual appeal.  \\n\\n\r\nI've said a lot of good things, but i can't really give it more than an 8.  Sure it's enjoyable, but there is not much of a story, no complexity.  It gets repetitive fast, but generally remains enjoyable.  Also another issue is that i happen to be a foodie myself and generally they fail to create dishes that i would actually want to eat.  Plenty of them are not even really feasible in reality.  Not a big deal, but if they went the extra mile to do extra culinary research, it would have earned the extra point to hit the 9 mark.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it, i don't know anybody who didn't enjoy this series.",

            "content": "This is a continuation of Shokugeki no Soma 3 part review spec-spatula!... Ok... that pun was horrible. Anyway... Let's jump right into part 2! XD\r\nFor those who are confused by the above statement, i'm doing a 3 part review for this. The first one is already up if anyone is interested in reading it.\r\nBEWARE OF MINOR SPOILERS\r\nPart 2: The calm waves of the fiery trilogy\r\nIn all honesty guys, even though this series is one of my all time favorites, i have to admit that the second season didn't feel as hyped as the first one or the third one did. I know many people aregoing to disagree but i do have my reasons for saying so. As those who have watched the first season may know it ended on a cliffhanger. Naturally, when the first half of the episodes were out, I was ecstatic. Imagine all the built up anticipation waiting for the continuation of the the actual competition for months and months, who wouldn't be excited? (P.S i couldn't wait for the anime and instead rushed for the manga. But that just made me long for the anime that much more) And true enough, the show delivered. All the battles were as awesome, if not more so than the first season. Even though the second arc was a huge step down from the finals hype, it was not to be blamed because of the episode constraint. It being a short anime season does not have that much of a leeway because of the tight constraint that is 12 episodes. The real problem lies in the fact there is no real plot involved throughout this season. Now, before you get mad, just hear me out. In the first season, throughout all 24 episodes, you knew that the show was heading somewhere. That it had a specific goal for every arc. Soma enrolling into Totsuki, saving the Don RS club, passing the examination with his friends, challenging *** to save Tadokoro's expulsion. They were all filled with excitement. What's going to happen next arc!? I found myself asking. Since the 2nd season is mainly about the Autumn Elections Main Competition, it lacks a certain eagerness from the first season. Sure, the hype was still there, but it revolved wholly around the competition unlike the first season which had spread the elements of surprise over different arcs and different stories. In the case of the 2nd season, once the hype ended, the transition into the next arc felt more like a interlude than anything else, or OVA if you will. Even the 2nd arc didn't have as much of an impact when compared to the other arcs from the first season. It just felt like a small training session for Soma and Soma alone. None of the other characters were shown (Only tadokoro and others briefly for about 1 minute) and there weren't any real twist or surprises from the show. Not even any indication it was going anywhere. By the time it ended, i was expressionless. I didn't feel the hype, nor did i feel any excitement. For strict anime watchers, you aren't even convinced there'll be a 3rd season (unless you read the manga beforehand). All in all, it is a great season but it just pales in terms of plot to the other 2 seasons, and by quite a margin. Though some of the battles were better than the 1st and especially 3rd arc, and not to mention points are given for the Mimasaka battle and the unexpected finals winner, so its plot level was still above average. Oh, and i LOVED the first intern arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nNo real comparisons from this season and the first. Though some of the metaphors used in the show was disappointing. Such an example would be Tadokoro and Ryo's ahem 'gang battle'. I'd honestly be more shocked if anybody enjoyed that. That metaphor alone ruined Tadokoro's personality. The first season protrayal of tadokoro... now that was a masterpiece! Other than that, no real complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs always, the music is astounding. More soundtracks have found its way into the viewers heart. One such soundtrack i can think of is during the first fight. Global Innovator of Taste. The whole soundtrack just screams NAKIRI ALICE! The previous season soundtracks were awesome as usual.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRemember when i said the characters didn't get much growth development during the first season? Well, this is where they start to shine. For starters, more of their character backstories are revealed so that you may start to relate to them more. Their skills are also explained to a clearer effect to enhance them as a character. Not to mention with the transition from season 1 to 2, you could clearly see that each of their skills have improved (cooking and personality wise), and not just Soma himself. Their ferocity and competitiveness also got fiercer and it is shown with much clarity during the pre finals fight. And that is something that i find really entertaining because it hinted that they will be back as stronger characters in the future. Oh and just 1 little detail that managed to push the initial score of 9 to a 10, and that is secretary Hisako. It's really enticing to see how much her character has developed. Not only did her perspective change, you could see just how much she has to change her views in order to grow and improve, especially after deeming herself incapable of being by her master's side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are certain parts of the show that i think are really really outstanding and have rewatched them a few times. Though it felt a little lacking afters its first season, it is still nevertheless a great show. And the main competition deserves more than just the spotlight of the show. So, watch it for that if not for anything else.",

            "content": "STORY - 7\r\nART - 10\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nThe Second Plate picked up from the first season, coming in strong with all the greatness of foods and characters that we got previously. With that, this season took a slightly different path away from comedic enjoyment towards a much more heated atmosphere in the kitchen.\r\nThe main highlight that took the spotlight is the extra competitive nature that enshrouded many of the characters. From here, we have many cooking ideals that faced off against each other, striving to reach the top in their own ways. These battles to cook the best foods introduced character developmentsthat we didn't get in detail from the season before, a very nice addition that was needed. However, all these great ideas were moderately ruined by how the story was presented. With only thirteen episodes, there were minimal build up as they went right into the mix when the episode started. It's a problem especially with the faster pacing. Absorbing all the information only to get into the next part can be kind of overwhelming, which is why some importance or significance were lost during several scenes. That aside, the humorous aspect that can be experienced a lot in the first season were toned down quite a bit, along with the fanservice. Like I said, it focused a lot of time on expanding the characters, so whether or not you missed the lightheartedness are up to each person's taste. Personally, I wanted more of it between a couple of parts due to the issues I've mentioned. Nonetheless, you will be treated with awesome new information of foods and characters' history, along with bits of hype or comedy seasonings sprinkled here and there.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the bright colors does stood out a bit more noticeably compared to Season 1. It definitely felt refined, and the animation is still as fluid as before. Capturing the cuisine of each dish with extreme details caused more drooling to occur. With the fanservice, not only is there less of it, the exaggeration were decreased too so you can focus more on the presentation of the dishes itself rather than their reactions. That did helped during the rushed parts but honestly, sometimes I yearned more for it. The faster pacing also affected the sound aspect. There were times where the words coming out of the mouth felt like gibberish to my ears, mostly because they spoke fast with minimal pauses. With the OSTs, it was for a different reason. They were masked by the huge amount of dialogues going on, drawing my attention to the voice-actors rather than the soundtracks. This can be fixed with more careful pacing to give a balanced audio experience. Still managed to portray the distinct cultural side of this anime but the potential for better experiences is there.\\n\\n\r\nThough The Second Plate was lower than what I was expecting, the story revealed more of what we should expect as the characters journeyed deeper through the professional world of cooking. My main gripe was the pacing issue and unfortunately, it affected a couple of factors. However, that alone didn't stopped Season 2 of Shokugeki no Souma to be an entertaining anime that will bring enjoyment to your table.",

WHAT A SEASON IT WAS!\r\nShokugeki took the concept of BATTLE SHOUNEN to a brand new level! In the Autumn election arc, the screenwriters crafted make one of the most exciting and creative tournments on the history of shounen anime. The duels were full of twists and turns, great dialogue and imagery. Autumn Election is at the same level as DBZ'S Namek Saga; Saint Seiya's Sanctuary Arc or Samurai X's Kyoto Arc and other great shounen sagas, it reaches the quintessence of a shounen perfectly.  If you liked the first season, youwill be just addicted by the new episodes and get stucked in Tootsuki Academy competitive ambience. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the new season features the great Stagiarie mini arc, were we can see all the evolution of Yukiriha Souma, confirming him as one of the greatest anime protagonists of all time. \\n\\n\r\nThe combination between an over the top championship and character development is the great merit of this second season, making this one even better then the first one. Yes, you read it right. Ni no Sara is even greater than its predecessor. Not only it had improvements on plot and pacing, but also had technical improvements. The animation is even better, the use of CGI is harmonic with the handrawing. This one is more fluid and vivid, continuing the great work of rocking the viewer's senses. The great soundtrack continues the same of the first season, with improvements on the opening and ending songs, the best of the franchise. \\n\\n\r\nSo as Souma, JC Staff have improved its work and made a even better animation. Can't wait for a possible third plate, enjoying the manga while I wait.",

            "content": "Grab a seat, sit back, and relax. Shokugek no Souma (Food Wars) is back and that means, fans are in for more treat and foodgasms. From the series that bought you excitement of cooking and extravagant culinary arts, the second season has a lot to offer as well and it\u2019s no understatement.\r\nFirst things first, the sequel is a direct continuation from the first and thus, the story connects from established characters and storytelling. Therefore, there\u2019s no reason to watch the second plate without tasting the first. Do note that there\u2019s also no recap so the second season really gets straight to the meat of thestory. That\u2019s a good thing anyway. Who wants to listen to boring narrative of recapping? Rather, the second season dives into the main course as the tournament (Fall Elections) gets underway. If you remember, main male protagonist Souma is an inspiring cook chef who wants to follow his father\u2019s footsteps into the culinary world. As a guy who is never afraid of challenges, it\u2019s interesting to see how he fares against his competition. The first of those is Alice Nakiri (Erina\u2019s cousin) and we see how both sides demonstrate their talent. \\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s often interesting about Shokugeki no Souma is often the clash of ideals because characters come from so many different backgrounds. For instance, Erina and Alice were both raised in a high class society so they lack understanding about people from below their class. This also adapts the way how Souma responds. If fans took notice, Souma often uses his own creative ideas to craft food rather than using fancy or stylish ingredients from the start. The point is that with so many ways characters can use to build on their talent, the second season capitalizes on them to make them memorable. Souma\u2019s talents aren\u2019t the only one being highlighted as characters returning from season one such as Megumi, Ryou, Akira, Hisako, and others get their own moments. Every one of these characters has their own cooking style so seeing them demonstrate what they\u2019ve learned shows their strengths and weaknesses. The season does a decent job at that through colorful explanation of the food making process while injecting humorous moments and details. Don\u2019t worry, if you\u2019re starving for some fan service because of the foodgasm, there\u2019s also that too.\\n\\n\r\nAs the titular character, Souma is still the face that gets the most highlight. In particular, his personal rivalry against one competitor named Subaru is something to remember. It\u2019s not because of what\u2019s at stake but because of Souma\u2019s willingness to take on the challenge. As I mentioned before, Souma is a daredevil. He likes challenges and often takes them for reasons beyond personal interest. Also do note that Souma isn\u2019t unbeatable and he does take a major loss. However, it\u2019s important that Souma is the type of guy that also learns from his mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of mistakes, I guess a season condensed into a single just one cour will result in what people call \u201crushing\u201d. Yes, the first season ran for 2-cour length of 24 episodes while the second season is only about half the length. What does that mean? It basically means material will be skipped to get straight to the main meat of the show. The first few episodes had me worried me a bit especially in the early stages. However, it doesn\u2019t destroy the storytelling altogether if you look carefully. In essence, the condensing is probably done to get the story flowing more or capture the more important elements of the manga. In particular, the second half of the season really gets intense with high level competition. Of course, there are still lots of room for humor and breathers in between. Just know that season 2 is much more about competition. Some of the final few episodes affirms Souma\u2019s motivation to improve himself and we get more background storytelling about his character.\\n\\n\r\nOnce again, J.C. Staff is responsible for the anime production. The visual quality remains more or less the same as fans may remember. There are occasionally awkward camera angles but in most parts works well. It\u2019s noticeable that with the variety of themes offered during the tournament (bento, seafood, ramen, etc), the staff is able to capture the thrill of that. Fan service seems to be tamer compared to the first season especially in the early episodes but they are still there to make the fans droll. Meanwhile, the soundtrack remains somewhat less noticeable. While the theme songs are quite catchy, it just feels like the OST is overshadowed by other factors of the season. Voice mannerism still works quite well though in terms of delivery. One of the more noticeable character is a woman who speaks in broken Japanese which can be quite amusing to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nThe gimmick of Shokugeki no Souma has been a clever one. Taking the idea of making food and transforming it into something so colorful is what makes the show special. It\u2019s essentially a satire with characters using their talent to make food better than appear. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s a clever joke and emphasizes more on how characters deliver their talent. The second season offers plenty of moments with these rivalries and moments you\u2019ll have hard time forgetting. We might not appreciate every humorous joke or foodgasm they throw at us. However, it\u2019s still enough to show that Food Wars remains a must-watch on the bucket list.",

            "content": "Order up!...AGAIN!\r\nShokugeki no Souma 2nd Plate left off where the first season did with the Autumn Election and it really ramps up the tension for Souma to be in the Elite Ten if winning the tournament.\r\nLA's views on the Shokugeki no Souma of the previous season was nothing but awe as to how cool and awesome the anime franchise which is essentially Iron Chef: The Anime with food porn and gasms which makes it weirdly unique to it and 2nd Plate may still have the same flavor (huhu) as the original season, but it both makes it great and falls under the same problems ofthe shounen genre and the original season did.\\n\\n\r\nFor what a food shounen anime comes in, this season still brings out some form of meaning this tournament and Shokugeki's this Election as well as the Stagaire has as well as make some of the more main cast members with the little screentime they had and ramps them up to be both badass and develop them further. Easy examples are Megumi Todokoro, the shy chef and Akira Hayama, the spice master and surprisingly enough Souma's development as a chef.\\n\\n\r\nBefore moving onto what's wrong with this season...the technical features.\\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, the animation is overall decent to the vibrantly flashy character designs as well as the tournament aesthetics, where the animation shines once again goes to the food, making you just drool at looking the gorgeously delicious food (by the way...HAVE FOOD WHILE WATCHING SHOKUGEKI...you'll be hungry if you don't) and is where most of the detail of the animation comes from. The animation overall is decent on par with the original season.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting at best can get overly hammy typical from the first season what with the more heated battles and wacky crazy contestants going against one another and really the voice cast were utterly great and added to the atmosphere be it a heated battle or the characters explaining about the food or how good it tasted due to how it was made, LA just can't put a favourite voice actor as the ENTIRE cast was great!. \\n\\n\r\nNow what's really wrong with this season?...well just by looking at the episode count in comparison to the original really says it all, 24 to 12...some of the Shokugeki battles gets rather rushed...to be precise, the tournament battles that are not important to the characters are like this, examples as Takumi Aldini vs. Subaru Mimasaka or Souma vs. Alice Nakiri, sure the \"meaning or theme\" is still shown, but the rushed portion comes in when these battles' food prep and \"how to make\" are skimmed over just to finish the battle before the episode ends. Now this comes off as both good and bad as with the season's episode count, they kinda DO want to hurry it along, but bad as feels rushed. Nonetheless, 2nd Plate even with it's rushed zigzag pacing isn't enough for LA to hate this season. The last problem and LA's own personal opinion is that LA knows that Souma gets the most screentime in this season, but LA wanted more of ERINA NAKIRI!!!, small flaw but LA knows why the focus is on Souma.\\n\\n\r\nEven the character development's zigzagged pacing gets a pass as even with this huge of a cast and the rushed Shokugeki battles, the combatants are still presented and developed even to the point even Souma's win record turns his character development even better as even he evolves as a character and not your typical \"always win main protagonist\" type. In terms of character development like Souma's screentime compared to the rest, Souma has the majority of the focus especially when it comes to Souma's battles in the Autumn Election, but he really has the majority of the focus come Stagaire. But for Souma's opponents as well as other contestants going against on another during the Election, they to during their battles brought up their development as a chef or personal developments again easy examples are Megumi.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending which brought to a finish the Stagaire mini arc, and really LA MUST point out that the Stagaire arc was one of thee best arc in Shokugeki no Souma, as it went more into the realistic look at restaurant and trying to be the better chef using new methods they learned. Ni no Sara by all means with it's strengths and flaws, it was on form, not all the way through but it still had the flavour and intensity of the original season and LA LOVED Ni no Sara for that...what else is there to say but...\\n\\n\r\nLA wanted more...LA wants a 3rd Plate for all LA cares...",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma returns after an extremely successful 1st season... and it is just as entertaining as the previous edition. \r\nShokugeki no Souma has been one of my favorite series for some time. Why? It's because it so damn entertaining. Where it might lack in the story, it makes it up for its consistent entertainment found in every single episode. That's not to say the story is bad however, as I find it quite fun and solid. Don't like ecchi? Well, as much as others like to say it, the show isn't ALL about those ridiculous 'foodgasms'. It also involves a good amount of emotions,fun 'battle'(cooking) scenes, and decent amount of development. In fact, I'd honestly like it just as much without the foodgasm scenes. The amount of effort and detail they put into the food and cooking is enough to make even the viewers craving for the food. And all things considered, this is how you do a proper cooking anime, making viewers hungry for more and more.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation in the 2nd season is just as amazing as the first. Although having a slightly rushed first episode, it manages to pick back up the original pace without too much dragging and rushing. he fast-paced cooking scenes are animated so fluidly and the whole show is just an eye-catcher in terms of the characters and the food. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, it does get rushed a bit in the later episodes again, but not too much. This kind of problem could have been fixed if the anime was 2 cour but unfortunately it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, the music is one of my favorite aspect of the anime adaptation. Along with the animation, it just adds so much more to the scenes, especially the cooking scenes. Also really liked the fact that they still kept a couple of great osts from the first season as well. OP/ED are worth checking out as well, although I still prefer the 1st season ones.\\n\r\nThe voice acting is great, but nothing too amazing i'd say. Each VA's fit their roles well, and big props to the VA's who had to do the foodgasms, because they sell it hilariously well. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on, the characters look like your typical shounen stereotypes. However, the thing that makes me actually like these characters are that every single character are just entertaining to watch, as in no annoying characters whatsoever imo. The character interactions are great, and it does have a good amount of developments throughout the story. They have a bit of depth in them, and all of them are just really likable. For me, the best part of the series is the protagonist, Yukihira Souma. He is such a smooth MC: not annoying, boring or anything of that matter. He's the one that brings all the comedy, entertainment and the intensity of the show together. At times he's just straight up ridiculous and silly, but he also has this serious/badass side, and that's when you know shit is about to go down. Overall, the characters might seem like shounen cliches, but the cast makes it up for being very entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nBoth seasons of Shokugeki no Souma are a great, entertaining watch for anyone. Unfortunately, since it's only 13 episodes, some contents from the manga are indeed skipped, and the pacing is a bit inconsistent at times. But even without the skipped parts, the story is still tied well together. Some of you might not like it if you aren't that into the concept of foodgasms but it's still worth the watch purely for the entertainment it effortlessly brings on the table.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma was a big surprise for many for 2015. What initially seemed like a weird mix of shounen, cooking and ecchi turned out to be one of the most interesting and suspenseful anime of the year. It ended up being one of the most popular anime of the year. With the first season ending incomplete, the second season\u2019s role was to finish up what was started. Although the second season never reaches the heights of the first season due to its really fast pacing and lack of buildup, but even with a flawed adaptation, Shokugeki no Souma is some of the best funyou\u2019ll have this year. \\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe story continues off right from where the first season ended. After the Autumn Election preliminaries in the first season, the series starts off with the quarterfinals, focusing on the characters that managed to get to this point. So basically, this season starts off straight into the action. The thing is that the writing in general is fairly unpredictable, unlike the first season of the anime. Maybe the one who you\u2019ve expected to win may not. The previous series focused more on Souma and his journey in learning more about cooking. This season focuses more on all of the finalist and what cooking and victory means too them. But the series still doesn\u2019t forget about Souma as he\u2019s on a journey to find his own style of cooking. The season is comprised of two different arcs. The first nine episodes are the rest of the Autumn Elections arc that was left incomplete in the first season. The last four episodes is the entirety of the Stagiaire arc. Now, the series would have been a lot better if they had time to build situations up, but the rushed adaptation prevents to do so. \\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThose who are familiar with the first season will feel home with the second season. Back to some more shounen-style cooking with over-the-top reactions and, of course, foodgasms. The style remains the same as the previous season, but unfortunately the same can\u2019t be said about the pacing of this season. When the episode count of 13 episodes was announced and the PVs teased the Stagiaire arc, red flags were being raised. I knew that the adaptation won\u2019t be as good as I was hoping it to be, but I wished that I would be proven wrong. Sadly, that wasn\u2019t the case here. What should\u2019ve been done in 19 or so episodes ends up being done in 13. The rest of the Autumn Elections arc should\u2019ve been done in 15 episodes, but it was pushed into 9. That means that roughly each episode adapted 4-5 chapters, which is not ideal for a manga series that has a fair amount of dialogue. A manga adaptation of JoJo can get away with that, but not Shokugeki no Souma. Due to the fast pacing, many moments that should\u2019ve felt tense don\u2019t end up feeling so, and the lack of buildup makes you feel less interested in the matches. The most ideal adaptation would\u2019ve been the rest of the Autumn Elections arc, the Stagiaire arc, and the arc after that, all being adapted in a two-cour series. But unfortunately that didn\u2019t happen. \\n\r\nPresentation: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nWith the second season, you\u2019ll be seeing the old characters back in action, but you\u2019ll be seeing some new characters too, particularly a finalist you probably haven\u2019t seen yet. Shokugeki no Souma had a fairly huge cast, and most of the characters ended up being either memorable, interesting and hilarious. The series revolves around Yukihira Souma and how he uses his skills to succeed in the world of cooking. But it\u2019s not just about him doing, but also about him learning. And we also have many returning characters like Tadokoro Megumi, Nakiri Erina, and many more. But a good chunk of the series mainly focuses on the finalists of the Autumn Elections, which are Souma, Megumi, Alice, Kurokiba, Hayama, Takumi, Mimasaka, and Hisako. And this season develops on those characters more than they did in the last season. You\u2019ll be seeing backstories for characters like Kurokiba, Hayama, and Alice, and they add more of a meaning to these matches. These characters end up feeling more complex than just a simple rival. And knowing what these characters value the most makes you not just cheer for one person.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nThe art quality is basically the same as the previous season, and just like the previous season, there aren\u2019t any noticeable quality drops. Shokugeki no Souma\u2019s art style is quite simplistic and is the one you would typically see in a typical school comedy. But more detailing is put for things of greater value, like the dishes in the series. Just like the previous season, comedic moments would be shown using chibi-looking characters and that helps add to the humor of the show. The foodgasms fanservice look just as good as the previous season. The backgrounds look quite nice, though most of the backgrounds in the series is more in buildings rather than outside. When compared to the manga\u2019s art, it is a little lacking as some facial reactions can look more badass in the manga. But that\u2019s a situation evert anime has since a still panel from a manga enables the mangaka to put more details than an animated scene where each frame needs detailing. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animations quality is also the same as the first season, and just like its art quality, it\u2019s quite consistend throughout and there\u2019s barely any quality drops. Never once did it seem like they were saving budget and cutting it short, and the same went for the first season too. The animations for the cooking moments look pretty good. The animation quality is pretty much what you would expect from J.C. Staff at this point. It\u2019s nothing mind-blowing, but it\u2019s not like as if an anime like these needs animations like that. My only concern is that outdoor backgrounds can look a little static, but most of the anime is taken place within buildings anyways. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast remains the same in the second season. The voice acting in the first season was excellent, however most of the seiyuu are pretty unknown. Souma is voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and he does a great job as the confident, yet curious protagonist. His effort here is of course nowhere near the level of his role as Petelgeuse in Re:Zero, but it\u2019s not like as if that\u2019s necessary. Megumi is voiced by Takahashi Minami again and she does a very good job, even if her role wasn\u2019t as important as it was in the first season. Taneda Risa returns to do Erina, but just like Megumi, there\u2019s not much of her to begin with. However, characters like Hayama and Kurokiba play a bigger role in this season and their seiyuu do a very good job. Okamoto Nobuhiko knows how to do raging characters well, so he did a great job as Kurokiba. And Suwabe Junichi did a great job as the composed, yet focused Hayama. Overall, the returning cast does a great job again with their characters. The \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 8/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music was mostly excellent in the first season and the same can go for this season too. The OP, \u201cROUGH DIAMONDS\u201d, is a very good song made by SCREEN mode. The music for the OP sounds like something you would hear from a battle shounen anime, but it\u2019s not like Shokugeki isn\u2019t as intense as a battle shounen. The ED,\t \u201cSnow Drop\u201d, was done the really loved and popular band, nano.RIPE. Though it might not be their best, but the song is pretty good. I\u2019m not a big fan of the band\u2019s vocalist though. The soundtrack for this anime is the same as the soundtrack used in the first season. Though I haven\u2019t noticed if there\u2019s any track that is new in the series. My favorite one (just like the last season), \u201cFood Battle Start!\u201d, is used very well in the anime to create suspense. Some of the over-dramatic music used when the dishes are being judged adds to the absurdness of the series too. \\n\r\nMusic: 7.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nEven with the lackluster adaptation, I found it very hard not to enjoy the second season of Shokugeki no Souma. With more shounen-style cooking, mouth-watering dishes, over-the-top foodgasmic reactions, epic one-liners and references to other series, it\u2019s got everything I expect from a sequel to Shokugeki no Souma. Although what should\u2019ve been Shokugeki\u2019s best arc ended up being one of its weakest do to a rushed adaptation and lack of buildup. But the characters are developed just as effectively as they were in the manga. I still enjoyed this season, and it\u2019s one of my favorite of the year, but what could\u2019ve been amazing only manages to be great and nothing more.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Shokugeki no Souma, chances are that you have already watched this season. But if you haven\u2019t then you should do so. The supporting character are more developed than before and are now much more complex as characters. Even Souma got more development as his goal from reaching the top got turned into finding his own style of cooking. And you get what you know and love from the first season too. However, the really rushed adaptation makes this season lack the intensity and buildup the last season. It\u2019s quite disappointing that the manga\u2019s best arc got a not so good adaptation. But even with the lackluster adaptation, there a lot of find in the second season of Shokugeki no Souma.\\n\\n\r\n+ The shounen-style, over-the-top cooking, and foodgasms are back.\\n\r\n+ Supporting characters are well-developed and some receive proper backstories.\\n\r\n+ The great background music used in the first season is back and new OP and ED are very good. \\n\r\n+ Souma is developed more as a protagonist who needs to find his own style of cooking.\\n\r\n- Very rushed as an adaptation and makes the series lack any proper buildup or intensity. \\n\r\n- Never reaches the heights of its first season, despite adapting the best moments from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.4/10",

            "content": "The only thing frying in this culinary show were my brain cells.\r\n*Character*\r\nSo you've got the main character, who is the greatest cook ever!  He's so good, no one can believe how good he is!  And he fights other cooks in cooking battles, and he always wins!  Except when he loses, but even when he loses we are still reminded that he's sooooo great!\r\nThen you've got this Meat Girl.  She's the BEST at meat!  Not as good overall as the main character, who is the greatest in the whole world, but she does have huge, and I mean HE-YUGE tatas.I'm talking boing boing boing sandbacks that will surely result in severe lower-back problems at a tragically young age.  Did I mention how ENORMOUS her boobs are?  She is never shown without her leopard-skin rag-bra.   Ever seen a porno staring Wilma Flinstone?  Me neither, but now you don't need to!  Now that I've covered her cleavage, I should probably move on to her number one character trait: that would be her boobs!\\n\\n\r\nMy other favorite character is Failure Girl.  Failure Girl is great because she can't succeed at anything.  Except when the main character believes in her, that is!  And then we're reminded of how great he is (did I mention he's the best ever?).  There's one scene later on in the show where, despite Failure Girl's absolute lack of any self confidence whatsoever, she manages to achieve a high score because she remembered a trick the Main Character taught her!  All of her achievements are attributed to him in some way.\\n\\n\r\nYou've got some other great characters, too.  There's your Stern White-Haired Godess, who has magical God-Taste powers (I'm not joking) and is always watching with contempt from afar as our Main Character proves himself time and time again to be the best.  There's the Hot Food Judge, whose entire set of dialog only consists of two lines: \"That looks disgusting, that can't possibly taste good!\" and \"I AM LITERALLY ORGASMING FROM THIS RICE!!!! [sexual squeal]\".\\n\\n\r\nYou've got Gay Dude, who frequently strips naked in the most inappropriate situations (as gay people do!).  He loves gardening!\\n\\n\r\nThere's Character Foil, the main enemy of Main Character, but really he's just Main Character with a different paint job and slightly less skills.\\n\\n\r\nThen you have Cast Of Minor Characters Who Each Have Specific Shallow Character Traits, they kind of blur together.\\n\\n\r\n*Art*\\n\\n\r\nFor a show about food and the culinary arts, everything looks suspiciously like the fake plastic imitation meals that sit outside restaurants in Japan: colorless and dull, plasticy and off-putting.\\n\\n\r\nBut since most of the youngsters this show is targeted towards are only here for the boobs: rest assured! They're drawn as engorged as ever.\\n\\n\r\nMain Character looks like most main characters and has a great head of Main Character Hair.\\n\\n\r\n*Sound*\\n\\n\r\nI bet you didn't know this many sound effects for bouncing breasts existed!  And the orgasmic shrieks of bliss as the judges are overcome by the pleasure of eating Main Character's meals will leave you craving a bowl of udon for sure.\\n\\n\r\n*Enjoyment*\\n\\n\r\nYou may be wondering how the show remains interesting when its only plot device is an Anime Food Battle with no stakes and no purpose.  The answer is easy: it doesn't!  Anyone who has the intelligence to speak a human language should feel insulted that this show exists.  This show even eschews the traditional \"shounen\" plot progression where our hero wants to be the best at The Thing, so he works really hard all season to be good at The Thing, and then finally achieves The Thing (or doesn't, but learns a lot along the way!).  Instead, this show cuts right to the chase, and our hero starts out ALREADY best at The Thing!  All he has to do is prove it!  Again... and again... and again.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall*\\n\\n\r\nI would rather eat a bowl of nails than suffer through another 22 minute of this show.  Even the worst restaurant in the world would never serve up a slice of meat that stunk this bad.\\n",

            "content": "So much hype for such an overrated series that can't get proper development. I see how it is nowadays with people's liking (Not that my liking is any good, it's just a saying). Such mediocre and predictable storyline with many \"serious\" encounters that won't ever happen in real life.\r\nStory. 5\r\n- As for the story, i don't understand what's the point. From a realistic point of view, none of this could ever happen, from the fanservice that makes no sense to those serious glances. \r\nThere's no real story, it's just the main character trying to be a thug and one of the best chefs, by beingslow. Everything is the same as previous seasons with the fact that first season had a more creative storytelling. At this point everything is about food battles with no real meaning and a bunch of almost if not nude scenes, resulting in 0 progress done, like what happened with that first half? Nothing?. Even those TV cooking shows have a better growth.\\n\\n\r\nArt. 3\\n\r\nThe art was horrible from a certain distance (Season 2 was worse, trust me). The animation was poorly done but at least you could get the idea of what was going on, i'll give props on that. Only on close shots you could see a certain progress compared to bigger shots with a lot of people or just a few.\\n\r\nFaces were the worst on trying to mimic feelings, i fully understand they wanted to give a proper sensation of them, but they are too exagerated that they were not funny but rather unpleasant. On the other side, i find it funny that Souma never changes his uniform, not for cooking, not for being in the house, not for anything. While everyone else respects the rules on that.\\n\\n\r\nSound. 5 \\n\r\nI haven't been enjoying the OP and ED as much i would like, but it doesn't matter. The music is put on good placed and properly decreased the volume if someone was talking, but there is too much music in the show, of a 21 min. episode, at least 17 minutes have music in it. I don't really like that, i feel like they are trying to get me excited when i shouldn't be.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter. 4\\n\r\nThere was no real progress from season 2 for the main characters, but rather there's a bit of development for support characters. Some of them have changed, some don't even appear anymore, and some of them is like they didn't even care to give them a proper development, you get to see everything.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. 5\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n\r\nThis is just an overrated show that didn't deserve my attention, but still got it. It's far from being the worst i've seen but it's certaintly bad and extremely predictable. The ending was a cliffhanger, with again, predictable decisions. The idea of adding a bad guy that would get the support of superior people is not new and not enjoyable. The series just keeps going down and down for me, nothing i can do though.",

            "content": "Having enjoyed the first season I was glad to hear we were getting more, but what we got wasn't more.  In the 2nd season of Shokugeki no Souma they've chosen to abandon anything resembling story or character development and given us a cooking competition.  The first 10 episodes are a series of duels with different characters we have no reason to care about and the final 3 episodes are \"restaurant rescue\" episodes.\r\nNow abandoning a story isn't necessarily bad.  I like cooking shows, I watch Beat Bobby Flay, Cuthroat Kitchen and many others, none of which have story or character development either.However much of what is said on Shokugeki no Souma is factually wrong and it's clear the writers of Shokugeki no Souma have never even seen a Michelin starred kitchen let alone been in one.  With food that are \"scent bombs\" that can instantly fill a stadium with aroma and where every bite causes an orgasmic clothing-destroying explosions in the judges, this show has as much to do with cooking as a bullet dodging anime has to do with fighting.\\n\\n\r\nSo what are we left with given there is no story and what they're doing is reality ignoring make believe?  We have a kid who is the best in the world kicking butt and saving adult run restaurants better than Gordan Ramsay could dream of.  In other words it's a chunibyou power trip with the magic being kitchen knife wielding skill rather than a sword or a spell.  But don't fret, huge breasted high school girls all admiring the main character are there too for people that want a touch of harem flavor in their otherwise flavorless show.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary, there is really nothing here to watch.  Give the second season of Chef's Table a watch if you want to see some of the best chef's in the world at work, or Beat Bobby Flay, Knife Fight, Cuthroat Kitchen etc. a watch if you want to see a cooking competition.  Not only are they better, they're also real, not magical nonsense.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma's characters all have one goal: be the best chef. They all have different reasons for wanting to be the best, as the show will often remind you, but in the end their goals are one and the same. Perhaps that's what makes this second season of Shokugeki fall a bit flat. They're simply not progressing towards that goal for the majority of the show. It starts to make everything feel a bit pointless.\r\nThe majority of my complaints for this season come from the tournament arc:\r\n-It barely matters who wins.\r\nWinning the tournament simply shows that you are the best in the class. Whilethat definitely aligns with the characters' goals, it also has no significance in the grand scheme of things. The series often reminds the viewer that these are just students we're following by showcasing the alumni of the school who are successful chefs. These constant reminders doom the arc's conclusion into the winner believing they still have a way to go. Of course, the losing characters all have the same thought. If the characters aren't satisfied with the conclusion and there are no tangible results win or lose, it's tough to find purpose in the events. Contrast this with the first season when expulsion was the result for failure and you can see how the intensity was dialed down a notch.\\n\\n\r\n-The fights themselves are tough to follow.\\n\\n\r\nThis might be a personal thing, but I'm not extremely well versed in cooking. When Hayama is describing all these spices that I last used to cure status conditions in Star Ocean, I'm stuck just trying to imagine how these things would taste. When you're watching an action show you can tell who's winning by how much damage each side has taken. In a sports show you look at the points. Winning conditions are easy to follow. In Shokugeki it's much more difficult to gauge who is winning the battle. In the tournament in particular, you're often relying on the judges' and crowd's reactions to tell you who's winning. The results of the fights could be switched and I would be none the wiser.\\n\\n\r\n-There's little forward impact on the characters (yet).\\n\\n\r\nThe arc gives a little motivation to Souma in the end, but by and large the cast is static. There's nothing inherently wrong with static characters. However, Shokugeki wants its characters to progress and get better at cooking. In that sense, it needs the characters to constantly improve. The best the arc does towards that is getting the characters to be more creative. In the short arc afterward we see some brief glimpses of the cast but no one besides Souma has seemed to change at all... and Souma is pretty much the same anyway. The tournament ends and it feels like the show is just like \"Welp, on to the next arc.\"\\n\\n\r\nTake my criticisms with a grain of salt. Obviously this season isn't a full adaptation of the manga. The results of the tournament might become more important later. It's the fact that there are little immediate results that makes the arc feel unsatisfying.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the following short arc brings the show back to its strength: high-pressure situations that aren't cooking battles. It puts the characters (but focusing on Souma) in a high-pressure situation in which they are quickly forced to improve or else face negative consequences. It's far more interesting and intense. I wish it had been longer.\\n\\n\r\nArt/animation/sound... it's all basically the same as the first season. It's not so bad that you're going to complain. It's not so good that you're going to be awed. It's good enough to get the job done. Frankly, that's good enough for me.\\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints about the tournament arc, it still had its moments of fun. Shokugeki's cast is fun to watch. So even if what the characters are doing isn't interesting, the cast's exaggerated personalities and silly reactions can make it enjoyable all the same. If you enjoyed the first season because of the cast interactions, then this season will not disappoint.",

I'm a bit disappointed, but not all that surprised.\r\nI don't have much to say about the animation here. If you enjoyed the quality of the animation in the first season, you get the same thing here. I literally couldn't tell if there were any improvements, despite the fact that it's a new season.\r\nMusic for Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara is pretty good. The OP and ED are nice. I wouldn't say they're quiteas good as the first season though. The score for the rest of the show hasn't really changed. It's just as good as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the problems I had with this season was the story. As everyone already knows, the first season ended in a cliffhanger, which I was not too happy with. Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara continues exactly where the first season left off. At first, I was excited, but I after a few episodes in, I realized what was going on and became utterly disinterested in the series. There's little to no real story in Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara. No, instead it's pretty much one food battle after another. That's the majority of this season. It got tiring and boring after awhile. I mean, the jokes are still funny and everything, but I was hoping for some more character development and a story that dealt with self-discovery. That's not what this is. Not only that, but the ending was pretty disappointing as well. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, because the story suffered, so did the characters. They still have the same personalities as the first season, and they do grow, but not by much. As I said before, it's literally just one battle after another. With the first season, I felt like there was a lot of downtime between battles where we got to learn more about the characters and their past. Sure, that happens here, but not much. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall I was pretty disappointed with Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara. It still has the humor and charm of the first season, yet, I definitely felt it was missing a lot of what made that first season so good. Would recommend as a time waster - not much else.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nAnyone who has seen \"Shokugeki no Souma\" knows perfectly well the qualities that Soma's and company's story possesses: gastronomy as a flag, humour in abundance, charismatic characters, competition and the desire to learn, a varied and quality soundtrack... In short, an anime clearly thematic (because it is) and worth a lot of money. The summary is simple: if you liked the first season, you'll enjoy this sequel, because it's still great and it still holds the keys that made its predecessor great.\r\n\"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" is basically a pure and clear sequel. In fact, it starts immediately after thelast scene we saw. So all those main features are kept intact, fortunately. I'm not going to expand on his qualities too much, because I already did it in the review of the first season (I encourage you to read it) and I think it would be repeat myself too much. What I will do is comment on the changes/new aspects that I think are worth mentioning, as usual I do in the sequels reviews.\\n\\n\r\nThe change that draws attention first of all in \"Ni no Sara\" is that it is a \"short season\", specifically 13 chapters, for the 25 that we enjoyed in the previous one. This has a very clear consequence: there is less time for frills and whirlpools. \"Ni no Sara\" comes straight to the point. I know there are people who like this quite a bit, but \"Shokugeki no Souma\" is an anime that, because of its characteristics, looks very good with the \"slice of life\" and those \"coexistence\" episodes in which we get to know and empathise more and more with the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily, despite having almost half the episodes, they have managed to develop and maintain their rhythm to perfection. The two different parts of the plot (autumn tournament on one side and practice on the other) work perfectly. The vibrant autumn tournament, full of surprises, sometimes fun and sometimes tense, is a true ode to gastronomy and cuisine in each of its clashes. Next, I found the arc of the practices so interesting that I would have liked to have seen more of them. They had enough material to do it. It has been a great respite after 7-8 episodes full of culinary battles one after the other, but at the same time it is a dose of reality in which they have managed to capture with surprising accuracy what it feels like to enter the kitchen of a restaurant as a novice.\\n\\n\r\nThe squad of characters is still as spectacular as ever, even better, as they've slightly reworked the ratio of protagonisms and appearances, to downplay the less interesting characters (like Aoki and Satou or Ibusaki) and begin to give way to others who emerge as key players in the plot, such as Megumi, Hayama and the duo Alice/Ryo.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect that is still great is the music section. Most of the melodies are really known from the first season, but the level was so high, that obviously the BSO of \"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" is still a wonder: varied and of high quality. I can't say the same thing about opening and ending. In my opinion, they've lowered the level with them. . For this second season they have chosen two songs with stronger and more aggressive tones, metal style. I imagine it's to match the theme of the season (autumn tournament, fights everywhere), but honestly, I've really missed the OP1 and both endings (especially the second one, which is wonderful) of the first season. I think they fit in much better with the atmosphere of the series and the way in which \"Shokugeki no Souma\" conveys joy and good cheers.\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nQuien haya visto \"Shokugeki no Souma\" sabe perfectamente las cualidades que atesora la historia de Soma y compa\u00f1\u00eda: la gastronom\u00eda como bandera, humor a raudales, personajes carism\u00e1ticos, competici\u00f3n y ganas de aprender, una banda sonora variada y de calidad... En definitiva, un anime claramente tem\u00e1tico (porque lo es) y que merece much\u00edsimo la pena. \\n\\n\r\n\"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" es b\u00e1sicamente una secuela pura y dura. De hecho, empieza inmediatamente despu\u00e9s de terminar la \u00faltima escena de su antecesora. As\u00ed que todas esas caracter\u00edsticas principales las mantiene intactas, por suerte. No voy a extenderme demasiado con sus cualidades, porque ya lo hice en la review de la primera temporada (os animo a leerla) y considero que ser\u00eda repetirme demasiado. Lo que har\u00e9 ser\u00e1, como de costumbre en los an\u00e1lisis sobre secuelas, comentar los cambios/nuevos aspectos que creo que son dignos de mencionar.\\n\\n\r\nEl cambio que llama la atenci\u00f3n en primer lugar en \"Ni no Sara\" es que es una \"temporada corta\", concretamente 13 cap\u00edtulos, por los 25 que disfrutamos en la anterior. Esto tiene una consecuencia muy clara: hay menos tiempo para florituras y remoloneos. \"Ni no Sara\" va al grano, directamente y sin rodeos. S\u00e9 que hay gente a la que esto le agrada bastante, pero \"Shokugeki no Souma\" es un anime al que por sus caracter\u00edsticas le sienta muy bien el \"slice of life\" y esos cap\u00edtulos \"de convivencia\" en los que vamos conociendo y empatizando cada vez m\u00e1s con los protagonistas.\\n\\n\r\nPor suerte, a pesar de tener casi la mitad de cap\u00edtulos, han sabido desarrollar y mantener el ritmo a la perfecci\u00f3n. Las dos partes diferenciadas de la trama (torneo de oto\u00f1o por un lado y pr\u00e1cticas por el otro) funcionan a la perfecci\u00f3n. El torneo de oto\u00f1o vibrante y repleto de sorpresas, a ratos divertido y a ratos tenso, una aut\u00e9ntica oda a la gastronom\u00eda y la cocina en cada uno de sus enfrentamientos. Seguidamente, el arco de las pr\u00e1cticas me ha parecido tan interesante que me habr\u00eda encantado que se hubieran explayado m\u00e1s con ello. Material ten\u00edan de sobra para hacerlo. Ha sido un respiro genial despu\u00e9s de 7-8 cap\u00edtulos repletos de batallas culinarias una detr\u00e1s de otra, pero a la vez una dosis de realidad en la que han sabido plasmar con sorprendente exactitud lo que se siente al entrar como novato en la cocina de un restaurante.\\n\\n\r\nEl plantel de personajes sigue tan espectacular como siempre, incluso algo mejor, ya que han retocado un poco el ratio de protagonismos y apariciones, para as\u00ed restar importancia a los personajes menos interesantes (como Aoki y Satou o Ibusaki) y empezar a darle cancha a otros que emergen como claves en la trama, como Megumi, Hayama y el d\u00fao Alice/Ryo.\\n\\n\r\nOtro aspecto que sigue siendo genial es el apartado musical. Realmente la mayor\u00eda de melod\u00edas son conocidas ya de la primera temporada, pero el nivel era tan alto que obviamente la BSO de \"Shokugeki no Souma Ni no Sara\" contin\u00faa siendo una maravilla: variada y de calidad. No puedo decir lo mismo sobre opening y ending. En mi opini\u00f3n han bajado el nivel con ellos. Supongo que va a gustos, pero para m\u00ed es as\u00ed. Para esta segunda temporada han elegido dos canciones con tonos m\u00e1s fuertes y agresivos, estilo metal. Imagino que es para cuadrarlo con la tem\u00e1tica de la temporada (torneo de oto\u00f1o, combates por doquier), pero sinceramente, he echado much\u00edsimo de menos el OP1 y ambos endings (sobre todo el segundo, que es maravilloso) de la primera temporada. Creo que casan mucho m\u00e1s con el esp\u00edritu de la serie y con esa forma de transmitir alegr\u00eda y buen rollo que \"Shokugeki no Souma\" tiene.",

            "content": "First, I'm soooo excited to see shokugeki having another season. This is one of the things I considered when watching an anime, If there is a high probability of getting another season.. and I'm sure there will be another season next year.\r\n*********************************\r\nLet's start with the NEGATIVES:\r\n- I'm kinda disappointed that it will only have 13 episodes, but still, I think its fine as long as it will left me in awe every episodes.\r\n- The story is a LITTLE BIT fast-pacing. Particularly in episode 1 where they already began cooking, and the judges where already sitting in their chairs. Unlike in the manga, the judges whereshown coming from their cars, and the manga has a lot more cooking/prep scenes. BUT, I assure you, gradually, it is now turning into normal pacing again.\\n\\n\r\n- ECCHI, I know lot of people dropped this series because of the ecchi scenes.. but guys, look, you just need to be open-minded. What you are watching is a cooking anime, let the small things like this slide. IT IS THE STORY WHICH COUNTS.\\n\\n\r\n*********************************\\n\r\nNext are the POSITIVES:\\n\\n\r\n- OST, sh*t.. Shokugeki never failed to give us quality opening and ending songs! I love the opening so much, it was awesome! The scene where they are standing above their knives in the sky was priceless!! \\n\\n\r\n- Complete package, it will surely make you LAUGH! There was no boring episode, every scenes were all must-see. There is a little bit of romance, and that's why it is good because LOVE CAN DESTROY AN ANIME. Hahaha. There was also some touching scenes. And one thing for sure, every episode is full of SURPRISES!\\n\\n\r\n- ANIMATION, everyone, even the extras were all HANDSOME and PRETTY. There are also a wide variety of characters. And I must say, the character development of the mc and even the supporting characters are all top notch. They have their own expertise and identity. And also the foods, it made me crave for snacks every time I'm watching shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\n- TWISTS, it always have a twist one after another. New characters are making appearance every arc. Its full of fun and exciting events.\\n\\n\r\n- The best characteristic of this anime is the STORY. The concept and everything are all MASTERPIECES. \\n\\n\r\n********************************\\n\\n\r\nI just want to say to all people who dropped this anime.. Guys, you were all losing a great show. Give it another chance. \\n\\n\r\nAnd to all the super fans out there, lets continue to support Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, I started a lot of threads in forums regarding who is the best girl (currently Tadokoro Megumi is leading), which supporting character needs to appear more (currently, Nakiri Alice is leading), which soundtrack is the best [currently, Spice (Season 1 Ed 1)  is leading].\\n\\n\r\nI hope I conveyed my love and support for shokugeki by writing this review.\\n\\n\r\n***************************************\\n\r\nThis section is not spoiler-free\\n\\n\r\nOne of the best character development i saw in anime was Megumi's. I honestly love how she represent common people who kept on struggling, waiting for their hidden talents to bloom. Yeah, she inspired me a lot. \\n\r\nParticularly in episode 2, damn, she really grew up a lot since season 1. \\n\r\nAlso, it was a good thing to do a Jojo parody on Megumi and Kurokiba's battle.\\n\\n\r\nI also loved the part when Souma defeated Subaru then the 99 knives were returned to their respective owners. \\n\\n\r\nMy final thoughts for the final round between Souma, Kurokiba and Hayama is that i felt pissed off very much, not because Souma didn't won, but because a glory hunter like Hayama won. For those who did not read the manga yet, that guy is full of crap! Since season 1, i don't like that guy, and now that i learned that he's going to betray Souma, i want this guy dead.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I appreciate season 1 more than this season. Still, overall, this anime deserves a 10. I hope season 3 is already around the corner.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara\r\nArt/Characters: The art style is just like the previous season; that is to say it is impeccable. The sharp design and the detail of not only the people but of the food as well is really what makes this show stick out among the crowd. The way the food is presented and the flavors can be seen rather than just heard about drags me into this world of food and excitement. One of the best parts about this art is the amount of detail that the food has as a finished product. If layers are important to the composition ofthe dish, you better believe those layers will be present and they will be so eye catching you won\u2019t be able to take your eyes off of it. There is a healthy amount of fan-service in this season, as well as the previous season, but it was more male that female; that being said, do your best not to let the fan-service draw you away from this masterpiece of a show. The characters themselves are quite interesting if I do say so myself. Obviously Yukihara is up to his usually antics and everyone wants to see him in action, and the same goes for the people surrounding him, but the people I want to focus on are some characters that we haven\u2019t seen prior, like Mimasaka, a crazy stalker guy that takes down his opponents by making the exact same dish as them, but making it better, or the growth of a former teacher in the latter half of the season. Overall there was a lot of growth coming from the cast here, but the focus is primarily on Yukihara, with the others hardly making an appearance. \\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music that we hear throughout the show makes a splash and helps move the plot along just as much as any of the characters do. The opening is catchy and I find myself listening to it over and over again. As for the music that is in the background, it is refreshing to listen to exciting music to accompany excitement on the screen. And it isn\u2019t some generic music that they use over and over, but it is new and it fits the scene in just a spectacular way. The one song they do use over and over happens to be when Yukihara all of a sudden looks like he is about to take the lead in a challenge and it is both awesome and inspirational, and I find I can\u2019t get the smile off my face when I hear it. The sound direction itself went in a fantastic direction. Much like the previous season, we have sounds for food as well as images (and dare I say smells). We hear the sizzling of meat on the pan, the crunchiness of vegetables being bitten into, and the overwhelming sensation of smell when the food bursts out of an oven. This attention to detail is what brings me to love this show so much. \\n\\n\r\nStory: We pick up the story right at the beginning of the Finals for the Autumn Elections, and Yukihara is not even close to feeling the pressure. He was able to come in 2nd place, only behind Hayama, in the Block challenges, but now it is time for the best of the best. The thrilling conclusion to the Autumnal finals is underway and you do not want to miss the outcome. As for the second arc, we explore with Yukihara the depths of his own cooking and what really makes it great; and from one former professor, what he can do to make it better.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: FOOD WARS!!!!!!! Now that that is out of my system; this show is spectacular. I fell in love with the first season, and if you haven\u2019t read my season 1 review, I ended it mentioning that I was desperate for a second season, and I begin with this: I am desperate for a Third Season! Everything about this show screamed amazing. The Shokugeki\u2019s, the autumnal finals, and so much more, this show put me in the mindset that I want to be able to cook like that. Now, I am not a professional chef, and I never will be, but I have just enough cooking talent to see this show and want to try, even though I see the rigorous training and the extremely stressful environment might tear me to pieces. In all seriousness though, this show really made my top 2 of this season. The characters were fun and energetic, the art was spectacular, and just when I thought the story was predictable, there is something to trip me up and makes me wonder if I know anything about story. Shokugeki no Souma: No ni Sara is an amazing ride and an incredible squeal to the first season. If you have seen the first season and loved it, I am surprised if you haven\u2019t yet seen The Second Plate! \\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.7/10",

( but then i realize i am already mentally ill from all that waiting for Hunter x Hunter :3 )\r\nThe most praiseworthy thing about this show is the Character development. I just love watching Souma grow as he tries to figure the chef he needs to become and cook the food that only he can, not to forget all these badass cooking moments. Just how can a cooking show be this exhilarating? the whole atmosphere of the show just pullsme in. But watching the characters cook for only 13 episodes just doesn't satisfying my hunger. ( geddit? :3 ). It just doesn't cut it out for me. The next season has to be bigger and hopefully it comes fast. I am most probably going to continue the manga anyway tho.\\n\r\nComing to the Art and music, Of course it was great! Watching all that food made my stomach growl like crazy, it is so detailed and looks so delicious. The OP and ED are really good, I like the ED more, The beat is kinda generic but the vocal is very unique and i found myself listening to it on repeat. The visual in the ED deserves a mention too, they just add beauty to an already sublime feast. \\n\r\nFor my final rating, I'd give it a 8.5/10. Can't rate in decimal here, so 9/10.  \\n\r\nI only have a problem with the pacing and the length of the show, the length being the source of many flaws, like how many of the side characters or even the main ones like Megumi and Nakiri Alice didn't get as much screentime and some scenes were rushed. But overall that didn't ruin the thrill and enjoyment this show had to offer. Bring on the third plate!",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI love Pizza Hut.\r\nMy brother and I used to always go down to the one close to us, sitting in the restaurant to talk and simply eat a tasty pie. Gooey cheese, flaky crust, greasy all around. The plastic, red cups filled with Pepsi, and a side order of the regular garlic and cheesy breadsticks, completed this delicious package \u2013 and made us feel entirely too full afterwards.\r\nIf I could eat just that whole meal for the rest of my life, I would. I would not say something similar for Shokugeki no Souma: Ni noSara, the sequel to Shokugeki no Souma. But I wouldn\u2019t mind having it every now and again.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nThis season of Shokugeki starts literally where the first season left off. Souma, Megumi, and the rest of the crazy chefs are competing against one another in the heated Autumn Elections. Doing what they can to prove their culinary worth and take one more step forward towards those coveted seats and, ultimately, the top of Totsuki\u2019s food chain.\\n\\n\r\nWhile many sequels are arguably \u201conly\u201d for those who liked the originals or the prequels, it goes doubly so for this season of Shokugeki. For the first ten episodes are almost entirely dedicated to the food wars and almost nothing else.\\n\\n\r\nCompare this direction with the first season. The huge number of people met. The daily life at their dormitory. The intense training they received at the resort. The shake-up in the who, what, where, when, and why of the food wars themselves.\\n\\n\r\nThis tournament arc creates a format that pushes Shokugeki down a path where its slow-roasting pot is filled with all manner of dishes. Sushi bento boxes. Turtle burgers. Mish-mashed meat stew. But it also creates an inherent problem for Shokugeki.\\n\\n\r\nAll right, maybe not a problem, but it certainly affects what the anime wants to do or even can do. Due to the large focus on the tournament and the food, only a small portion is set aside for anything different. The same battles are almost always had, boiling down to everyone wanting to win the whole thing. The same characters almost always take part, cutting out or reducing the side cast to a hefty degree. The same reactions sprout forth with the director baring his chest or the judges going through yet another spiritual journey.\\n\\n\r\nEven the dialogue takes a hit. The anime does a lot to describe the huge number of foods created, and it gets points for going into meticulous detail. But the anime likes to swing back to umami this and umami that. It may be the case that umami does, indeed, make up nearly every grain, meat, and vegetable on the planet. But, again, this sameness only serves to turn these exciting wars into uninspired plates.\\n\\n\r\nNow, it\u2019s not exactly repetitive. The anime does just enough to mix up the different duels, like when Subaru (the stalker) forces his opponents to a Shokugeki or the finals turn into a three-way bout. And, to be fair, the food wars are the crux of the show, so it makes sense that they would receive the most attention. However, \u201cvariety is the spice of life\u201d (as Hayama would most likely say). Sticking to just the food wars over and over and over doesn\u2019t lend itself to a more diverse offering.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is why the final arc of the season, the Stagiaire arc, ends everything on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nIt deviates away from the tournament, placing the students in a public setting. It reintroduces the rigor of the school (a joke that Souma points out) and just how tough graduating can be. It pairs specific characters together with the intention of camaraderie and mutual understanding. It makes the motivation more about improving themselves rather than simply winning. It gives Shokugeki the chance to blend in more of its slice-of-life, comedic moments given the down-to-earth presentation.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, this arc lasts for only three episodes, and, once these episodes are up, the arc officially concludes. Meaning it will not appear again should a third season eventually pop up. But, for its short stay, this arc performs much better than its Autumn Elections counterpart for being what Shokugeki always did best \u2013 using food as a means to an end rather than the end itself.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout both arcs, a theme on losing takes precedence. That losing isn\u2019t the end but rather the beginning. The audience sees it with Subaru and turning a new leaf. With Alice and Ryou in their constant duels since childhood. With Erina\u2019s secretary in how she does not feel worthy of following Erina. With Erina herself and how her position has pushed her away from nearly everyone. And, of course, with Souma and how he views his losses as more experience than he had before.\\n\\n\r\nNobody wants to lose. That\u2019s the obvious part. What is not so obvious is that losing leads to understanding. Of one\u2019s self and of the field they are in. So, while winning is the most ideal outcome, losing has its own merits, too. Because, although Totsuki may frown on failure, it is only through loss that these students achieve what is beyond their reach. Namely, a brimming, delicious future.\\n\\n\r\nOne final note. This season of Shokugeki lessens the total amount of ecchi content. The evil Subaru, the final round with its more serious tone, and the Stagiaire arc do not give the anime the opportunity to present its ridiculous sexual material, moving away from what made the series a standout to begin with. It does appear occasionally, but, when Alice rotates while naked or Megumi juts out her butt, the finesse, the inspiration just isn\u2019t there like it used to be.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki\u2019s art and animation remain at relatively the same quality as its first season. That is to say, it\u2019s pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nChief among its strengths are the imaginative scenes when the characters eat, the overall designs of the characters themselves, and the mouth-watering food on display.\\n\\n\r\nFor the imaginative scenes, they branch out per usual (unlike the ecchi content this time around). The judges have fun at the Souma Land amusement park. Hisako dresses up as a turtle. And Hayama duels Ryou with their own respective swords. Alongside Subaru\u2019s twisted depictions of the devil and villainy, Shokugeki adds its signature flavor to the various scenes once more.\\n\\n\r\nFor the character designs, they (obviously) do not change and, indeed, they do not need to since they are already quite attractive. Erina, Alice, Leonora, Megumi, and Hinako have the eyes, hair styles, and figures that are tough to say no to. And Kojirou, Gin, Hayama, Takumi, and Jouichirou are some combination of buff, handsome, and rugged.\\n\\n\r\nA special shout-out goes to Sonoka Kikuchi\u2019s design. Her long, pink hair with a side ponytail and ribbon, her big bust, her soft teal eyes, her white blouse with a contrasting black skirt, and her laced heels. Ultimately simplistic yet extremely eye-catching. She was only around for a little bit, but she always became the focal point whenever her beauty was on screen.\\n\\n\r\nFor the food itself, Shokugeki once again delivers a delicious, veritable buffet of goodies. Rice glistens, meat steams, and vegetables shine, creating a myriad of meals that make it almost impossible to watch the show on an empty stomach.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation remains the same, too. While the anime clearly puts almost all its attention on the artistry behind the imaginative scenes, character designs, and food, fileting, pouring, and cooking support the wars when the show is not trying to sell itself on looks alone. Plus, the reactions from the characters \u2013 be it elation at eating something exquisite or another funny face for comedic effect \u2013 further give Shokugeki a spoonful of animation.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki sets its cast up for many chances to experience growth as a person. The format \u2013 two chefs battling it out with cooking \u2013 provides the give-and-take necessary to let one learn from the other and vice versa. Then, when needed, the anime delves into the backstory during the cooking before getting into the juicy commentary on the food itself.\\n\\n\r\nA strong example of this character exploration is Hisako \u2013 who is arguably the best character that this second season plates.\\n\\n\r\nHisako (as both the academy and the audience know) is Erina\u2019s secretary. Hisako dotes on Erina as much as possible, doing everything in her power to make Erina\u2019s life a bountiful one. To this end, Hisako is content with following in Erina\u2019s huge shadow, wanting nothing more than to tail Erina as she continues onward to greatness.\\n\\n\r\nBut her duel with Hayama serves her a cold, spicy dish of reality. That gunning for second place will only ever hold her back. She loses without question to Hayama, and her sudden defeat causes her to step away from her role as Erina\u2019s right-hand girl due both to pride and a feeling of worthlessness.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not until the Stagiaire arc that she appears again. She just so happens to team up with Souma at a popular diner, and it is evident that the loss she took and the separation from Erina she has endured has deeply affected her.\\n\\n\r\nInitially, she looks down on Souma. Be it the fact that he irritates Erina or that she refuses to take orders from someone as \u201clow\u201d as him when she feels she is perfectly capable of handling herself, she does not see Souma as anything other than a nuisance. Simultaneously, she expresses her current state of mind in relation to Erina. That, \u201cIf a loser like me stays at her side, I\u2019ll demean her.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nWhen the customers roll in, though, she starts to realize that she\u2019s out of her element more so than she would like to admit. And, once Souma begins to give her orders once more, she begrudgingly follows them. She is angry \u2013 angry at herself for being too weak.\\n\\n\r\nAs Hisako spends more time at the restaurant, she is content with the place and its staff. But, listening to Souma\u2019s thoughts and words, she discovers that something about the diner must change. She insists that, \u201cIf there is something you really want to pursue, you should cling to it without worrying about appearances!\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAt this point, it becomes apparent how wonderful of a parallel the restaurant is to Hisako\u2019s character. For she is exactly the same way. She has the potential to grow, the drive to change herself. To become the ideal that she could always be.\\n\\n\r\nWith the restaurant saved, her and Souma finally seem like friends. But Hisako\u2019s final talk with him solidifies their relationship. For Souma explains to her rather simply: become someone that can walk beside Erina instead of just behind her. Using her own words from earlier against her.\\n\\n\r\nAfter giving her the metaphorical With Heart manga series to deliver to Erina, she runs off with gusto. And, come the end of the season, Hisako takes her place not behind the person she has aided all this time. But rather right next to Erina, striving for her own ideal self as best she can.\\n\\n\r\nHisako represents the best that Shokugeki delivers. Other characters, however, are worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nCertain characters are set up well. In particular, Subaru, the show\u2019s new villain and resident, talking copycat. His style is frowned upon due to its lack of class, but it is fair within the rules of the academy. His later loss to Souma opens his eyes, teaching Subaru that his approach does not represent the chef that he himself has the power to be.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are given the stepping stones for later development. Namely, Takumi and Erina. Takumi\u2019s loss to Subaru serves not only to introduce Subaru\u2019s evil ways but also give Takumi the opportunity to go through some self-reflection. As for Erina, Shokugeki clearly has something in store for her in the future. For, at several points, like when Hisako leaves her or when she stares out at Souma and his friends all laughing and having fun together, Erina seems lonely at the top. That her abrasive attitude and inability to connect with people \u201cbeneath\u201d her has left her without the relationships she most likely craves.\\n\\n\r\nSome are simply given more. Ryou\u2019s tough upbringing and his constant food bouts with Alice give them and their relationship a stronger fork with which to lift. And Kojirou\u2019s time as mentor to Souma during his part of the Stagiaire demonstrates that he has overcome his mental block, maturing both as a chef and, more importantly, as a person.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one would be remiss to not speak about everyone\u2019s lovable protagonist: Souma. His friendly personality keeps him grounded and continues to gravitate others towards him. He even won the moral victory in the Autumn Elections when the other students finally begin to acknowledge him and his cooking.\\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s his willingness to put his career on the line for his \u201crival.\u201d His ability to bounce back with a smile on his face. His perseverance to better himself in the face of hardship and overwhelming pressure. Souma may not be a complex character, but he is certainly someone worth aspiring to be.\\n\\n\r\nNowhere is this statement more evident than in the new path he chooses to follow. His loss to Hayama in the finals of the Autumn Elections does not deter him. Rather, it reinvigorates his passion for cooking. He sees now that what he needs is not just to make great food \u2013 but to have a reason for making it.\\n\\n\r\nPutting it another way, he realizes he must find something that makes his cooking, his way of living, his own. Not his father\u2019s or someone else\u2019s at the academy. Just Souma\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nThis mentality is seen not only in Souma but also in every character. Hisako converts from cooking for Erina to cooking with Erina. Subaru changes from copying his opponents to taking on his own style. And Hayama (despite the heavy-handed, seconds-before-winning backstory) embodies this point, doing it all for Jun (calling back to Souma\u2019s father\u2019s early words on finding someone to cook for; possible foreshadowing for Souma eventually doing the same for Erina given the chemistry between them).\\n\\n\r\nYes, the anime teases a lot of the what-will-be with its characters. Yes, many of the side cast members are barely present in this season. And yes, most of them are a lot of build-up and backstory without largely noticeable changes. But they are no doubt a diverse group of chefs, friends, and people, crafting a strong set of characters suitable for the Totsuki brand.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first season of Shokugeki had a stellar set of opening tracks and ending tracks that were filled with hype, fun, and catchy tunes. The OP and the ED for this visit are not as strong, but they have their positives.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP leans heavily on guitar and drums to rock its audience. The song never seems to stop, coinciding with the anime\u2019s own push and constant \u201caction.\u201d While the piano in the background is drowned out, and the vocalist does not have the best range imaginable, it\u2019s a cool piece that fits Shokugeki\u2019s style.\\n\\n\r\nLike the first season, it\u2019s the ED that comes out on top, though. It does use a similar set of guitar and drums when compared with the OP as the basis for its beat and its tone. But the ED has more going for it. A slightly more methodical approach. The emotion in the final stretch. And nano.RIPE\u2019s instantly recognizable vocals which add their unique sound to the mix.\\n\\n\r\nThe original soundtrack and the voice acting performances maintain their same level of high quality (which is to be expected, considering everything and everyone remains the same). The tracks are hyped up when they need to be, personable when they need to be, and grandiose when they need to be. And Nobuhiko Okamoto as Ryou, Chinatsu Akasaki as Alice, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Souma bring the fire, the cuteness, and the affability like an all-you-can-eat buffet.\\n\\n\r\nAnd a shout-out to the various sound-effects. Sizzles, clanging pots, and chops ring out in the kitchens as each chef rushes to make their dish, adding weight and believability to these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nFor me, watching a sequel goes one of three ways: I like it more than the previous season, I like it about the same, or I like it less. Unfortunately for this one, it sits in the latter camp.\\n\\n\r\nA few reasons make this so.\\n\\n\r\nOne, Erina is hardly around. She is my favorite character in the show, so seeing this season focus about the bare minimum on her did not make me happy.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the reduction in the comedy and slice-of-life segments. The tournament got extra serious and dramatic, so it never felt as if the anime spent (or even could spend) time on more lighthearted material.\\n\\n\r\nThree, Souma didn\u2019t win. I feel like he has lost a lot: Erina\u2019s first taste of his food, the draw against Takumi, his near expulsion at the resort training area, his pseudo-loss in the makeshift Shokugeki with Kojirou. He has won smaller events, like with the karaage back at his hometown. But he has yet to win something big. So it seemed like it was high time for that to happen after almost forty episodes.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. Despite my gripes with the narrative\u2019s structure and my more personal issues here, I had a fun time with the series again. Souma is a cool guy to root for, the small, cute moments with Megumi and Alice had me laughing and smiling, and the food battles, even if they are no longer fresh, maintained their over-the-top mentality.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, though, this season does not live up to the magic and interest that the first season cooked up.\\n\\n\r\nShokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara may be a teaspoon compared to the tablespoon that is its first season. But that does not mean it didn\u2019t bring something to the table. Some strong character introspections, a diverse visual palate, and impressive voice acting curtail some of the imperfections in this seasons\u2019 narrative. It\u2019s like eating Pizza Hut pizza without the breadsticks. Yea, it\u2019s yummy food, but it could have been even yummier.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, an overabundance of food wars counterintuitively takes away from the variety, intrigue, and ecchi content that made the plot fun to begin with, but a theme on losing and the Stagiaire arc are there to provide a meaty backbone\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Great, imaginative scenes, attractive character designs with emphasis on Sonoka Kikuchi\u2019s gorgeous look, mouth-watering food, and about average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, Hisako represents the cast at its best, and she, Souma, and the others highlight how individualism and personal goals lead to one\u2019s improvement\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, okay OP, good ED, good OST, above average VA performances, and nice sound effects\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, less Erina, less slice-of-life, and still no major wins for Souma, but cute, silly, and hype moments are still had within this wacky series\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 7/10",

            "content": "This series is just concentrated entertainment.  It has every element and they are blended together in perfect harmony, much like (some of) the food that is prepared in the show.\r\n1. It's funny.  The chibi drawings in particular are cute and always at least get a smile out of me.  Everything in this show is so over the top that you have to laugh at it.  Sometimes it's just so stupid, but in a good way, because it doesn't take itself seriously.  There is no pretension here.\r\n2. It really energizes you.  There is constant competition, overcoming-of-challenges, people are gracious indefeat.  There's cliff hangers at all the right places, and just enough unpredictability.  Like any good sports anime, basically.  \\n\\n\r\n3. All the characters are lovable.  And it's not often that i say this about a series, but practically all of them are great here.  They're not too archetypal, nor do they have unrealistic gimmicks.  In this case, they usually have a food specialty and/or backstory that helps them stand out.  \\n\\n\r\n4. Endless eye candy.  The girls look cute, really cute.  They're consistently well drawn, often have big tits, and there is fan service a plenty.  It's forced as hell, but that is intentional, as it ends up looking like a parody of itself, and i can appreciate that.  But really it's the food that is the most pleasant to look at.  Detailed, colorful dishes and ingredients that are on par with Non Non Biyori's backgrounds in visual appeal.  \\n\\n\r\nI've said a lot of good things, but i can't really give it more than an 8.  Sure it's enjoyable, but there is not much of a story, no complexity.  It gets repetitive fast, but generally remains enjoyable.  Also another issue is that i happen to be a foodie myself and generally they fail to create dishes that i would actually want to eat.  Plenty of them are not even really feasible in reality.  Not a big deal, but if they went the extra mile to do extra culinary research, it would have earned the extra point to hit the 9 mark.\\n\\n\r\nJust watch it, i don't know anybody who didn't enjoy this series.",

            "content": "This is a continuation of Shokugeki no Soma 3 part review spec-spatula!... Ok... that pun was horrible. Anyway... Let's jump right into part 2! XD\r\nFor those who are confused by the above statement, i'm doing a 3 part review for this. The first one is already up if anyone is interested in reading it.\r\nBEWARE OF MINOR SPOILERS\r\nPart 2: The calm waves of the fiery trilogy\r\nIn all honesty guys, even though this series is one of my all time favorites, i have to admit that the second season didn't feel as hyped as the first one or the third one did. I know many people aregoing to disagree but i do have my reasons for saying so. As those who have watched the first season may know it ended on a cliffhanger. Naturally, when the first half of the episodes were out, I was ecstatic. Imagine all the built up anticipation waiting for the continuation of the the actual competition for months and months, who wouldn't be excited? (P.S i couldn't wait for the anime and instead rushed for the manga. But that just made me long for the anime that much more) And true enough, the show delivered. All the battles were as awesome, if not more so than the first season. Even though the second arc was a huge step down from the finals hype, it was not to be blamed because of the episode constraint. It being a short anime season does not have that much of a leeway because of the tight constraint that is 12 episodes. The real problem lies in the fact there is no real plot involved throughout this season. Now, before you get mad, just hear me out. In the first season, throughout all 24 episodes, you knew that the show was heading somewhere. That it had a specific goal for every arc. Soma enrolling into Totsuki, saving the Don RS club, passing the examination with his friends, challenging *** to save Tadokoro's expulsion. They were all filled with excitement. What's going to happen next arc!? I found myself asking. Since the 2nd season is mainly about the Autumn Elections Main Competition, it lacks a certain eagerness from the first season. Sure, the hype was still there, but it revolved wholly around the competition unlike the first season which had spread the elements of surprise over different arcs and different stories. In the case of the 2nd season, once the hype ended, the transition into the next arc felt more like a interlude than anything else, or OVA if you will. Even the 2nd arc didn't have as much of an impact when compared to the other arcs from the first season. It just felt like a small training session for Soma and Soma alone. None of the other characters were shown (Only tadokoro and others briefly for about 1 minute) and there weren't any real twist or surprises from the show. Not even any indication it was going anywhere. By the time it ended, i was expressionless. I didn't feel the hype, nor did i feel any excitement. For strict anime watchers, you aren't even convinced there'll be a 3rd season (unless you read the manga beforehand). All in all, it is a great season but it just pales in terms of plot to the other 2 seasons, and by quite a margin. Though some of the battles were better than the 1st and especially 3rd arc, and not to mention points are given for the Mimasaka battle and the unexpected finals winner, so its plot level was still above average. Oh, and i LOVED the first intern arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 \\n\\n\r\nNo real comparisons from this season and the first. Though some of the metaphors used in the show was disappointing. Such an example would be Tadokoro and Ryo's ahem 'gang battle'. I'd honestly be more shocked if anybody enjoyed that. That metaphor alone ruined Tadokoro's personality. The first season protrayal of tadokoro... now that was a masterpiece! Other than that, no real complaints.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nAs always, the music is astounding. More soundtracks have found its way into the viewers heart. One such soundtrack i can think of is during the first fight. Global Innovator of Taste. The whole soundtrack just screams NAKIRI ALICE! The previous season soundtracks were awesome as usual.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nRemember when i said the characters didn't get much growth development during the first season? Well, this is where they start to shine. For starters, more of their character backstories are revealed so that you may start to relate to them more. Their skills are also explained to a clearer effect to enhance them as a character. Not to mention with the transition from season 1 to 2, you could clearly see that each of their skills have improved (cooking and personality wise), and not just Soma himself. Their ferocity and competitiveness also got fiercer and it is shown with much clarity during the pre finals fight. And that is something that i find really entertaining because it hinted that they will be back as stronger characters in the future. Oh and just 1 little detail that managed to push the initial score of 9 to a 10, and that is secretary Hisako. It's really enticing to see how much her character has developed. Not only did her perspective change, you could see just how much she has to change her views in order to grow and improve, especially after deeming herself incapable of being by her master's side.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThere are certain parts of the show that i think are really really outstanding and have rewatched them a few times. Though it felt a little lacking afters its first season, it is still nevertheless a great show. And the main competition deserves more than just the spotlight of the show. So, watch it for that if not for anything else.",

            "content": "STORY - 7\r\nART - 10\r\nSOUND - 8\r\nCHARACTER - 9\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\r\nThe Second Plate picked up from the first season, coming in strong with all the greatness of foods and characters that we got previously. With that, this season took a slightly different path away from comedic enjoyment towards a much more heated atmosphere in the kitchen.\r\nThe main highlight that took the spotlight is the extra competitive nature that enshrouded many of the characters. From here, we have many cooking ideals that faced off against each other, striving to reach the top in their own ways. These battles to cook the best foods introduced character developmentsthat we didn't get in detail from the season before, a very nice addition that was needed. However, all these great ideas were moderately ruined by how the story was presented. With only thirteen episodes, there were minimal build up as they went right into the mix when the episode started. It's a problem especially with the faster pacing. Absorbing all the information only to get into the next part can be kind of overwhelming, which is why some importance or significance were lost during several scenes. That aside, the humorous aspect that can be experienced a lot in the first season were toned down quite a bit, along with the fanservice. Like I said, it focused a lot of time on expanding the characters, so whether or not you missed the lightheartedness are up to each person's taste. Personally, I wanted more of it between a couple of parts due to the issues I've mentioned. Nonetheless, you will be treated with awesome new information of foods and characters' history, along with bits of hype or comedy seasonings sprinkled here and there.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, the bright colors does stood out a bit more noticeably compared to Season 1. It definitely felt refined, and the animation is still as fluid as before. Capturing the cuisine of each dish with extreme details caused more drooling to occur. With the fanservice, not only is there less of it, the exaggeration were decreased too so you can focus more on the presentation of the dishes itself rather than their reactions. That did helped during the rushed parts but honestly, sometimes I yearned more for it. The faster pacing also affected the sound aspect. There were times where the words coming out of the mouth felt like gibberish to my ears, mostly because they spoke fast with minimal pauses. With the OSTs, it was for a different reason. They were masked by the huge amount of dialogues going on, drawing my attention to the voice-actors rather than the soundtracks. This can be fixed with more careful pacing to give a balanced audio experience. Still managed to portray the distinct cultural side of this anime but the potential for better experiences is there.\\n\\n\r\nThough The Second Plate was lower than what I was expecting, the story revealed more of what we should expect as the characters journeyed deeper through the professional world of cooking. My main gripe was the pacing issue and unfortunately, it affected a couple of factors. However, that alone didn't stopped Season 2 of Shokugeki no Souma to be an entertaining anime that will bring enjoyment to your table.",

WHAT A SEASON IT WAS!\r\nShokugeki took the concept of BATTLE SHOUNEN to a brand new level! In the Autumn election arc, the screenwriters crafted make one of the most exciting and creative tournments on the history of shounen anime. The duels were full of twists and turns, great dialogue and imagery. Autumn Election is at the same level as DBZ'S Namek Saga; Saint Seiya's Sanctuary Arc or Samurai X's Kyoto Arc and other great shounen sagas, it reaches the quintessence of a shounen perfectly.  If you liked the first season, youwill be just addicted by the new episodes and get stucked in Tootsuki Academy competitive ambience. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, the new season features the great Stagiarie mini arc, were we can see all the evolution of Yukiriha Souma, confirming him as one of the greatest anime protagonists of all time. \\n\\n\r\nThe combination between an over the top championship and character development is the great merit of this second season, making this one even better then the first one. Yes, you read it right. Ni no Sara is even greater than its predecessor. Not only it had improvements on plot and pacing, but also had technical improvements. The animation is even better, the use of CGI is harmonic with the handrawing. This one is more fluid and vivid, continuing the great work of rocking the viewer's senses. The great soundtrack continues the same of the first season, with improvements on the opening and ending songs, the best of the franchise. \\n\\n\r\nSo as Souma, JC Staff have improved its work and made a even better animation. Can't wait for a possible third plate, enjoying the manga while I wait.",

The characters are enjoyable except for one I found, the music is still good as it compliments scenes and the art/animation is just the same as last season's. Overall a solid second season to Food Wars without losing or gaining anything.\r\nThe one character that sort of threw me out of enjoying Food Wars less is the Subaru guy who studies his opponents to the very detail. Like it's an interestingconcept but it just sounds too unreal and ridiculous for a cooking competition...\\n\r\nAnd the entire arc just feels so shouneny (lol ain't a word but deal with it). The moral felt so forced, they were basically spoon feeding it or slapping it to my face. It's a personal nitpick but I don't like shounen and some people do and that's fine. I know Food Wars is a shounen and there are lots of shounen aspects/conventions in it but the interesting dishes and food they make in a creative way and the characters were also fun to watch is what made me forgive that it was a shounen. But alas this time, that Subaru guy pushed it. I made up this phrase to the common phrase \"Suspension of Disbelief.\" Where you forgive a film/tv show for it's unrealistic bits because you're have too much fun to notice or care for it. Well this show has made me make up the phrase \"Suspension of ShounenDisbelief.\" I was willing to forgive a lot of Food Wars season 1 and 2' shounen aspects because I was enjoying it too much but the copycat chef really killed it for me. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAside from the nitpick of Subaru, the show is still as average but as entertaining and enjoyable as the first season.",

So far, Yukihira is still in his middle school uniform, man what the fuck is keeping illustrator Shun Saeki from  making Yukihira wear the standard T\u014dtsuki uniform?  The best fanservice we can see was with Ryoko in her underwear, inpsite of it this category is still a 5 over 10, I may have given it a 10 if I could have seen some Mito fanservice at least in a full bikini.\\n\\n\r\nSound, I gave this part a 7 over 10 due to the opening and for Megumi's seiyu, Minami Takahashi, since I find it cute.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter, still a 5 over 10, since we still see the same characters as from the 1st season, as mentioned \"No Development\", despite of the addition of new judges. I don't have to go any further....besides the star of this anime were always the food.......... \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment, I enjoy this anime up to the end of the Shokugeki, I've started to get bored on the 11th episode, where I've skipped ep 12 and just waited for the 13th, frankly they should have ended on the  Shokugeki part and not go to that Stagiaire , thing, so its a fair 6 over 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, a 5 over 10, it's obvious that Y\u016bto Tsukuda, was banking on the food preparations as if he's making something like an over pumped up Master Chef, frankly , his work isn't that bad, but overtime it becomes boring as if one is too full to eat more, so no to season 3, if there will be one.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'm full!",

            "content": "Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara is the second season of the popular Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Souma series.  It is the continuation of the trials, tribulations, and misadventures willingly taken on by culinary prodigy Souma Yukihira.  As in S1, most of the episodes in this season fit together well and did not rush into advancing the plot prematurely.  There were no \"fillers\", with each episode providing a unique step forward in the overall plot.\r\nThe art style is neither realistic nor overly basic.  It is, however, extremely suggestive.  If you're a fan-service enthusiast, you will definitely be pleased.While the seductive nature surrounding many of the female characters may have coaxed some comedic elements out from the other characters, I do believe it detracted, slightly, from the plotline.  That being said, the animation was fluid and well-made without any significant deviation throughout the season.\\n\\n\r\nI watched the English DUB of this show and can confirm that the voices harmonized with their respective characters well.  This was not the case in S1, but seemingly over time, significant improvements were made.  The background music fit each scene well, as did the OP/ED.  The sound effects relating to the preparation and cooking of dishes was superb.  It caught me off-guard in S1 but I was prepared this season.  Thankfully, I was not let down.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters did not develop appreciably from S1, they were neither basic nor complex.  Nobody, including Souma Yukihira, seemed to evolve over time.  He and many of the other characters simply became better culinarily but no effort was given to display growth in other aspects - there was a distinct lack of well-roundedness.  Using the same formula from S1, the show focused too much on building each character into a master chef rather than expounding upon their personal feelings, thoughts, and desires.\\n\\n\r\nFood Wars!: Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara is a decent sequel to Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Souma.  I feel somewhat disappointed because this season had the chance to fix some of the issues found in S1 and didn't.  I won't be re-watching Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara for the time being.  It isn't a terrible season but it failed to impress - it's the very definition of average.",

Do not read this if you haven't finished the last episode!    \r\nIn sports, there are certain teams that are really good during the regular season, but when the playoffs come around, these teams that may win 75% or more of their regular season games, suddenly fall in the Post-season when it really counts.  The feeling that that leaves their fans with is a feeling of disappointment, which probably wouldn't be that deep if they didn't recognize how much talent their team had.  You want them to win, not just have good regularseason runs and when they don't you feel deflated and irritated.  \\n\\n\r\nThat's what Shoukugeki No Souma has become.  Souma is that guy that tears it up in the regular season, but when it really counts, he just keeps falling short.  He can go off for 30 points a game in the regular season, but just keeps hitting clunkers when it matters most.  Souma will run through all of the lower level cooks, but when it comes time to take home a big prize, he keeps losing.  It's frustrating because you want him to win.  \\n\\n\r\nI understand that this is being done to grow him as a character, as he learns from his losses.  And ultimately, it makes you root for him more.  But, it's not a good habit to keep closing seasons with a feeling of disappointment for the viewer.  I do like the fact that it really leaves you wondering who is going to win, and doesn't make it obvious.  But, animes should at least keep their MC looking top-tier, if not the very best.  Souma's repeated major failures are starting to make him look second rate to me.  The end result of the Tournament was irritating enough, but was it really necessary to have his chicken egg quail rejected at the end?  And sure, once again, it was turned around into a teachable moment, but should've just won it outright to clear the disappointment from the Finals.  He's supposed to be the son of the greatest chef and a prodigy in his own right.  He shouldn't be losing even rushed, post-finals filler challenges to get his quail on a menu in a restaurant we'll never even see again.  Send the viewer home happy without an asterisk.   \\n\\n\r\nIt's frustrating.  But, nevertheless, in spite of this growing flaw, I love the series.  I enjoyed this season in spite of the disappointment, because of the lovable cast, the good animation, the over the top reactions and comedy.  As I move into season 3, hopefully, there will be some big wins for Souma and not more disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\\n",

            "content": "Making a sequel for an existing series usually implies trying to accomplish one goal: Don't screw up too much.  It's common knowledge that sequels are usually never as good as the original, so the general baseline when making a sequel is to make the newly made material up to at least the standard of the previous season to try and eradicate the stigma as much as possible.  So what happens when you adapt a second season of one of the two most popular cooking manga into a 13 episode series instead of its predecessor's original 24 episode run?  Well you get Shokugekiseason 2.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Picking up from the cliffhanger that the first season ended on, season two focuses on the end of the Autumn Elections competition arc and the Stagiare arc that comes right after the Autumn Elections are over.  Complete with the normal shenanigans of the Shokugeki series and growth with some of the characters, why is the story that we get so faulty?\\n\\n\r\nThere's no questioning that J.C. staff has done a faithful adaptation, especially for the Autumn Elections arc.  Much like the original manga series, the Autumn Elections take up a huge chunk of the series in order to complete, spending the majority of the season 2 runtime to finish up the remaining battles and rivalries that come later with rather great detail.  It's the kind of adaptation that most series can only dream of since J.C. Staff rarely leaves out any of the details involving that arc.  Everything including character development, side interactions, and pacing are kept in rather well and succeed in bringing a close to the second largest arc of the Shokugeki no Souma series.  Then there's the Stagiare arc.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to compensate for the sheer amount of detail that Autumn Elections give us, J.C. had to pawn away time from the second arc that they were doing in order to bring that big one to a close.  This unbalance left the proceeding story to rush through in three episodes and the end result was abysmal.  The pacing was quickened through, development for characters got cut short, and overall left a bad taste in my mouth.  Character development was there, but it wasn't left on the plate long enough for us to sit and take in, thus leaving what we saw to feel hollow and unnatural.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, season 2's story was the dessert to end the main course we were introduced to in the first season; a little sweet treat with a slightly bitter aftertaste to end a decently satisfying meal.  While I am personally disgruntled at the quality of the Stagiare arc, I can say for certain that the overall quality is still moderately well executed.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Good detail to finish its cliffhanger\\n\r\n-  Second arc severely lacked the same treatment\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:  Quite honestly, characters are really not that big of a deal to talk about.  Due to the nature of this sequel, the cast save for a few exceptions are the same as last season with those few exceptions being nothing more than other rivals or side characters that add to the particular arc that's being shown at the current moment of time.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of going through the actual characters (since well they still the same people), first up is the meat of this entire season, growth.  The entire season is more or less dedicated to the growth of its characters.  Souma, Megumi, and many other members of the recurring cast get varying degrees of growth and/or character motivations that're sprinkled in episode after episode.  Sometimes focusing entirely on a single character for the whole episode, sometimes only for a scene or two, the story puts them together surprisingly well to create some meaningful changes that evoke care from the audience.  Some however are better treated than others, so not everything is perfect.  (Poor Hisako)\\n\\n\r\nAs for the new additions to the cast, all of them are side characters that pertain to one arc or another.  Quite a few of them are memorable side characters, so there's an upside I suppose.  But don't expect to see much more of them or add them to the main set of characters since they're side characters and by the law of shonen, if you don't show up for more than 1 arc, you're time is up.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good character development\\n\r\n+/- Memorable side characters (That is a shame that on some cases we don't get more of them)\\n\r\n-  Some character development was rickety and/or rushed through\\n\\n\r\nArt: J.C. Staff's art quality only skyrockets or goes to a decent level when the company gives a sh*t about the series that they're adapting.  In Shokugeki's case, they care very, very much.  \\n\\n\r\nMuch like the first season, the overall quality of the series is bright, inviting, and has a lot of appeal with all of the imagery that the series uses in order to represent the current emotions or cooking style that every character uses.  From anime references to demonization, and the ever classic \"Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking series\" hentai foodgasm scenes, the overall quality and look of the series really has nothing truly terrible about it.  I will say that the foodgasm scenes have drastically reduced, or at least to the point where you don't see them every other episode, or something.  They're still there, just not as frequent.\\n\\n\r\nBut the true testament to how good the series looks is the food.  Food is by far the most focused part of the art as the glistening and shimmering sauces on the turtle or duck that they characters prepare show just how good food in anime can actually look.  Every dish was animated with such care to the point you might want to lick your screen trying to get a taste of whatever these high school students prepared.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Quality food animation\\n\r\n+ Good animation all around\\n\\n\r\nSound:  The soundtrack for the series is admittedly not really the best.  Personally, I prefer the tracks to season one since what they showcased and used here really didn't sound or feel all that memorable.  Good tracks, but not anything I'd listen to over and over again like other OPs that I know of.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  I'm still pissed about the Stagiare arc.  It's probably my favorite arc considering how non-competition focused it is and how the show focused in a wacky shonen-like way what it's like to be cooking outside of Tootsuki.  It was such a different dynamic from the rest of the series that I grew attached to it and actually saw some kind of learning experience from the series since up till this point it's been nonstop cooking competitions with little to no actual learning shown.  (I know it's a battle manga, but this is a school.  At least show us them learning something sometime.)\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nI did.  Admittedly, I'm not the biggest Shokugeki fan, but it's definitely a series I roll with and have a lot of fun both watching and reading.  This season tied up loose ends and did well to adapt the source material despite its flaws, so it's good in my book.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf my rant wasn't clear enough, the last three episodes focusing on the Stagiare arc.  Rushed through that faster than someone cowering from Souma's experiments.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you watched season 1 and you want a conclusion, you can watch this.  Aside from that, don't.  Due to the nature of the adaptation, watching season 2 will get you sorely lost and would lead me to question why you even tried to watch the sequel before the original.",

            "content": "Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara, is the second season of an anime culinary show, which has elements of ecchi, comedy and even bits romance. I was really surprised at how much I liked the first season. I enjoyed the simple flow of the story, the original characters and their interactions. It had this weird thing about it, which you don\u00b4t see in many anime. There was no real antagonist. Even when there was an opponent of the MC, they soon turned friends. All the characters had good and compact backstories. It even had a somewhat romantic feel between the MC and Erina Nakiri, whichI enjoyed. But, unfortunately I\u00b4m talking about the first season. The second season, or second dish as they called it, lacks in almost every area. I will be comparing it to the first season, to show how much it lacks. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, I liked the simple story of the first season, but here it is just too simple. While the first season story was about how Souma went through the ranks, trying to prove everybody that even if he comes from a diner, he can still be better than kids from rich restaurants. It showed different competitions, challenges and just dialogues that could stand on their own, but still connected the story. In the second season, about 3/4 of the story consists of one single competition and cook-offs within it. The rest of the story seems to not be really that connected with anything, except maybe the possible season 3. Yes, you will get moments of tension and build-up, but without any time for character development you will start seeing that it is just a cooking show. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that a modern anime show must have to stand out, especially if it wants to take experiment with such things as cook-offs, is good art and animation. Shokugeki no Souma gets that right. Colourful, smooth drawing makes the show really enjoyable. That goes very nicely with smooth and fast animations, which are a must for the cooking part of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u00b4ll keep it simple here. The intro was good, the outro was okay. The music wasn\u00b4t anything exceptional, but it did build up some tension where needed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nPossibly the biggest let down of the second season. As mentioned earlier, the first season didn\u00b4t really have any bad guys. Or even if it had, you either really liked them and even cheered for them, or they turned good right away. I was disappointed to see that the second season had just a straight up bad and boring character. I didn\u00b4t feel anything for him, I just wanted him to lose. Before I watched the acclaimed culinary anime show known as Shokugeki no Souma, I asked myself a question. What can make it that good? I found my answer in the characters and their interactions. From the romantic tension between Souma and Erina, to the friendly mentor relationship between Souma and Megumi, it all felt alive. All the character had a nice, but compact backstory which made you cheer for them. However, in the second season there are a lot less characters. And even those that appear seem to be stripped of all the thing that made them special. Megumi and the Aldini brothers hardly get any screen time. The season seems to be mainly focused on the MC, Souma. So it would make sense if he would have a lot of character development, they would show more of his dilemmas, and made him less OP than the first season one. Wrong. They went with the casual MC superhero type for half of the season. At points he even reminded me of Saitama from OPM. At least in the first season he had to think about how to solve his problems with the power of working in a real restaurant. Here he just uses his super cooking abilities. That sort of got fixed in the second half of the season, where they showed interactions between the rest of Polar Star dormitory and other characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAlthough this season focused a lot more on cooking than the first one, it still kept you hype for the next weeks episode. That is the part which they got most correct. Before this show I never would have thought that I would be hyped up all week just to see the results of a cook-off on TV.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI was really thinking about giving it as 6/10, but the second half somewhat saved it. Also there is my sweet nostalgia of the first season. It is not in anyway a bad season, it just has parts which are too mediocre. It doesn\u00b4t stand out. Take it this way, if this was the first season it would get no where near the hype as the first one has got. It has parts which may be on par with the first one, but it never surpasses it. It doesn\u00b4t really focus on comedy, characters or ecchi in particular. It is pretty much about cooking, what may be a nice thing for some chefs, but I have a hard time cooking pancakes, so I couldn\u00b4t care less about the history of some indonesian spices. \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it? I guess if you have seen the first season it won\u00b4t hurt to see the second one. \\n\\n",

I liked it a lot I enjoyed the 43rd annual Totsuki Autumn Election Arc it was very good and enjoyable. That being said the story wasn't as great as the first season. I didn't like the last couple of episodes. Also, the matches could have been a bit longer.\r\nArt - The art is great as always. If you like anime with great visuals, art and animation then you will love this anime. Every character has a spectacular design and the animationis great in every episode. \\n\\n\r\nSound - The music in this season was disappointing. The opening was quite terrible in my opinion. It could have been much better. After getting spoiled with 2 fantastic openings in season 1 this opening left me very disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - The characters are excellent as always. One thing I like about this show is the characters. The characters have so much personality. Overall the characters are excellent. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - It was enjoyable but it wasn't as enjoyable as the first season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - Very good season but can never be as good as the first season. \\n\\n\r\nSCORE - 72% (Recommended)",

            "content": "Second plate is a direct continuation of season one, and fits in seamlessly with the end of season 1. It's the same formula for the most part, and the cast barely changes. This can be both good and bad, depending on what you're looking for in a series like this. \r\nDid you enjoy the formula from season 1? If so, you'll continue to enjoy season 2. If not, you won't find anything too different here.\r\n**spoilers\r\nThere are a few additions that I really liked about season 2, and since I already wrote a review for season 1 I thought I'd mention them here. \r\nFor starters, thenew three-way rivalry betwee Souma, Ryou Kurokiba, and Akira Hayama introduced towards the end of the season is a great setup going into season 3. While this will mean that other characters may have to be pushed to the side for a while (or forever), the backstories of Ryou and Akima were constructed nicely and their motivations are competitive with the main character's. Basically, there are more people to root for than ever which makes it exciting.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoyed the creator's expansion of the culinary scope of the show. We started seeing more exotic dishes introduced this season, everything from mesquite BBQ to middle eastern food. More diverse food options, and more diverse cast options.\\n\\n\r\nBut the main problem that seems to be occurring now is that cast members are being brushed off to the side. We barely see the dormitory crew doing anything other than cheering or commentating, and we've only seen Erina Nakiri watching the action other than the one incident with the \"manga soup\" deal. Basically, the pacing and rotation of characters is getting a bit messy and the only way I can imagine them fixing it is to reduce the size of the cast a bit. \\n\\n\r\nI gave the show an 8 rather than the 9 I gave season 1, primarily because I didn't feel it justified to give the show another super-high rating again based on the same formula. The creators are going to have to find new ways to change up the dynamic going into season 3 to keep up the momentum, but even if they play it safe and stick to the same formula it'll definitely be entertaining enough to sit through.\\n",

            "content": "Once again Shokugeki no Souma doesn't fail to deliver it's amazing and tasty dish of a second season, it builds up from the previous season and unlike most sequels, becomes *better* and makes it's mark in an even higher position. This is my review of Shokugeki no Souma season 2, commence!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nContinuing immediately where we left off at the last season, Shokugeki no Souma wastes no time in bringing is straight to the front seat with the clash of cooking experts in what could be called the tournament season of the series. Likewise, it was fun and didn't waste even one second in getting thefood over burnt or uncooked and delivers at just the right pace, leaving is to the edge if our seats, edging for the next episode as it, like Akira's cooking, had it's own mastery of spice to add on in the form of suspense. You never once felt you could predict the winner of a match unlike in other anime. Credit to the last arc (the Stagiare arc) as it was my favorite part of the season.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJ.C Staff. They're my all-time favorite animation studio, and with good reason. The way they faithfully represent the original anime as well as revolutionizing it with the brilliant art design is very much commendable. The character design, the backgrounds, the color scheme and most of all the WAY THE COOKING LOOKED was ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. It totally made my mouth water as I stared at the dishes, something I had never before felt even while watching real life cooking shows like MasterChef.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAs usual the VAs were as incredible as they were from the last season, if not better. The OP/ED were really good, despite many people saying it wasn't so. Perhaps it's because it was inferior to the previous season's amazing OP/EDs which were at the absolute pinnacle of the top, quite the exquisite topping you'd expect. To say that this season's soundtrack wasn't good wouldn't be fair, as it in it's own right too was a legendary composition. Compared to most other animes out there it took the top cake (running out of food puns here) and was the cherry on top aside from the obvious and expected performance of the background music which was as usual brilliant to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with the characters last season was Himedere-sama, and thankfully it got resolved this time as she didn't act like one for most of the time, or maybe it was just me. The other characters? Well, they're incredible as usual ;)\\n\\n\r\nSouma: The title character, he improves his character a lot from where we left off, and mainly due to the tournament and final arc he became better. And that's something I found rare as most other sequel anime either have the same character development (Kazuma from KonoSuba) or worse (Gonna keep my mouth shut for this), and Souma as is his true nature sets himself apart from the crowd as he once again improved his personality from what he was in the first episode.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi: The other MC, Megumi once again stole our hearts as usual with her innocent and cute demeanor. She although didn't get as much attention as she got last season, too improved in her own way and it was quite applaudable at the way she did, because even though she didn't take much of an active part she still stole the show.\\n\\n\r\nErina: Thankfully this time around our resident Hime-sama wasn't so much of one now. She took a more laid back approach to her character which was a positive change as it made her personality a little more likable (just a little). This was prominent in the Hisako arc (of the last arc, the Stagiare one) which brought out both Erina's and Hisako's to a better degree. Which was really nice to see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nNeedless to say I loved watching the suspense, the mouth watering dishes, the adorable characters and the like in Shokugeki no Souma season 2. I wasn't disappointed at all at the way how it went through because it improved upon where the last season left off. The fanservice was... well.. GREAT. A bit toned down (I'm sure I heard a NANIIII right now from you) and even though I'm a massive Ecchi fan, I could live with this change. It had everything I could ask for in an anime. Comedy, suspense, competitive atmosphere, fanservice (wink wink) and the like.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.4\\n\\n\r\nWoah. That's c!ose to a 10. That's just how great this anime is (I hope you don't go to my profile and read my old 10/10 reviews because they're well... quite biased, but I took over a new leaf so SHUSH OKAY!!!), It had the perfect blend of everything one could ask for and delivers an absolutely wonderful dish balanced out everywhere, ranging from the umami to the fragrance, down to the right detail (get the reference?). One of the best anime sequels to date! The best way you could follow up to another gem of a first season out there!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: Once again, Megumi best girl <3 Although strangely Hisako came at a close second. Mainly because of that final arc (don't worry I won't spoil it) but I liked it a lot. As you can see, I was very very fond of that final arc, and I hope you will too!\\n\\n\r\nGlad you liked it ;)",

            "content": "The first season disgusted me from the start with a completely shameless cheap fanservice policy, which thankfully died down as the series went along.\r\nMy reaction was very negative to Shokugeki because no matter where I looked, it felt like the most boring characters ever had been shoved into the most generic nekketsu ever(only with food) and the whole had been coated into some sort of boob wrapping to make it \"appealing\". And I'm not by any stretch opposed to fanservice. Fanservice is great. Just like salt in your food. And just like salt in your food, if you have none it lacks taste, if youhave too much, it's disgusting.\\n\\n\r\nLet's say that season 1 started off as water gorged with salt, and while the salt levels decreased slowly till the end, first impressions are important and they left a very bad one on me.\\n\\n\r\nStill, Shokugeki Season 2 has kept on the trend of Season 1: while fanservice is still cheap and mostly unwarranted at this point, it doesn't bombard your eyes like it used to, so it's safe to say that we're out of Magic Orgasmland by now.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of what I said about Season 1 still holds up.\\n\\n\r\nYou have a generic nekketsu (with food) and a bunch of characters which are all boring, bad, uninventive and generally are absolutely not worth a second of your time, all of them cooks, all of them exposed through flashbacks, all of them resting on one trope (princess, admirer, prideful child, prideful adult, too nice for own good, silent assassin, pirate, etc, etc).\\n\\n\r\nI guess you could call it a \"pick your waifu/husbando\" anime, too. Too many characters, each has one trope, none are in any way deep, so just pick your flavor. Mine's Alice Nakiri, by the way.\\n\\n\r\nApart from the terrible poor characters, I think the story got a bit of a kick compared to season 1. It's essentially the same nekketsu story you're used to, go to a place, meet a villain, beat him, get in a tournament and beat him except the ones you just stock up so you can beat them in the next tournament... but there were some nice touches I think. They brought back characters that were sidelined, they did keep me a tiny bit in suspense over who would win the main contest of this season, and although I honestly care about nobody in this show, it was still better than Season 1.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound still deliver every way. Cute girls, huge boobs, and a few nice guitar notes here and there. For a 2016 anime, it does its job very honestly.\\n\\n\r\nA side note I'd like to make is that I always compare Shokugeki to Dagashi Kashi, because they're amazingly polar opposites.\\n\r\nShokugeki has 0 originality, Dagashi tried tons of strange stuff.\\n\r\nShokugeki has 100000 characters that suck, Dagashi has 5 that are worked on.\\n\r\nShokugeki is abysmal to look at outside of its \"mcdonalds entertainment\" value, Dagashi is immensely interesting.\\n\r\nShokugeki is fun, Dagashi is boring like a rainy day with the power cut off.\\n\\n\r\nThese two represent some sort of amazing polarity, one is generally boring, done cheap and yet managed to squeeze a lot of imagination and ambition out of itself, it aimed for experimentation and made itself a great identity, and the other is so generic it's painful, its characters marry their fanservice in some sort of creepy cult of the Giant Boob Without Brains,  it's a waifu market with no real appeal yet you can swallow the entire season in one go and not feel bored or overwhelmed by all the action(although that one does tend to weigh over time, this anime is 80% cooking or cooking educaiton).\\n\\n\r\nA very boring experimentation VS a really entertaining tasteless noise.\\n\\n\r\nSo while in my opinion it's far better than season 1, fanservice is less present, characters are a bit more fleshed out thanks to the whole season behind us, and it has some neat touches here and there, the final word's the same: if you want a good anime, look elsewhere, if you want mcdonalds,  digest-without-a-brain generic entertainment to keep you busy while you eat dinner, Shokugeki has every waifu and husbando for you.",

            "content": "I enjoyed the first season of Food wars immensely and i was overjoyed \r\nwhen he heard that there will be a new season for the series. \r\nAs with the first season the story follows Yukihira Soma as he works \r\nto learn all there is about cooking and improve his cooking skills by \r\ntaking part in competitions and beating powerful opponents while surviving in the elite cooking school Totsuki academy. This season continues on from the first season and having managed to win in the preliminaries Soma is one of the 8 people that managed to get to the main tournament. \r\nYukihira Soma is the maincharacter of the series. \\n\r\nThe son of a former member of the elite ten Yukihira is an earnest, energetic and positive person that is confident with his skills. However he is always willing to learn and improve upon his skills while at the same time deflecting what hostile perceptions he gets from his enemies who most often than not become allies. Yukihira's most prominent trait is perhaps his creativity in that he is able to create many an outstanding dish using ingredients that many thought were too common. \\n\\n\r\nMegumi is a friend, dorm mate and classmate of Soma and co and serves as one of the heroines in the series. Megumi is similar to Soma in that both come from backgrounds different to most students at the academy in that they come from rather humble backgrounds and do not have large restaurants or well known restaurants under their name.\\n\\n\r\nMegumi's personality remains unchanged and she is meek, quiet and prone to panic but she also can be determined and resolute when it counts. Megumi is kind by nature though she can be a bit of an airhead. \\n\\n\r\nErina is Soma's main rival and one of the heroines of the series. \\n\r\nErina is one of the Totsuki academy's elite ten and has a rather unique specialty in that of the god tongue in which she can determine what ingredients something has just by tasting it once. Erina's personality is your typical rich girls personality in that she's arrogant,proud and haughty but she has a softer side to her and her inexperience in romance is quite funny. \\n\\n\r\nErina has a rather interesting relationship with Soma in that she views him as a rival as she sees herself above him in status and skill yet Soma continues to stay and improve his skills much to her chagrin. \\n\\n\r\nTakumi and his brother Isami are friends and fellow students of Soma and co. Both are chefs from Italy and specialize in Italian cuisine. Takumi is an earnest, kind and skilled chef who maintains a one sided rivalry with Soma that i find hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a rival Takumi is more like a friendly rival that often provides advice and support for Soma when he's out of fresh ideas for his dishes.  \\n\\n\r\nAlice is Erina's cousin and a fellow student of Soma and co. Alice is mischievous, skilled and friendly and is very different to Erina in that regard. However she is just as skilled in cooking as any other character on the series and her specialty is Molecular Gastronomy which is a field that i for one never heard off lol. Alice's prominent trait is her cunning and intelligence. \\n\\n\r\nAlice is one of my favorite characters from the series because she \\n\r\nis more friendly than Erina and the fact that she pouts when she loses makes her really cute. Plus the byplay between her and Ryo are hillarious. Chinatsu Akasaki is one of my fav seiyuu's and her portrayal of Alice was well done. \\n\\n\r\nAkira is a fellow student of Soma and Co and perhaps one of the best cooks \\n\r\nin the current generation of students alongside Soma and Ryo. Calm, Collected and reserved Akira emphases on the word patience. Akira's most prominent trait and his specialty is his sense of smell in that he is able to pick out the individual ingredients that make up a dish by his sense of smell alone. \\n\r\nThough Akira can be arrogant he's not a bad person by nature. Akira has a interesting relationship with his guardian and teacher Jun sensei though. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSubaru aka the Stalker biker is a fellow student of Soma and co and probably \\n\r\none of the most unusual characters i ever encountered. Arrogant, sadistic and cruel Subaru is a character that looks like a mirror bad version of Soma in that while no doubt skilled reminds me of an intimidating brute that only cares about winning. \\n\\n\r\nHis specialty if you can call it that is copying in which he researches his targets thoroughly and determine what dish they would try and create and replicating that dish when the time comes creating the same thing that is better. As punishment for the loser he selects a tool that they prize and take it away from them thus causing misery.  Though his backstory about his lack of acceptance by his father changed my impressions of him somewhat Subaru is a character that i didn't like very much. \\n\\n\r\nHisako is a fellow student of Soma and Co and is Erina's secretary to which she respects highly. Skilled, prideful and stubborn Hisako until this season usually only followed Erina around but in this season she finally got the chance to shine. \\n\\n\r\nHisako's specialty of medicinal cooking is unusual to say the least but unique enough for her. Her first dish for the main tournament was a turtle hamburger in which she shockingly prepared it by butchering the turtle. This image of butchering an animal is perhaps an image that i generally won't associate with someone like her normally. \\n\\n\r\nHisako's personality changes as the series goes on as after the tournament came the stag arc in which she was paired with her idols nemesis and rival Soma. Though at first she was still hostile towards him this eventually changed to being a bit more friendly towards him. And it was nice seeing Hisako being able to recover from the tournament by regaining\\n\r\nher confidence and aiming to stand beside Erina rather than behind her. \\n\\n\r\nSaori Onishi really portrayed her character well and Hisako is one of my fav support characters. \\n\\n\r\nRyo is a fellow student of Soma and Co and is the aide to Alice. \\n\r\nInterestingly Ryo actually has two different personalities with the normal one being rather plain and meek while the other one that only shows up when he's cooking is loud, rude and challenging and aggressive somewhat like a mad dog. Ryo's specialty is seafood as he grew up and worked in a seaside restaurant where he learnt all the skills that he knows today. \\n\\n\r\nRyo has a rather interesting perception of a kitchen that i find \\n\r\nunusual.  Ryo is a great character in his own right and his skills are on par \\n\r\nwith the likes of Akira and Soma and probably above Alice as well. \\n\\n\r\nThe Totsuki Alumni are the previous generation of students \\n\r\nthat were in the academy prior to the current generation. With few exception the majority of the alumni that were featured in the series were members of that generations elite ten. Of the list my favorite members were Hinako who i found to be  hillarious and Shinomiya who while cool and detached is actually a nice guy by heart. \\n\\n\r\nHinako and Shinomiya's interactions are always so funny and Hinako's Seiyuu Mamiko Noto did a fantastic job portraying her. \\n\\n\r\nArt for the series was pretty good as was the character designs which i found to sharp and largely faithful to the manga. The animation itself was pretty clear and the colors were sharp. The animation for the food and the preparation for it was especially good. \\n\\n\r\nMusic was good for the whole series especially the opening and ending themes. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was superb as always and every seiyuu did a fantastic job portraying their characters. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development and story pacing was also good \\n\\n\r\nOverall A fantastic series that was every bit as amazing as the first season. \\n\r\nThe series was faithful to its source material and the arcs that were featured in this season was shown amazingly. The story was backed up by a great cast of characters that were played by some of Japan's best up and coming seiyuu's with Risa Taneda who played Erina and Minami Takahashi\\n\r\nwho played Megumi, Saori Onishi who played Hisako and Chinatsu Akasaki who played Alice being my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nI really hope that there will be a next season to show off the next story arcs. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nSince my Review on this series has been removed prior, Let me start off by reviewing about the early episodes.\r\n----------------------------------\r\nThe first episodes was mostly fan service and what we call \"food gasm\" occuring which took most of the minutes in this episode rather than the story building up and the characters. Oh god and the amount of jump cuts that was happening was so quick and bad which they tried it to make it look epic after a Season 2 coming which in my opinion think it was a complete FAIL. If you actually inspect the cut scenes and the amount of fanservice happening ,which the whole thing was TIME consuming and not very enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nEpisode 2 was an Improvement from the previous episode as the character\\n\r\ndevelopment was getting better by displaying both characters background skills and their capabilities, but the pacing as usual was horrible as well as the Animation at the end when Kurokiba ryou gave that \"hot,sizzling\" ramen to Megumi Tadoroko and Her ass was Wobbling and went bazonkers like a FKING JELLY???? LIKE WTF.....Come on J.C Staff Studio, We all know you made that scene to be hilarious but honestly you could do better. In terms of enjoyment for episode 3, It was really boring and they was really no point of watching but Episode 4 man....that was a very good watch, it had more depth of what was going on within the tournament, felt more sympathy towards Takumi Aldini and as viewers wondering how the next episode will turn out to be.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nThe quality so far from Episode 5 to 7 has stepped up and you can actually see the impact it has for the viewer because instead of the quick jump cuts they did through the earlier episodes, they decreased the amount of fan service a bit by showing more plots on whats going on and the whole meaning behind the tournament \"Autumn Elections\". \\n\\n\r\nSPOILER\\n\r\n---------------\\n\r\nNow that Kurokiba and Hayama drew the match in episode 7 which clearly both sides werent happy with the score because of that one Judge who couldnt decide the better taste from one another. This gave a new beginning and chapter to a 3 way match! Which never happened before in totsuki culinary school! in episode 8 and 9! Kurokiba Ryo vs Hayama Akira vs Yukihira Souma! This was the perfect opportunity for Yukihira to adapt and improve his cooking skills as he always wanted to beat both of them because of what happened in the previous preliminary.\\n\\n\r\nSince Hayama Akira won the autumn elections which Yukihira Souma was very disappointed about, Him and Kurokiba ryo have been thinking outside of the box to improve on their cooking skills whilst still being competitive with one another. Both of them have been visiting Hayama Akira's place a lot to taste his food. They do this, so they can analyze what Hayama's flaws are and how they can beat him at upcoming battles.\\n\\n\r\nIn the upcoming late episodes, We see the students have to partake a stagiaire in order to advance through the next stages. Yukihira souma passed the first stage stagiaire sucessfully and enrolled to the next one at Chef Shinomiya Kojiro restaurant. As viewers we know that, Chef shinomiya kojiro was a previous First seat in Elite ten council and the first japanese man to earn the \"Pluspol\" award. Considering that now he is a world reowned chef and someone Yukihira challenged to a shokugeki, we know he will be very critical about Souma's food and the skills he is able to display in the kitchen. During episode 12, Yukihira souma was able to improve his skills inside the kitchen and improve his pace on par with the other chef at Shinomiya's place, this factor contributed to Shinomiya having a positive image of Yukihira passing the stagiaire entirely since a student like him challenged him to a shokugeki, However at the end of the episode , Yukihira asks shinomiya if he can enter the compeitition alongside him in order him for him to ADAPT entirely as a chef and see where his limits ends at, which Shinomiya agrees to but has his worry that the food Souma will come up with will be bad.\\n\\n\r\nSince the anime came to an end, what i can actually say is that the Soundtrack is amazing and Art is average i guess. The amount of Fanservice time was a LOT BETTER compared to the first series and doesnt ruin the story.",

            "content": "Moving on from the awesomeness of the first season, I expected the second to deliver similar if not better results, especially with all of the hype for the \"Autumn Elections\" which promised a series of climactic and high-level battles between all of our favorite chefs. However in my eyes, what we were given was nothing of the sort.\r\nStory: 4\r\nTo begin with, the story and its progression were highly sub-optimal; sub-average in fact. Whilst the first season had a strong approach to its direction, making you guess at every turn how things would play out, the second has settled into a series of monotonous battles thatall have the same feel to them. All of the key events have become increasingly predictable, removing a large sense of excitement and wonder that I felt from the first season. Additionally, each episode consists almost entirely of just the battle between the chefs, leaving little room for any actual character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nContinuing the theme from the first season, the art style of Shokugeki no Souma is still astonishing, and fits the show very well. Looking at the food does genuinely make you want to eat it. The only downfall to the art is the animation, which can appear stagnant at times.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nA theme song that is by far shadowed by its predecessor, along with an internal track that is mostly reused, left this anime lacking in terms of a unique music direction. I no longer feel the tension I felt after watching the first season, or the sense of badassery in the intro, meaning it has lost a lot of its charm for me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nAs stated in the story paragraph, this anime has very little besides the battles themselves. Therefore, the characters are often neglected, and very little has happened thus far to further them. On top of this, many of the already defined traits of the characters from the first season have been ignored to a large extent in the name of advancing the plot, leaving the already defined characters seeming devoid of their previous features.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6\\n\r\nDespite the huge drop in quality from the first season to the second season, this anime is still quite enjoyable. Although the battles are predictable, they are still heated contests that are fun to sit through. It is not boring, it just lacks the flare needed to make it stand out like the first season did.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nThe average across my scores for the previous parts is a 5, but I believe that the overall score this anime should have is a 7. This is because despite its failings, it is still what I consider to be a \"Good\" anime, which is a cut above many mediocre productions. To those who enjoyed the first season, this should be watched only if you feel the need to see an end to the story. If you felt satisfied enough by finishing the first season, then it may be better to avoid this one entirely.",

            "content": "The blazing hot season ended with a big bang that would instill it to be one of the good ones. With this, big expectations were..... well.... \"expected\" (well duh) on the second season, and with it, a big hurdle of a cliff hanger to connect. Running only 1 cour, this season is also tightening up in time so..... a big skip from the original series was also imminent. And just as predicted, it did skip a lot of prep arcs. But still the production made it well enough to make it as far as they can while keeping the quality of the story at ahigh point so...... a big hand to them (Seriously). Well dividing it as usual, here is the rating status of the Second Season:\\n\\n\r\nStory - 6: Yep, it was fairly understandable along with a few obvious skip points to be told, but the overall impact of the story didn't wane much. A bit sad though that it could only reach Stagiaire arc, but still it could've gone a lot worse. Fairly happy yet fairly disappointed.\\n\r\nArt - 8: It holds to be one of the qualities that didn't go bad. Although a few episodes used many flashback cuts, the overall quality is quite good enough to render it to 7. I only added one point on a few humor cuts which are also pretty hilarious to the point that I've seen them being used as meme.\\n\r\nSound - 9: Even though I'd say the first season's first ED was better, the second season's ED just as good. The sarcastic yet comedic voice overs are still there so...... (lol).\\n\r\nCharacter - 7: Shino's back! Yay!...... that's the only thing I could tell. Aside from that, the addition of few new characters which I won't probably remember and the highlight of the director stripping (Finally)..... yep, nothing much ..... (SHINO'S BACK!)\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6: If this season was food, then I might've shove in too much into my mouth without chewing. That sense of \"rushing due to time\" keeps me from totally enjoying the whole season. The good thing though is that it didn't choke me off from watching.\\n\r\nOverall - 7: Yeah, the first season is definitely better, but it's all due to the fact that time was against them on the second one. Rushing too much ended up making its viewers feel something was lacking this season. But by far in total, Shokugeki no Soma is still definitely one of the notable series to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I was very disappointed that it didn't make it to the reveal of Soma's dad but meh....... not related to this season. :P",

            "content": "My score: 7/10\r\nThree words: flamboyant, over-the-top, yet charismatic\r\nLooking at it fully, the second season was even better than the first. It had development, it had twists, it had the beheading of that annoying beast that was \u2018character over-powering\u2019. It was fast paced, bright and engaging. Really, it deserves an 8.\r\nSo why a 7? \r\nI suppose for me, the first season is always more enjoyable for me. Rarely have I enjoyed a second season MORE than the first. The first season had character relations to build, which is usually my favorite aspect of any show. Season 2 opens with all characters having been set in theirniche. So what I look for in a season 2 would be flexibility and further development of those characters. Not an easy task for sure, especially in a 12 episode season, but what I\u2019d have liked nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter breakdown:\\n\r\nHere in season 2, every character remained, not only a niche, but in a stereotype as well. Honestly, if the art wasn\u2019t so blinding and distracting, the stereotypes would have been so blatantly obvious, I may have dropped it (Note: no, I definitely would have.) \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, one of the only reasons I\u2019m not full out destroying their character roll is because, possibly by sheer dumb luck, the lead character is so charismatic. Souma is charming and interesting, and not an airhead and is actually pretty quiet and intelligent, which is a breath of fresh air when it comes to main male characters. That\u2019s what has carried me through the show feeling like I was getting my time\u2019s worth. Not to say there aren\u2019t other good characters, because they are, but when it comes down to it, you spend most of your time with the lead, and if the lead sucks, the show sinks. \\n\\n\r\nAnd although I criticized character development, I will say this doesn\u2019t apply to Hayama Akira. He had brilliant moments, and I went from neutral to being an actual fan.\\n\\n\r\nThe other bits:\\n\r\nVisuals were top notch again. The food looks incredible, and the presentation of basically the entire show is so \u2026 facetious, so anime, you can\u2019t help but roll your eyes, enjoying every darn second of it. The music, the voices, the directing; all extremely flashy. But hey, that\u2019s Shokugeki no Souma, and it\u2019s what separates it from the crowd. That and the mouth-watering food.\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict:\\n\r\nWatched season 1 and liked it? Watch this.\\n\r\nNew to the series in general? I dropped this season 1, episode 1. The very next week, I saw the next episode in the latest updates, and decided to give it a go. And its flashiness has had me ever since. \\n",

            "content": "Shokugeki No Soma is a strange beast. It annoys me, but makes me laugh all the same. It's like one of those annoying friends who keep on bugging you, but you can't help but like them a little.\r\nStory: The story in Shokugeki No Soma is the low point of the series, meaning, there isn't much story. Soma wants to become a better chef than his dad and ends up going to a high class culinary school. The plot is simple, but it works. In the world of Shokugeki No Soma people settle a lot of their disputes through food battles, which have people make extremereactions according to the food. This ends up with mostly being ecchi stuff, like people losing their clothing, but can be fun (\"Oops. I turned into a young girl for a second\" hint hint). Tragically, I think the writers must have had a hard time writing about food as it mostly boils down to \"The umami of this works well with the umami of that. The sourness enhances the umami. Umami this, umami that...\". It's like 90% of all taste is suddenly umami. I call that \"bullshit\" or \"horse crap\".\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The shows art style is nice and flexible, switching fluently between detailed drawings and a more simplistic style (usually when the character aren't acting seriously or for comedic relief). This is well done and goes well with the show. Also, the food is nicely drawn and kinda makes me hungry sometimes. The sound is also very well done, with nice voice acting and good sound effects.\\n\r\nCharacters: The character are a diverse trope filled with most of the stereotypical characters, some mixes and a few, a bit, original. They are enjoyable enough, but usually doesn't get you too invested in their lives.\\n\r\nOverall: Shokugeki no Soma annoys me often, especially with way they describe flavors, but it's a fun watch with enough to keep me watching it all the way. If you're not super against flashing of skin (with awkwardly placed light beams or items placed in front of the more daring areas) or drawn underwear, and want some, over the top, extreme comedy this is a nice watch. Intensive, mostly brainless fun.\\n\r\nEnjoy!",

            "content": "Food porn season 2!!! I recently finished this anime. I watched this cuz next season, the 3rd installment of this series will air, and this time, I\u2019m planning on watching it weekly.\r\nWhat I really like about this series was that the anime feels like its a shounen anime even though it doesn\u2019t have any action sequences. It was that intense, every cooking competition was really intense and thrilling, I can\u2019t even stop pressing the next button every time an episode ends.\r\nThe art and animation were consistent all throughout the series. I really really loved the fact they parodied some of shounen famous anime scenes (likeJojo, card game animes, etc.) to make the anime and the competition more entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI think the only negative point I could give to this series is the unfairness of character development. I do understand why this was happening. The series was intently following the manga, so it can\u2019t be helped. At least, they did shed light to some characters, about their background and why they were doing what they were doing. I\u2019m still waiting for more of Erina. Indeed, Erina can be seen all through out the series, but we still don\u2019t see and understand much about her. My questions about her since season 1 were still not answered. I do hope I could get them this new season.\\n\\n\r\nIf you like food porn, watch this!!!\\n\\n\r\nLel. What I really want to say was this anime can be watched by anyone, even for shounen or mecha fans. It\u2019s that enjoyable. But beware, you will get hungry after watching the characters cook such yummy foods.",

            "content": "Ah Shokugeki, probably my favorite ecchi series of all time. Mainly because the fanservice is done in a comedic way that actually adds to my enjoyment rather than detract. Unfortunately the sequel disappointed me quite a bit. The sound and art are still top notch but the characters and story fell apart for me in this season. Ni no Sara takes place right after season 1, meaning we get kicked right into the tournament arc. Sadly the tournament arc which is the biggest part of the series is so bland. There's none of the cutthroat tension from the previous season. There aren't any students gettingkicked out or even any cool preperation arcs. These things are what made Shokugeki entertaining for me in the first place. There's only so many times that the eye-opening, orgasmic \"This food is excellent!\" reaction can stay entertaining before it gets boring. It's also not nearly as funny as season 1. Thankfully the show REALLY picks up in the last 3 episodes. It's because of them that I chose to give this season a 7 instead of a 5 or a 6. The tension comes back, Soma's creativity comes into play and there's a lot of charatcer development to be had as well. It's ironic that the last 3 episodes which could be considered filler were the most entertaining. So should you watch Shokugeki Season 2? If you liked season 1 then yes but don't expect the same kind of quality the first season had. If you didn't like season 1 you will HATE this series. Hope this review helped a little :)\\n\\n\r\n-Prorogon",

I've been comparing this series to Yuri!!! on Ice and Bleach a lot because it has a lot of the same competition/battle feels that put you on the edge of your seat. \r\nThis season does feature the inclusion of a new character that's kind of out of left field, so that may throw you off abit because he hadn't been seen in the series at all before, but don't let it deter you from the rest of this season's story because it's amazing. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime doesn't relent when it comes to amazing characters and showdowns. What's better is the seasons blend together perfectly so it feels like no time has passed in between each one. You should definitely keep supporting this anime if you loved the first season.",

The food still looks great an appetizing, the ecchi has been toned down, but I really want to see more in terms of character development and the deepening of the relationships between the main protagonists, rivals and support.\r\nI hope this doesn't turn into another typical Shounen wherethe main character just evolves in the most unimaginative way possible, just fighting stronger and stronger opponents one after another.\\n\\n\r\nI know this isn't a romance anime and is primarily about cooking, but more character development and change in the dynamics of the relationship between Soma and Nakiri / Tadokoro would have been more than welcome.",

I am surprisingly pleased with this anime because when I first saw it I put it off because I thought I would hate it but then one day I decided to give it a watch and I do not regret it. the weakness part is the story the story is ok its not bad but not greatthe story follows the Main Character named Souma he has been cooking under his dad his whole life mastering his craft so to speak. and one day his dad took off out of nowhere and send his son to the top cooking school in japan. now the characters I feel that the characters make this anime work if it wasn't for the characters it would fail this anime did a really good job on characters there was no almost no useless characters each character had its own personality and back stories for each character were solid and character development is decent. now lets get into the Ecci and I will admit I hates Ecci anime series 9/10 times but this show is in that 10 percent the ecci scenes only really happen when they eat the food which is great because it is a way to show how good the food is and the ecci seems very subtle and not in your face this is one of the few times I actual enjoy Ecci in an anime or manga series. if you hate the ecci tag I would personally still give it a shot. the art and sound are great no problems here. this anime was really close to a 8/10 but I thought the story was a little weak but Overall good anime I would definitely give it a shot.",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Shokugeki no Souma: Ni no Sara. This second season was a bit of a drop in quality in some ways. However it was still a really enjoyable show.\r\nThe story continues where we left off in the first season. The autumn elections are proceeding into the head to head matches. For those of you who thought this was a dragging part of the show, i'm afraid you'll be disappointed in this season. Nine of the thirteen episodes are dedicated to finishing the elections, and the ending is predictable, but not terrible. The last four episodes are dedicated toSouma growing again as he faces the next set of challenges. This nicely sets us up for another season, which i'll be looking forward to.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is top quality again. Soundtrack same as usual, though none of the music caught me.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were mostly the same as they were in the previous season. There was little in the way of character development for anyone who didn't make it into the next stage of the elections. A new character was introduced and some side plots emerged a little but mostly everyone was the same. My only gripe here was that some of the characters lost a bit of the charm and the dialogue felt a bit forced and annoying. \"You cant hope to beat me!\" was literally said dozens of times. It just felt a little cheap and overused.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed this season but again it didn't feel as good. This season only had 13 episodes to work with and even though certain event were dragged out, it still felt rushed. The pacing of the first season was slow perhaps, but well done. Unfortunately there was something off with this seasons presentation and the pacing to be equally as good. For those who didn't like the ecchi bits of the first season, you may find the second season more appealing. There was far less sexual themed visions. This may seem like a win, but it also was a loss. Like I mentioned in my other review, even though it was over the top is still was able to convey the feeling of the food. This season though descriptive, was lackluster. It felt like the excitement, and the food was a bit wilted.\\n\\n\r\nI think they did the right thing by showing us all of the cook off's. Though this season may have taken a dive in enjoyment, they left us with new possibilities and finished a section that could have meant the end of the show. I'll chalk this up to being a springboard season and await a fresh and enjoying season 3.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Finishing up first season. Bit of a drop in quality in terms of characters and enjoyment. However it was still rather enjoyable.\\n\\n",

I will focus this review on the differences between the two seasons; please see my review on season 1 for a full discussion of the series' merits.\r\nSeparated into two main arcs, Shokugeki season 2 begins by completing the food tournament from season 1. This section doubles down on its sensory overload with foodgasms and gushing monologues describing the dishes. Personally, I felt this to be uninspired and saccharine (hencemy lower overall rating). However, the second arc accommodates for this by investing in character development. In total, Shokugeki remains fun and sets up well for another upcoming season.\\n\\n\r\nStory [5/10]\\n\r\nPacing [7/10]\\n\r\nArt [7/10]\\n\r\nSound [7/10]\\n\r\nCharacter [6/10]\\n\r\nEnjoyment [6/10]\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [6/10]",

            "content": "Honestly - they should have ended this anime after the first season which was very good.\r\nPeople are really doing this series a disservice by rating it far higher due to their love of the first season.\r\nThis second season is truly pathetic, over the top, and BORING.\r\nSeriously.  I enjoyed the first season very much but this 2nd season is leaving nothing but a horrible taste in my mouth.  I honestly can't see how people are rating this any higher than I have and even I'm giving it more than I should because I'm biased due to the first season.\r\nI just feel like I'm wastingtime now.  The progression has disappeared and I feel robbed.",

            "content": "SnS Ni no Sara begins with a battle. A battle that is depicted as incredibly unlucky and disadvantageous. A battle where the MC faces with one of the most formidable opponent. In metaphorical way, the first episode is a battle between a hero and the grand-daughter of the demon lord himself. The ominousity, the darkness that envelops the battle field, the semi-final boss\u2019 giggles that send a chill down in our spine. This battle is so impactful and can be called as an epic......I wish i could say all of those.\r\nAfter seeing the fail-adapted first episode and the almost non-existent opening plot, it\u2019s only naturalthat people\u2019s expectation become low. Not only for a few episodes ahead, but can be for a whole season. This is one factor that makes this second plate pale in comparison compared to the first plate. The very first beginning of the story wanted to be epic and impactful, but what we find is an epicly fail-cooked adaptation from its original source.\\n\\n\r\nAfter that beginning, only battles and battles await the viewers. Battles which speak of the characters personality, potential, strength, their struggle, their motivation etc \u2013 but it is only spoken without much development. And unfortunately, those battles are the main ingredients of this second plate.\\n\r\nYes, those ingredients are fixed ones, can\u2019t be changed \u2013 those ingredients were the first pitfall of its original source, and become trouble for the chefs in the anime production. Just be thankful for the viewers that can eat those ingredients in 2 and half months. The original source took more than a year.\\n\\n\r\nBut this second plate isn\u2019t entirely worse. In a single glance, we don\u2019t see any useless jello in this plate. The over-used abstract backgrounds are still there, but now being used in a more moderate way. In the first part of the first plate,  what we hear from the characters are mainly their exotic voices, which is trying to emphasize their sexual strength instead of their personality. In this second plate, however, this doesn\u2019t happen...not as much as the first plate. Technically, things are better cooked in the second plate.\\n\\n\r\nAs this anime is trying to fully adapt the original source as much as possible, which is commendable, there\u2019s heavy challenge to adapt Saeki Shun-sensei\u2019s style into an anime. His style has this \u201csharp\u201d nuance, which may become a difficulty to be drawn into an animation.\\n\r\nBut then, comes episode 4 of the second plate. Truly well-adapted episode that dwarfs all of its siblings. Episode 4 is a proof that a creatively cooked \u201cbad ingredient\u201d can be turned into something truly delicious. \\n",
