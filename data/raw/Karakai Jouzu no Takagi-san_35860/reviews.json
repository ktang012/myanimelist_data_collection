            "content": "First off thanks for upvoting this review guys! This is my first review and it feels good to get a solid response from it. I'm editing and adding more of my thoughts for this reason.\r\nI don't like using the Story, art, sound, etc, way of reviewing. This is due to may great anime having no story and shit art but still being endlessly better than anime with complex stories etc.\r\nThe big reason to watch this show is the Super witty dialogue/humor and the somewhat lovable innocent characters. Now time to turn off your brain and laugh at the main character Takagi-Sans wit as she mentallytears apart Nishikata much alike how DoomGuy might rip a demon apart. The anguish shown on Nishikatas face is quite satisfying after he has been proven to be an idiot twenty times per episode...if you're a sadist.\\n\r\nLook... I'm gonna level with y'all. We all had that kid in school who could always one up you or prove you wrong, and personally this anime brought up some embarrassing memories of me being an idiot. Much alike how many people cringe while watching Watamote or Chunibyo and other delusions.\\n\r\nYou will quickly learn that Nishikita isn't treated like a human being by the shows creators. He's a tool...a tool to be used by Takagi-San to make the show entertaining. He isnt treated fairly or morally by anyone in the show and it makes me sad, what a sad character. He's so innocent but everyone screws him over, and all for the sole reason of he's the punching bag so lets lay into that bastard.\\n\r\nReally though if you want an anime like this but without the emotional battery try watching Seki-Kun master of wasting time. Its very similar except every episode is 10 minutes. Which is more viewer friendly for this type of show anyways.\\n\r\noverall 5/10\\n\r\nTHIS ANIME IS NOT OVER. There is still time for it to become more than a girl pushing around a dopey guy, I don't stop halfway through anime and eagerly await what will happen next in this mediocre yet fun anime.",

            "content": "In the moment you encounter that special someone, everything else is rendered obsolete. In this encounter, the world around you, the people in your life, and the things they demand of you all lose meaning. Your attention belongs to that special someone and no other. Time itself ceases to move as your encounter unfolds; when that special someone carries on a conversation with you, it feels as if it\u2019ll last forever. Your heart races, pulsating as if it\u2019ll spring forth from your chest at any given time. Your nerves quiver, the butterflies fluttering freely inside your body. Your vision blurs and your face crimsons, theblood coursing through your head at an alarming rate. Clouded by a whirlwind of strange thoughts, emotions, and instincts, you react to this encounter in a completely different fashion than you would in any other situation. The ideas you contemplate, the things you say, and the actions you create are a jumbled mess, shaken and stirred by the heat of the moment. Just as the conversation is gathering steam, that special someone departs from you and the encounter concludes. Time has moved forward again. While you\u2019re mostly relieved to distance yourself from the situation, there\u2019s a part of you that pleads to return to that brief encounter, that yearns to conversate with that special someone, that fantasizes of losing yourself in the moment once more. \\n\\n\r\nFor those that have become infatuated with a crush, for those that are adjusting to their feelings of attraction for another, for those that are stumbling their way into their first relationship, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is a reflection of their lives, their own romantic endeavors manifesting themselves on a grand scale. As this show ignites and refines the chemistry between its two protagonists, Nishitaka and Takagi, it reveals its understanding of relationships and the intricacies they possess. Subdued in its tone and serene in its outlook, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san\u2019s handling of its central couple is accomplished with nigh-unparalleled ease, using their series of frivolous yet elaborate pranks to slowly and steadily transition into something more, and its examination of their relationship is delivered with a rather unconventional approach.\\n\\n\r\nWhen two contrasting personalities attempt to align, there is an army of problems that arise along the way due to the differences between them. Although said differences can generate a rift in relationships, they can also strengthen them; contrasting personalities naturally heighten common interests. While most works of the romance genre opt for discovering these common interests, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san almost entirely ignores this pursuit. Instead, what it values is how these characters think and why they\u2019re attracted to one another. In particular, it values these concepts as they relate to Nishitaka.\\n\\n\r\nIt is his point-of-view that Skilled Teaser Takagi-san operates from. It is his series of pranks, his attempts to outwit and \u201ctease\u201d Takagi, that this show mainly revolves around. Nishitaka is always thinking of ways to perplex Takagi, either by concocting a complex scheme to use on her or (more often than not) by solving the problems she gives him. Every challenge Nishitaka tackles, every puzzle he confronts, makes for a satisfying watch. No two obstacles are alike; each distinct in their own way, they\u2019re deceptively simple at first glance but dangerously intricate the more you analyze them. And, boy, does Nishitaka analyze these obstacles. The music crescendos to a fever pitch, with saxophones screaming their way through, and the animation dizzily spirals out of control, its color scheme constantly changing, as he ceaselessly conjures countermoves and hypothetical solutions in his head. To Nishitaka, these pranks are far from trivial pastime activities. To him, they are battles of the intellectual variety, epic in scale, each choice determining one\u2019s fate.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that Nishitaka cares deeply about outsmarting Takagi, which makes it all the more depressing to witness him falling short time after time. It matters not what plan he formulates, what measures he takes, what approach he adapts; the result never changes. Nishitaka is Sisyphus, forever doomed to try changing his fate, to watch his efforts go to waste, to repeat the same pattern. It\u2019s not his fault, though. With his remarkable tenacity, perception, confidence, and cunning, Nishitaka definitely distinguishes himself as a talented individual. Were he competing against someone else, against anyone else, one could argue that he\u2019d easily be more than a match for them. However, as long as Nishitaka remains tethered to his current circumstances, he\u2019ll always be defeated. Sure, he\u2019s quite intelligent for someone his age but, for all of his virtues, he pales in comparison to the titular character.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cProdigy\u201d is an overused word; it's a term that's often given to people who don't deserve such praise. Takagi, however, is an exception. Not only is she able to unravel the most intricate of Gordian knots but she also does so effortlessly. Not only does she repeatedly confound Nishitaka with riddles, traps, and decoys galore but she also manipulates each and every one to obscure her true motives. However, it\u2019s not just Nishitaka that Takagi dupes. On multiple occasions, she easily deciphers the tricks her classmates pull on her, alongside subjecting them to a few of her own, and (in one memorable instance) she\u2019s even able to deceive her teacher, manipulating him into disciplining someone else for her transgression. \\n\\n\r\nWith each competition, with each episode, with each challenge, it\u2019s almost pre-determined who's going to persevere in the end. On the one hand, this pattern of predictability causes Takagi to come across as a Mary Sue, one who's almost entirely defined by her ceaseless victories. On the other hand, you simply cannot resist watching her mercilessly outfox her peers time after time. Takagi is akin to a world-renowned chessmaster practicing against novices of the game, a decorated military tactician competing against cadets in the field, a veteran criminal investigator matching wits with rookies on the job; the inevitable outcome of each encounter never detracts from the entertainment value that they provide. While it is pleasing to witness Takagi flaunting her intellect, it\u2019s in conveying this show\u2019s themes where she really proves her worth.\\n\\n\r\nSkilled Teaser Takagi-san is, perhaps more than anything else, a master of subverting expectations.  With each issue that arises, the solution to them is never what you\u2019d anticipate. Takagi and the show itself deceive you into assuming, alongside Nishitaka, that the motives, nuances, and hints in each situation are leading to one solution when the true answer is entirely different. Again and again, this show emphasizes that Takagi\u2019s victories are due to Nishitaka overthinking each situation, attempting to uncover the deeper meaning behind it, instead of choosing the most obvious answer. Through its titular character, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san argues that the problems we encounter in life aren't as challenging or complex as we think they are. Through Takagi, this show argues that if we can push aside the details surrounding these problems (alongside our preconceived notions of them) and simply examine them for what they are, it'd be easy to find a solution for our issues.\\n\\n\r\nFor Takagi, each challenge presents an opportunity for Nishitaka to acquire more knowledge, and she strives to accomplish that goal. Yes, part of why Takagi teases him is for her own amusement; she enjoys watching her opponent panic, struggle and ultimately collapse under the pressure she places upon him. However, the other part is because Takagi wants to see Nishitaka mature and grow. The puzzles that she tasks him with are crafted out of love; Takagi gives Nishitaka a hard time mainly because she cares about him, and this detail really strengthens their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Skilled Teaser Takagi-san directs its focus away from the smoke and mirrors, it's actually a genuinely sweet and charming show to watch, and the central couple\u2019s relationship emphasizes its virtues. On the surface, Nishitaka and Takagi couldn't be more different if they tried. While Nishitaka approaches every situation with tact and caution, Takagi is far more direct. While Nishitaka leans towards the naive, Takagi is incredibly perceptive. While Nishitaka is something of a workaholic, Takagi is more relaxed. However, with a closer observation, one can see that, despite the surface-level differences, they are essentially alike. Both Nishitaka and Takagi are confident and intelligent individuals that adopt an extremely timid approach to their relationship (Nishitaka more than Takagi). Watching them develop more and more into expressing their feelings for one another, while supporting each other along the way, is easily the highlight of the show. In fact, the central couple's bond is so heartwarming, nuanced, and inspiring that it allows one to overlook the more unappealing aspects, the various deficiencies and mishaps, of this show that materialize just outside the insulated sphere of the central couple.\\n\\n\r\n100% Unrequited Love is an in-universe anime that not only inspires a few of Nishitaka\u2019s schemes but it also serves to poke fun at other works of the romance genre. By overloading Unrequited Love with genre-specific stereotypes, cliches and tropes, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san claims that it's different from the other shows of its chosen field, more intelligent and self-aware than the rest. However, when it involves its supporting cast, Takagi-san resorts to the same tiresome and tedious cliches as its peers. Whenever this show transitions away from its central couple and towards the people around them, it almost always suffers because of it. While the supporting cast strengthens Takagi-san\u2019s youthful charm, they also represent this show at its weakest. With each appearance the supporting cast makes, it becomes more and more apparent that, outside of its central couple, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san isn't all that adept at developing its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Mano and Nakai, classmates of Nishitaka and Takagi, is among the most dull and lifeless that I\u2019ve seen in recent memory. Mano is the \u201cshy one\u201d, blushing, squirming, and stammering about to no end, while Nakai is but a cardboard cutout, hardly worth mentioning, really, and they lack even a faint resemblance of chemistry. Then, there's Mina and Sanae, classmates of the central couple that serve as comic relief. The adventures that this pair embark on are rife with memorable gags - my personal favorite is a recurring act where they dub over random conversations, like an exchange between cats or a chat between the central couple - but they tend to wear themselves out after a while. Mina and Sanae\u2019s adventures are meant to represent the protagonists\u2019 shenanigans from a different, more carefree, perspective but they (more or less) come across as re-iterations of previous events than anything creative or unique. It doesn't help matters much that this show stylistically pigeonholes these two. One is the \u201cgenki girl\u201d, manically working herself into a frenzy over trivial matters, while the other is the \u201cquiet one\u201d, silently observing the mess that unfolds around her, and Takagi-san never allows either of them an opportunity to establish themselves beyond these classifications. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Takagi-san strays from its intended course (mishandling a supporting character here, re-treading an old plot line there), it's the central couple's chemistry that helps re-adjust its focus. Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is, in part, an elaborate game of chess, a neverending battle of wits, with brilliant strategists on either side. It is also a refreshingly pure and simple tale of romance, a love story mostly unchained by the conventions of its peers. And all of it is deftly secured by the incredible bond between its protagonists. Fascinated with their intellect and awestruck by their passion, you cannot resist wishing to accompany the central couple in whatever direction their relationship guides them toward. Time itself ceases to move as you rush headlong into Takagi-san, allowing its loving, all-encompassing embrace to overtake you.",

            "content": "Life is like a game, if you play right, you\u2019ll win. Well, that\u2019s sounds like bullshit but life can feel like a game sometimes. You\u2019re like a player in a world with others and to be successful, you need to play right. Now, what the hell does that have to do with a show like \u201cKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san\u201d?\r\nTo put it simply, this show feels like watching two players compete but not in the way you\u2019d think. To me, Takagi and Nishikata are two characters that play with each other in life. However, it\u2019s a little bit different than competition. Between the two, Takagi isalways the one that stays ahead of the game. Think of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. In that show, the coyote attempts to catch the road runner but always comes up short. For this show, Takagi is always successful in defeating Nishikata at pretty much anything. As predictable and tedious as that sounds, the show is actually more than that.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve read the manga and even as a 1-cour adaptation, the show manages to deliver what\u2019s needed to achieve success. The majority of the story focuses on the duo of Takagi and Nishikata as the two main characters. Every episode takes on multiple segments that features the two in various shenanigans. Even though the show is fictional, many of these shenanigans can occur in real life. These range from being tricked into strolling down a shadowy tunnel, competing in sports, test of courage, school academics, and among many others. The main attraction of the show is to sell the character chemistry between Takagi and Nishikata. This pair\u2019s relationship will undeniably be the take or break for most viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOn the individual level, Takagi is a clever girl with a cute face and crafty mind. While she isn\u2019t a prodigy or gifted with extraordinary talent, she often thinks outside the box to outsmart her opponent, Nishikata. Takagi\u2019s character and personality also makes her quite likable as she carries a youthful charm. Even as she teases Nishikata, it\u2019s more than just teasing. She wants to know him more and through their interactions each time, they unintentionally grow closer. There\u2019s also no malice between the two despite the low key drama. From my perspective, Takagi considers Nishikata as more than just a friend. Some people may call that nonsense since she often plays Nishikata like a toy. However, if you really pay attention to their character interactions, it\u2019s easy to realize how close they are. Does this venture into the territory of romance? That\u2019s actually left for viewers\u2019 imaginations. There\u2019s the genre tag of romance for this series but it\u2019s far from a love story.\\n\\n\r\nNishikata is pretty much the boy that gets defeated by the master of tease, the one and only Takagi. The show often tries to make audience anticipate with a thrilling feel on whether he can ever beat her or not. For me, this made me come back to this show every week. From simple games involving erasers to more complex mind games with playing with emotions, it\u2019s the type of show that categorizes game as more than just winning. Nishikata himself is an average kid with an average personality and living an average life. We don\u2019t find out much about his past and honestly, I don\u2019t think we need to. This show focuses on the present and what\u2019s ahead rather than characterization. In essence, the show\u2019s character dynamics lies in how characters connect rather than how they develop. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, there are also three others that show up in the show although they are unrelated to the series as a whole. Well, technically they are in a way but they don\u2019t get involved with the teasing and games. That\u2019s probably one of my complaints about this show. They should keep the characters from Ashita wa Doyoubi away in this anime as it feels like a distraction. Thankfully, their screen time isn\u2019t long and mostly added to make the show flow a bit as a slice of life. That being said, I think the show succeeds not just in the character chemistry but also in pure comedy. The way characters react comes out naturally in many ways. This is especially true for Takagi as she often gets the joy of teasing Nishikata shown through her reactions. While Nishikata feels annoyed by this, he never truly hates her. In fact, you could say that he gets a joke out of losing countless times in their daily life games. \\n\\n\r\nA simple show like this only needs simple visuals and TMS Entertainment accomplishes that. Takagi is undeniably adorable with her charming smile, bright personality, and facial expressions. She\u2019s able to carry this show thanks to these characteristics that are adapted straight from the manga. Similarly, Nishikata has a goofy looking face that often makes him look like a fool, as viewers will expect in many episodes. It makes this pair incredibly cute to watch thanks to how they act. The art style enhances that experience. Their voice mannerisms also stays pretty consistent throughout the show. Even someone like Yuki Kaji can play a character like Nishikata as he\u2019s been in the roles of goofball characters before. The incredible voice acting of Takagi makes her character even more believable as a master of teasing.\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this show an 8 after reflecting on what I watched. At first, it seems like a high score for such a dry story. However, it\u2019s the pure comedy and character chemistry of the main character pair that won me over. Every episode made me laugh and it never betrayed expectations. There are times when I wish this show\u2019s segments would last longer than it should. Time flies fast when you\u2019re having fun after all.",

            "content": "With Winter 2018 comes a plethora of Slice of Life series. One of them being a war. A war between 2 middle schoolers. Enjoying their youth to the fullest comes the ecstatic interactions between our two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi. In short, the females always win.\r\nThat\u2019s basically the whole premise, a girl teasing a boy to no end and his failed attempts at retaliation only fans the flame even more. However, there\u2019s always variety in the way she does her schemes. It\u2019s fun to watch each time and highly enjoyable. As a manga reader, I am glad they were able to present all theemotions correctly and keep the tone as it should be originally. I appreciate the staff at Shin-Ei Animation for making this anime as fun as possible.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoy the extra cast with their small screen time. The random but appropriate situations the girls make are just as adorable and fun to watch even when it\u2019s for a short time. Works as a lovely transition to the Main Cast once more.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time on a Monday and just can\u2019t seem to get in any sort of mood, watch this anime and it\u2019s sure to bring your spirits up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is more nicer than I expected, especially the eye design. The manga had a super simple drawing for the eye unlike the anime where they added a bit more. I like it since it adds a bit more spice to the characters. I love the background art and the colours used in it. The animation is also great. The facial expressions are super fun to see and the character movements, although small, adds a more human feel to the characters. It\u2019s small details like those that I appreciate in a series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t too special, but it does its job properly, making the anime sound even funnier was accomplished by the soundtrack and I enjoyed listening to it. Both the OP and ED are indeed super catchy and I never skipped it for its cheerful visuals. I loved how we got both Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi to play our mains. That makes it even better for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe crazy antics between the two characters are what makes the interaction so...middle-schooler like. Seems just right when it comes to 2 kids having fun teasing eachother. Although, it\u2019s quite one-sided. Even so, the character chemistry is great and you mostly never get bored watching the dynamics between them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an anime that you wanna watch for fun. Nothing too endearing, but there to help with boredom and to put a smile on your face if it does at all. I loved reading the manga and the anime is just as good as it\u2019s presented. I am satisfied with this adaptation so far.\\n",

            "content": "Do you want to know what school days love is 10 years back?\r\nThis is a story of 2 backbench kids or to be precise, a daily or slice of life of a boy named Nishikata who gets teased by his benchmate Takagi by playing mind games on him.\r\nAlmost every situation is kind of different, i.e unlike in some anime like 'Tonari no Seki-kun'  where the situation is always in class but here in this anime we see diffferent scenarios from walking from home to school, doing homework, studying in library, summer holidays etc.\r\nThe main beauty of this anime is the presence of innocent loveor crush between the kids, the tension in air and being careful not to hurt the other person (Nishikata with Takagi). That sort of attitude is missing these days.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEach and every episode is refreshing and gives you smile especially seeing the expression on Nishikata's face, because they are priceless like Takagi states and teases him. \\n\r\nWhile the starting episodes have lots of teasing, as the series comes near ending, they are reduced and the focus is more on romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike I said it, It is a slice of life, so basically there isn't any story at all and not much characters either. Excluding the 2 main characters, we have 7 side characters who would'nt impact the main characters much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is funny, cos the head is big while the body is small, but it gives a better opportunity to understand the emotions of characters.\\n\\n\r\nComing to soundtracks, The opening and ending songs are really good and pleasing to hear, while the soundtracks in middle are just some monotonous tones to convey the situation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, If you are a fan of 5 minutes short comedy like Saiki Kusuo no \u03a8-nan or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, which do not have much story but make you smile every 5 minutes and remind you of your childhood days crush stories, then I am sure this anime is best suited for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want story, or development of characters or something meaningful to learn, then this isn't the choice for you :)",

            "content": "i just think this was the most underrated anime from winter season.\r\nJust don't overthink it,  this show in a nutshell is girl tease boy, he plans something to get tease her, backfires and gets teased again, simple and repetitive but very funny every time\r\nStory 7 | Art 9 | Sound 7 | Character 8 | Enjoyment 10 | Overall: 9\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story is repetitive but not boring, they somehow manage to make completely different scenes without getting the usual plot elements (tease, plans something, backfires,gets teased) and get a lot of comedy moments from it, simple but not everyone can do this.\r\nAside from thestory there is a little screen time for 3 girls, whose names I don't remember, and it's really good, with just a few minutes they show us 3 likable and different characters which are in the same class as the main, experiencing their problems, they show childish relatable stories with great comedy. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation background it's amazing, the character design isn't my cup of tea but i got to admit that it is  really impressive, it represents the age of our characters so well, by being kind of a childish artstyle, every background when Nishkita and Takagi walk together is great, just as if it were from a movie, I was really impressed by this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe ending, and op are not good at all and there is no point on reviewing. 3/10\\n\r\nThe voice character its really adhoc to its characters, this a feature i really like.\\n\r\nTakagi's voice is adorable and it suits her so well when he teases Nishikata 10/10\\n\r\nNishikata's voice represents well the age of the character, and the weird sounds when he gets frustrated can't be better 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nYou might say \u00a8Nishikata is a pussy\" \"Oh man he is so dense\" \"What an annoying character\" they are 12 years old, try to picture yourself at that time and basically you will describe yourself as the 3 words I used above, I think his attitude really portrays the age in which he is right now. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi is really likable, she basically carries the show herself,  appealing attitude, combined with a good representation on how girls really act at that age when they like someone and with a some mature comedy makes Takagi the star of the show 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLots of chemistry between this two characters, you can kind of feel the \"love\", every episode  Nishikita starts getting more in love with takagi without really realizing(just when we were younger), great interactions between characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching this series, it show us a simple life we all lived, with characters that actually feel kind of real, the teasing of girls when we were younger, the fluster moments you had without knowing why, they show us love seeing it with eyes of kids. The comedy element is present in here, I have laughed in all episodes so far, and the management of different stories but being faithful to their (plot,plans tease, backfires, tease) without making it annoying its really amazingly executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 4 episodes made me change my score from 8 to 9, amazing enjoyment I got from this series, amazing ending, I wish we have some of this simple but unique shows more frequently. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was a huge surprise. The ending is beyond Perfect",

            "content": "Over a year ago I reviewed a little anime called Skilled Teaser Takagi San a show that disliked it for it's mean spirited comedy, repetitive teasing matches and annoying characters. The main reason for this it's because I watched the series at the wrong time when I was jaded towards the romcom genre thanks to bad experiences from certain romcom animes that shall not be mentioned.\r\nMy jadedness eventually died out in November of that same year and I started to love romcom animes again. \r\nFast forward 4 months later where I made a list of romcom anime that I should give a second chance. SkilledTeaser Takagi San was the first anime on that list and I watched the whole series again in it's dubbed form on Blu-ray.\\n\\n\r\nAfter re-watching Skilled Teaser Takagi San I went from disliking it to loving it to a point it became not only one of my favourite shows of 2018 but one of my favourites romcoms period.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a young boy Nishikata who mercilessly gets teased by his classmate Takagi. Not wanting to be an easy target\u00a0he swears vengeance on his classmate Takagi for all the times she's teased him and made him blush out of embarrassment.\\n\r\nWill he be able to make Takagi-san\u00a0blush from embarrassment even once in the end? Find out in Skilled Teaser Takagi San.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that the story of Skilled Teaster Takagi San sweet is an understatement. This is one of the sweetest and innocent shows I have seen in a long while. Where do I begin? For starters does a fantastic job at establishing the shows innocent nature by having the kids in the series behave like actual natural kids that you will encounter in real life.\\n\\n\r\nNo unrealistic, melodrama, no misunderstanding contrivances just actual kids living they youth as people. It is very grounded on that aspect as it makes the world of Skilled Teaser Takagi San unique and refreshing compared to most romcom anime.\\n\r\nThe teasing matches themselves range from engaging, smart and addicting. Some would say that the series is way too repetitive for its own and I can understand why however the teasing matches add more to this show then hinder it thanks to brilliant character interactions that never gets old.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of theses teasing matches is that is they were not contrived and mean spirited. Nishikata may do some stupid things during the teaching matches that causes him to lose but the show reminds the viewer that he is a kid and kid's generally would do anything to reach the goal even if it's a dumb move that Takagi often comments on.\\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of Skilled Teaser Takagi San is how it's romance. Dialogue wise, especially in the beginning, may not be much however it completely makes by having character movements and body language.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler Alert)\\n\r\nEpisode 10 is the best example of this as it was the episode that these two would eventually become a couple. From Nishikata bushing more frequently than usual to Takagi getting more physical to Nishikata\u00a0Skilled Teaser Takagi San showcased that you don't always need long dialogue just to indicate love.\\n\r\n(End of spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nIf, there one thing that Skilled Teaser Takagi San does masterfully well that most other romcom anime lack these days is character chemistry.\\n\r\nDespite them having these teasing matches on a daily bases they actually do support one another very well.\\n\r\nAdd up to this show's rich comedy that would make anyone and you got yourself a charming romcom story on your hands.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had any nitpicks at with this innocent cute love story it would slow pacing at times then again this is a show that features primarily a child character cast and children tend to learn things slower compare to adults.\\n\r\nHowever, this nitpick is nothing compared to the fact that the show at times still functions like a short despite having 24 minutes of run time. It wasn't noticeable in the first and last couple of episodes but when that slights issue happened it really showed as some episodes did not translate well to the 24 minutes format. This is especially distracting when the show decided to focus on the funny but less interesting trio of girls.\\n\r\nLucky these small nitpicks that I had didn't damage the overall story for Skilled Teaser Tagaki San as It's a simple, nicely directed and entertaining slice of life romcom.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, this is a character driven show meaning the characters for a character-driven should bring they're A game. Thankfully the chararters in Skilled Teaser Takagi San are great and charming to watch from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNishikata is a sweet and adorable idiot. He consistently screws up his teasing antics against Takagi, and he always feels bad for screwing up. However, while he may be an idiot he makes up with determination and humanity. Despite him flailing he's very detected to beat Takagi at a teasing match however at the same time he's not a mean spirited angsty brat who wishes Takagi out of his life. This makes him a great character to watch because despite everything that happens to him still a human.\\n\\n\r\nThe real star of the show is without the question, Takagi. A first glance, she appears to your typical kindhearted and caring person who loves to tease her classmate Nishikata. \\n\r\nHowever, there's more to her than her teasing antics. She has a strong crush on him where she is constantly doing these sexual teasing acts just to penetrate Nishikata bluishness. \\n\r\nThis makes her an interesting foil for Nishikata to overcome and seeing her tease and outsmart him in the most unpredictable and savage ways was intriguing to watch. \\n\r\nDespite Takagi being my favourite character in the show, there was one slight problem I with her is that she can be a bit of a Mary Sue at times. She's not one of the theses annoying types or anything but at times she can be too perfect for her own good. Hopefully, this slight problem will get fixed in season 2. \\n\r\nDespite that small complaint, Takagi is an incredibly fun and likeable character to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are surprisingly good. While they don't develop as characters they were enjoyable chararters especially the main girl trio who were some of the funniest supporting chararters I have seen from 2018 thanks to nicely done short stories. \\n\r\nI'm glad that the series was able to have a strong cast because it wasn't for the characters then the series would be nothing more than a tedious slog feast.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the visuals side of things, Takagi San is gorgeous. The background scenery is masterfully drawn in a realistic way and it only made better with the show smooth colour palette that brings the scenery\u00a0to life.\\n\r\nCharacter designs were simple and nicely drawn especially Takagi. Forehead memes aside her design is gorgeously cute to the eye and I really adore her expressions.\\n\r\nThe animation may not be as good as the art as the series relays on basic animation techniques for movement but it was still serviceable for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound department, it's very good and fits well the cute and innocent show. \\n\r\nThis is all thanks to the Hiroaki Tsutsumi did an outstanding job at bringing this charming romcom series to life with the light instrument pieces that play in the background.\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending themes are super cute and perfectly fitted the show.\\n\\n\r\nRomcom anime generally have a hard time when it comes to English Dubs as many of them especially back then suffered from subpar audio quality and bad acting. When I decided to watch this show dubbed I was worried that these two cute love birds (Takagi and Nishikata) would be butchered by poor acting.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Funimation manages to produce a fantastic dub for it. \\n\r\nFunimation's rising figure Sarah Wiedenheft did an outstanding job voicing and portraying the cute Takagi. Another great performance in the dub goes to Aaron Dismuke voicing the determined Nishikata. Every other performance ranges from good to great.\\n\r\nGreat job Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nSkilled Teaser Takagi San won't be winning the best romcom anime award from me but it is still a great, fun and engaging show that I loved from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great, funny and nicely written, the visuals for a slice of life, romcom anime were stunningly beautiful and music is sweet.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an innocent and charming romcom anime to watch on a sunny afternoon than Skilled Teaser Takagi San would be a fantastic choice. It's an innocent and charming romcom piece that I hold in high regard.",

            "content": "Before I embark on my review of Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san, I would like to first mention that this is my first review; I am sorry if this does not meet your expectations in terms of length, word usage, or points I make. In this arguably harsh review, there will be a few spoilers that I would not quite categorize as candidates for ruining the show, but rather general, disappointing realities of it. I did not enjoy Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san if not at all because the concept became too repetitive (as many have also pointed out) and I did not enjoy it to beginwith. The character models were okay, the music fit, and the animation was quite nice. Unfortunately, the strengths end there, which leaves us with the flaws of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a hit or miss with most people: The main protagonist, 12-year-old Nishikata, is constantly being teased by a girl in his class who secretly has feelings for him, skilled teaser and forehead goddess Tagaki-san, who is entertained only by embarrassing him every day. Although this may be refreshing and different for some, I believe there is a reason that we have not seen something like this explode before. I use the words \u201cevery day\u201d and \u201cconstantly\u201d with all potential force that they carry - the entire show is episode 1 repeated over and over. If you do not like the first few episodes, you likely will not enjoy the rest of the series. Every time Nishikata plots revenge, it is immediately ruined by the fact that he will never carry it out successfully because that is what the entire show is about: this kid\u2019s hopelessness for getting back at the girl who teases him. For me, I could not help rooting for Nishikata when he devises a plan of revenge, but I always stop myself from getting too excited because I know it will never happen. This frustrates me because Tagaki always finds a magical way to work around his plan or conveniently say something that will throw Nishikata off and destroy his - in some cases - imaginatively formulated ideas for debunking this chick\u2019s ruling over him. The best example of this that I can remember is when they are comparing heights and the boy is actually taller than Takagi-san, so he thinks in his mind \u201cMan, I bet she\u2019s really bitter because she\u2019s shorter than me\u201d then the girl immediately says \u201cOh, and I\u2019m not bitter\u201d... like HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HE WAS THINKING THAT?!?! The show becomes so unrealistically biased towards Takagi-san that I cannot help hating her. This show seems to rely on their cute-faced characters when it comes to hiding the rather embarrassingly poor story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were unenjoyable because they were either too stupid or too shallow-minded and predictable. The aforementioned fact that there seems to be little to no change throughout the show leaves us with characters that developed in no way and told the same joke over and over again. Nishikata never carries out any kind of revenge or suddenly becomes less of a pansy, and Takagi is always entertained by his clumsiness and inability to not be an idiot. I would imagine that this quintessential category of development throughout the story would be present, but it seems this one just does not provide that factor. It feels like I am watching a clip of a fat man falling on repeat; it may be funny the first few times around, but it just cannot last 12 episodes. The show also follows the story of the clich\u00e9 group of friends containing a clueless girl (Mina Hibino), nerdy but witty girl (Yukari Amakawa), and sad and quiet but smart girl (Sanae Tsukimoto). I did not care much for this side-story because although it drew attention away from the atrociously repetitive story of the two main characters, it also did not have much substance itself. Each member of this friend group shows their character (all of which were extremely stereotypical) the entire show so they never changed or showed any signs of progression. Overall, the characters in this show are either clich\u00e9, lifeless stereotypes or tell the same joke the entire series and do not change at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend this show because of the sick, unchanging concept. If the idea of getting a friend to blush or become embarrassed interests you, try it. The fact that Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san carries out this idea for 13 episodes is the reason I composed this review: to save you innocent people from wasting the 5 hours of your life you would be spending to watch this anime. Obviously, it is your choice, so if you would like to know if you would enjoy this show, the best test for that would be to watch the first episode... because that is basically the entire show.",

            "content": "The description of this anime had me a little skeptical whether I'd be able to enjoy it, but the above average score and the numerous comments about how cute it was convinced me to give it a try. Two episodes in, I was finding it very discomforting, even cringy, leaving me doubting whether to continue watching. Where is this story headed? There was still plenty of room at that point for the main characters and their relationship to develop in a way that would make it a worthwhile journey. But my efforts to get a feel for what lie ahead suggested that it was largelymore of the same. Still, for whatever reason, I watched some more. Episode 3 was actually somewhat enjoyable. The fourth was a return to the unpleasantness of the first two. And then came episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the problem? Without mincing any words, I cannot help but see Takagi as a horrible person for the way she bullies Nishikata. No matter how cute she is, treating another person like that isn't cute or funny, it's just mean. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango, and quite frankly Nishikata is an idiot in how he handles her treatment. Too often he tries overthinking things when he could just end it by saying 'I don't care', 'No thanks', or by ignoring her and walking away if possible. But every time he falls into her trap, even when he knows it's a trap and could easily avoid it. \\n\\n\r\nIs it teasing or bullying? My take on it is that teasing means keeping it within the bounds of the parties' sense of humor, limiting it to stuff they'd be able to laugh about after the fact. I don't see Takagi exercising any such restraint. She has little sense of when enough's enough. Furthermore, her actions have tangible consequences for Nishikata, such as getting extra cleaning duty as punishment, or failing a math test, and when things like that are the result, it's over the line from teasing into bullying. Some have compared their antics to Road Runner and Coyote, but that comparison fails when you consider that Coyote is usually the perpetrator, the one who starts it, and that's generally not the case for Nishikata. As a general rule, bullying scenes are uncomfortable for me to watch, even when the bully is the antagonist and the victim is the protagonist. That they're trying to unapologetically make it out to be cute and funny just makes it worse.\\n\\n\r\nIn other respects, the show gets better marks. The OP and ED animations are impressive and well done, and I enjoyed the setting and give the background artists high marks. The scenes that feature the three girls, Mina, Sanae, and Yukari, were enjoyable in a CGDCT kind of way. In a lot other anime I might complain that they're filler that only takes time away from the main story, but in this case they're welcome relief from it. Character design is average. Takagi is actually very cute, but then so are the characters in Happy Tree Friends. On the balance, I'll give the show a 3/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nFull disclosure: I couldn't finish the series. I tend to be a 'completist' and with over 250 anime completed at this writing I had never dropped one before. The closest I've come before was a few that had me pondering whether watching something else would be a better use of my time. But with this one, after the math test scene in episode 5 it was too painful to go on. The streak is broken as \"Teasing Master Takagi-san\" becomes my first ever drop, as well as only the second to score below a 4. Now I hear there's going to be a second season, which makes me think about how many other shows I would like to see get another season that probably never will. One thing that might make me decide to resume watching is if Takagi does a turnabout ala Shouya Ishida in season 2, but I'm not holding my breath.",

            "content": "Romance is usually a concept that is difficult for children to wrap their minds around. Sure, you might like someone, but how do you even approach that person? Even if you do manage to approach him or her, how do you make sure that you don\u2019t make an utter fool of yourself? Most kids end up arriving at one answer \u2013 show your interest by teasing the target of your affection. Sure, the target may not take it all that well, but at least you get to interact with them because of it, right? Karakai Juzou no Takagi-san (henceforth abbreviated as \u2018Takagi-san\u2019) is an animeabout one such girl, Takagi, who shows her interest in a boy, Nishikata, by teasing him.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san follows an episodic format, with each episode containing 2-3 short stories about Takagi and Nishikata, and usually one story about three girls who are in the same class. As far as story is concerned, there isn\u2019t much to speak of. Nishikata tries to come up with a plan to win against Takagi, only to be completely foiled by her, after which she proceeds to tease him. Pretty much every episode follows that format, with various little changes here and there. While it does seem to be the sort of thing that would get repetitive and dull over time, it has a certain charm to it that keeps things interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as Art is concerned, it makes use of rather minimalistic artwork. The coloring and details are nothing spectacular, but it doesn\u2019t look all that bad either. Still, due to this, it looks rather clean overall. The Sound is relatively forgettable, although I found the opening to be rather catchy (or annoying \u2013 take your pick).\\n\\n\r\nThe show mainly revolves around the interactions between Takagi and Nishikata, and they are generally rather cute. Takagi always makes sure never to go too far, and it always stops at the level of minor teasing, rather than bullying. She simply teases him because she likes him, not because of any real animosity. The other characters that show up are usually nothing all that important, except maybe the three girls (Sanae, Mina, and Yukari), who get some screen time in every episode. These segments are usually just youthful ramblings of young girls, but it can often be rather funny as well.\\n\\n\r\nAll put together, Takagi-san is a cute anime which works really well as a palate cleanser, to watch in between more serious anime. It may feel rather repetitive if watched all at once, so I advise against binge watching the whole thing. A simple way to describe Takagi-san would be a gender-bent version of Tonari no Seki-kun, with a little more of a (childish/innocent) romance focus. I\u2019d recommend this one to just about anyone, since it\u2019s a rather difficult show to hate. With this, I conclude.",

            "content": "She teases him; he blushes and resolves not to let her tease him again.\r\nRinse and repeat every single episode. The anime is divided into a series of shorts each a few minutes long; there are normally about 4 or 5 per episode. Each is a small self-contained story about Takagi\u2019s and Nishikata\u2019s daily lives in and out of the classroom. This isn\u2019t a plot-heavy series and it\u2019s not meant to be. What it is meant to be, however, is a character-oriented series, and so that shall be my main focus.\r\nJust to get the art and music out of the way: the art style isreally cute. Huge heads, massive eyes (even by anime standards), high foreheads and relatively simple drawings altogether. It suits the characters and show style nicely without being too extravagant. The animation is done well, even if not much is being animated besides the characters. The music is good, nothing spectacular but again, just nice. No complaints on these areas.\\n\\n\r\nSo now to the characters. There are the two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi, who take up the majority of the shorts, and then there are a few supporting characters (a trio of girls in the same class) who feature every now and again. Nishikata and Takagi engage in a variety of activities, from making bets with each other to tandem riding to doing homework or going shopping. All basic daily activities, and nothing really happens in any of them event-wise, but they provide a lot of opportunities for exchanges between the two. \\n\\n\r\nNishikata seems to take these exchanges as mental matches between the two of them - constant sparring to see who comes out on top verbally. He reads deeply into every single thing Takagi says, wondering if she\u2019s trying to tease him and then trying to play bluff and double bluff. Whilst it\u2019s true that Takagi does slyly tease him a fair amount of the time, watching him thoroughly analyse every single little sentence of hers becomes irritating after a while.  It\u2019s obvious to the viewer (although not to Nishikata) that her teasing is well-intentioned and that she actually likes him, perhaps even has feelings for him. (The latter\u2019s shown more subtly until the last couple of episodes.) Nishikata does seem to like her (hence the blushing) but the feelings seem to be pretty pure and innocent. In any case, her teasing is always incredibly mild. If she wins a bet and gets the opportunity to order Nishikata to do anything she wants, she\u2019ll just choose something like going shopping together or another harmless activity.\\n\\n\r\nNishikata, however, sees every single tease as a personal failure, and a blow to his pride. He never seems to be able to best her in anything, and to be fair to him this is probably incredibly frustrating. But it never ends! He never actually tries to talk to her properly about anything! He never tells her unequivocally to stop teasing him, because it would be a \u2018loss\u2019 to let her know that she\u2019s gotten to him. He just makes every exchange, no matter how harmless, into a mental sparring match and thus causes his own inferiority complex to worsen, because she always \u2018beats\u2019 him. (Even when there\u2019s nothing to \u2018beat\u2019 him on \u2013 sometimes she just asks him a simple question that is literally only an attempt to make small talk.) \\n\\n\r\nThere is almost no character development whatsoever. If you look at the beginning episodes, and compare them to the later ones, you\u2019ll notice barely any change. She still talks to him and teases him in the same way she\u2019s always done, and he still tries and fails to best her the same way he always has. This was the main flaw of the anime, as a character-driven series. The characters just become boring after a while, you can predict almost exactly what will happen and how it will happen. Even Takagi\u2019s initially adorable laugh becomes grating after hearing it every few minutes, episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does try to add a few more characters into the mix, but they suffer from the same problem of one-dimensionalitis. Their exchanges are also cute, sometimes funny and sometimes boring, but I think the only reason I liked these three girls was that they were a break from the endless cute monotony that was Takagi and Nishikata\u2019s exchanges. They were nothing special in and of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t say that I dislike Skilled Teaser Takagi-san. Whilst I didn\u2019t exactly look forward to it every week, it has a lot of sweet moments, and it does have a few funny parts. I just can\u2019t binge watch it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to try it, I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching more than one or two episodes at a time, with a large break in between sessions. That should keep it from getting too tedious, and instead just be a cute and mildly comedic series. XD\\n\\n",

The moments of Nishikata wanting to win over Takagi in numerous ways sets up the ONLY plot for the show, and my heart fluttered as I remembered the manga original and finally getting to see it in action. Every single detail, though simple and plain yet appropriately beautiful was handled exquisitely well and props for retaining the original designs of the manga art.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with a plain, boring but yet endearing series, what do you get with it? A boy who's always frustrated at the girl whom has an edge over him, with the girl finding that the na\u00efve, innocent-looking boy is her fun factor. Every \"plot\" that Nishikata comes up with is a total failure and wreck at the same time, but that doesn't always pose a problem for Takagi, who has always been able to outwit and outlast Nishikata, at times charming him with simple things like tickling to the more heart-to-heart embarrassing moments like getting together under an umbrella when raining, closing on faces that look like a kiss and blushing like mad when she doesn't mean it, oh how we wished our younger sweetheart days were like that. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply beautiful and gorgeous, that reminds me of the typical Sunrise and Tatsunoko Productions' type of old anime backgrounds made modern-age and it truly is a sight that looks simple but yet it delivers. Musically wise, what better way than to express the romantic love than to come up with songs of young, romantic expressions? The OST here is simple too but great in its own regard; the OP and numerous EDs (sung by Rie Takahashi) are light-hearted, giving the whole series an appeal that will never run dry.\\n\\n\r\nFor people that absolutely love rom-coms in its entire simplicity, I recommend you to check out this show. While the repetitive teasing thing is a BIG drawback and flaw of the series, it is the EXACT same factor that gave the series its substance that stands out among other school-type rom-coms.\\n\\n\r\nThe unrequited love of middle-school teasing, signing out.",

That getting out of the way how does the show hold up so far\r\nThe story is very loose but it works. It is just a bunch of pranks and childish fun at and after school between two kids who kinda have a thing for each other, and their friends. Its very episodic but it leads to amazing moments and some character development in an episodic show. Its romance. The kids have a thing for each other. Also there are lots ofjokes about growing up and teenage life which are relatable. Maybe some owo jokes here and there but this is not an ecchi. G O O D. I dont want to see middle school tits in my anime. I don't want the keisatsu coming in so im glad it takes a conservative approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good. I haven't noticed a single point in where the animation was noticably sub par like in other shows i have watched. The characters are very simple and stylized which works well. The detail in some parts of the background scenery is amazing too. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets across that childlike innocence with whistles and exaggeration in certain points. The acting is solid and OMG THATS FRICKEN KOICHI FROM JOJO'S VOICE ACTOR!!! The acting overall is believable and adorable. Then again the voice actors seem to have played adorable characters before.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are adorable as hell. Nishikata/Koichi voice (the protagonist) is a kid who wants to prank Takagi like she does to him but fails miserably. He doesn't realize it at first but he starts to kind of develop romantic feelings for Takagi. Takagi (the title character and the secondary protagonist) is a girl who likes to toy with Nishikata by teasing and pranking him a lot.But this is because she kinda loves him. She also kinda makes a few dirty jokes on Nishikata without it turning into softcore porn like (generic animu number 9266664632882). Mina is a girl who acts like a younger child as she always wants to be cheerful. She also is very immature and sometimes borderline dumb, but it makes her lovable. Sanae is her best friend and she is a bit more serious but still jokes around a small bit. And the English teacher is a bit of a DOUCHEBAG AS HE THROWS CHALK AT LOUD KIDS I MEAN WTF THATS RUDE. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It is one of my favorite shows to debut this season and if my little brother who isn't into anime likes it it must be good. This is my number 3 anime this season and i solidly reccomend this show. 9/10 Mastahpiece\\n",

            "content": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san (or Skilled Teaser Takagi-san) is a title that pretty much sums up what you'll see in this anime: Lots of teasing.\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is an episodic slice of life/comedy anime with a bit of romance. It shows the everyday interactions between Takagi and the target of her teasing, Nishikata. Even though Nishikata is usually the loser of this seemingly one-sided teasing game, he still tries his best to come up with schemes to win against Takagi and make her embarrassed.\r\nEven though that's pretty much the whole premise, there's a variety of ways and situations in which Takagi outsmarts Nishikata andmakes him blush from embarrassment. This helps the anime remain funny and entertaining and there's something to look forward to even in a simple story like this. So, the premise was executed well. \\n\r\nFor those who expect something more from the series though, the anime's pattern and jokes might get repetitive soon.\\n\r\nApart from the main two characters' interactions, which cover almost the entire anime, there are short segments about 3 other characters in each episode. These characters are 3 girls, Mina, Yukari and Sanae, who are classmates of the two main characters. Their interactions are, also, quite fun to watch and feel refreshing, since watching the same two characters all the time can be kind of tiresome.\\n\r\nWhile this anime is meant to be lighthearted and relaxing, the pace can be a bit too slow sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't many characters in the series, but they are all likeable. Their personalities fit those of innocent middle-schoolers.\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the smug girl and the main charm of the series, Takagi. She is a girl who loves teasing her classmate, but she does it in such an adorable way that she's hard to hate. Also, it's pretty obvious that the reason why she teases him in the first place is because she likes him, which makes her teasing even cuter.\\n\r\nNishikata is a nice, but naive boy who gets easily embarrassed. His face is too easy to read, which is part of the reason why his plans to tease Takagi always backfire. He is so focused on his plans to defeat Takagi, that he fails to notice that he actually likes her. His reactions and thoughts, although a bit repetitive, are pretty fun to watch and listen to.\\n\r\nThe chemistry between these two characters is very nice and it's fun to watch their interactions.\\n\r\nMina, Yukari and Sanae are also quite interesting, although they don't get much screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals may not be spectacular, but they are good enough for an anime like this.\\n\r\nThe artstyle, although it seems a bit simple at first, is quite cute, especially the character designs. The characters' expressions are also drawn greatly and are fun to watch. The backgrounds are pretty good and the colors that are used create a nice atmosphere that fits the anime's lightheartedness.\\n\r\nThe animation is good and fluid most of the time. But sometimes, the characters look weird when they are laughing or talking and the quality of both the art and animation of the characters drops when they are shown from a longer distance.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound, the show's music consists of tracks that are nice enough and fit the anime's lightheartedness. The OP is quite catchy and it's interesting to see so many different EDs sung by Takagi's VA. The background music is used well, too.\\n\r\nThe voice actors are doing a very good job, though. Both Takahashi Rie and Kaji Yuki are popular VAs, and they pulled their roles off nicely. Takagi's cute voice fits her and her playful way of talking is done perfectly. Nishikata's inner thoughts being voiced by Kaji Yuki are great to listen to and the weird sounds he makes sometimes are really funny. Both of them sound like actual middle-schoolers.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some of its flaws, like the anime's pattern getting repetitive after a while, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san can be a very enjoyable anime with many funny moments and likeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is an anime that I'd recommend you to watch if you want something cute, lighthearted and relaxing. It's an episodic anime, so you can watch a bit of it every time you feel like watching something to have a few laughs. It doesn't do much more than showing a girl teasing a boy, but it's an anime that serves its purpose just fine and it can be entertaining. Even if it gets a little repetitive and you might find better series similar to this one, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san has its own special charm that makes it unique.",

            "content": "TL;DR \u2013 A fun, comedy-driven show that gives me diabetes every episode. It knows exactly what it wants to do, how to go about doing it and then does it really well.\r\nBasic breakdown below \u2b0e\r\n== Impressions / Presentation: 7.5/10 ==\r\nThe basic formula involves Nishikata (the boy) trying to tease Takag (the girl), but fails and gets teased instead. Before you know it, you too are thinking: \"What is Takagi scheming this time!?\". It's not only a game for Nishikata, it's also a game for us, and this is how the show keeps the formula fresh and exciting.\r\nWhile there's nothing exceptional about the art and animation,the anime has been drawn with plenty of love and care. And it shows in the many character interactions in the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Story: 7/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nEvery interaction Nishikata and Takagi share feels like they're getting closer to each other, and it's very endearing to watch. With lots of moments that continually flesh out their relationship, it's hard to say that the show doesn't have a story, or there is no character development/progression.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, their relationship probably feels more real and believable than the ones in traditional romcoms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Characters: 7.5/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nNishikata and Takagi have great chemistry with each other. Yes, they react to each other in entertaining ways, but simply watching them hang out is a wholesome and fulfilling experience in of itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe background characters don't get a lot of screentime, but the show has done a good job incorporating them in various scenes so it feels like these kids are inhabiting a fun and lively world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment: 7.5/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nBecause Nishikata and Takagi hog most of the show's spotlight, your enjoyment will be heavily dependent on whether you like them or not. The easiest way to find out is to just watch an episode and find out for yourself, as the reasons I like them could easily be the reasons you hate them.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise yeah, I clearly got a lot out of a show just about two kids teasing each other.",

            "content": "As far as this anime goes so far, I have enjoyed it quite thoroughly these past few weeks. Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a Slice of Life anime in which two middle schoolers have a relationship where the girl teases the boy (contrary to other similar popular anime).\r\n          The story has no real plot to it, and is fairly repetitive; but I don't think it should pose any problem because of the way in which this anime is laid out. The art and soundtracks are well done, and I even went to such lengths to tryand cover the opening on my piano.\\n\r\n        The two characters Nishikata and Takagi have a decent amount of synergy with each other as the episodes go by, but I do find Nishikata's tsundere-like attitude a bit repetitive. I gave this area a 7 only because the roles are reversed and strays from the normal anime stream. Otherwise, it might've been lower.\\n\r\n        As far as I got in the series (10 episodes so far), I have really enjoyed this purely for smiles and teasing comedy. I tend to watch more slice of life anime compared to action anime, so if you tend to have the same tastes I believe this anime would be something to watch for sure.\\n\r\n       Overall, I gave this an 8/10; if you like comedy, slice of life, maybe even a little bit of romance, I definitely encourage you to watch this anime! I smiled and cringed (in a good way!) the whole way through, and is definitely worth the wait every week.",

            "content": "First off thanks for upvoting this review guys! This is my first review and it feels good to get a solid response from it. I'm editing and adding more of my thoughts for this reason.\r\nI don't like using the Story, art, sound, etc, way of reviewing. This is due to may great anime having no story and shit art but still being endlessly better than anime with complex stories etc.\r\nThe big reason to watch this show is the Super witty dialogue/humor and the somewhat lovable innocent characters. Now time to turn off your brain and laugh at the main character Takagi-Sans wit as she mentallytears apart Nishikata much alike how DoomGuy might rip a demon apart. The anguish shown on Nishikatas face is quite satisfying after he has been proven to be an idiot twenty times per episode...if you're a sadist.\\n\r\nLook... I'm gonna level with y'all. We all had that kid in school who could always one up you or prove you wrong, and personally this anime brought up some embarrassing memories of me being an idiot. Much alike how many people cringe while watching Watamote or Chunibyo and other delusions.\\n\r\nYou will quickly learn that Nishikita isn't treated like a human being by the shows creators. He's a tool...a tool to be used by Takagi-San to make the show entertaining. He isnt treated fairly or morally by anyone in the show and it makes me sad, what a sad character. He's so innocent but everyone screws him over, and all for the sole reason of he's the punching bag so lets lay into that bastard.\\n\r\nReally though if you want an anime like this but without the emotional battery try watching Seki-Kun master of wasting time. Its very similar except every episode is 10 minutes. Which is more viewer friendly for this type of show anyways.\\n\r\noverall 5/10\\n\r\nTHIS ANIME IS NOT OVER. There is still time for it to become more than a girl pushing around a dopey guy, I don't stop halfway through anime and eagerly await what will happen next in this mediocre yet fun anime.",

            "content": "In the moment you encounter that special someone, everything else is rendered obsolete. In this encounter, the world around you, the people in your life, and the things they demand of you all lose meaning. Your attention belongs to that special someone and no other. Time itself ceases to move as your encounter unfolds; when that special someone carries on a conversation with you, it feels as if it\u2019ll last forever. Your heart races, pulsating as if it\u2019ll spring forth from your chest at any given time. Your nerves quiver, the butterflies fluttering freely inside your body. Your vision blurs and your face crimsons, theblood coursing through your head at an alarming rate. Clouded by a whirlwind of strange thoughts, emotions, and instincts, you react to this encounter in a completely different fashion than you would in any other situation. The ideas you contemplate, the things you say, and the actions you create are a jumbled mess, shaken and stirred by the heat of the moment. Just as the conversation is gathering steam, that special someone departs from you and the encounter concludes. Time has moved forward again. While you\u2019re mostly relieved to distance yourself from the situation, there\u2019s a part of you that pleads to return to that brief encounter, that yearns to conversate with that special someone, that fantasizes of losing yourself in the moment once more. \\n\\n\r\nFor those that have become infatuated with a crush, for those that are adjusting to their feelings of attraction for another, for those that are stumbling their way into their first relationship, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is a reflection of their lives, their own romantic endeavors manifesting themselves on a grand scale. As this show ignites and refines the chemistry between its two protagonists, Nishitaka and Takagi, it reveals its understanding of relationships and the intricacies they possess. Subdued in its tone and serene in its outlook, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san\u2019s handling of its central couple is accomplished with nigh-unparalleled ease, using their series of frivolous yet elaborate pranks to slowly and steadily transition into something more, and its examination of their relationship is delivered with a rather unconventional approach.\\n\\n\r\nWhen two contrasting personalities attempt to align, there is an army of problems that arise along the way due to the differences between them. Although said differences can generate a rift in relationships, they can also strengthen them; contrasting personalities naturally heighten common interests. While most works of the romance genre opt for discovering these common interests, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san almost entirely ignores this pursuit. Instead, what it values is how these characters think and why they\u2019re attracted to one another. In particular, it values these concepts as they relate to Nishitaka.\\n\\n\r\nIt is his point-of-view that Skilled Teaser Takagi-san operates from. It is his series of pranks, his attempts to outwit and \u201ctease\u201d Takagi, that this show mainly revolves around. Nishitaka is always thinking of ways to perplex Takagi, either by concocting a complex scheme to use on her or (more often than not) by solving the problems she gives him. Every challenge Nishitaka tackles, every puzzle he confronts, makes for a satisfying watch. No two obstacles are alike; each distinct in their own way, they\u2019re deceptively simple at first glance but dangerously intricate the more you analyze them. And, boy, does Nishitaka analyze these obstacles. The music crescendos to a fever pitch, with saxophones screaming their way through, and the animation dizzily spirals out of control, its color scheme constantly changing, as he ceaselessly conjures countermoves and hypothetical solutions in his head. To Nishitaka, these pranks are far from trivial pastime activities. To him, they are battles of the intellectual variety, epic in scale, each choice determining one\u2019s fate.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that Nishitaka cares deeply about outsmarting Takagi, which makes it all the more depressing to witness him falling short time after time. It matters not what plan he formulates, what measures he takes, what approach he adapts; the result never changes. Nishitaka is Sisyphus, forever doomed to try changing his fate, to watch his efforts go to waste, to repeat the same pattern. It\u2019s not his fault, though. With his remarkable tenacity, perception, confidence, and cunning, Nishitaka definitely distinguishes himself as a talented individual. Were he competing against someone else, against anyone else, one could argue that he\u2019d easily be more than a match for them. However, as long as Nishitaka remains tethered to his current circumstances, he\u2019ll always be defeated. Sure, he\u2019s quite intelligent for someone his age but, for all of his virtues, he pales in comparison to the titular character.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cProdigy\u201d is an overused word; it's a term that's often given to people who don't deserve such praise. Takagi, however, is an exception. Not only is she able to unravel the most intricate of Gordian knots but she also does so effortlessly. Not only does she repeatedly confound Nishitaka with riddles, traps, and decoys galore but she also manipulates each and every one to obscure her true motives. However, it\u2019s not just Nishitaka that Takagi dupes. On multiple occasions, she easily deciphers the tricks her classmates pull on her, alongside subjecting them to a few of her own, and (in one memorable instance) she\u2019s even able to deceive her teacher, manipulating him into disciplining someone else for her transgression. \\n\\n\r\nWith each competition, with each episode, with each challenge, it\u2019s almost pre-determined who's going to persevere in the end. On the one hand, this pattern of predictability causes Takagi to come across as a Mary Sue, one who's almost entirely defined by her ceaseless victories. On the other hand, you simply cannot resist watching her mercilessly outfox her peers time after time. Takagi is akin to a world-renowned chessmaster practicing against novices of the game, a decorated military tactician competing against cadets in the field, a veteran criminal investigator matching wits with rookies on the job; the inevitable outcome of each encounter never detracts from the entertainment value that they provide. While it is pleasing to witness Takagi flaunting her intellect, it\u2019s in conveying this show\u2019s themes where she really proves her worth.\\n\\n\r\nSkilled Teaser Takagi-san is, perhaps more than anything else, a master of subverting expectations.  With each issue that arises, the solution to them is never what you\u2019d anticipate. Takagi and the show itself deceive you into assuming, alongside Nishitaka, that the motives, nuances, and hints in each situation are leading to one solution when the true answer is entirely different. Again and again, this show emphasizes that Takagi\u2019s victories are due to Nishitaka overthinking each situation, attempting to uncover the deeper meaning behind it, instead of choosing the most obvious answer. Through its titular character, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san argues that the problems we encounter in life aren't as challenging or complex as we think they are. Through Takagi, this show argues that if we can push aside the details surrounding these problems (alongside our preconceived notions of them) and simply examine them for what they are, it'd be easy to find a solution for our issues.\\n\\n\r\nFor Takagi, each challenge presents an opportunity for Nishitaka to acquire more knowledge, and she strives to accomplish that goal. Yes, part of why Takagi teases him is for her own amusement; she enjoys watching her opponent panic, struggle and ultimately collapse under the pressure she places upon him. However, the other part is because Takagi wants to see Nishitaka mature and grow. The puzzles that she tasks him with are crafted out of love; Takagi gives Nishitaka a hard time mainly because she cares about him, and this detail really strengthens their relationship.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Skilled Teaser Takagi-san directs its focus away from the smoke and mirrors, it's actually a genuinely sweet and charming show to watch, and the central couple\u2019s relationship emphasizes its virtues. On the surface, Nishitaka and Takagi couldn't be more different if they tried. While Nishitaka approaches every situation with tact and caution, Takagi is far more direct. While Nishitaka leans towards the naive, Takagi is incredibly perceptive. While Nishitaka is something of a workaholic, Takagi is more relaxed. However, with a closer observation, one can see that, despite the surface-level differences, they are essentially alike. Both Nishitaka and Takagi are confident and intelligent individuals that adopt an extremely timid approach to their relationship (Nishitaka more than Takagi). Watching them develop more and more into expressing their feelings for one another, while supporting each other along the way, is easily the highlight of the show. In fact, the central couple's bond is so heartwarming, nuanced, and inspiring that it allows one to overlook the more unappealing aspects, the various deficiencies and mishaps, of this show that materialize just outside the insulated sphere of the central couple.\\n\\n\r\n100% Unrequited Love is an in-universe anime that not only inspires a few of Nishitaka\u2019s schemes but it also serves to poke fun at other works of the romance genre. By overloading Unrequited Love with genre-specific stereotypes, cliches and tropes, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san claims that it's different from the other shows of its chosen field, more intelligent and self-aware than the rest. However, when it involves its supporting cast, Takagi-san resorts to the same tiresome and tedious cliches as its peers. Whenever this show transitions away from its central couple and towards the people around them, it almost always suffers because of it. While the supporting cast strengthens Takagi-san\u2019s youthful charm, they also represent this show at its weakest. With each appearance the supporting cast makes, it becomes more and more apparent that, outside of its central couple, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san isn't all that adept at developing its characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between Mano and Nakai, classmates of Nishitaka and Takagi, is among the most dull and lifeless that I\u2019ve seen in recent memory. Mano is the \u201cshy one\u201d, blushing, squirming, and stammering about to no end, while Nakai is but a cardboard cutout, hardly worth mentioning, really, and they lack even a faint resemblance of chemistry. Then, there's Mina and Sanae, classmates of the central couple that serve as comic relief. The adventures that this pair embark on are rife with memorable gags - my personal favorite is a recurring act where they dub over random conversations, like an exchange between cats or a chat between the central couple - but they tend to wear themselves out after a while. Mina and Sanae\u2019s adventures are meant to represent the protagonists\u2019 shenanigans from a different, more carefree, perspective but they (more or less) come across as re-iterations of previous events than anything creative or unique. It doesn't help matters much that this show stylistically pigeonholes these two. One is the \u201cgenki girl\u201d, manically working herself into a frenzy over trivial matters, while the other is the \u201cquiet one\u201d, silently observing the mess that unfolds around her, and Takagi-san never allows either of them an opportunity to establish themselves beyond these classifications. \\n\\n\r\nWhen Takagi-san strays from its intended course (mishandling a supporting character here, re-treading an old plot line there), it's the central couple's chemistry that helps re-adjust its focus. Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is, in part, an elaborate game of chess, a neverending battle of wits, with brilliant strategists on either side. It is also a refreshingly pure and simple tale of romance, a love story mostly unchained by the conventions of its peers. And all of it is deftly secured by the incredible bond between its protagonists. Fascinated with their intellect and awestruck by their passion, you cannot resist wishing to accompany the central couple in whatever direction their relationship guides them toward. Time itself ceases to move as you rush headlong into Takagi-san, allowing its loving, all-encompassing embrace to overtake you.",

            "content": "Life is like a game, if you play right, you\u2019ll win. Well, that\u2019s sounds like bullshit but life can feel like a game sometimes. You\u2019re like a player in a world with others and to be successful, you need to play right. Now, what the hell does that have to do with a show like \u201cKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san\u201d?\r\nTo put it simply, this show feels like watching two players compete but not in the way you\u2019d think. To me, Takagi and Nishikata are two characters that play with each other in life. However, it\u2019s a little bit different than competition. Between the two, Takagi isalways the one that stays ahead of the game. Think of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. In that show, the coyote attempts to catch the road runner but always comes up short. For this show, Takagi is always successful in defeating Nishikata at pretty much anything. As predictable and tedious as that sounds, the show is actually more than that.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve read the manga and even as a 1-cour adaptation, the show manages to deliver what\u2019s needed to achieve success. The majority of the story focuses on the duo of Takagi and Nishikata as the two main characters. Every episode takes on multiple segments that features the two in various shenanigans. Even though the show is fictional, many of these shenanigans can occur in real life. These range from being tricked into strolling down a shadowy tunnel, competing in sports, test of courage, school academics, and among many others. The main attraction of the show is to sell the character chemistry between Takagi and Nishikata. This pair\u2019s relationship will undeniably be the take or break for most viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOn the individual level, Takagi is a clever girl with a cute face and crafty mind. While she isn\u2019t a prodigy or gifted with extraordinary talent, she often thinks outside the box to outsmart her opponent, Nishikata. Takagi\u2019s character and personality also makes her quite likable as she carries a youthful charm. Even as she teases Nishikata, it\u2019s more than just teasing. She wants to know him more and through their interactions each time, they unintentionally grow closer. There\u2019s also no malice between the two despite the low key drama. From my perspective, Takagi considers Nishikata as more than just a friend. Some people may call that nonsense since she often plays Nishikata like a toy. However, if you really pay attention to their character interactions, it\u2019s easy to realize how close they are. Does this venture into the territory of romance? That\u2019s actually left for viewers\u2019 imaginations. There\u2019s the genre tag of romance for this series but it\u2019s far from a love story.\\n\\n\r\nNishikata is pretty much the boy that gets defeated by the master of tease, the one and only Takagi. The show often tries to make audience anticipate with a thrilling feel on whether he can ever beat her or not. For me, this made me come back to this show every week. From simple games involving erasers to more complex mind games with playing with emotions, it\u2019s the type of show that categorizes game as more than just winning. Nishikata himself is an average kid with an average personality and living an average life. We don\u2019t find out much about his past and honestly, I don\u2019t think we need to. This show focuses on the present and what\u2019s ahead rather than characterization. In essence, the show\u2019s character dynamics lies in how characters connect rather than how they develop. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, there are also three others that show up in the show although they are unrelated to the series as a whole. Well, technically they are in a way but they don\u2019t get involved with the teasing and games. That\u2019s probably one of my complaints about this show. They should keep the characters from Ashita wa Doyoubi away in this anime as it feels like a distraction. Thankfully, their screen time isn\u2019t long and mostly added to make the show flow a bit as a slice of life. That being said, I think the show succeeds not just in the character chemistry but also in pure comedy. The way characters react comes out naturally in many ways. This is especially true for Takagi as she often gets the joy of teasing Nishikata shown through her reactions. While Nishikata feels annoyed by this, he never truly hates her. In fact, you could say that he gets a joke out of losing countless times in their daily life games. \\n\\n\r\nA simple show like this only needs simple visuals and TMS Entertainment accomplishes that. Takagi is undeniably adorable with her charming smile, bright personality, and facial expressions. She\u2019s able to carry this show thanks to these characteristics that are adapted straight from the manga. Similarly, Nishikata has a goofy looking face that often makes him look like a fool, as viewers will expect in many episodes. It makes this pair incredibly cute to watch thanks to how they act. The art style enhances that experience. Their voice mannerisms also stays pretty consistent throughout the show. Even someone like Yuki Kaji can play a character like Nishikata as he\u2019s been in the roles of goofball characters before. The incredible voice acting of Takagi makes her character even more believable as a master of teasing.\\n\\n\r\nI decided to give this show an 8 after reflecting on what I watched. At first, it seems like a high score for such a dry story. However, it\u2019s the pure comedy and character chemistry of the main character pair that won me over. Every episode made me laugh and it never betrayed expectations. There are times when I wish this show\u2019s segments would last longer than it should. Time flies fast when you\u2019re having fun after all.",

            "content": "With Winter 2018 comes a plethora of Slice of Life series. One of them being a war. A war between 2 middle schoolers. Enjoying their youth to the fullest comes the ecstatic interactions between our two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi. In short, the females always win.\r\nThat\u2019s basically the whole premise, a girl teasing a boy to no end and his failed attempts at retaliation only fans the flame even more. However, there\u2019s always variety in the way she does her schemes. It\u2019s fun to watch each time and highly enjoyable. As a manga reader, I am glad they were able to present all theemotions correctly and keep the tone as it should be originally. I appreciate the staff at Shin-Ei Animation for making this anime as fun as possible.\\n\\n\r\nI also enjoy the extra cast with their small screen time. The random but appropriate situations the girls make are just as adorable and fun to watch even when it\u2019s for a short time. Works as a lovely transition to the Main Cast once more.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re having a hard time on a Monday and just can\u2019t seem to get in any sort of mood, watch this anime and it\u2019s sure to bring your spirits up.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is more nicer than I expected, especially the eye design. The manga had a super simple drawing for the eye unlike the anime where they added a bit more. I like it since it adds a bit more spice to the characters. I love the background art and the colours used in it. The animation is also great. The facial expressions are super fun to see and the character movements, although small, adds a more human feel to the characters. It\u2019s small details like those that I appreciate in a series.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack isn\u2019t too special, but it does its job properly, making the anime sound even funnier was accomplished by the soundtrack and I enjoyed listening to it. Both the OP and ED are indeed super catchy and I never skipped it for its cheerful visuals. I loved how we got both Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi to play our mains. That makes it even better for the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe crazy antics between the two characters are what makes the interaction so...middle-schooler like. Seems just right when it comes to 2 kids having fun teasing eachother. Although, it\u2019s quite one-sided. Even so, the character chemistry is great and you mostly never get bored watching the dynamics between them.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is an anime that you wanna watch for fun. Nothing too endearing, but there to help with boredom and to put a smile on your face if it does at all. I loved reading the manga and the anime is just as good as it\u2019s presented. I am satisfied with this adaptation so far.\\n",

            "content": "Do you want to know what school days love is 10 years back?\r\nThis is a story of 2 backbench kids or to be precise, a daily or slice of life of a boy named Nishikata who gets teased by his benchmate Takagi by playing mind games on him.\r\nAlmost every situation is kind of different, i.e unlike in some anime like 'Tonari no Seki-kun'  where the situation is always in class but here in this anime we see diffferent scenarios from walking from home to school, doing homework, studying in library, summer holidays etc.\r\nThe main beauty of this anime is the presence of innocent loveor crush between the kids, the tension in air and being careful not to hurt the other person (Nishikata with Takagi). That sort of attitude is missing these days.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEach and every episode is refreshing and gives you smile especially seeing the expression on Nishikata's face, because they are priceless like Takagi states and teases him. \\n\r\nWhile the starting episodes have lots of teasing, as the series comes near ending, they are reduced and the focus is more on romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLike I said it, It is a slice of life, so basically there isn't any story at all and not much characters either. Excluding the 2 main characters, we have 7 side characters who would'nt impact the main characters much.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art is funny, cos the head is big while the body is small, but it gives a better opportunity to understand the emotions of characters.\\n\\n\r\nComing to soundtracks, The opening and ending songs are really good and pleasing to hear, while the soundtracks in middle are just some monotonous tones to convey the situation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, If you are a fan of 5 minutes short comedy like Saiki Kusuo no \u03a8-nan or Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, which do not have much story but make you smile every 5 minutes and remind you of your childhood days crush stories, then I am sure this anime is best suited for you.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want story, or development of characters or something meaningful to learn, then this isn't the choice for you :)",

            "content": "i just think this was the most underrated anime from winter season.\r\nJust don't overthink it,  this show in a nutshell is girl tease boy, he plans something to get tease her, backfires and gets teased again, simple and repetitive but very funny every time\r\nStory 7 | Art 9 | Sound 7 | Character 8 | Enjoyment 10 | Overall: 9\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story is repetitive but not boring, they somehow manage to make completely different scenes without getting the usual plot elements (tease, plans something, backfires,gets teased) and get a lot of comedy moments from it, simple but not everyone can do this.\r\nAside from thestory there is a little screen time for 3 girls, whose names I don't remember, and it's really good, with just a few minutes they show us 3 likable and different characters which are in the same class as the main, experiencing their problems, they show childish relatable stories with great comedy. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe animation background it's amazing, the character design isn't my cup of tea but i got to admit that it is  really impressive, it represents the age of our characters so well, by being kind of a childish artstyle, every background when Nishkita and Takagi walk together is great, just as if it were from a movie, I was really impressed by this aspect of the show.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe ending, and op are not good at all and there is no point on reviewing. 3/10\\n\r\nThe voice character its really adhoc to its characters, this a feature i really like.\\n\r\nTakagi's voice is adorable and it suits her so well when he teases Nishikata 10/10\\n\r\nNishikata's voice represents well the age of the character, and the weird sounds when he gets frustrated can't be better 10/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nYou might say \u00a8Nishikata is a pussy\" \"Oh man he is so dense\" \"What an annoying character\" they are 12 years old, try to picture yourself at that time and basically you will describe yourself as the 3 words I used above, I think his attitude really portrays the age in which he is right now. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi is really likable, she basically carries the show herself,  appealing attitude, combined with a good representation on how girls really act at that age when they like someone and with a some mature comedy makes Takagi the star of the show 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLots of chemistry between this two characters, you can kind of feel the \"love\", every episode  Nishikita starts getting more in love with takagi without really realizing(just when we were younger), great interactions between characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy watching this series, it show us a simple life we all lived, with characters that actually feel kind of real, the teasing of girls when we were younger, the fluster moments you had without knowing why, they show us love seeing it with eyes of kids. The comedy element is present in here, I have laughed in all episodes so far, and the management of different stories but being faithful to their (plot,plans tease, backfires, tease) without making it annoying its really amazingly executed.\\n\\n\r\nThe last 4 episodes made me change my score from 8 to 9, amazing enjoyment I got from this series, amazing ending, I wish we have some of this simple but unique shows more frequently. \\n\\n\r\nThis show was a huge surprise. The ending is beyond Perfect",

            "content": "Over a year ago I reviewed a little anime called Skilled Teaser Takagi San a show that disliked it for it's mean spirited comedy, repetitive teasing matches and annoying characters. The main reason for this it's because I watched the series at the wrong time when I was jaded towards the romcom genre thanks to bad experiences from certain romcom animes that shall not be mentioned.\r\nMy jadedness eventually died out in November of that same year and I started to love romcom animes again. \r\nFast forward 4 months later where I made a list of romcom anime that I should give a second chance. SkilledTeaser Takagi San was the first anime on that list and I watched the whole series again in it's dubbed form on Blu-ray.\\n\\n\r\nAfter re-watching Skilled Teaser Takagi San I went from disliking it to loving it to a point it became not only one of my favourite shows of 2018 but one of my favourites romcoms period.\\n\\n\r\nThe story follows a young boy Nishikata who mercilessly gets teased by his classmate Takagi. Not wanting to be an easy target\u00a0he swears vengeance on his classmate Takagi for all the times she's teased him and made him blush out of embarrassment.\\n\r\nWill he be able to make Takagi-san\u00a0blush from embarrassment even once in the end? Find out in Skilled Teaser Takagi San.\\n\\n\r\nSaying that the story of Skilled Teaster Takagi San sweet is an understatement. This is one of the sweetest and innocent shows I have seen in a long while. Where do I begin? For starters does a fantastic job at establishing the shows innocent nature by having the kids in the series behave like actual natural kids that you will encounter in real life.\\n\\n\r\nNo unrealistic, melodrama, no misunderstanding contrivances just actual kids living they youth as people. It is very grounded on that aspect as it makes the world of Skilled Teaser Takagi San unique and refreshing compared to most romcom anime.\\n\r\nThe teasing matches themselves range from engaging, smart and addicting. Some would say that the series is way too repetitive for its own and I can understand why however the teasing matches add more to this show then hinder it thanks to brilliant character interactions that never gets old.\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of theses teasing matches is that is they were not contrived and mean spirited. Nishikata may do some stupid things during the teaching matches that causes him to lose but the show reminds the viewer that he is a kid and kid's generally would do anything to reach the goal even if it's a dumb move that Takagi often comments on.\\n\r\nAnother strong aspect of Skilled Teaser Takagi San is how it's romance. Dialogue wise, especially in the beginning, may not be much however it completely makes by having character movements and body language.\\n\\n\r\n(Spoiler Alert)\\n\r\nEpisode 10 is the best example of this as it was the episode that these two would eventually become a couple. From Nishikata bushing more frequently than usual to Takagi getting more physical to Nishikata\u00a0Skilled Teaser Takagi San showcased that you don't always need long dialogue just to indicate love.\\n\r\n(End of spoilers)\\n\\n\r\nIf, there one thing that Skilled Teaser Takagi San does masterfully well that most other romcom anime lack these days is character chemistry.\\n\r\nDespite them having these teasing matches on a daily bases they actually do support one another very well.\\n\r\nAdd up to this show's rich comedy that would make anyone and you got yourself a charming romcom story on your hands.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had any nitpicks at with this innocent cute love story it would slow pacing at times then again this is a show that features primarily a child character cast and children tend to learn things slower compare to adults.\\n\r\nHowever, this nitpick is nothing compared to the fact that the show at times still functions like a short despite having 24 minutes of run time. It wasn't noticeable in the first and last couple of episodes but when that slights issue happened it really showed as some episodes did not translate well to the 24 minutes format. This is especially distracting when the show decided to focus on the funny but less interesting trio of girls.\\n\r\nLucky these small nitpicks that I had didn't damage the overall story for Skilled Teaser Tagaki San as It's a simple, nicely directed and entertaining slice of life romcom.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, this is a character driven show meaning the characters for a character-driven should bring they're A game. Thankfully the chararters in Skilled Teaser Takagi San are great and charming to watch from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nNishikata is a sweet and adorable idiot. He consistently screws up his teasing antics against Takagi, and he always feels bad for screwing up. However, while he may be an idiot he makes up with determination and humanity. Despite him flailing he's very detected to beat Takagi at a teasing match however at the same time he's not a mean spirited angsty brat who wishes Takagi out of his life. This makes him a great character to watch because despite everything that happens to him still a human.\\n\\n\r\nThe real star of the show is without the question, Takagi. A first glance, she appears to your typical kindhearted and caring person who loves to tease her classmate Nishikata. \\n\r\nHowever, there's more to her than her teasing antics. She has a strong crush on him where she is constantly doing these sexual teasing acts just to penetrate Nishikata bluishness. \\n\r\nThis makes her an interesting foil for Nishikata to overcome and seeing her tease and outsmart him in the most unpredictable and savage ways was intriguing to watch. \\n\r\nDespite Takagi being my favourite character in the show, there was one slight problem I with her is that she can be a bit of a Mary Sue at times. She's not one of the theses annoying types or anything but at times she can be too perfect for her own good. Hopefully, this slight problem will get fixed in season 2. \\n\r\nDespite that small complaint, Takagi is an incredibly fun and likeable character to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters are surprisingly good. While they don't develop as characters they were enjoyable chararters especially the main girl trio who were some of the funniest supporting chararters I have seen from 2018 thanks to nicely done short stories. \\n\r\nI'm glad that the series was able to have a strong cast because it wasn't for the characters then the series would be nothing more than a tedious slog feast.\\n\\n\r\nOn to the visuals side of things, Takagi San is gorgeous. The background scenery is masterfully drawn in a realistic way and it only made better with the show smooth colour palette that brings the scenery\u00a0to life.\\n\r\nCharacter designs were simple and nicely drawn especially Takagi. Forehead memes aside her design is gorgeously cute to the eye and I really adore her expressions.\\n\r\nThe animation may not be as good as the art as the series relays on basic animation techniques for movement but it was still serviceable for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound department, it's very good and fits well the cute and innocent show. \\n\r\nThis is all thanks to the Hiroaki Tsutsumi did an outstanding job at bringing this charming romcom series to life with the light instrument pieces that play in the background.\\n\r\nBoth opening and ending themes are super cute and perfectly fitted the show.\\n\\n\r\nRomcom anime generally have a hard time when it comes to English Dubs as many of them especially back then suffered from subpar audio quality and bad acting. When I decided to watch this show dubbed I was worried that these two cute love birds (Takagi and Nishikata) would be butchered by poor acting.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully Funimation manages to produce a fantastic dub for it. \\n\r\nFunimation's rising figure Sarah Wiedenheft did an outstanding job voicing and portraying the cute Takagi. Another great performance in the dub goes to Aaron Dismuke voicing the determined Nishikata. Every other performance ranges from good to great.\\n\r\nGreat job Funimation.\\n\\n\r\nSkilled Teaser Takagi San won't be winning the best romcom anime award from me but it is still a great, fun and engaging show that I loved from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were great, funny and nicely written, the visuals for a slice of life, romcom anime were stunningly beautiful and music is sweet.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for an innocent and charming romcom anime to watch on a sunny afternoon than Skilled Teaser Takagi San would be a fantastic choice. It's an innocent and charming romcom piece that I hold in high regard.",

            "content": "Before I embark on my review of Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san, I would like to first mention that this is my first review; I am sorry if this does not meet your expectations in terms of length, word usage, or points I make. In this arguably harsh review, there will be a few spoilers that I would not quite categorize as candidates for ruining the show, but rather general, disappointing realities of it. I did not enjoy Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san if not at all because the concept became too repetitive (as many have also pointed out) and I did not enjoy it to beginwith. The character models were okay, the music fit, and the animation was quite nice. Unfortunately, the strengths end there, which leaves us with the flaws of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a hit or miss with most people: The main protagonist, 12-year-old Nishikata, is constantly being teased by a girl in his class who secretly has feelings for him, skilled teaser and forehead goddess Tagaki-san, who is entertained only by embarrassing him every day. Although this may be refreshing and different for some, I believe there is a reason that we have not seen something like this explode before. I use the words \u201cevery day\u201d and \u201cconstantly\u201d with all potential force that they carry - the entire show is episode 1 repeated over and over. If you do not like the first few episodes, you likely will not enjoy the rest of the series. Every time Nishikata plots revenge, it is immediately ruined by the fact that he will never carry it out successfully because that is what the entire show is about: this kid\u2019s hopelessness for getting back at the girl who teases him. For me, I could not help rooting for Nishikata when he devises a plan of revenge, but I always stop myself from getting too excited because I know it will never happen. This frustrates me because Tagaki always finds a magical way to work around his plan or conveniently say something that will throw Nishikata off and destroy his - in some cases - imaginatively formulated ideas for debunking this chick\u2019s ruling over him. The best example of this that I can remember is when they are comparing heights and the boy is actually taller than Takagi-san, so he thinks in his mind \u201cMan, I bet she\u2019s really bitter because she\u2019s shorter than me\u201d then the girl immediately says \u201cOh, and I\u2019m not bitter\u201d... like HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HE WAS THINKING THAT?!?! The show becomes so unrealistically biased towards Takagi-san that I cannot help hating her. This show seems to rely on their cute-faced characters when it comes to hiding the rather embarrassingly poor story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show were unenjoyable because they were either too stupid or too shallow-minded and predictable. The aforementioned fact that there seems to be little to no change throughout the show leaves us with characters that developed in no way and told the same joke over and over again. Nishikata never carries out any kind of revenge or suddenly becomes less of a pansy, and Takagi is always entertained by his clumsiness and inability to not be an idiot. I would imagine that this quintessential category of development throughout the story would be present, but it seems this one just does not provide that factor. It feels like I am watching a clip of a fat man falling on repeat; it may be funny the first few times around, but it just cannot last 12 episodes. The show also follows the story of the clich\u00e9 group of friends containing a clueless girl (Mina Hibino), nerdy but witty girl (Yukari Amakawa), and sad and quiet but smart girl (Sanae Tsukimoto). I did not care much for this side-story because although it drew attention away from the atrociously repetitive story of the two main characters, it also did not have much substance itself. Each member of this friend group shows their character (all of which were extremely stereotypical) the entire show so they never changed or showed any signs of progression. Overall, the characters in this show are either clich\u00e9, lifeless stereotypes or tell the same joke the entire series and do not change at all.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would not recommend this show because of the sick, unchanging concept. If the idea of getting a friend to blush or become embarrassed interests you, try it. The fact that Karakai Jouzu no Tagaki-san carries out this idea for 13 episodes is the reason I composed this review: to save you innocent people from wasting the 5 hours of your life you would be spending to watch this anime. Obviously, it is your choice, so if you would like to know if you would enjoy this show, the best test for that would be to watch the first episode... because that is basically the entire show.",

            "content": "The description of this anime had me a little skeptical whether I'd be able to enjoy it, but the above average score and the numerous comments about how cute it was convinced me to give it a try. Two episodes in, I was finding it very discomforting, even cringy, leaving me doubting whether to continue watching. Where is this story headed? There was still plenty of room at that point for the main characters and their relationship to develop in a way that would make it a worthwhile journey. But my efforts to get a feel for what lie ahead suggested that it was largelymore of the same. Still, for whatever reason, I watched some more. Episode 3 was actually somewhat enjoyable. The fourth was a return to the unpleasantness of the first two. And then came episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the problem? Without mincing any words, I cannot help but see Takagi as a horrible person for the way she bullies Nishikata. No matter how cute she is, treating another person like that isn't cute or funny, it's just mean. As the saying goes, it takes two to tango, and quite frankly Nishikata is an idiot in how he handles her treatment. Too often he tries overthinking things when he could just end it by saying 'I don't care', 'No thanks', or by ignoring her and walking away if possible. But every time he falls into her trap, even when he knows it's a trap and could easily avoid it. \\n\\n\r\nIs it teasing or bullying? My take on it is that teasing means keeping it within the bounds of the parties' sense of humor, limiting it to stuff they'd be able to laugh about after the fact. I don't see Takagi exercising any such restraint. She has little sense of when enough's enough. Furthermore, her actions have tangible consequences for Nishikata, such as getting extra cleaning duty as punishment, or failing a math test, and when things like that are the result, it's over the line from teasing into bullying. Some have compared their antics to Road Runner and Coyote, but that comparison fails when you consider that Coyote is usually the perpetrator, the one who starts it, and that's generally not the case for Nishikata. As a general rule, bullying scenes are uncomfortable for me to watch, even when the bully is the antagonist and the victim is the protagonist. That they're trying to unapologetically make it out to be cute and funny just makes it worse.\\n\\n\r\nIn other respects, the show gets better marks. The OP and ED animations are impressive and well done, and I enjoyed the setting and give the background artists high marks. The scenes that feature the three girls, Mina, Sanae, and Yukari, were enjoyable in a CGDCT kind of way. In a lot other anime I might complain that they're filler that only takes time away from the main story, but in this case they're welcome relief from it. Character design is average. Takagi is actually very cute, but then so are the characters in Happy Tree Friends. On the balance, I'll give the show a 3/10 rating.\\n\\n\r\nFull disclosure: I couldn't finish the series. I tend to be a 'completist' and with over 250 anime completed at this writing I had never dropped one before. The closest I've come before was a few that had me pondering whether watching something else would be a better use of my time. But with this one, after the math test scene in episode 5 it was too painful to go on. The streak is broken as \"Teasing Master Takagi-san\" becomes my first ever drop, as well as only the second to score below a 4. Now I hear there's going to be a second season, which makes me think about how many other shows I would like to see get another season that probably never will. One thing that might make me decide to resume watching is if Takagi does a turnabout ala Shouya Ishida in season 2, but I'm not holding my breath.",

            "content": "Romance is usually a concept that is difficult for children to wrap their minds around. Sure, you might like someone, but how do you even approach that person? Even if you do manage to approach him or her, how do you make sure that you don\u2019t make an utter fool of yourself? Most kids end up arriving at one answer \u2013 show your interest by teasing the target of your affection. Sure, the target may not take it all that well, but at least you get to interact with them because of it, right? Karakai Juzou no Takagi-san (henceforth abbreviated as \u2018Takagi-san\u2019) is an animeabout one such girl, Takagi, who shows her interest in a boy, Nishikata, by teasing him.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san follows an episodic format, with each episode containing 2-3 short stories about Takagi and Nishikata, and usually one story about three girls who are in the same class. As far as story is concerned, there isn\u2019t much to speak of. Nishikata tries to come up with a plan to win against Takagi, only to be completely foiled by her, after which she proceeds to tease him. Pretty much every episode follows that format, with various little changes here and there. While it does seem to be the sort of thing that would get repetitive and dull over time, it has a certain charm to it that keeps things interesting. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as Art is concerned, it makes use of rather minimalistic artwork. The coloring and details are nothing spectacular, but it doesn\u2019t look all that bad either. Still, due to this, it looks rather clean overall. The Sound is relatively forgettable, although I found the opening to be rather catchy (or annoying \u2013 take your pick).\\n\\n\r\nThe show mainly revolves around the interactions between Takagi and Nishikata, and they are generally rather cute. Takagi always makes sure never to go too far, and it always stops at the level of minor teasing, rather than bullying. She simply teases him because she likes him, not because of any real animosity. The other characters that show up are usually nothing all that important, except maybe the three girls (Sanae, Mina, and Yukari), who get some screen time in every episode. These segments are usually just youthful ramblings of young girls, but it can often be rather funny as well.\\n\\n\r\nAll put together, Takagi-san is a cute anime which works really well as a palate cleanser, to watch in between more serious anime. It may feel rather repetitive if watched all at once, so I advise against binge watching the whole thing. A simple way to describe Takagi-san would be a gender-bent version of Tonari no Seki-kun, with a little more of a (childish/innocent) romance focus. I\u2019d recommend this one to just about anyone, since it\u2019s a rather difficult show to hate. With this, I conclude.",

            "content": "She teases him; he blushes and resolves not to let her tease him again.\r\nRinse and repeat every single episode. The anime is divided into a series of shorts each a few minutes long; there are normally about 4 or 5 per episode. Each is a small self-contained story about Takagi\u2019s and Nishikata\u2019s daily lives in and out of the classroom. This isn\u2019t a plot-heavy series and it\u2019s not meant to be. What it is meant to be, however, is a character-oriented series, and so that shall be my main focus.\r\nJust to get the art and music out of the way: the art style isreally cute. Huge heads, massive eyes (even by anime standards), high foreheads and relatively simple drawings altogether. It suits the characters and show style nicely without being too extravagant. The animation is done well, even if not much is being animated besides the characters. The music is good, nothing spectacular but again, just nice. No complaints on these areas.\\n\\n\r\nSo now to the characters. There are the two main characters, Nishikata and Takagi, who take up the majority of the shorts, and then there are a few supporting characters (a trio of girls in the same class) who feature every now and again. Nishikata and Takagi engage in a variety of activities, from making bets with each other to tandem riding to doing homework or going shopping. All basic daily activities, and nothing really happens in any of them event-wise, but they provide a lot of opportunities for exchanges between the two. \\n\\n\r\nNishikata seems to take these exchanges as mental matches between the two of them - constant sparring to see who comes out on top verbally. He reads deeply into every single thing Takagi says, wondering if she\u2019s trying to tease him and then trying to play bluff and double bluff. Whilst it\u2019s true that Takagi does slyly tease him a fair amount of the time, watching him thoroughly analyse every single little sentence of hers becomes irritating after a while.  It\u2019s obvious to the viewer (although not to Nishikata) that her teasing is well-intentioned and that she actually likes him, perhaps even has feelings for him. (The latter\u2019s shown more subtly until the last couple of episodes.) Nishikata does seem to like her (hence the blushing) but the feelings seem to be pretty pure and innocent. In any case, her teasing is always incredibly mild. If she wins a bet and gets the opportunity to order Nishikata to do anything she wants, she\u2019ll just choose something like going shopping together or another harmless activity.\\n\\n\r\nNishikata, however, sees every single tease as a personal failure, and a blow to his pride. He never seems to be able to best her in anything, and to be fair to him this is probably incredibly frustrating. But it never ends! He never actually tries to talk to her properly about anything! He never tells her unequivocally to stop teasing him, because it would be a \u2018loss\u2019 to let her know that she\u2019s gotten to him. He just makes every exchange, no matter how harmless, into a mental sparring match and thus causes his own inferiority complex to worsen, because she always \u2018beats\u2019 him. (Even when there\u2019s nothing to \u2018beat\u2019 him on \u2013 sometimes she just asks him a simple question that is literally only an attempt to make small talk.) \\n\\n\r\nThere is almost no character development whatsoever. If you look at the beginning episodes, and compare them to the later ones, you\u2019ll notice barely any change. She still talks to him and teases him in the same way she\u2019s always done, and he still tries and fails to best her the same way he always has. This was the main flaw of the anime, as a character-driven series. The characters just become boring after a while, you can predict almost exactly what will happen and how it will happen. Even Takagi\u2019s initially adorable laugh becomes grating after hearing it every few minutes, episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does try to add a few more characters into the mix, but they suffer from the same problem of one-dimensionalitis. Their exchanges are also cute, sometimes funny and sometimes boring, but I think the only reason I liked these three girls was that they were a break from the endless cute monotony that was Takagi and Nishikata\u2019s exchanges. They were nothing special in and of themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wouldn\u2019t say that I dislike Skilled Teaser Takagi-san. Whilst I didn\u2019t exactly look forward to it every week, it has a lot of sweet moments, and it does have a few funny parts. I just can\u2019t binge watch it. \\n\\n\r\nIf you want to try it, I wouldn\u2019t recommend watching more than one or two episodes at a time, with a large break in between sessions. That should keep it from getting too tedious, and instead just be a cute and mildly comedic series. XD\\n\\n",

This dramatic, emotional show tells a tale like no other\u2014a show of tragic love and betrayal. And of bobblehead chibis with hairlines that have more of an extreme angle than Minecraft's rubberbanding glitch.\r\nIts hard to forget sometimes that there are some shows that are purely made for fun, with no meaning behind them\r\nLike this one.\r\nThe art and sound aren't that impressive, I feel like you would have the same experience reading the manga. Considering shows like VioletEvergarden and Overlord II that are currently airing, the quality is significantly worse. \\n\\n\r\nThe main plot goes like so: Takagi constantly teases Nishikata, and he's out for revenge. The entire plot/goal of this series is to make Takagi flustered. (hey, at least it has a plot, cough Blend S cough)\\n\\n\r\nAs a person who read the manga to the point where I'm checking every week to see if a new chapter is released, I can confirm that it is at least an entertaining series. When you watch plot-heavy shows like Code Geass and Eden of the East, sometimes you need a break to relax your mind, a break that this show provides.",

The moments of Nishikata wanting to win over Takagi in numerous ways sets up the ONLY plot for the show, and my heart fluttered as I remembered the manga original and finally getting to see it in action. Every single detail, though simple and plain yet appropriately beautiful was handled exquisitely well and props for retaining the original designs of the manga art.\\n\\n\r\nSo, with a plain, boring but yet endearing series, what do you get with it? A boy who's always frustrated at the girl whom has an edge over him, with the girl finding that the na\u00efve, innocent-looking boy is her fun factor. Every \"plot\" that Nishikata comes up with is a total failure and wreck at the same time, but that doesn't always pose a problem for Takagi, who has always been able to outwit and outlast Nishikata, at times charming him with simple things like tickling to the more heart-to-heart embarrassing moments like getting together under an umbrella when raining, closing on faces that look like a kiss and blushing like mad when she doesn't mean it, oh how we wished our younger sweetheart days were like that. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is simply beautiful and gorgeous, that reminds me of the typical Sunrise and Tatsunoko Productions' type of old anime backgrounds made modern-age and it truly is a sight that looks simple but yet it delivers. Musically wise, what better way than to express the romantic love than to come up with songs of young, romantic expressions? The OST here is simple too but great in its own regard; the OP and numerous EDs (sung by Rie Takahashi) are light-hearted, giving the whole series an appeal that will never run dry.\\n\\n\r\nFor people that absolutely love rom-coms in its entire simplicity, I recommend you to check out this show. While the repetitive teasing thing is a BIG drawback and flaw of the series, it is the EXACT same factor that gave the series its substance that stands out among other school-type rom-coms.\\n\\n\r\nThe unrequited love of middle-school teasing, signing out.",

            "content": "This is one of the few anime that my little brother watches with me and that speaks volumes as he doesn't watch many anime. That getting out of the way how does the show hold up so far\r\nThe story is very loose but it works. It is just a bunch of pranks and childish fun at and after school between two kids who kinda have a thing for each other, and their friends. Its very episodic but it leads to amazing moments and some character development in an episodic show. Its romance. The kids have a thing for each other. Also there are lots ofjokes about growing up and teenage life which are relatable. Maybe some owo jokes here and there but this is not an ecchi. G O O D. I dont want to see middle school tits in my anime. I don't want the keisatsu coming in so im glad it takes a conservative approach.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is really good. I haven't noticed a single point in where the animation was noticably sub par like in other shows i have watched. The characters are very simple and stylized which works well. The detail in some parts of the background scenery is amazing too. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets across that childlike innocence with whistles and exaggeration in certain points. The acting is solid and OMG THATS FRICKEN KOICHI FROM JOJO'S VOICE ACTOR!!! The acting overall is believable and adorable. Then again the voice actors seem to have played adorable characters before.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are adorable as hell. Nishikata/Koichi voice (the protagonist) is a kid who wants to prank Takagi like she does to him but fails miserably. He doesn't realize it at first but he starts to kind of develop romantic feelings for Takagi. Takagi (the title character and the secondary protagonist) is a girl who likes to toy with Nishikata by teasing and pranking him a lot.But this is because she kinda loves him. She also kinda makes a few dirty jokes on Nishikata without it turning into softcore porn like (generic animu number 9266664632882). Mina is a girl who acts like a younger child as she always wants to be cheerful. She also is very immature and sometimes borderline dumb, but it makes her lovable. Sanae is her best friend and she is a bit more serious but still jokes around a small bit. And the English teacher is a bit of a DOUCHEBAG AS HE THROWS CHALK AT LOUD KIDS I MEAN WTF THATS RUDE. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime. It is one of my favorite shows to debut this season and if my little brother who isn't into anime likes it it must be good. This is my number 3 anime this season and i solidly reccomend this show. 9/10 Mastahpiece\\n",

I'm not a quitter, so I'm not going to drop this anime, but I can definitely see it being one of the underwhelming forgettable animes of the season. But who knows? Maybe the recycled teasing scenes will get more and more unique.\r\nWord count. Word count. The voice actorfor the main guy is definitely what carries the show for me.",

            "content": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san (or Skilled Teaser Takagi-san) is a title that pretty much sums up what you'll see in this anime: Lots of teasing.\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is an episodic slice of life/comedy anime with a bit of romance. It shows the everyday interactions between Takagi and the target of her teasing, Nishikata. Even though Nishikata is usually the loser of this seemingly one-sided teasing game, he still tries his best to come up with schemes to win against Takagi and make her embarrassed.\r\nEven though that's pretty much the whole premise, there's a variety of ways and situations in which Takagi outsmarts Nishikata andmakes him blush from embarrassment. This helps the anime remain funny and entertaining and there's something to look forward to even in a simple story like this. So, the premise was executed well. \\n\r\nFor those who expect something more from the series though, the anime's pattern and jokes might get repetitive soon.\\n\r\nApart from the main two characters' interactions, which cover almost the entire anime, there are short segments about 3 other characters in each episode. These characters are 3 girls, Mina, Yukari and Sanae, who are classmates of the two main characters. Their interactions are, also, quite fun to watch and feel refreshing, since watching the same two characters all the time can be kind of tiresome.\\n\r\nWhile this anime is meant to be lighthearted and relaxing, the pace can be a bit too slow sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nThere aren't many characters in the series, but they are all likeable. Their personalities fit those of innocent middle-schoolers.\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the smug girl and the main charm of the series, Takagi. She is a girl who loves teasing her classmate, but she does it in such an adorable way that she's hard to hate. Also, it's pretty obvious that the reason why she teases him in the first place is because she likes him, which makes her teasing even cuter.\\n\r\nNishikata is a nice, but naive boy who gets easily embarrassed. His face is too easy to read, which is part of the reason why his plans to tease Takagi always backfire. He is so focused on his plans to defeat Takagi, that he fails to notice that he actually likes her. His reactions and thoughts, although a bit repetitive, are pretty fun to watch and listen to.\\n\r\nThe chemistry between these two characters is very nice and it's fun to watch their interactions.\\n\r\nMina, Yukari and Sanae are also quite interesting, although they don't get much screentime.\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals may not be spectacular, but they are good enough for an anime like this.\\n\r\nThe artstyle, although it seems a bit simple at first, is quite cute, especially the character designs. The characters' expressions are also drawn greatly and are fun to watch. The backgrounds are pretty good and the colors that are used create a nice atmosphere that fits the anime's lightheartedness.\\n\r\nThe animation is good and fluid most of the time. But sometimes, the characters look weird when they are laughing or talking and the quality of both the art and animation of the characters drops when they are shown from a longer distance.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the sound, the show's music consists of tracks that are nice enough and fit the anime's lightheartedness. The OP is quite catchy and it's interesting to see so many different EDs sung by Takagi's VA. The background music is used well, too.\\n\r\nThe voice actors are doing a very good job, though. Both Takahashi Rie and Kaji Yuki are popular VAs, and they pulled their roles off nicely. Takagi's cute voice fits her and her playful way of talking is done perfectly. Nishikata's inner thoughts being voiced by Kaji Yuki are great to listen to and the weird sounds he makes sometimes are really funny. Both of them sound like actual middle-schoolers.\\n\\n\r\nDespite some of its flaws, like the anime's pattern getting repetitive after a while, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san can be a very enjoyable anime with many funny moments and likeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is an anime that I'd recommend you to watch if you want something cute, lighthearted and relaxing. It's an episodic anime, so you can watch a bit of it every time you feel like watching something to have a few laughs. It doesn't do much more than showing a girl teasing a boy, but it's an anime that serves its purpose just fine and it can be entertaining. Even if it gets a little repetitive and you might find better series similar to this one, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san has its own special charm that makes it unique.",

It knows exactly what it wants to do, how to go about doing it and then does it really well.\r\nBasic breakdown below \u2b0e\r\n== Impressions / Presentation: 7.5/10 ==\r\nThe basic formula involves Nishikata (the boy) trying to tease Takag (the girl), but fails and gets teased instead. Before you know it, you too are thinking: \"What is Takagi scheming this time!?\". It's not only a game for Nishikata, it's also a game for us, and this is how the show keeps the formula fresh and exciting.\r\nWhile there's nothing exceptional about the art and animation,the anime has been drawn with plenty of love and care. And it shows in the many character interactions in the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Story: 7/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nEvery interaction Nishikata and Takagi share feels like they're getting closer to each other, and it's very endearing to watch. With lots of moments that continually flesh out their relationship, it's hard to say that the show doesn't have a story, or there is no character development/progression.\\n\\n\r\nIf anything, their relationship probably feels more real and believable than the ones in traditional romcoms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Characters: 7.5/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nNishikata and Takagi have great chemistry with each other. Yes, they react to each other in entertaining ways, but simply watching them hang out is a wholesome and fulfilling experience in of itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe background characters don't get a lot of screentime, but the show has done a good job incorporating them in various scenes so it feels like these kids are inhabiting a fun and lively world.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n== Enjoyment: 7.5/10 ==\\n\\n\r\nBecause Nishikata and Takagi hog most of the show's spotlight, your enjoyment will be heavily dependent on whether you like them or not. The easiest way to find out is to just watch an episode and find out for yourself, as the reasons I like them could easily be the reasons you hate them.\\n\\n\r\nOtherwise yeah, I clearly got a lot out of a show just about two kids teasing each other.",

Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a Slice of Life anime in which two middle schoolers have a relationship where the girl teases the boy (contrary to other similar popular anime).\r\n          The story has no real plot to it, and is fairly repetitive; but I don't think it should pose any problem because of the way in which this anime is laid out. The art and soundtracks are well done, and I even went to such lengths to tryand cover the opening on my piano.\\n\r\n        The two characters Nishikata and Takagi have a decent amount of synergy with each other as the episodes go by, but I do find Nishikata's tsundere-like attitude a bit repetitive. I gave this area a 7 only because the roles are reversed and strays from the normal anime stream. Otherwise, it might've been lower.\\n\r\n        As far as I got in the series (10 episodes so far), I have really enjoyed this purely for smiles and teasing comedy. I tend to watch more slice of life anime compared to action anime, so if you tend to have the same tastes I believe this anime would be something to watch for sure.\\n\r\n       Overall, I gave this an 8/10; if you like comedy, slice of life, maybe even a little bit of romance, I definitely encourage you to watch this anime! I smiled and cringed (in a good way!) the whole way through, and is definitely worth the wait every week.",

The jokes were pretty witty at times, I'll have to give it that and this is why the score isn't lower. A lot ofkinda funny scenarios are added where she f*cks him silly mentally. Which honestly isn't hard with a mc like this.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while it's kinda interesting and amusing to see, this just DOESN'T work in anime format. I believe that it could be kinda good in manga format where you can read quickly. It honestly starts getting old after the first episode, I only made it through the rest because I watched one episode at a time spread out over a week, but even then I kind of felt like dropping it after 2-3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very monotone and quite boring anime that is pretty similar to anime such as \"sakamoto desu ga\" where we're served with the same type of stuff all the time but it's not the type of stuff that can be recycled and still be amusing, at least not in the way it's done here. There's no real point to it and I somehow don't really feel any spirit or personality from the characters. They don't feel even remotely \"real\" or \"alive\", they just feel like machines that exists purely to deliver jokes. Not sure how to best explain it, but normally you feel like the characters have a proper purpose and they're almost \"alive\" instead of dead and static. You feel that you actually like the characters and you want to see what they'll be up to next, that if they were real, you'd love to spend some time with those people, be it alone or in the \"gang\" they usually have. \\n\\n\r\nWell, there's nothing like that here. I wouldn't say I hate them, but I don't like them either. They feel empty and I certainly can't get behind any of them. It actually feels cringeworthy at times to see the excessive overreactions and unrealistic situations in a setting that is supposed to be pretty realistic. This just wasn't a good anime in my opinion, at least for me it was a complete miss. The only thing it gets plus points for is that the jokes are witty/smart/well thought-out, but that's sadly the only thing this anime has going for it and it just isn't enough.",

            "content": "Sorry for the mistakes. English is not my first language\r\nIt's my first review.\r\nStory: 4/10\r\nThe story is simple and uncompromising. This must be respected, but it will never justify not being good. Basically you have a kid who is constantly trolled for a girl and wants to change that, but it's always trolled again in the end. And this is repeated over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. The problem is not just having a formula but especially repeating 3 times per episode. It is extremely repetitive and rarely any moment of humor is creative. If romance is just a heap of randomand predictable moments (with a few exceptions) that do not make much difference if they don't exist and is not going anywhere, so it's not a well-developed romance, and romantic or sensual insinuations are just one useless plus. The goal is just to show situations that should be funny. Sometimes between a skit and another one, there's a trio of random girls talking about random things, and I'll never understand the point in their existence.\\n\r\nIt's no use having a simple base and doing nothing with it. It's almost the same as Yuru Camp, another anime from the same season that has a simple idea but does nothing creative or memorable inside it, but is considered a masterpiece because \"it's cute\".\\n\r\nSome people are comparing with Tonari no Seki-kun, which is also largely centered on simple (but not very straightforward) interactions involving two characters of different sexes, but this one is not so repetitive, it's more original, humor is more creative and the reactions of the characters are not so predictable.\\n\r\nAnyway, the ending was cool.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nIt's \"ok\". Remember: cuteness is not an automatic synonym of excellent art. The character figures are very shallow. The animation is not very important in this context, but it did not seem so good at some necessary moments (like in a racing scene).\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nIt's \"ok\". Music and voice acting are forgettable, but they have not done a bad job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 3/10\\n\r\nA dumb boy with a girl you'll only remember for being a smiling troll and having a big forehead. Without good characterization, (explicit) development or chemistry that makes a lot of sense, and reactions to situations are predictable (even if many jokes are not). Many one-dimensional characters from animations are functional within their contexts and they can be charismatic and memorable for some reason, not the case of these characters. I do not find it very comfortable to watch everything from the point of view of the boy who is always being \"victimized\" in situations and the fact that the pranksters only work to one side.\\n\r\nAnd the 3 random girls are ... just 3 stupid random girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\r\nIt is not detestable, but it has a formula that wears out very fast and becomes a boring experience to me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10.\\n\r\nIt's not so bad because some moments can still be fun, but why is it still not a good anime, if it's unpretentious and supposedly we should not be rigid?  Some genres of this anime include romance, comedy, school and slice of life. Failed as a comedy because it is repetitive and uncreative, fails as a romance because it is just \"bait\", school is just a scenario that could easily be replaced, and it's a normal slice of life. The result? A bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nI do not recommend it unless you can easily enjoy any romantic school comedy or be part of a select group of people who love to see little girls commenting about their own body.\\n\r\nIn other cases, I would recommend watching Tonari no Seki-kun.",

            "content": "Love comes in many different forms such as romanticly, eroticly, platonicly, parental,familial, love among friends, and a whole lot more. Sometimes we are oblivious to our own feelings, other time we are aware but don\u2019t act in them or sometimes we do. Karaki is basically playful love between two middle school students, Takagi and Nishikata, via teasing.\r\nKarakai is structured in snippets of the daily occurrences in the lives of these two characters and the teasing that occurs during these occasions, usually initiated by takagi. The teasing for the most part is okay as it\u2019s usually playful, and never end up being just downright bad eventhough Takagi is usually the one that comes out winning in each occurance. It also really doesn\u2019t come off as a bad thing that Nishikata always gets the short end of the stick since it\u2019s always his own personality that let\u2019s hime get teased so easily.  He always try to think things through and guess the ahead of takagi, but it usually tends for him to overthink it causing him to doubt his own thoughts and dupe himself in the end. He\u2019s also very expressive about his emotions that he has to turn his face so that he can literally hide his emotions from Takagi even though that in itself is very telling of his emotions. It\u2019s also because of this he is no longer able to make eye contact with her so he\u2019s unable to tell what she\u2019s might be thinking making him more susceptible to teasing. So while the teasing is fine, but it does wear thin after a while and the creators may have taken note of that. So instead of having a short length time, the show sometimes intermittently intercuts with the life of three other girl students who are schoolmates of the duo, and their stories are usually parallel with the main story and it\u2019s just fine and not much else.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else about this show is just fine across the board. The show has a bright generic colour pallet that suits the show fine. The background art is very close to a japanese countryside town as a sign of innocence which this show basically is. The character designs are alright, but the noticeable large foreheads may put some people off but i think it\u2019s cute on some characters. There\u2019s no real issue with the animation because for the most part it\u2019s kept to a minimum in shows like this, and that\u2019s alright The voice acting in the show could have been better with different voice actors as the ones voice acting them make them sound older than they actually look which does come off as odd, although it takes a little bit of time to get used too. The soundtrack also sounds fine even though there\u2019s not really much worth noting about it. \\n\\n\r\nThe show is a fine watch. It not a full fledge romance and it\u2019s not a off the wall comedy. It\u2019s just a cute show about two children who like each other having fun together while they are still young.",

If you want to watch a cute show where two middle schoolers constantly pull childish pranks on each other, but one side wins every time, then you'll enjoy this anime. As for me, I constantly found my self begging for this show to give me more to chew in. The main two leads Takagi and Nishikata are both adorable to watch don't get me wrong, it's just disappointing that that all this show has to to offerin each episode is the question of \"How will Takagi make Nishikata look like an idiot today?\" There's also a B story where the show follows 3 female classmates of Takagi and Nikshikata, but it's undoubtedly the dullest part of show. When ever you see the 3 girls come on screen, i'd recommend skipping. Now even though I may have made myself sound like I hated this show, which I don't, I just wish there was more here. I still recommend everyone who can find the time to give this one a shot, because it really is super cute, and all the other aspects of this show whether it be the animation, sound design, and the soundtrack are consistently fitting for what this show is doing. It just doesn't do more.",

The sound on it's own is actuallynot that bad. Problem is that none of the other points will get any sympathy from me. It just grinds my gears way to much, I like to see a series that shows at least some intelligence. This for storyline, humor as the characters and their progression.

Don't be fooled, this is not a romantic comedy : it's a comedy with a very small pinch of romance.\r\nSTORY\r\nIt's about a boy and a girl in love with each other and teasing each other, and... that's all. Literally.\r\nThere is no development at all on the situation nor on the characters. Even in each episode there is no actual story, as each episode is only a set of several indepedent sketches.\r\nThat's why this show is pointless : there is nothing to learn from it, and nothing to expect from it.\r\nThat said, story is far from being everything in an anime!\r\nART\r\nI'min love with the art style. It's smooth and it's beautiful.\\n\r\nThat said I do regret that the environments are clich\u00e9s. Sadly it's a recurring problem in japanimation : the environments often look alike. For example, high-schools have very little difference from one anime to another! The same for the towns, they look exactly the same sometimes.\\n\r\nI don't know if that's how it really is in Japan, but when it's about watching anime, I really regret that there is few variation in environments.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are gorgeous. The OST is not memorable, but does its job in the episode. Not great, but not bad.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nTakagi-san is admirable! She's spontaneous, she's a cutie, and she's bold on top of that. It was really fun to watch her hit on Nishikata.\\n\r\nAs for Nishikata, I don't really like him. He is dumb and totally clueless. That said he is fun to watch as well!\\n\r\nAs a \"main couple\", it works quite well.\\n\r\nThe other characters, on the other hand, are totally pointless. I mean, they are kinda fun, but their presence doesn't have any weight at all, especially because their interactions with the MCs are very limited.\\n\r\nMost of the time the secondary characters have their own sketches, and they are totally lfet aside once we switch back to the MCs' story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nWhen it comes to characters and story, this show is totally pointless. So if you're looking for strong development or good romance, you should pass on this anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut if you just want to watch something fun, then I definitely recommend that you try this. It is pleasant thanks to its comedy and its beautiful art style.",

            "content": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, a sweet and funny anime, although very simple\r\nLove is never as tender as when it awakens between two young people who have just stopped being children. In the case of Takagi, the female protagonist of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, her way of proving it is to mock the object of her affection without mercy.\r\nThis series of 12 episodes concluded a few weeks ago, leaving the door open to continue, although it is not necessary to do so. The mission is accomplished for Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, created to satisfy manga fans (and its sequel or spin-offs). In addition, it captured theattention of many anime lovers who did not know about the original work.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite how effective it is as entertainment and as a sweet demonstration of preadolescent love, it is the clear example that an anime does not have to be perfect to succeed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMediocre, but perfect in its own way\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs I said, the premise of this series is mediocre. As I said at the time, this premise has nothing new. The strength of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is in how it manages to have fun despite it.\\n\\n\r\nThe pranks and jokes at Nishitaka's expense and his frustrated desire to defeat Takagi-san become repetitive and yet continue to work. It does not stop being funny or sweet, especially when it seems that the tables are going to turn ... to finally not happen.\\n\\n\r\nThis series is a light comedy, it has no greater plot pretensions and that's fine. If I had to find some fault of it, it would be the fact that the power dynamic is never shaken. As a character Nishitaka is too soft, to the point that Takagi does not even try too hard to beat him.\\n\\n\r\nThis circumstance can make Takagi look a bit one-dimensional, because she simply seems to know everything and there is no real effort on her part to troll Nishitaka. There are few lovers of the series who call Takagi the \"master troll\". But is it really, or is it simply that Nishitaka is too stupid?\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion it is the second and that would have ballasted the series if it were longer. Fortunately for this anime of Shin-ei Animation based on the manga of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, having only 12 episodes avoids premature fatigue. The jokes are not particularly complicated and I repeat, they can be repetitive. Maybe in the manga work much better, by how fast you can read, but in anime more than 12 episodes and it would have been an outburst.\\n\\n\r\nCuriously, there is a manga that shows them as adults, and, to my surprise, it is much better. But I will not discuss that work here.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the technical section, we can not expect animated pyrotechnics in such a simple slice of life so the animation is correct for what it is. Nothing impressive, but it does not affect enjoyment either. The voice work is very good, especially that of Rie Takahashi as Takagi. Yuki Kaji does not do badly as Nishitaka, but his work is subject to Nishitaka's exaggerated reactions, which sometimes get tiresome.\\n\\n\r\nThe secondary characters are that, very secondary. This despite the fact that the trio of Mina, Sanae and Yukari receives a lot of attention, because they have their own spin-off manga and their little stories are included.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion we have a correct anime, without more. To have a good time and, if you like this kind of inoffensive romances, enjoy it and laugh a little. If you are unable to understand that they are two children of 11 years old and you can not wait much in the romantic field, better not see it.\\n\\n\r\nIt is an anime for a younger audience, although it can be enjoyed by people of any age. If you have not seen it, enjoy it.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I know most of you guys will not enjoy my review but this entire review is based purely on my opinion on this show. And also, this is my very first review of an anime so please bear with me. :)\r\n*SPOILER-FREE REVIEW* (Well a bit)\r\n(Although there are some recommendations throughout this review)\r\nI\u2019ll start my review with the Story \u2014 Rating: 10\r\nOk. Not much to say but it is based on two characters Nishikata and Takagi who are middle school students who sit next to each other during class and Takagi is a \u201cskilled teaser\u201d (as mentioned in the English Title) who teases Nishikata. But italso includes short moments of three other girls who are in the same class: Mina, Yukari and Sanae. That\u2019s basically it. But I do love the story between two young middle schoolers enjoying their young youth at their school/outside of school. \u201cYou blush, you lose\u201d - Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san 2018\\n\\n\r\nNow towards the Art \u2014 Rating: 10\\n\r\nI absolutely adore the art. It\u2019s beautiful, cute, bright and colorful. The character designs on each character really suit what type of character they are and are absolutely cute (but seriously surprised on how the arts differentiate between the manga and anime, well at least for a few chapters of it. But I do suggest reading the manga too). The tv cover art is what made me attracted towards this show and made me want to watch it of its innocence, childish-plays and very happy themed. In my opinion I think this show did a very good job incorporating those aspects towards this show.\\n\\n\r\nNext, is the Sound \u2014 Rating: 10\\n\r\nI ABSOLUTELY looooooove the sound and music incorporated because of how happy each sound/song has been well used in different scenes and it really suits the theme of the anime. You know why I say that? Because all the sounds/music that has been used in this have really made it worthy to be incorporated onto this anime. The musics, oh god, I am absolutely in love with both the Opening Theme Song and the Ending Theme Songs (there are 7 Ending Songs). But my most favorite out of the 7 Ending Themes are the 2nd, 6th and the 7th one. I won\u2019t go in depth on why they are my absolutely favorite, but, I suggest you find out yourselves why and I RECOMMEND to never skip the Opening and the Endings, you will not regret skipping them. Lastly I want to say is that the use of the sounds and musics give me a sense of nostalgia, refreshment and relaxing listening all the sounds and musics. But yeah, don\u2019t skip the songs. :D\\n\\n\r\nNow, the Characters \u2014 Rating: 10\\n\r\nHmm... The characters were rather unique as far as I have seen in anime. I\u2019ll firstly talk about Nishikata. Nishikata is a rather sweet, funny, and a gentleman character. But some of the times in the show made me say \u201cNiiiiishiiikaaataa, why would you do that?\u201d Or \u201cJust, why..?\u201d But these things were said in a good way and not a negative way because this is one of those shows where you want the character to do that and do that etc. Now I\u2019ll talk about Takagi. Probably my newest favorite waifu at the moment. You know why? Because she is just a heartwarming, honest and cute character. There\u2019s absolutely nothing you can complain about her character but just to enjoy her smiles and laughters when teasing Nishikata. Lastly I\u2019ll talk about the 3 girls: Mina, Yukari and Sanae. Their shorts were fun to watch as they live out their life. Not much to say, but just to watch them. BTW #NishikataXTakagi <3\\n\\n\r\nProbably the shortest one out of the other categories, my Enjoyment \u2014 Rating: 10\\n\r\nMan, I\u2019ve absolutely enjoyed each and every one of the episodes watching as they live their life as middle high school students. I\u2019ve DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY, and DEFINITELY enjoyed this show! :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2014 Rating: 10\\n\r\nOut of all that I have said, I\u2019m giving this a SOLID full 10. If you guys don\u2019t agree then you don\u2019t have to agree with me but it\u2019s what I think personally so I\u2019m completely fine if you disagree with my statements. But I will miss this show for sure and I\u2019ll probably rewatch it again.\\n\r\nBut I do hope for a Season 2 for this :) (Probably won\u2019t happen but I hope).",

            "content": "Do you remember your crush in middle school, who you always teased, but you only did that to keep their attention? \r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is taking this very common and very plain concept, and make a very nostalgic and relateable experience for all viewers. The best word to describe this series is \"pure\". You won't see any huge plot twists, action, not even real drama, is is literally about \"that\" first childhood love, which is embarrassing and confusing at the same time.\r\nThe first thing you need to understand about the story that it is not continuous. This doesn't mean that I recommend watching thisanime out of order, but there will be only small references to the previous episodes throughout the series. Of course, that doesn't mean that there is no character development, just that it is a light anime, which doesn't heavily depend on the story itself. I wouldn't go into detail regarding the story elements, other than it is about two (aside from some minor supporting characters) middle school student, who sits next to each other, and walk home together regularly.\\n\\n\r\nAs for art, it is nothing too special. Very clean, very easy to watch, no flashy elements, no 3D effects, it is what it is: an anime about middle school students. The art is perfectly mirrors and adjust to the story.\\n\\n\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san has a very clear and nice soundtrack. The opening song, and the ending songs are perfectly in balance with the anime itself, it describes and sets the mood for the series. I liked all of the songs for the anime and I found myself listening to the opening song in my free time as well, although I am not sure it was because my love for the series or the catchyness of the song. The soundtrack aside from the opening and ending song are perfect, in every possible way. I would easily say that it just give the anime a whole new layer of adorableness.\\n\\n\r\nNow the true strength of the anime are the characters. Takagi-san and Nishikata are perfect protagonists. The cheekiness of Takagi-san, and the clumsiness of Nishikata are perfectly in balance, and it is just so nice to watch how these two characters are developing during the series. I loved all the characters though, even the supporting characters are cute -- although they are not as detailed as the two protagonists. Also a huge shoutout to Rie Takahashi, who made Takagi-san so adorable. I truly believe with another seiyuu it wouldn't have been as enjoyable as it was with Takahashi-san's acting.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed this series, and I would recommend it to everyone. It gave me a very nostalgic feeling, made me remember my years in middle school and the purity of the characters and story was truly refreshing. I watched this series every week as it came out, and I always found myself looking forward to the next one. I really hope there will be a second season, there are much more potential in this series than just 12 short episodes. There is enough manga material for a new season, also I really hope for the spinoff manga to be turned into an anime Karakai Jouzo no (Moto) Takagi-san. Check out both if you loved the series. Until the next episode!",

            "content": "\"Ah, youth\", a phrase that harkens back to a simpler time without adult responsibilities like taxes, work, or complicated interpersonal relationships, and everything can be summed up with having fun with friends or having an innocent crush on the girl sitting next to you.\u00a0 Ooo, I've been waiting for this one.\r\nStory:\r\nOur story starts between the two middle schoolers who sit next to each other in class, Nishikata and Takagi.\u00a0 It's become glaringly clear for Nishikata that Takagi enjoys seeing his flustered reactions and teasing him at every opportunity she can get, leading this boy down the rocky path to get back at this girl forall of the light torture he goes through, persevering day after day to get his first win unbeknownst to the fact that he has already stolen her heart.\\n\\n\r\nWholesome.\u00a0 That's the word I would use to describe this show in a word.\u00a0 Throughout its twelve episode run, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san paints a picture of youth and moments of childhood fun as each episode compiles several mini stories, chapters from two of Yamamoto-sensei's works, primarily focusing on the school mishaps of the titular character outwitting and teasing Nishikata despite the boy's desperate attempts at getting back at her.\u00a0 While the concept at first appears stale, much of its presentation varies after the initial few takes of Nishikata failing to outwit the girl who's always two/three steps ahead of him, creating different scenarios in how he gets teased rather than him having his plans fail ninety five percent of the time.\u00a0 All the while, the story manages to make slow, but noticeable progress on the relationship between these two that creates something of an ideal 'youth romance' that feels warm and fuzzy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nQuite often, the story will also switch from its main focus to adapt chapters from \"Ashita wa Doyoubi\", a different manga series from the same author that follows the adventures of three girls who are canonically take place in the same town and school as Karakai Jouzu, providing a change of pace that still manages to emulate the same air to it as the casual and lax nature of these girls is nearly identical to the tone that we're normally used to.\u00a0 Personally though, I feel these stories generally have a lot less weight to them compared to the show's main story, as the unlike Takagi and Nishikata, the three girls Mina, Yukari, and Sanae don't have a developing relationship that creates personal investment, and instead emulates more of the 'slice of life' with girls story we're used to.\\n\\n\r\nOverall however, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a show that does a solid example of a slice of life show with a slow but positive impacting romance element that gradually grows to fruition with each passing episode.\u00a0 It's a fun and relaxing school comedy that's just a blast to watch trying to see the various things Nishikata tries to do in order to get back at Takagi, blissfully unaware that he has in a sense already claimed the biggest victory of them all.\u00a0 Personally I would've liked the show to have ended on a different chapter (Chapter 31), as it would've given the show a more definitive end, but if Shin-Ei decides to do a second season, I wouldn't mind.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Well-paced development\\n\r\n+ Wholesome.\u00a0 Very wholesome.\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Ashita wa Doyoubi sections feel lackluster in comparison\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs with any slice of life show, the most important parts to take into consideration are the characters, and how good they are as characters since they do carry the show.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san as the titular character is a mischievous girl who always manages to triumph over Nishikata despite his vain attempts to tease her for all the teasing he gets, and Nishikata is the boy who tirelessly and fervently desires to be the one standing over Takagi-san, even if it's for one time.\u00a0 The duo is an inseparable aspect of the show that gives the show its charm, their interactions acting as both the heart and soul of this series.\u00a0 While from a story standpoint, it seems like as characters they can't function without each other, much of the series dedicates to various their various quirks and interests, filling in blanks like their relationships with other members of the cast, favorite manga, and what they do without the other around, which helps to expand this show to be more of a slice of life on youth rather than just a school slice of life, as is what is commonly seen with much of the genre's school examples.\u00a0 As a result, these characters feel a lot more believable and leads the show into many other situations outside of school which for how often they're seen at school, is really refreshing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as mentioned before, we get the girls Mina, Yukari, and Sanae who spend much of their screentime creating character dynamics within each other; Mina is the kind of dumb energetic one, Sanae is the blunt and deadpan one, and Yukari is the levelheaded, almost sensible one of the group.\u00a0 Apart from them, the few characters we do see don't get explored much if at all, and really only serve to fill up cast slots and make it so that Nishikata doesn't just spend all of his free time with the girl he sits next to (even though that is totally the case).\u00a0 Everyone but the main protagonists are pretty bare in characteristics, but it's definitely not a dealbreaker in this case.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Well rounded (and very entertaining) main characters\\n\r\n-\u00a0 Side cast is lacking in comparison\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Shin-Ei Animation, a studio who is noticeable for being the studio responsible for the Doraemon series, the quality of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is not...great.\u00a0 While I will give the show credit for being very reminiscent of Yamamoto-sensei's style and doing an excellent job at all of the closeups that help emphasize the psychological warfare going between two seventh graders, the art is not all that impressive.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wavers in quality and background frames look slightly off and different from scene to another, making the overall style quite inconsistent and not that amazing to look at.\u00a0 The color palette used is indeed bright and gives a nice shiny coat over everything to give the show its bright atmosphere, but really nothing to me stands out as 'amazing' from this style.\u00a0 Which is a shame too considering how much I like this series.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/-\u00a0 Average art\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, the sound is almost an inverse of quality.\u00a0\u00a0\"Iwanai kedo ne.\" by Oohara Yuiko is the song that really emulates the kind of ride you're in for when you're watching this show.\u00a0 It's bright, it's cheerful, and its light tone really hammers in how lax and fuzzy the series feels while watching it.\u00a0 One of my absolute favorite parts of the OST comes with a woodwind version of the OP, which comes appears very often in the series to give each scene the extra push it needed to make it from just a normal teasing scene to a really fun to watch teasing scene.\\n\\n\r\nED's are a bit of a different story, as we have seven different songs all sung by the voice of Takagi-san, Takahashi Rie.\u00a0 Most of the songs fall under the same category of being relaxing and cheery songs, each of the seven falling into a spectrum between energetic to calming, which is honestly a nice variety that I didn't expect from the series, but is something that's quite welcoming.\u00a0 My personal favorite is \"Chiisana Koi no Uta\", or the fifth ED in the series, as it falls in the midway of that spectrum so you sort of get the best of both worlds that way.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Bright and energetic OP\\n\r\n+ Varying but all very good EDs\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is bar none one of my favorite romance series, both to read and to watch.\u00a0 As someone who has followed and loved the original manga to the extent that I drop everything I'm doing just to read the next translated chapter, seeing that it was getting an anime was like euphoria.\u00a0 And I'm so happy that the show fulfilled everything I as a fan could've ever wanted.\u00a0 Seeing my favorite chapter get animated was so great to see, and I feel embarrassed to say just how excited I got every Monday just to see the next episode.\u00a0 I love the gradual pacing, I think the show is wholesome to a fault, and Takahashi Rie while at first I was apprehensive at her casting, is now something I'm so glad they did.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I admit that I didn't do much but spout just how much love I have for this series, it's genuinely nice to see an adaptation get the amount of care and attention that the show got.\u00a0 The chapters were adapted almost 1:1, the accurateness of the characters blew my expectations, and the music was so much better than I ever thought it would be.\u00a0 While my recommendation is heavily biased, if you enjoy a good slice of life romance without any melodrama, watch this show.\u00a0 It's cute, it's fun, and most of all, it's wholesome.",

            "content": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a rather episodic format series divided into multiple skits per episode that relies overly on one formula. Once you saw the first episode you can predict how most interactions down the line would go. This is made even more glaring by the fact that the show attempts to preserve the status quo for the majority of its run. You will be stuck mostly watching the male MC repeatedly attempt to pull a shenanigan against the female MC and she is of course one step ahead of him. Much of the show\u2019s attempt at humor is centered on how she flipsthe table on him and his reactions to that. That\u2019s pretty much it. The skits are not punctuated by overly strong punch-lines that will leave you gasping for air. What it instead does is leave you with a big wide knowing smile looking at one skilled teaser, who obviously has a crush on the guy, try to tease him day in and day out into quasi-dates with her because it\u2019s the one sure excuse she has to stay near him without freaking him out with the idea of dating.\\n\\n\r\nMuch of the appeal of the series therefore lies on the delivery of the main characters and it is here that I must recommend the English dub. Aaron Dimsuke performs admirably in a series that puts a lot of weight on the male lead\u2019s reactions to being playfully teased. And, of course, the star of show, Sarah Weidenheft\u2019s Takagi, brings out a performance that is equal parts childish, playful, devious, and endearing all at once, while still selling the idea that she longs for him to notice her feelings.",

And Takagi cute laugh will haunt your boring life, because it's very adorable (as expected of Emillia-tan).\r\nThis show is simple and silly, yet I will wait every week wanting to see more. I'm not bored because the events and places are varied and of course all of them are cute. Though the personality of Nishikata stay the same, buthis determination increased day by day and I can feel him and Takagi getting closer. Hopefully, even if it's just once we can see some drastic moment when he triumph against Takagi. Because I somehow understand that Takagi teasing him is actually some form of love, or at least that's what I want to believe.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is still ongoing, but I can recommend this. I didn't experience something like Nishikata does in the past, but I still find this anime is very charming and can brighten up my Monday life.",

Never has he actually tried to understand her or act differently. \r\nThis doesn't change over the next episodes & watching quickly becomes more frustrating than amusing as Takagi beats a fallen man over and over.\r\nAs someone who isn'tmuch of a fan of these childhood stories, a slice of life without character development isn't attractive for long.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does, however, reflect well the competition, excitement, embarrassment, overthinking, making a big deal of the trivial & so on that we experience during our younger days. A bit romance is hinted at and the characters are relateable to an extent.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, very slow paced but not bad. I'll be skipping until the final few eps when they come out.",

But while the plot doesn't truly progress, you can't help but feel a step was taken in right direction. The tease-skit holds true to itself throughout, and yeteach episode still inches you on that they're so close, almost there, just a little further. This is often the demise of slapstick's repetitive nature, but it manages to keep you sucked in; it's executed masterfully to make each and every single interaction refreshing via creative schemes and deftly executed sudden intense moments. \\n\\n\r\nI couldn't, and still can't help but want more- and that's meaningful considering the amount of competition in this genre. If you're looking for either romance or a fuzzy-feeling / awkward comedy, I highly recommend giving Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san a shot.",

            "content": "Lets talk about one of the animes of the season. Not just for me but to the community in general. After all it has a rating in Mal of 7.92 (at the time of my writing) and you ask me why is that?\r\nWell, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a story about love. What?? You ask. It is. It's a story about love in middle school and most of us don't remember our early years of middle school and can't phantom to remember if we felt love OR how we express it. One thing I know for sure - after all I am 37 now so...\r\nBoysusually tend to pick on girls they love or at least care (or lust?) about. We tease and tease - that's the way young teens mind work. And thus enter these series BUT it's not they boy teasing the girl but instead the girl teasing the boy and at the same time understanding that both love one another but they really can't express.\\n\\n\r\nShe seems more mature giving hints that she likes him but he is a boy and thus become timid and screws up - while she teases some more. We never know what she really feels until the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nI am not going into much spoilers (If we can call it that because from the start we know what this show is all about) but even if you have no interest in romance you will enjoy seeing Nishikata losing again and again against Takagi who is a mastermind in Nishikata psychic.\\n\\n\r\nThe 12 episodes follow the lives of these two young teens and each episode is divided in several segments (where Takagi-San teases Nishikata or Nishikata plots to tease Takagi-san). In most episodes we also see small 3/4m segments with three of his collegues and their interactions (Mina, Yukari & Sanae).\\n\\n\r\nFor those who do not know (I didn't) this anime is based on two manga. The main manga is obvisouly Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san  and the small three girls manga is called Ashita wa Doyoubi.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and animation is very simple but works very nicely in this kind of anime. Takagi-san and Nishikata expressions are priceless. The sound and voice acting is great as well. No qualms. Not gaining an award but they do their job.\\n\\n\r\nTalking about the show, you ask me, isn't a bit repetitive formula? No! There is a charm with each episode and never gets dull. With so much stuff going on on bullying you might ask but I will say - no. It's never bullying. They tease one another although Nishikata sucks on teasing her back after all she gain pretty easily read his expressions and mind.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, in terms of character development it's one of those shows we see a main character (Nishikata) really develp throughout the anime since we follow him most of the time. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not an anime to watch in one go lest will be boring no doubt. It was made to watch a single episode between more serious anime. It's an anime to watch before sleeping OR in my opinion they should have made it a 5/6m anime but instead of 12 episodes they could have made 52 or something like that. That would be very interesting!\\n\\n\r\nWell, to me, it was a very interesting show to watch throughout the season and I didn't let accumulate 3 or 4 episodes and watch it in one go like most shows.\\n\\n\r\nBtw, this show is a lot alike Tonari-no Seiki-Kun minus the romance part and in this show there isn't a tease per se... \\n\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\r\n.\\n\\n\r\nSpoilers Alert \\n\r\nThere is also a Manga about Takagi-San and her adventurous with Nishikiata and their daughter. Funny as well. Hope someday it will be put on anime like this one.\\n\\n",

            "content": "An anime taken from  a Japanese manga series by S\u014dichir\u014d Yamamoto. The series features the daily life of Takagi, who loves to tease her classmate and friend Nishikata, and Nishikata's bonker way of getting even, geeez. So:\r\nGood 7, Story: \r\nI may have hated the way that a guys like Nishikata always gets punked by Takagi, but then again, it was kinda nice that in this anime chivalry is still around as he fails over and over again cu'z Takagi is always 2 steps ahead of him and he didn't even try to as far a doing lewd stuffs on her as payback for theteasing, but then again the plot wasn't just about the two, it also involve the 3 girls namely Hibino Mina, Amakawa Yukari and the tomboyish Tsukimoto Sanae, the genre Slice of life was with them as they go around throughout their junior high school life discussing all things that were seemingly random. Good as the story, it wasn't a full thing on the anime or manga's part.\\n\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, Art: \\n\\n\r\nI don;t anything to say about the illustration, but it was kinda good that there weren't anything kinky around here and don't look for it.\\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, sound: \\n\\n\r\nI may hate Takagi's laughter, when she gets to punk Nishkata, but, it was cute laughter and Nishkata to be annoyed was good as well, then again , since I have mixed feeling as to the voices of the characters I've decide on a 4. \\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Character: \\n\\n\r\nThe score goes to Takagi, since it isn't always that we see a girl get's to own a guy in a ridiculous way, were it amuses us audience to see the look of annoyance in Nishkata's face, we can forget the 3 other girls who have their own separate part in this anime, but ya know it was kinda disgusting that several other characters weren't even given their own screen time only after the anime has it's final episode.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nIt was enjoyable to a certain degree , were I would wish that Nishkata would flipped Takagi's skirt a seeing what color panty is she wearing, but this being wholesome, such thing has to be put on the back seat, cu'z this is one anime where you could enjoy seeing the girl punking a boy.....but the part where them girls get their own screen time with all things random , adds to such boredom. Sooo........\\n\\n\r\nfair 6, Overall: \\n\\n\r\nTbh, the anime's title was a bit misleading, it was suppose to be \"Skilled Teaser Takagi\" but what we get was something added into the mix, which is  the slice of life of the 3 girls, man do they have to be there??????? Well, what ends just ends, since in the manga has spoiled us that Takagi and Nishkata will be together in the future as husband and wife and that's how the cookie crumbles..........The end. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAhahahahahahahah Ahahaha....  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\u201cDon\u2019t tease me bro!\u201d -(Dat forehead though)\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, or, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san as the gringos say, is an anime that I feel a lot of people are getting the wrong impression of. Takagi-san is an adaptation of the manga of the same name by Souichirou Yamamoto that also pays homage to characters from his previous manga, Ashita no Douyubi (Tomorrow\u2019s Saturday). Takagi-san wasn\u2019t necessarily a project that caught my eye given any one name attached to its credits, if I\u2019m being honest here I didn\u2019t even bother to read a premise. I\u2019d go so far as to say it was a series thatI watched on a whim to keep up my facade of \u201cseasonal garbage-eater\u201d. And what I got out of it was a Slice of Life series that worked for me on almost every level. I don\u2019t typically go out of my way to white-knight shows I enjoyed, but Takagi-san managed to capture my heart and imagination with something that so few series of its ilk offer nowadays, charm. \\n\\n\r\nTime for the technicals. Animation this time around was done by Shin-Ei, probably most known in the west for \u201cMy Neighbor Seki\u201d but perhaps most famous for producing the monstrously popular \u201cDoraemon\u201d and \u201cCrayon Shin-chan\u201d, two franchises that never translated well in the West but have remained relevant for decades in Japan. The series was helmed by Hiroaki Akagi, a director whom beyond a few key animation and episode credits has remained a relative unknown until now. Slice of Life series tend to sneak up on me when it comes to the quality of their animation, and that\u2019s probably due to the lack of action set-pieces to grab me by the horns. But even I get sick of Yutapon cubes, laser light shows, and obnoxious movement lines. Takagi-san\u2019s average was consistently high, and on first viewing, it never dipped under that average. On the other hand, it never set out to impress with dynamic and polished sakuga as much as it aimed to keep everything polished and vibrant. Some studios take liberties with the art-styles of certain source-materials (e.g. Attack on Titan, Tokyo Ghoul, *cough* Berserk) but from what little I\u2019ve read of Yamamoto\u2019s manga, I can say confidently that his art-style was translated pretty accurately from panel to screen (not that his art-style is all that unique to begin with). \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is about as unassuming as you could imagine. Slice of Life series have the most potential to have varied soundtracks, unfortunately, this was not one of those shows to creep up on me with its fantastic composition. Rie Takahashi, as always, is a great singer and provided a not entirely skippable opening theme. Some of the ending themes throughout this show\u2019s run were also pretty catchy. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of harping on the relatively average score and middling theme songs, I\u2019d like to pontificate on Yuki Kaji and Rie Takahashi\u2019s performances as the two leads. Because of his youthful rasp, Kaji has a natural aptitude for and tends to shine in these younger roles. Pair that with Rie Takahashi\u2019s perfectly smug cadence and you have one of the better casting choices for a series in a while. Kaji and Takahashi have such good chemistry that they may as well have recorded all of their sessions in the booth ad-libbing off each other. With a series whose quality is contingent on the chemistry between its two leads, Kaji and Takahashi provided two of their best performances to date, practically making the lines of dialogue jump right off of the page. They loved their roles so much in fact that they helped produce a chapter of the still ongoing manga together with Yamamoto. For you dub purists out there, for reasons mentioned earlier, I can\u2019t in good conscience recommend watching this series dubbed. Funimation has been producing consistently better dubs in their \u201cSimulDub\u201d program, and while the Takagi-san dub is no exception, Aaron Dismuke and Sarah Wiedenheft don\u2019t come close to having the amount of chemistry that Kaji and Takahashi do. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san is a series whose content could be argued, on a surface level, to be repetitive. In fact, that\u2019s such a surface level observation that 99% of the negative reviews being posted about this series have taken the liberty of framing a good chunk of if not their entire review on this observation. While some might find Takagi-san\u2019s repetitive nature to be a detriment to its quality, I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s only repetitive for viewers who are too caught up in the \u201cteasing\u201d gimmick, which entirely misses the point of the series. Not only that but narratively, Takagi-san is episodic, series that by definition are MEANT TO BE REPETITIVE. Takagi-san, first and foremost, never set out to be more than an episodic Slice of Life series with light romantic-comedy elements peppered throughout. It doesn\u2019t pride itself on conjuring up intricate punchlines every episode or populating its cast with over-the-top joke-factory characters. Takagi-san plays to its strength, and that strength is the relationship and chemistry between its two leads. \\n\\n\r\nSo many other Slice of Life series to come out with similar premises would\u2019ve easily taken either an obnoxiously mawkish or unbearably sophomoric approach to its content. Instead, Takagi-san\u2019s meat and potatoes is an honest and refreshing innocence. The measured and \u201crepetitive\u201d approach to the comedy is deliberate, creating a believable rapport between characters at this age. Nishikata and Takagi are the centerpieces, clearly, but that\u2019s not to discredit the sporadic segments featuring the charming trio from \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Saturday\u201d. The low-key vibe that this series will often utilize makes it teeter closely towards the unambitious yet steadily growing \u201chealing\u201d subgenre, but the characters are grounded and believable enough to where it\u2019s not just a gaggle of perpetual tropes getting away with providing the bare minimum. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san may unfortunately never get the credit it deserves. In this ever stressful political climate where society is inundated by snarky edgelords squeezing laughs out of fart jokes, nihilism, and sardonic humor, Takagi-san has little room to breathe. Takagi-san is a much smarter show than it might seem on its surface. When you strip this show down to its most basic elements, the comedy deliberately makes up very little of what this series is truly made of. Instead, Takagi-san focuses more on believably pacing and portraying this burgeoning relationship between two infinitely likable characters. \\n\\n\r\nIt's that forehead, man. \\n",

            "content": "With great comedy and entertainment values, this is a cute story about the first love of a foolish boy and a girl who loves teasing him.\r\nTHE GOOD:\r\nTakagi-san is a great character overall. She is fun, intelligent and smart, and of course she likes to tease the protagonist, Nishikata, who is a bit on the slow and foolish side. But I honestly like both of them.\r\nTheir games and teasing is fun to watch. Not much else to it but that.\r\nTHE BAD:\r\nSince I'm a big fan of this anime, I'll try to be nitpicky to have things to talk about.\r\nThis is a story about the main charactersand their everyday life. Since it's slice of life, there is the feeling of 'not much is happening', and sometimes it sinks in more prominently. It didn't bother me, but it could bother others who like shows where things actually happen that push the plot forward and completely change things. This show isn't like that, it's pretty relaxed and fun.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the voice actors. The voices don't really match what I expected them to sound like in my head. They sound a bit too old, I think.\\n\\n\r\nI also think the manga is the better experience - not that the anime isn't good! Just, I remember laughing harder with the way the manga presented the jokes.\\n\\n\r\nOne last thing to mention: sometimes Takagi's bullying is a bit too mean for my tastes, and almost leaves the territory of friendly teasing to enter 'bullying', specially when Nishikata never gets an upper hand or a chance to 'fight back' against her antics. My point is it does sometimes feel a bit mean spirited.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR - CONCLUSION:\\n\\n\r\nA lot to love and very little to dislike, the tale of Takagi and Nishikata is cute and fun as expected. It's a typical boy-meets-girl love story, but it's a fun one with plenty of laughs and entertainment value.",

            "content": "\"Mwahahaha! Winds, blow harder and harder! Now, gale, I command--\"\r\n\"Morning, Nishikata.\"\r\n\"uAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!1\"\r\nSkilled Teaser Takagi-san, is a slice of school life type of comedy anime in recent years. There is no particular storyline expect for the little romantic development of the two main characters Nishikata, an average middle-schoolar shy boy, and Takagi-san, an unbeatable teaser girl who loves making fun of Nishikata more than anything. This is an anime where you will enjoy a small, little by little progress of their relationship changing from friends to somewhere above that. \r\nI thought at first that a full-time, I mean an anime that takes 30-minutes of the TV programs,is too much for this anime, because the major part of it is only the conversation between the two, or Nishikata's (inner) talking to himself. The starting few episodes made me unsure if the anime was worth watching to the end. But I learnt soon the situations varied effectively from inside school to shoping malls and then I was gradually getting interested in how the relationship of the two will progress. Of course I should not tell much about it, but now I am sure this anime is worth to watch for all sorts of people. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, I am kind of astonished how greatly the English dubbing work on this anime has been done. I found the Nishikata's English voice actor was awesome. Maybe it's the first time I liked a guy's voice in anime this much. He sounded always energetic/emotional that every time he spoke, or rather cried, I could'nt help smiling and laughing a lot. And Takagi-san's English voice is way better than Japanese, in my opinion. Totally she best acted throughout the show. When she pets a cat in episode 11, her tone of voice slowly changes into really funny, while Japanese tone doesn't much change. Beside of the two, the voices of the all side characters are very well done too. Voice acting is really something to bring anime characters to the lives. So, I think the dubbed version of it is better than the original. \\n\\n\r\nI won't be so interested in anime with no story, recently. But for some reason I enjoyed this anime very much. If you ask me what is the point watching a slice of life anime that has no storyline, I will answer that a good slice of life anime certainly has 'some' story you can discover even though it looks not has at first. Takagi-san is an anime something like that.",

            "content": "If there\u2019s one thing I really can\u2019t stand, it\u2019s cringe comedy. Part of the experience of living with Asperger\u2019s is that you\u2019re both cripplingly deficient with social communication and painfully aware of that deficiency, so every social interaction is just one mangled sentence away from plunging you into a witch\u2019s brew of bubbling shame that drags you down the more you helplessly flounder to escape. From that experience, watching fictional characters embarrass themselves for the sake of \u201ccomedy\u201d that derives mocking pleasure from their social agony doesn\u2019t so much trigger laughter from me as it triggers PTSD flashbacks. So on the surface, this show mightresemble nothing more or less than my personal hell. An entire anime dedicated to the idea of watching some poor fuck get repeatedly embarrassed in public over and over again? I can feel my inside trying to throttle themselves at the mere prospect. But against all odds, Skilled Teaser Takagi-san ends up being a really funny, really sweet, really wholesome time that captures the awkward, earnestly relatable nature of young love without falling prey to its menaces.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yes, the premise is as simple and direct as I made it out in the previous paragraph. Nishikata is a middle-school boy living an average middle school life, with one exception: his classmate Takagi has made it her personal mission to tease him at every possible opportunity. She lives for the chance to catch him off guard and leave him in flustered confusion, and she knows his insecurities and thought process well enough that she\u2019s really fucking good at it. Nishikata vows to get her back one of these days, but he\u2019s unable to crack her code as easily as she\u2019s cracked his. From there on, the show really does just follow them (and a handful of their classmates on occasion) as they hang out, getting into bets and challenges, with Takagi always leading Nishikata by the nose into her mischievous games and coming out on top. With such a simple premise and such a simple formula, the show leaves itself very little room for error. If it can\u2019t make this poor kid\u2019s suffering continuously funny, it will crash and burn on its face.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a good thing, then, that Takagi-san is actually able to pull that difficult feat off. These two dorks\u2019 interactions are a frigging delight; every single time they\u2019re on screen, which is 85% of the show, has a kind of infectious charm that\u2019s impossible not to get swept up in. What keeps it from descending into genuine mean-spiritedness is that you really get the sense that both of these kids truly enjoy the time they spend together. The enjoyment Takagi gleans from watching him suffer at her hands isn\u2019t the power trip of a bully; it\u2019s real appreciation from someone who can\u2019t believe how lucky she is to have such a fantastic ally by her side. And more critically, for all the embarrassment she puts him through, it\u2019s clear that Nishikata genuinely relishes the chance to match wits with her at every possible opportunity, even if he can\u2019t quite put it into words himself. She makes life fun for him. Add to that a pair of stellar lead performances from Rie Takahashi of Konosuba fame, capturing Takagi\u2019s earnest enjoyment of the time she spends with him, and the ever-stellar Yuki Kaji cranking up his Eren Yeager-patented theatrical determination with all the goofy sincerity this kind of character deserves, and I never felt the need to cringe away from their interactions because it\u2019s so abundantly clear that neither of them truly feel the need to cringe away from their interactions. And Nishikata slowly realizing how much Takagi actually means to him makes for one of the most heart-fluttering experiences of anime in 2018.\\n\\n\r\nBecause yes, this show is a rom-com, and it captures this kind of immature, puppyish adoration better than pretty much any other show I\u2019ve seen. Over the course of the show, the teasing gets less straightforward, the time they spend together grows more meaningful for both of them, and their interactions become increasingly tinged with a growing understanding of what\u2019s lying underneath the mind games and flustered flailing. This is young love at its best: sweet, sincere, a little cruel at times, but innocently cruel in the way only kids can be. There\u2019s something so pure in how they approach each other, how they handle their feelings in such vastly different ways, how they never lose the bite of the teasing games that brought them together in the first place. I can\u2019t remember the last time a joke about periods felt this overwhelmingly clean-spirited, or flirtation with sexuality felt this refreshingly understated. The simplicity of their interactions feels more genuine than any attempt to heighten the situational absurdity could have been. This is a show about two kids in very awkward love, and it doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything more or less.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, while that simple, straightforward quality is what makes this show such a delight to watch, it\u2019s also what keeps it from being any better. This is a purposefully light affair, with not much on its mind other than observing the endearing nuances of these two kids at a very particular time in their lives. The side characters are decently entertaining but not too memorable, and it sometimes feels like there\u2019s a little too much space in between each line. But you know what? Sometimes, that\u2019s okay. These two don\u2019t need a grand adventure or bitter trials for the sake of their connection; the simple joys of each other\u2019s company are enough for them. They were certainly enough for me. Skilled Teaser Takagi-san is a real gem, and it\u2019s sure to make you day a little bit brighter with every clarion call of its titular character\u2019s joyful laugh.",

I would sometimes skip the three girls' side story and just focus with the main story.

            "content": "Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san or \"Boku no Forehead\" as I like to call it is actually a pretty enjoyable show. I thought this would be just another boring cliche \"kids fall in love then suck on each others faces\" but I was surprised that it wasnt like that (thank god). The story is a 6/10 because it is just kids and young love but the way the pull it off is pretty funny with all the light heart humor and minor harassment of the sexual variety. The art is a 7/10 because holy crap the character design is the funniest animation style ive ever seen.Why have giant foreheads? why not! They somehow made it work. The sound is a 7/10 aswell. The opining isnt anything special and the overall OST isnt bad but its not memorable at least for me. Now for the characters. I think the reason i love the characters so much is because of their giant forehead, this aspect of the show is better than the story. Sure Takagi is cute and Nishikada is funny to watch but holy moly the foreheads make it golden but i digress. 9/10 for these amazing creatures. I enjoyed this show alot and id watch it again. All in all this show is a 7/10 not original but still a great piece of work.",

            "content": "Takagi-san is an anime that encourages you to revel in the fluttering hearts and flushed cheeks that accompany young love. It pushes you to root for our MC Nishikata, and to simultaneously have fun teasing him with Takagi.\r\nWhile Takagi-san is certainly repetitive, based on several teasing vignettes per episode interspersed with brief glimpses into the lives of some of their other classmates, the formula is effective. Takagi-san keeps both Nishikata and the viewer on their toes, and her mischievous smile and voice, provided by Rie Takahashi (Megumin in Konosuba and Emilia in Re:Zero), are as relentlessly disarming as her teasing is. \r\nTakagi-san is simple, pure,embarrassing and delightful. It's far from groundbreaking, the art leaves something to be desired aside from the character designs themselves, but it's a wonderful time none the less. Watch a few episodes and try to repress those embarrassing middle school memories that Nishikata's obliviousness will doubtlessly surface. You'll know pretty quickly if this is the show for you.",

But that's probably because those sorts of characters are always in shows like One Punch Man, where stakes are pretty high. When the main struggle of a story is a middle school boy trying to prank a middle school girl, yeah, having the middle school girl not only be impervious, but a perfect retaliator\u2026 It makes for a great, if at least somewhat predictable comedy.\r\nThe other thing you should know going in is that a substantial amount of the pranking and teasing isn't necessarily the innocent, imaginative school material ofyour Tonari no Seki-kun. A lot of it is very much a flirty sort of teasing that is meant to tease *you*, the viewing audience, with a will-they-won't-they sort of romance.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi and Nishikata aren't great characters (though they are exactly what they need to be for the teasing subplots to work at all), the story isn't groundbreaking, the foreheads are a little distracting, and a trio of side characters steal about three minutes per episode being a very generic school-style comedy bit far away from the teasing gimmick - but overall it's just a fun comedy that actually sucked me into the will-they-won't-they, despite my usual disdain for that style of romance.\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I liked it more than I should have.",

When Takagi teases Nishikata its sort of funny and sort of heartwarming, this anime always brings a smile to my face. the plot is really simple but effective, recommended for casual slice of life viewers. Its been a long time since we got a good slice of life anime and this anime is worth a while. The day to day lives of these characters may remind you of childhood,to be honest this was nostalgic for me. The Character designs are so simple that they are beautiful, Like every character's eye styles are unique and their facial features are also unique . The backgrounds are just so beautiful it looks super good which goes along with the background music which is soothing when it plays when characters are interacting with each other. The Characters in this anime are Obviously childish and do childish things which is so slice of life. Overall this is a Very nice anime, definitely recommend it. \\n",

While it is true that in the beginning it is mainly about our main character Nishikata being teased by our main heroine Takagi-san and wanting revenge on her, it slowly turns into a development between both middle school kids and their relationship with each other. While Nishikata tried different kind of ways to get back at Takagi he actually goes on to try to improve his body and mind as well. Constantly doing pushups throughout the series in anattempt to become stronger.\\n\r\nMeanwhile we see a stronger bond form between the two of these kids. Which eventually leads to some victories for Nishikata. Add in the fact that Takagi never crossed the line in my eyes. Never physically or even mentally scarring Nishikata. She knew her boundaries. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation was like watching a better CGI anime at points. It was far from great. However it seemed to fit this anime quite nicely.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was really cute and catchy. The endingS were very well done as well. When you get an anime where the Main Girl sings multiple endings I feel like it makes the anime more special. The bgm during the show was rather good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise I thoroughly enjoyed both Nishikata and Takagi. They're just two cute kids enjoying their youth. What's not to like about them?\\n\\n\r\nI rather enjoyed this anime. I found myself wanting to watch it immediately even though each episode was left with zero cliff hangers. Seriously there was no reasoning to watch the new episode only for the sheer fact that I wanted to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I do not think this anime is for everyone. However it was one of the better Slice of Life/Relaxing anime of the Winter 2018 season. I would give it a Mid/High recommendation.",

            "content": "A tale of two middle schoolers, and innocent love. The chemistry between Nishikata and Takagi was so powerful, hence why I loved following this show. \r\nIt's not your generic love story with a cheesy storyline, rather it plays on the idea of love with both happiness and thrill.\r\n1: Story Score -> 5 (Mediocre)\r\n-> Something that this series lacked in my opinion. I felt there was no sense of story progression between each episode, because of how they chose to break it down. In short and sweet \"Topics\" they showcased a spectrum of different situations and feelings that both Nishikata and Takagi went through, as wellas the trio of friends. I liked how they took the approach of cutting it down to different showcasing but it doesn't support a easy to sense timeline or story structure.\\n\\n\r\n2: Art Score -> 6 (Fair)\\n\r\n-> It takes a lot to impress me on the section of Art, as it implies a powerful influence on the entire story. For this show, I think its fair to give it a solid 6/10. It didn't quite wow me, but at the same time it wasn't terrible. Decent scenes in the typhoon period and others but that's pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\n3: Sound Score -> 6 (Fair)\\n\r\n-> Pretty much the same description from the art score fits my sound score. Nothing wowed me, but again. Not terrible. From voice acting and situational audio, it was fine.\\n\\n\r\n4: Character Score -> 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\n-> Being a short 12 episode series, it is pretty hard to maintain a strong cast of characters who pass a charm to its viewers, and thankfully this show does this extremely well. With these seamlessly short and passive scenes in the show, I felt as though the chemistry between both Nishikata and Takagi was amazing. The way they communicate with each other shows a realistic approach to the 'innocent love' or 'young love' aspect. Being an inexperienced lad, Nishikata is completely oblivious to Takagi's feelings, so much so that he often lowers his guard at the worst times for Takagi to tease him. Strong potential for these two in the future. Although we did see only did see a handful of scenes between the three friends Yukari, Mina and Sanae, I am comfortable with stating that they were also well portrayed for their ages.\\n\\n\r\n5: Enjoyment Score -> 8 (Very Good)\\n\r\n-> With its fairly simple story, I was surprised. I was always looking forward to my Monday afternoon to watch this show, as each episode made me smile and laugh at how dumb Nishikata can be! :D\\n\\n\r\n|-_-_-_-> Final Score: 7/10 (GOOD)  <-_-_-_-|\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this show, but as I stated, it takes a lot to impress me given this short stack of just 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI would've raised this score IF:\\n\r\n-> We had a much more fullfilling ending. The missed potential of adapting chapter 31 especially. A great opportunity lost.\\n\\n\r\n-> More story progression. Fill the air with some sort of organization instead of just following a broken \"topic\" based timeline.\\n\\n\r\n-> Increased quality of the art and sound aspect. These two were both okay in my perspective, but with the ever so increasing competition of the Slice of Life genre you NEED to stand out. An easy way of doing this would be to focus on the art/visual style, since it is the one aspect that is literally at everyone's faces from start to end.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! This is actually my first MAL written review so I hope you enjoyed it! :D  \\>.</\\n",

The story doesn't really have that much plot because it just tracks the daily lives of two middle school students, and let's be honest you don't expect much action, or drama to happen during this stage of your childhood. \r\nHowever, in my opinion, what this story delivers is the genuine shape of puppy love, since at this stage of our life we are not yet vocal with our emotions (I doubt anyone one of you confessed to your crush at middle school) as demonstrated by Takagi and Nishikata throughout the series via Takagi's constant teasing and Nishikata'sawkward reactions and denial.\\n\\n\r\nI suggest that you pick up this series if you are interested in the slow and humorous romantic development between Takagi and Nishikata. If you can live without any major development and plots, then this anime is for you.",

            "content": "I'll just say this: This series is for pure comedy and enjoyment, but right now it's really outdoing itself in terms of comedy and has such a charm that people really shouldn't find a reason to hate.\r\nI'll keep this as brief as possible:\r\nSTORY: This series doesn't really have some sort of serious story or plot, but that's totally fine; this series' purpose is to present the everyday lives of two very good friends in middle school who play a one-sided game of trying to embarass the other, with Nishikata always getting the short end, which is always VERY funny. It's one great hell of adevelopment to see if whether or not Nishikata can squeeze out a win. Of course, there's also the segment for the three other supporting cast members who present quite the showcase of amusing interactions and conversations about common things in life.\\n\\n\r\nART: Shin-Ei Animation really doesn't try to do too much with their animation, but damn, the animation here is clean, and depicts Takagi's smug (perhaps the best of all anime smugs by a cute female character) so well. Now granted, some people might not like the art style and design of the characters, but then again, there's stuff like Boku no Hero Academia, Mob Psycho, and Kill Al Kill, and those series did GREAT despite the odd designs they themselves have.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Not much to say here. It gets a solid grade here simply for fitting the scene during which it is playing. Because of how this series functions, there's 0% chance of this series getting a grandiose soundtrack, but it doesn't need it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Nishikata is a fun character to watch despite how he usually gets short-ended. Granted, he can be too naive, but at least he's a good person at heart. Then there's Takagi, a smug queen at heart, and a playful personality. She's really the charm that make this series worth watching. Of course, the three other support characters do get their own segment as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: It's probably already mentioned above, but seeing Nishikata getting into trouble or played like a fiddle is all worth it for the laughs. And of course there's Takagi's cute expressions. On a personal level, it was also oh so satisfying when Nishikata finally got his first \"win\". Lastly, probably aforementioned, there's also the three girls' own segment that may or may not have you shaking your head or laughing your ass off.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: Just watch and enjoy it as your typical slice of life comedy. If you're not into those kind of series, just don't bother. Trust me, though, if you do decide it to watch it, you won't regret it.",

            "content": "Nishikata and Takagi san sit next to each other in middle school, and it immediately reminded me of a girl I sat next to in middle school.  I really liked her a lot, and I might have been guilty of teasing her once or twice.  Well, as it happens my good friend also liked her and as such I never did confess my feelings.  Years later when I became an adult I looked back on the situation and I realized she must have liked me too (at one point I overheard her say, \"I liked you so much ~\" under her breath,but this was apparently too vague/ambiguous for my middle-school self to understand). However, my strange personal code of conduct (bros before super cute girls?!  How stupid was I?) prevented me from enjoying my youth with someone who still sometimes shows up in the odd dream or two.  Not that I regret my actions one bit.  (I regret nothing!!!  *Sniffle*)\\n\\n\r\nAhem, enough about me.  This show reminds me of those days, and so I really enjoyed this anime more than I ought to have.  I say \"ought\" because while the anime is indeed quite cute, I do have some complaints.  The relationship between the protagonists is not equal in any way.  The girl is super cute, witty, clever, gets excellent grades, kind, considerate, knows what she wants, and mature beyond her years.  The boy is awkward-looking, gets poor grades, is apparently slow-witted, disruptive in class, has problems controlling himself and his inside voice, and apparently doesn't think anything through before blurting it aloud.  Seriously, one wonders what Takagi sees in Nishikata.  I'll buy that she's further along in her emotional and verbal development, since that's basically all girls at that age.  That part is pretty accurate.  \\n\\n\r\nBut seriously, he's not even more athletic than she is, apparently losing at every single contest in which they compete.  This includes their endless attempts to see who can cause the other to embarrass themselves.  However, since Nishikata is about as subtle as a brick, he is pretty much just Takagi's punching-bag.  One would think it would grow old, picking on such an easy target.  To the show's credit, she's never excessive or truly malicious about it.  There are side-characters who have their own amusing conversations, and I'm especially a sucker for the two girls that fill in a dialogue they observe but can't hear. \\n\\n\r\nI'd like to complain about how dense Nishikata is regarding how Takagi obviously likes him given how much attention she lavishes upon him.  But then I re-read the first paragraph of my review...  um, yeah.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is fantastic; I think the style chosen fits the mood perfectly.  The voice acting is superlative, and Takagi's seiyuu in particular is remarkable.  However, the same formula (can we even call it a plot?) is repeated over and over.  I think this show might make for a good watch as it airs, but it would be a little boring to binge the whole series in a single go.  \\n\\n\r\nMy advice to you is: watch if you really have a weakness for cute kid interactions, if you wish you were even a little more self-aware at their age, or if you don't like your stories to actually go anywhere.  On the other hand if you lack self-confidence, you might have trouble enjoying this show to its fullest.  I think a certain type of cuteness offends the overly-serious or analytical viewer, so if that describes you then stay away.",

She is a real breath of fresh air on the anime's world.\r\nI read some chapters of the manga, not in this integrality because of the poor way of french traduction, and with like 20 chapters, I totally fell in love of this child (in an ok way, you know, i'm not a lolicon or something like that)\r\nThe story is simple, that's some little storiesabout two children, Takagi and Nishikata, sometimes in class, sometimes on the street. Nishikata is a young boy naive, simple, often silly but with a self-denial for everything. Takagi making jokes, she make fun of Nishikata, who try to do the same to her, but he always fail.\\n\\n\r\nThe schema is almost always the same. Takagi make fun of Nishikata, who try to reverse the situation, who fail and Takagi can make fun of Nishikata even more. I find this process really funny, the enjoyment is always here.\\n\\n\r\nActually, when i saw that a studio would make an anime of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, i thought it would be like many episodes of 3/5 minutes, i was surprised when i see the format.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I hope this review was understandable.

            "content": "Do you ever tease someone? Is there somebody that you just love getting under their skin, or maybe you just love their reactions? Sure, teasing is a lot better when you\u2019re the one doing it. The person getting teased usually doesn\u2019t enjoy it, but teasing typically has no malicious intent.  As weird as it seems we often tease the people we love. There are many ways to show affection after all.\r\nOur story centers around Nishikata and Takagi, two friends and classmates who are very competitive with each other. Takagi loves to tease Nishikata whenever the two of them are together, this often leads toNishikata getting in trouble in class. These two love to try and one-up each other, but Takagi is often the winner of their tease battles. \u201cI\u2019ll get her next time,\u201d is what Nishikata often thinks, but will he ever actually get the upper hand? Hilarity ensues as these two friends fight the ultimate tease war, a war that is most definitely one-sided. This may seem like a pretty simplistic concept, but that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Teasing Master Takagi-san knows exactly what it wants to do and does its best to honor that. It wants to make a sweet and funny love story of two friends who constantly try and get the better of each other, and it does a fantastic job.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is a very small cast of characters in Teasing Master Takagi-san. Again, that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. You have Nishikata, our main character who is at the mercy of Takagi, and Takagi, the scarily intelligent master of teasing herself. Nishikata is pretty naive (I want to say stupid at times as well) and is always falling for Takagi\u2019s tricks. You\u2019d think he would catch on to her by now and keep his guard up, but it isn\u2019t entirely his fault, Takagi knows exactly how to manipulate him to get a reaction she wants. She\u2019ll also often manipulate Nishikata to think or say something perverted then viciously tease him for it, again showing how cunning and sometimes cruel Takagi can be. I\u2019d talk about the side characters a bit, but there honestly isn\u2019t that much to talk about. They fall into archetypes for the most part and aren't that memorable. They\u2019re a nice diversion from the tease war and that's about it.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art isn\u2019t the best thing I\u2019ve ever seen, but it\u2019s far from bad. There\u2019s aren\u2019t any noticeable quality drops, at least that I\u2019ve noticed. It gets the job done fine. I will say that I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve watched an anime that had character designs quite like these. When I say that I mean Nishikata and Takagi mostly, the rest of the cast is pretty normal. I don\u2019t know what it is, but I just don\u2019t see many characters that look like Nishikata. I also really adore Takagi\u2019s design. Again, I don\u2019t know what it is and can\u2019t exactly put it into words. They both just look different and I love it. Something I love about the opening is how much personality they managed to cram into it. You watch this opening and you get a great look into the characters of both Nishikata and Takagi. You also get a good grasp of who the side characters are in the second or two they\u2019re on screen. I think it\u2019s impressive to get that through in such a short amount of time. The opening song \u201cI Didn\u2019t Say That,\u201d and the whole thing in general just bleeds personality and is really nice. This anime has quite a few endings, 7 to be exact. Now the visuals usually change slightly between each ending, but the song is different for each of them. Having that many songs for a 12 episode series is pretty incredible. They could\u2019ve just had one normal ending for every episode and have one more for the last episode, but they went beyond that. That amount of work definitely deserves some praise. As someone who tends to skip endings unless I really like them, this series is a little wake-up call that will make me watch them for now on. I never want little details to go unnoticed like that again.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI also want to give special credit to Takagi\u2019s VA. I love her voice and her laugh and they both fit Takagi\u2019s character so incredibly well. I couldn\u2019t imagine another voice for Takagi honestly, it\u2019s fantastic. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a fun anime to watch, one that you don\u2019t have to think too hard about, one where you can just relax and take in the characters and adorable story, you could do a lot worse than Teasing Master Takagi-san. I was originally going to watch this when it was airing, but for one reason or another, I never did. Man, am I glad I came back to it. With all that being said, This was just my opinion and isn\u2019t any more or less valid than anyone else\u2019s. As always I highly recommend you watch it for yourself and form your own opinions.\\n\\n\r\nThank you so much for your time, I really appreciate it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd as a little side note get excited for season 2 this year, I know I am.\\n\\n\r\nI give Teasing Master Takagi-san 8 blushing Nishikata\u2019s out of 10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Other than that I do not see anything else. \\n\\n\r\nNegatives: There are one cruse word use and the d-word but that about it on foul language. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is a really interesting anime because of one of those anime that you never know what you're going to get and fairly clean and if you keep watching you may find yourself soon wanting to takagi-san to tease you. \\n",

            "content": "I did expect a lot from the whole series. But it failed. Not all, but almost. The whole series starts with a bit interesting slow start. The comedies, skits and scenes are very cliche and you can see all the teases coming. Somewhere in the middle starts to fall, its very boring and not fun to watch. But the last 2 eps is somewhat good. Takahashi Rie Voiced Takagi-sa. was a good choices. I love how she delivers a very heart warming tone. My heart melts hearing both the Opening and Ending. I can say that the OPs and EDs are more heart warming thanthe whole series. Ep 11 where Takagi-san was been Critical Hit is a good choice to spark the ending. And again, I did expect a way better ending of the series. It could be better if they put a more romance on the ending, where the confess or hug or hold hands, or something like that. But still. The series is a medicore. My scores: The story? Hmm not good. The MCs? Medicore. But I could see the potential of the series if it was centered on a romance rather than a sliceoflife / teasing anime. Romance! A little hugs and hold hands wont hurt. The art? Very bad. Very dry. I guess the animation budget is not that huge to begin with. The Ops & Eds? The best. Ending? Good, but it could be improve a lot. Can I recommend this to other people? Maybe no. There are other good series to watch. Maybe watching this 12eps is a little waste of time and boring. But ... having a little romance some times is good for our health. \ud83d\ude00",

Takagi is the only female lead and is the one who is always Nishikata in always than one when it comes to said teasing she is nice and again straight forward when it comes to teasing Nishikata. (even though you might think id review the 3 other girls in the anime i wont i just kinda felt like they were there when they didn't need to be i guess they had there own manga i guess set in the same spot the 2 but yeah i wont review them even though one might think i would).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: What i liked: i mean i loved this anime for sure from just Takagi and Nishikata and there certain interaction's with each other to the art and also the other characters being really well done to the comedy actually being really well funny and what not it was a really good anime for sure also the bits of romance as well a good here. What i didn't like: i guess this would be more for people that yes this anime CAN get repetitive and old after while with all the teasing between the 2 but i thought it was always good this is just here for some people who might not like the repetitiveness otherwise i would say yeah at sometimes it was repetitive but i still enjoyed myself here.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: id give this a 8.5 (would give it a 9 but maybe you could kinda understand why i wouldn't) ill admit the only thing i didn't like was yes it was kinda repetitive for me but just the interaction between Takagi and also Nishitaka with and also the fact that i just really loved the comedy as well as the teasing going on and such was really well done here i would recommend this anime to anyone.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Who hasn't been teased by a girl before!? Not unlike Danshi Koukosei, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is one of the most relatable slice of life for any teenager around the world. The show involves a very simple yet relatable plot: a boy named Nishikata that constantly tries to outwit a girl named Takagi-san but ends up always being outwitted and teased instead. \r\nPlot: 8/10\r\nThe show's biggest selling point for me was how relatable it was to my teenage life. Even in college, i am always looking for ways to tease people (family and friends) or am always on the receiving end of being teased.Karakai's way of portraying teasing is attractive, interesting and SOOO relatable it's ironic. It's like getting to see yourself in the main protagonist's shoes as he plots his plan meticulously only to have them thwarted effortlessly by Takagi-san. Throughout all 12 episodes, there is so many ways of teasing introduced that it always feels fresh, and rarely boring. Even though some of the teasing methods were familiar to me and predictable, i never once found the desire to skip ahead. Seeing Nishikata's inner monologue and thought process is a treat and a very different perspective you never expect to see when you think about teasing in real life. Most time,  I find myself comparing Nishikata and myself from years ago and laughing at the antics that he pulls or plan he fails at, just because i understand his desire to get back at Takagi or his humiliation at Takagi's hands. This relatable feeling to the protagonist is what kept me interested and eager to watch the continuing episodes, be it to reminisce about my life or see what my life could have been like if it were full of tease like Karakai. The little romantic gestures between Takagi and Nishikata is also portrayed so sweetly in this show. The way Nishikata looks at Takagi and the way Takagi hides her true feeling by teasing him is so sweet and nice to watch. It's like watching how a secret crush between 2 people progress and develop, while also seeing how both of them cope and feel towards one another. \\n\\n\r\nThe side story about the 3 girls is also one of my favorite things about the show. Each of the 3 girls's unique personality is something to adore and adds something a little more to the already fun show. Not only is it funny, and adorable, but it also serves as an interesting distraction from the overloading of teasing the show already has. Rather than suffocating you with overabundance of teasing, the show cleverly inserts the daily lives of these 3 girls, to satisfy you before being pulled back to the main story. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI LOVE THE OPENING THEME. The opening song to Karakai jouzu is so smooth and sweet. It's so relaxing and fitting to the theme of the story. It's a nice pace away from the fast paced / rock / pop of the usual anime openings. I'm not so sure about the Ending songs though. Some of it were nice, some of it were ok, but it's not long enough to have a long lasting impression on me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter : 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhat else do i have to say. The characters are adorable. I honestly have no reason to dislike any of them, probably couldn't find any if i try. Nishikata is an extremely relatable character to me (and probably most guys out there). Always getting teased, having such a complex thought process, always failing at plans, gets embarassed easily, not knowing how to express himself. Takagi is like that girl is our lives. THE ONE WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. Cute smile, always getting on our nerves and yet we can't live without them. She's the girl we don't want other guys looking at / talking to, and we want her all to ourselves, despite not being able to stand her. The trio girl group always has great personality, with a fun/ clumsy one (Mina), a cool one (Sanae) and the sensible one with the biggest headache taking care of the other two. (Yukari). Apart from being lovable, the best part about these characters is the relatability i have with them. All the characters shown in the show are characters we could easily understand. We could also just as easily have been in their shoes at any point in our lives. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nReally nice slice of life. \\n\r\nUnexpectedly funny comedy value. \\n\r\nRelatable plot and characters\\n\r\nRelaxing and nice opening theme\\n\r\nCreative way of portraying teasing.\\n\\n\r\nRecommended: Yeah, a very nice and relaxing anime, and suitable for everyone.",

            "content": "An awesome romance story about 2 kids.\r\nIf you like cute romance stories and love major trolling, this is the show for you.\r\nGod, this anime was great. When I started watching it I wasn't really feeling it and kind of disregarded it as overrated after 3 episodes. A couple of months after it came to my mind to try the show once again, as I may have been in the wrong mood to watch it. I was god damn right. After I picked it up again, I watched 3 other episodes, and I loved it. I finished the remaining ones at the moment of writing thisreview.\\n\r\nFor starters, I love Takagi-san as a character and her relationship with Nishikata. I laughed my ass off so many times watching the way she completly owned him again and again. Nishikata is a perfect character for what he does in the show. Which is getting completly owned. I kinda feel bad for him but I love those two as a couple. The 3 girls whose names I can't be bothered to remember are also quite fun to watch as they face some of the funniest antics without stealing the show from the great and fun romance bettween Nishikata and Takagi-san.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show a lot. Can't give it less than a 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nSeason 2! Season 2! Season 2! Season 2! Season 2! Season 2! Season 2! Season 2!",

            "content": "Children, as they are just beginning to learn about themselves and the world around them, struggle to identify that a taller glass doesn't always necessarily contain more milk than a shorter but wider glass. If they're presented with emotions, they would only be more confused with more abstractions.\r\nInitially, I didn't have high expectations for Takagi-san, since it was just about childhood romance. I mean, what could be so interesting about that? Kids just fooling around, playing on the playground and swinging on monkey bars. \r\nHowever, I quickly realized that I was so wrong about this anime. What appeared to be a children's show turned intoa good bittersweet cup of chilldhood romance.\\n\\n\r\nI blushed. I lost. \\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san explores the emotions between two elementary children, a perceptive girl named, obviously, Takagi-san and a klutzy boy called Nishikata. Without knowing how to deal with the emotions that they feel for each other, Takagi-san proceeds to tease Nishikata to interact more with him and help him grow to realize her affection, while Nishikata plainly rejects any evidence of affection, or any girly behaviour such as loving \"50% Unrequited Love\", mainly due to his gender expectations. The series runs through their interactions with each other, which I believe are more comic than serious. There were some exceptionally hilarious and interesting scenes, such as when the 100% star-crossed elementary couples go tandem riding, when Takagi makes faces at Nishikata while he's drawing a portrait of her, and when Nishikata is always on the receiving end of Takagi's prowess as a witty teaser. However, the more that I progressed through the show, the more that I realized the heartwarming portions of it, which was the fact that although Takagi may seem to be treating Nishikata like a poor goldfish with  unattainable fish food in sight, she really is just trying to help him become more open to her affection. That fact becomes progressively apparent as Takagi show her weakness to emotions more and more towards the cute ending of the series.\\n\\n\r\nHa, looks like all poker faces can break, even the ones made outta gold. \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, I gotta say that Takagi-san was quite a relaxing and touching watch for me. I do agree with many on this review page that the minor characters were very weak. They're the characters who resemble the poor quality that I initially expected from this anime. However, I think they can be basically overlooked since there many more outstanding pros than cons: The romance between Takagi-San and Nishikata was sweet and nostalgic, the ending was great, the humour is solid. I give this anime a 7/10 only because I still enjoy animes with more complex plots/themes better (eg. Code Geass, Caligula Effect) and I put a lot of emphasize towards soundtrack quality, which is not all that great for this anime but I can't really blame it since it represents the anime's school-setting style. Despite my picky criticisms, I highly approve of this anime and would recommend it to anyone who's just looking to reflect on their childhood or just looking to relax. \\n",

One of those anime where times fly on each episode and you wouldn't even notice getting yourself surprise while reaching the end of it.\r\nAppreciate it's production, it isdone so smartly and with such a good taste. romance is taken to a high level on this one with very little happening (characters are kids). Character feelings wont be over easily display but there is no way to be mistaken at the end of the season. \\n\\n\r\nart wise is not a overdevelop style, actually is quite simple, there is no mystical views, side seen etc.  and is probably intended to... the flavor of it lies on the relationship between characters and their script\\n\\n\r\nthis could be one of the anime that will be use as romance reference in the future. simple but good. like a good meal at home instead of a fancy dish at a restaurant. enjoyable and smart \\n\\n\r\nI ended up thinking that I will re-watch this for sure",

The show would have been way better by making small 5 minutes episodes, especially since most stories are relatively disconnected or even when they are linked can be watched separately\u00a0.\\n\\n\r\n2. The repetitive humor.

There\u2019s not lots of animation to speak of which makes it difficult to rate but the few times there\u2019s a bit of action\u00a0 (characters running for instance) the animation is really choppy. Given how little there is to animate\u2026 that\u2019s not tolerable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\u00a0: 6\\n\\n\r\nCute\u2026 Fits the atmosphere but frankly I doubt the genre allows for outstanding OST overall. Points for the actor dubbing Nishikata, he\u2019s a delight to listen to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 5\\n\\n\\n\r\nI won\u2019t talk about the trio of girls because there\u2019s not much to say about them.\\n\\n\r\nTakagi-san\u00a0:  I was relatively indifferent at first but after a while to be honest she started to irritate me. Her teasing often relies on her using her female status knowing that Nishikata being the polite and sweet kid he is not gonna say this or do that. She also appears pretty bossy at times. Moreover She doesn\u2019t know when to stop. Teasing a person is only fun when you\u2019re together in the joke, when it only makes the other person uncomfortable repeatedly at that, it\u2019s time to change tactics. I don\u2019t care that you obviously like the poor fellow, I\u2019ve already mentally imagined my own fanfic in which Nishikata meets another girl and leaves you behind. That will teach you good manners. Also\u2026 I hate this power-imbalance. She calls him \u00ab\u00a0Nishikata\u00a0\u00bb, when he calls her \u00ab\u00a0Tagaki-san\u00a0\u00bb\u2026 Seriously why\u00a0? Can\u2019t you add the -kun as you should in the first place\u00a0?\\n\\n\r\nNishikata\u00a0: Complete pushover. The problem with this character is that after a while you wonder if he\u2019s really pissed by \u00ab\u00a0loosing\u00a0\u00bb every-time. Why spend so much time with a girl whose joy in life is to make you squirm I wonder\u00a0? OK I know he doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s attracted to this little witch yet but the fact that we do doesn\u2019t make this enjoyable at all. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he\u2019s obsessed with \u00ab\u00a0winning\u00a0\u00bb every single stupid contests Takagi throws his way, I would have loved that sweet little guy ( well obviously there would be no anime to speak of then). He\u2019s just so considerate. Nishikata has also a tendency to go into soliloquy and psychological turmoil for every single little thing that happens\u2026 but I guess I was the same at his age so I can\u2019t really fault him for that\u2026 But it is a bother to watch. I sighed quite a lot.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\u00a0: 4\\n\\n\r\n\u2026 Honestly I don\u2019t really know how I finished that show, especially since I cut the episodes almost every time a story ended\u2026 Even the last episode didn\u2019t afford anything on the progression front. Couldn\u2019t we at least have been given a small victory from Nishikata at the end\u00a0? Nope. Some stories were entertaining but most of them were cute but ultimately boring. I\u2019ve got to say, that it\u2019s got a lot to do with my age. I guess projecting myself into a kid with dreams to achieve and ambitions is easier than into another who\u2019s having girl or guy problems. Nostalgia could only go so far for me. As an adult, it just appears like a lot of drama over nothing but yeah, I guess you could say it\u2019s pretty realistic.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall\u00a0: 5\\n\\n\\n\r\nCan\u2019t really say this is a bad show. The only real fault I could find is the repetitiveness of the jokes\u2026 For the rest of my complains\u2026 Well.. That\u2019s the complain of a 30ish woman watching  kittens learning to play with a ball of yarn\u2026 It\u2019s all very cute but man\u2026 it\u2019s boring as hell.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Should you watch it?\r\n- If you tolerate SOL anime that are not pretentious or edgy, that may seem \"boring\" or \"simple\", and feature normal people, then you may like this anime.\r\nTL;DR: Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san falls in the category of what I like to call \"serene\", and is similar in atmosphere to Non Non Biyori. Characters are almost perfect. Solidly good show.\r\nStory: 9\r\nTo be honest there's very little to the story, however, we must assess it in slice-of-life genre that it belongs to. The story is simple, boy meets girl, girl teases boy, cue the romantic undertones.\r\nArt: 7\r\nIt's alright I guess. Nothing stunning but nothingbad either. The animation is quite nice.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nA nice, simple, mostly piano and flute based soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\\n\r\nInitially wanted to give it a 10 but got progressively annoyed by Nishikata's reactions. They're too extreme and should've been handled better. Instead of reacting outwardly with screams like he so often does, instead he should have had internal conflicts. An alternative is to use metaphorical devices such as in Nichijou, where an exaggerated reaction is obviously not part of their reality but goes to show the state of mind of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nIn Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, this is absolutely vital. The female MC seemed to be a little too stiff at times. She is almost always smiling and in a good mood. I'd love to see some more emotions from her. Even with her stiff emotional role, when other emotions do come though, it leaves a huge impact.\\n\\n\r\nThe show thrives on its characters and really needs to nail this aspect to be considered good.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nRegardless of the flaw in characterization, I still thoroughly enjoyed the show. It was not boring. I care about these characters... even about the other characters that are involved. They're all likable and their personalities are distinct. They're not over-the-top moe or unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nWhat the... I'm talking about characters again?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it's a solidly good show and deserves a strong 8 in my opinion. If it fixed up the character flaws I might've given it a 10 even with the OK art and sound.",

            "content": "I try to watch at least one romance anime per season and the lucky winner of the previous season is Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san. Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is a slice of life, romantic comedy which unfortunately doesn\u2019t manage to keep invested in the story or the characters.\r\nStory \u2013 5/10\r\nTakagi and Nishikata are both in the same middle school class and as luck would have it, they also happen to sit right next to each other, much to Takagi\u2019s amusement and Nishikata\u2019s despair. The story revolves around these two characters and the interactions between them, and other than that very little happens duringthe twelve episode run-time.\\n\\n\r\nEvery episode is divided into three parts, each of which focusing on a different keyword. These keywords are simple and are the main focus for that sections teasing. Unfortunately the teasing, which the title is so proud of, is the only form of dialogue between the two characters. To make matters worse, after the first episode the teasing starts becoming repetitive and predictable. What remains to keep us engaged in the story? Nothing is left, as all the supposed \u2018story\u2019 focuses on is the teasing. During an era of five minute short episodes, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san is the perfect anime to get a short adaptation, because the entirety of the plot has a single gimmick and sticks to that gimmick until the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi san\u2019s art is really simple, but effective. Because focus is placed on the dialogue between the two protagonists, the characters designs are well done. Both Takagi and Nishikata have extremely cute character design\u2019s which are appropriate for the series. The focus unfortunately remains on the two characters, which doesn\u2019t allow for any proper world building. I can only describe the art style of the anime as a single word: adequate.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 7/10\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately is Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san\u2019s OST as barren as its plot. One thing that kept bugging me throughout the series was the lack of background music. Sure there are one or two tracks which form part of the OST, but these were only played once or twice an episode. Where the anime manages to hit the ball out of the park, is with the opening and seven endings. All these are soothing and an absolute joy to listen to, which is mainly thanks to the fantastic vocalist and voice of Takagi, Takahashi Rie. Her gentle voice makes for some great tracks which work well with the aesthetic the show is going for. Speaking of voice actors, the most enjoyable part of the two protagonists were their voice actors Takahashi Rie (as aforementioned) and Kaji Yuki. They really managed to make the characters more enjoyable and I believe that few voice actors could accomplish the same effect. The rest of the cast all performed their roles admirably, but these two in particular were fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\\n\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi san sports a total of ten characters, five of whom are simply present. Takagi and Nishikata are the center of attention for the majority of the series. What little personality they have can be summed up as: cheerful, mischievous, witty and over-complicated. The other characters who managed to get some screen-time is the trio of friends.  Their different personalities lead to some interesting conversation and for that reason I found them the most likable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 4/10\\n\\n\r\nOther than the fantastic voice acting, sweet OP and ED, there was nothing which drew me into Karakai Jouzu no Takagi san. Neither the repetitive jokes nor the weak characters helped the fact. I might have enjoyed the series more if it had a shorter run-time and the dialogue wasn\u2019t as predicable or repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 6/10\\n\\n\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi san is an anime which sets out to make you smile and manages just that. Whether it is the innocent setting, the adorable voice acting or the sweet opening/endings, these combined elements will most definitely accomplish just that. However, if you are looking for a romcom dealing with young love and personality to boot, I suggest you look elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

            "content": "This show has a very simple premise, Nishikata gets teased by Takagi-san constantly and Nishikata wants to strike back. Although this sounds like it would get repetitive, it really does not. Here's why this show does not get old and was always putting a huge smile on my face.\r\nCharacters 10:\r\nThis is one of the categories this show THRIVES in. Nishikata is the perfect protagonist for this show. He is very shy and also adorable but is a really good person over all, but he does'nt take the spotlight in this show(which he is not suppose to). This is because Takagi-san is SO PURE AND ADORABLEAND I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO PROTECT HER. Okay, but seriously, not only is Takagi extremely adorable but she is extremely smart and always makes me bust out laughing with her new schemes to tease Nishikata. The best part about this show is the bond these two characters share. Takagi and Nishikata have some of the best chemistry I have seen in anime. I can not get enough of these two and I love them so much. Now, they aren't the only characters in this show there also these scenes ( usually shorter then Takagi and Nishikatas ones) that include Sanae, Yukari, and Mina. There scences are usually good and they do not hog up too much of Takagi and Nishikatas screen time. There is also Nishikata's friends who play there roles perfectly fine. Nishikata and Takagi are what make this show work and they make me easily give this show a 10 in this category.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8: \\n\r\nThe sound in this show will not blow your mind. But that does not mean it is average. The music fits the relaxing and happy middle school vibes of the show. The voice acting is great. Overall, the sound is very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nThe backgrounds in this show are GORGEOUS. The classroom is very detailed, and so is every place they go. This show has a very bright yet relaxing feel to it. I love the painting feeling of the backgrounds in this show. Overall, not only does it get the job done but it is great with amazing backgrounds with varied character designs that pop out of the backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10:\\n\r\nThis show is extremely enjoyable. The comedy is so pure and great. This show come up with new scenarios for Nishikata and Takagi to experience together and each episode the scenarios get better and better. This show had me with a huge smile on my face every second. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10:\\n\r\nI would reccomend this show to everyone (unless you need action in your shows or something).  This show will have you smiling left and right and you will grow attached to Nishikata and Takagi. So if you want to have a good time, watch this show. You won't regret it.\\n",

I enjoy that the anime doesn't just focus on the main duo, it also focuses on more characters, mainly Mina, Yukari, and Sanae.

            "content": "legitimately one of my favourite anime of Winter 2018\r\nSummary: Heartwarming and nostalgic, it's a gentle and funny exploration into how first love can be hard to spot and the different speeds children come to realise it.\r\nFirstly, let me address some of the minor issue I have with Karakai Jouzo no Takagi-san:\r\n. Yes, Nishikata does suffer from the, all too common, stupid Protag-kun syndrome. However, in this case, I make allowances for his age. Since I know (from personal experience) how much slower boys are at getting started in the romance game\r\n. Some people regard this anime as having a bullying theme, but I think theyare very wrong in that regard, since it is clear from the off-set that Takagi has a MAJOR crush on Nishikata and the \"teasing\" in never mean spirited, but I can see how some people might be misguided into believing this from the title and synopsis.\\n\r\n. Takagi's character design is more 'big forehead' than 'big tree'. I can see how it might be off-putting to some, but I found it endearing.\\n\\n\r\nNow, for the good stuff:\\n\r\n.The show format is broken down by chapter, which means that, while there is progress in the overall story, it is never monotonous and repetitive, especially when it is interspersed with chapters dedicated to the three girls; Mina; Yukari and Sanae. They each had their own unique characters, but Mina was, by far, my favourite as she was the quintessential tomboy. Their contribution was always lighthearted and was responsible for the best of the comedy.\\n\r\n.The romance is clear to see (to everyone except Nishikata, as you'd expect) but it is genuine, gentle and heartwarming. It gave me a great sense of nostalgia. Takagi's teasing is never mean and when her facade does occasionally slip it's really enjoyable to witness (if you like 'young love' stories, as I do).\\n\r\n. The music is another highlight, primarily due to the variety. I'm not certain, but it appears that there is an entire album's worth of ending songs in this anime, all from the artist Rie Takahashi...most surprisingly, they are all well in keeping with the lighthearted nature of this anime and I liked them all, without exception.\\n\\n\r\nWould watch again, especially as a mood booster. Left me with a similar good vibe as the anime Amaama to Inazuma.",

            "content": "Tonari no Seki-kun with the positions reversed and given a romantic edge.\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is one of those animes where it's the \"journey rather than the destination that counts\", and in this regards is Takagi's teasing. The plot is very simple of Takagi voiced by Rie Takahashi teasing Nishikata voiced by Yuki Kaji but Nishikata tries to tease her back by over-analyzing things and fails. Where the \"journey is better than the destination\" works into this is because of most of the anime comprised of these two at it with mind games in making one of them blush and as LA said before thatmost if not ALL the time Nishikata's counter-teasing fails, the results are obvious, it's HOW Takagi rounds up Nishikata is where the beauty of this anime comes into.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other minor characters who has some limelight, namely Takagi's friends Mina Hibino voiced by Konomi Kohara, Sanae Tsukimoto voiced by Yui Ogura and Yukari Amakawa voiced by M.A.O who have their own comedy skit going on and sometimes they intermingle and even contribute later to Takagi's next teasing. Yukari are the cloudcuckoolander's minder of Mina and Sanae, Mina more often with her non sequitur and spur of the moments things she wants to do while Sanae encourages Mina and gets in on the action.\\n\\n\r\nNow LA had heard both sides of the argument on whether Takagi or Nishikata are horrible characters, LA has heard that Takagi is an utter troll who gets Nishikata into trouble EVERY single time with Nishikata getting into trouble in the process, while LA has heard Nishikata is in the wrong by how he tries to HORRIBLY fail in trolling Takagi with some malicious intent. Now mind you LA doesn't see either of them as \"horrible characters\" however for LA, LA is on Nishikata's side for a \"bad character\" (which is LA's very loose definition by the way), as by all intents Takagi is mainly here for Nishikata's overreactions with her teasing and her liking Nishikata, while Nishikata tries desperately to repeat Takagi's teasing or comes up with an even more projected tease to try and embarrass Takagi and most obviously fails as Takagi has caught on already by this point and add that he's kinda dense in the romance department and him over-thinking things is a major sign he misses Takagi's real intent. So yeah LA did like Takagi as a character better however Takagi by all intents can't be \"her\" without Nishikata because without it we'd have no anime.\\n\\n\r\nWhich goes into LA's next point of the romantic edge Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san has, as Takagi mainly teases Nishikata through some romance teasing showing that she does like Nishikata and them both being adolescent kids they can't show their emotions that well most of the time thus for Takagi she uses her teasing to show that she likes Nishikata and it's shown throughout the anime that this is the case.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Shin-Ei Animation, LA thought for the most part the character designs were fine but with some decent backgrounding added as well. The animation wasn't that bad but the animation for LA lies in the character emotions shown in simple but great detail of our main duo, as we KNOW how they are feeling at the time by them not even needing to speak and LA praise that highly animation-wise, other than that, not much beyond the decent character designs and backgrounding.\\n\\n\r\nNow the voice acting, well for a rather minimalistic voice cast of 5, but the voice cast is excellent with Nishikata doing great in his overreactions and his schemes while Rie Takahashi's poker face and expert teasing vocals being masterfully done. LA hasn't heard Yui Ogura in her kuudere vocals in a while and this is also a first for LA hearing Konomi Kohara doing genki vocals as Mina in Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san. Overall the voice cast is kinda crucial to Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san thus LA would praise the voice cast as minimalistic as it is.\\n\\n\r\nKarakai Jouzu no Takagi-san is soo simple in it's execution but works out great with the good chemistry of Nishikata and Takagi as characters and their mind games of trying to tease one another being interesting enough, the minor characters of our trio Mina, Yukari and Sanae was also good additions as they had their comedic moments as well as an inadvertent hand in some of Takagi's teasing later on. The animation was decent but with an excellent voice cast, LA wouldn't have seen Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san as nothing else. Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san by all means was a good watch and seeing Takagi's lingering romantic feelings shown more and more through her teasing for Nishikata was a nice touch to how the anime progressed in this not-so repetitive romantic comedy.\\n\\n\r\n\"If you blush, you lose.\"",

            "content": "First of all, I\u2019ll let you know that I\u2019m not even that much into romance. There are some specific titles which meet specific conditions which make them \u201cepic\u201d, but those are really rare. However, I must say I relatively liked this one even if not that much; it did greatly for the romance part especially in the last few episodes so at least it didn't disappoint me as most romance do.\r\nStory\r\nIt\u2019s not that bad. Takagi obviously is in love with Nishikata and everyone is aware of that except for\u2026 You guessed it. So with Nishikata unaware of her feelings, Takagi-san continues to tease him allthe time while implicitly conveying her feelings to him little by little. Nishikata, however, is more interested in paying her back for all that teasing she puts him through. With that, every episode revolves around Nishikata trying to make her embarrassed with one way or another through those plans of his. Though, those plans are mostly what you\u2019d expect a middle schooler to come up with which makes them really cute if you ask me. We also have some occasional arcs with a trio of Nishikata\u2019s classmates which serve basically as a break of the main arc.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\r\nNot the best this season, but definitely not the worst either. The most elaborately-drawn thing in the whole anime is Takagi, honestly. It\u2019s like she was intended for a completely different anime. I know she\u2019s the main heroine and all, so she needs her own steady number of fans which make her looks matter. But to simply overlook the entire cast even the MC and make them dull in comparison isn\u2019t a wise choice either.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nExpect a lot of Nishikata noises almost all the time. And plenty of \u201cTakagi-saneee\u201d in an intimidating voice. Other than that, you won\u2019t be bothered too much. The rest of the cast have relatively calm voices, especially Takagi-san.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development\\n\r\nThe only character who develops here is basically Nishikata. As I said, Takagi continues to throw hints at him that all that\u2019s left is sticking a sign to her forehead. But don\u2019t worry, although slowly, he continues to grow more attached to her by the time and you\u2019ll be quite pleased if you\u2019re supporting their ship.\\n\r\nEntertainment\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is a light slice of life romance. The comedy is really weak if that\u2019s what you\u2019re interested in, but the rest is ok. If you can\u2019t stand being teased or have a traumatizing experience with it then I can\u2019t recommend watching this. However, if you enjoy a somewhat manipulative heroine and have good ears to withstand Nishikata\u2019s screams then you\u2019re probably in for a treat.",
