            "content": "We were expecting a football animation. Instead, we received a comedy with some interesting and funny moments. \r\nAoyama is a soccer star that suffers from a cleaning complex. He hates being touched. He needs to see everything clean. He needs to cook his food. How can a person like this be the center of the attention and one of the youth soccer stars from Japan?\r\nIn the beginning, I was waiting to see a sports anime and football matches every time. After some episodes, the football became irrelevant. The story focus on the events full of jokes and actions from the football squad and all thepersons related to it. The jokes aren't bad, sometimes are silly but are executed smartly. However, there are few moments dull.   \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are standard as we can expect from this kind of comedy. Aoyama is another guy that is good in everything that he does and sometimes is annoying. Also, he needs to clean everything. His friends are the ones that carry all the responsibility of the comedy. Without them, Aoyama could sink in boredom. Let's thank the other characters for the jokes.  Ayoma has lots of admirers, including a person that loves him. The plot mixes everything, football, manga, a love triangle, fights, challenges and maybe some stupid actions. You will laugh at the situations. You will laugh after seeing some epic moments, but after some hours you will forget the fun and will focus on other things. \\n\\n\r\nThis kind of animation is fun for the first time, but you aren't going to repeat it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the music are standard. Do not expect too much from it. It was created to fill the time. At least the art isn't like the ending of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't a big thing. It is standard, and the OST isn't that amazing but does the job, same for the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, yes you will laugh but nothing more. The show isn't a great comedy but has some fresh, hilarious moments. Do not hope to see a competitor for Captain Tsubasa because it isn't. Expect to spend some minutes laughing at the situations, but that's all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a freak (kidding) that loves sports anime, this won't be the right anime for you. If you are a soccer fan, you will get disappointed and will say \"what a waste of time.\"  \\n",

If you like sports, more specifically soccer, watch this. If you like comedy, watch this. If you like romance, watch this. If you think this is not for you, at least watch the first episode, you might be surprised. I LOVE this anime. The story was so interesting and characters were so interesting and made me laugh so many times! The sound and art was crisp and perfect. Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun is definitely one of my favorites! I think I'm actually in love withAoyama-kun, he's so adorable and cute, and he's not even trying! Overall, I had an amazing experience watching this anime and I hope there is a second season or that I can find more animes similar to this one. So, what I'm trying to say is...\\n\\n\r\nYOU. MUST.

            "content": "This anime made me feel conflicted in my feelings for it because I really enjoyed it yet had some serious gripes with it. It's hard to put everything into a good review because I'm not a reviewer, this is just a regular viewer take on it, so I'll try to be as coherent as possible. This is just what I thought of it, but somehow it didn't affect my enjoyment so please take my gripes with a grain of salt.\r\n-Spoiler Alert-\r\nI'll start off by saying that Aoyama shines as a main character. He's funny, talented, and overall a somehow very strong character without being toodetailed. The rest of the football team (minus Gotou) shine best when they're only support characters highlighting Aoyama. Their individual episodes are mediocre at best, though some of the topics handled are unique to a lot of anime I've seen, and overall they don't deserve a lot of main screen time. Heads up, I'm going to talk about Gotou like a main character because she's arguably the most enjoyable of any character. Her love for Aoyama is genuine, her anger and signature weapon is entertaining, and her ability to bring life into this anime is there. I don't think I would've liked this anime half as much without her. As well, the only time I really cared about Zaizen, who's portrayed as some sort of main character but is really only a side character, is during the last 10 minutes of the last episode. Maybe the issue with having a character like Aoyama is that most of the other teammates are useless in any sort of actual sports situation compared to him, and Zaizen is especially useless up until these last moments. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime tries to push some sort of idea that Aoyama cares about his teammates deep down by eye contact alone and that never really holds up. It's joked about that he's there for the toilets and the white uniforms only, and it really made me think at the end that was all there is to it. There are really no moments when the anime makes you think they all care about each other as friends rather than just teammates, as most everyone is very selfish in the sense that they're using Aoyama as a way to get to nationals.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the more interesting characters come from people we only see once or twice, like Ozaki. Though it really seemed like they were scrambling for filler episodes despite only having a 12 episode air schedule, which seemed like too little of an amount of time to have to flesh out the characters they already started out with.\\n\\n\r\nI had a huge gripe with the character of Odagiri, not because of any sort of \"shipping\" issue but because she seemed to be thrown in as some sort of development plot point for Aoyama that really never came to have any lasting effect. The entire time I saw her, I wasn't positive if she was supposed to be a love interest or just solely some sort of outlet for Aoyama to practice contact. If she was going to have a lasting effect, it would've made sense for them to introduce her earlier on in the anime so that we could see that change. In any case, they could've spent that wasted character time fleshing out Zaizen as a good friend, or Gotou as a solid rock for Aoyama to lean on, as both always came off as genuine and trustworthy people more so than the rest of the football team. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say much for the art or sound, as I don't know what would be good or bad, I really don't have talent on that end. If it was atrocious, I'm sure it would've been obvious to me so I guess it wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if this somehow gets a Season 2, they really have a lot of work to do, as they didn't lay a very solid foundation in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoyed it though? Somehow I was still laughing at the jokes and watching along. It's a dumb fun kind of anime, you have to be willing to enjoy it for what it is, which is a whole lot of comedic nothingness.",

            "content": "Currently, I've watched 10 episodes of this, but I can already tell that nothing I say about it will change.\r\nOkay, so I won't waste your time with a long, boring, synopsis, but I can tell you that every episode is basically the same thing:\r\n-Aoyoma is a 'model student' with a cleanliness obsession who is an amazing *soccer* player and doesn't talk much.\r\n-Either:\r\nA. He's being 'cheered on' by his obnoxious legion of fangirls\r\nB. He's being stalked by his... friends?... who go crazy and yell when they see him do something a normal person would\r\nC. He says a few words to someone who is struggling and theysuddenly have a revelation and become a better person, or find out they love him and join the stalking train\\n\\n\r\nor\\n\\n\r\nD. He's cleaning because \"wow haha that's so funny let's have him clean something every episode because it's so random and entertaining\"\\n\\n\r\n...So that's the whole thing. You don't need to watch this now. I honestly don't understand why it has such positive reviews--I suppose it's because people were so desperate to find a decent anime this season they just thought \"hey, this is nice, I'll give it a 10 because I laughed once\" and left it at that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: If you're still not sure whether to watch this or not... don't. The story is about as interesting as a piece of plain white bread. When I started watching this, I thought it would just be a decent sports anime with alright characters I could be entertained by. WRONG. The plot progresses nowhere. Well, actually, there is no plot. Each episode just contains Aoyama and some person who either loves him or hates him and they see him do a cool thing and re-evaluate their entire life and convert to his disciple. That's it. I would rather watch a plastic bag decompose than sit through that again. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say here. Art was decent, nothing memorable nor abysmal, and the animation was quite good in some scenes. However, something that ruined it a bit for me was the over-reliance of chibi scenes... at least half of every episode uses some awkwardly-moving chibi animation where some character glides along the screen and makes a noise. B o r i n g. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending were kinda catchy, but the ost was completely forgettable; the voice acting was nothing special either. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh God, where do I begin? Well, here's a list of the characters I remembered:\\n\r\n-Aoyama\\n\r\n-Angry tsundere stalker man\\n\r\n-Chubby dog-faced guy who's only shown eating\\n\r\n-Glasses guy who does keepie-uppies with his butt (and has a tragic backstory episode about it because people stopped finding it funny, boo-hoo)\\n\r\n-Quiet stalker who loves Aoyama and... something else probably, I forget\\n\r\n-Guy who aggressively gyrates and shows his abs when he gets excited\\n\r\n-???\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the worst things about this for me, aside from its appalling story (or lack of one). They're so annoying I want to rip my hair out every time they appear. More and more characters keep on getting introduced with such poor development and situations, I can't even sympathise with them. They make me so frustrated I could write an entire book about their flaws, but I fear if I keep writing about them, I'll become as angry and stupid as they are. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ugh. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An anime I initially hoped I was going to enjoy became a steaming pile of forgettable waste in less than 6 episodes. I tried to like it, I really did, but it made me feel so cynical, hopeless and bored, I had to break about 4 times each episode just to labour through it. Please don't adhere to the positive reviews because it definitely will not live up to the high expectations they set. 3/10\\n",

A clean freak playing soccer. Normally soccer leans more toward the dirty side and I really wanted to see how they pull this off, and trust me they did it really  well.\r\nThis anime is so absurd yet so funny,  and what makes this anime so good are its ART, Characters and Story. \r\nLets begin with Art, this animeis one of those, which switches to chibi every now and then and I have no complaints here. The motions are also fluid and in some part the character are like teleporting (not fluid) and its works out well. And remember the iconic doodle-ish eyes of Saitama, you will see something similar to that here ever so often. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, when I say characters I ACTUALLY MEAN CHARACTERS, NOT SOME LIFE LESS GENERIC SHITS, most of the characters (not all) have few traits and makes unique and funny and even the generic one are funny and seem to blend well. \\n\\n\r\nStory, this anime is not that story heavy. Its more focused on making you laugh (or thats what I think it is) and the sports part is also there just for the sake of making this show funny(also what i think). 4 episodes in i really dont see a serious story, nor do I think it will in later episodes.  For me I watch it for enjoyment not story. \\n\\n\r\nSo this anime is funny, has varieties of characters and is funny, and has great art style which fits the theme and makes it funny(ier), I know i said funny 3 times coz ITS LEGITIMATELY FUNNY!!! What more could you ask for?\\n",

            "content": "\"Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun\" is kinda strange show. My experience with sport shows is I had two categories: the competitive and serious one such as Haikyuu and then the non competitive (or just not focused on the competitions) comedic one such as Yuri!!! on Ice. Yes, Yuri!!! on Ice does have the main character enter a competition but the anime doesn't really focus on the competition. It focuses on the characters. Back to Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun, it doesn't fit in those two types I'm familiar with. This show was weird because it focus on comedy half of the time.\r\nBeing a comedic show with sort of plotprogression with end game objective, the story becomes fragmented with the episodes dedicated to 2 character spotlights. The show doesn't just focus on Aoyama and his sport team. We do the coach, manager, a mangaka, a basketball girl (yes, we had an episode on basketball instead of soccer), and a fellow germaphobe student. Since comedy is binary, you will have some episodes which give you laughter or not. I had my favorite characters, the manager/stalker who loves Aoyama and the judo guy. \\n\\n\r\nSince I'm not good with names and didn't bother with checking it for the review, the characters in this show might be hard to remember for those who aren't good with names like me. You will remember their quirks. \\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much the strength of the show's comedy: the wacky characters and their interactions. For sports, the show does up its animation during its few intense soccer matches. It doesn't feature as much if you wanted soccer.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakness of the show for me is it ends with a weak bang. It doesn't really entice me for a second season. It was like a one trick pony ice cream that you just wanted to taste first time and won't go back. It's a shame because I loved the show when I saw the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 for me in rating this show. I wish it went out with a bang or have some plot objective but being a comedic show, it might have killed its sport element. With a cast huge, you can barely remember all of them. You will be sure to have some favorites.",

And I'm exaggerating a little bit. But if you're a comedy lover like me, then you'll definitely get a couple laughs and have a good time.\r\nAlthough sometimes you get the impression that the anime wants to pushcertain subjects, such as romance for example, but I must admit that the art is really good and one of the top reasons why I watched it till the end. The characters are very particular and you get used to them, mainly the protagonist, who until the end (literally) doesn't lose the characteristic touch that defines him. The music in general is quite acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nI'd have liked a deeper development of the side characters, like the team goalkeeper for example. In fact, even the protagonist is left with dilemmas at the end of the series. But after all, it's comedy, what could you expect from that?

            "content": "Incredibly underrated show in what seems to be an overall lackluster season. The story doesn't really exist and none of the characters are fleshed out more than the bare minimum, but the art is surprisingly well done and comedy hits right where it needs to once the show picks up some steam. Give it 3 episodes, its actually better than you think. \r\nI believe many people might not have the best first impression of this show because of the false notion they watch it with -- thinking that this is a sports anime. Viewing this show in such a light makes the comedy and quickchibi animation jarring and out of place. However, if you go into this show knowing full well its a comedy anime with soccer players, its much more enjoyable. Please don't make the same mistake I did.\\n\\n\r\nMany others might be put off from this show by its average episode one. The first episode felt as though it was one huge set up/ exposition for the clean freak element of the titular character, Aoyama-kun. At the end of the episode it almost felt as though the clean freak joke had already run its course. I was afraid that this show would pull a Sakamoto and just play on one joke over and over again ad nauseam. I was pleasantly surprised by episode two. The towel gag had me rolling on the floor laughing. The part where half the school gathered on the soccer field to get a glimpse of Aoyama's towel was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the only shows I have rated higher than the average MAL rating. Im really looking forward to more as the season progresses. I just hope it doesn't fly under the radar.",

            "content": "\"CLEAN, CLEAN, A-O-YA-MA!\"\r\nAt first, in my previous review I had stated that Aoyama kun was a fun comedy anime which had less story in it, now, I update my statement saying that Aoyama-kun is a quintessential piece of art, comedy and character development and sound!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nIn the first 4 episodes (when I reviewed this) the story hadn't kicked off yet (pun intended) and so I'd rated it low, but once you get past the episode 4 mark you notice that even though there wasn't a big focus on story, it definitely was a ball in for me (pun!). The story moves smoothly, and doesn't muddleup multiple things at once IYKWIM, it focuses on one thing at a time which was perfect for Aoyama-kun. Not too deeply story driven, and not too shallow either, it was just right. And did I mention how satisfying that ending was?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the art. What a beauty it was. You can clearly see that effort was made into *every Character* whether you're Aoyama or Zaizen or just a random extra who has to say one line, every Character looks wonderful and *clean* (pun!). The way the backgrounds look is also another amazing feat as a lot of effort was put into that too! And so, I found no faults in the art section of the anime and so rated it as mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother 10? For sound? Yes! I rarely give an anime a full on 10 for sound (altthough I'm guilty of giving a 9 to almost every anime in the sound category), and I feel that Aoyama couldn't get any lower than 10. The VAs did an outstanding job with the voice acting. Zaizen was great, Gotou was great, Aoyama was... *clean* (repeated pun!) and so on. It'd take me a few years to point out an error or fault with the sound of Aoyama-kun. The OP and ED were an excellent and brilliant job. They was upbeat, and totally gave you the chills (in a good way). Not trying to fanboy, but these were way better than any other OP/ED in an anime. (In the sense that both were great). So far no anime I've watched has had both the OP *and* ED to such a brilliant level. You might bring up Unravel, but that was great as an opening and the ending was forgettable, which is why I put Aoyama-kun's OP+ED the top ranking for best OP+ED combination in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly the lowest focused part of the anime, the presentation of character development may make you feel that it was lacking, but after a double or focused insight, you'd realise that \"Oh yes, Aoyama-kun's character development *is* good after all!\" And that's why it got an 8 by me.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama: The main character (duh!), Aoyama doesn't just develop himself during the anime, but plays the important part of influencing and developing *other characters* as well. Which is quite the feat. Although a star player he learns and teaches others the importance of teamwork and tries his best to manage his football and germaphobe tendencies too. The reason for him playing for Fujimi was teased at multiple times (***SPOILER*** It was maybe what you expect from a germaphobe ***END SPOILER***) but the simple act or expression he makes at the end (which is common everywhere and I mean even in sad anime) totally seals the deal for me. ***SPOILERS*** That smile killed me by the way, he reached a whole new league with that glorious smile!!! So adorable!!! ^_^ ***END SPOILER***).\\n\\n\r\nZaizen: Not a main character but one who appeared the most AFAIK apart from our MC, Zaizen had the dream of getting Fujimi to the finals in the tournament and had his own motivations for it too. The rich-boy was kinda like a close friend of Aoyama and was hilarious to watch whenever he encountered the said character. He was brilliant in the last episode and ultimately got to be the center of the last episode (where his and Aoyama-kun's performance almost brought me to tears).\\n\\n\r\nGotou: Resident Shy-dere, she was afraid of talking to Aoyama at first because she thought he wouldn't remember their only encounter in their younger years (Guess what happened?) and later on works as the team manager (because anime cliches, not complaining). Her character was easily the cutest I've seen in a while from a female character (specified because I watched Tanaka kun recently and that was Sugar in it's most literal sense) and so I loved watching her how she behaved when Aoyama talked to her or when she played football (and let me tell you, without spoilers, Underestimating your opponent is the biggest mistake you could make) and so is also another important character who also got a lot of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching Aoyama-kun. It was something different and something relatable all at the same time. The comedy was amazing, the art was breathtaking, the story was simple but fun, it kinda made me think why other anime can't make something this amazing and why it's so hard to make something like Aoyama-kun. And so obviously it ranks as one of my fav shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.2\\n\\n\r\nAoyama-kun takes a 9.2 from me. It had it's great moments and I loved every but of it. If you're in it for the comedy, sports, or just wanna watch a random anime that is *good*, watch Aoyama-kun, because it's the complete package any anime could ask for. Definitely one of the most underrated anime of this year! This is one of those anime that totally deserved more attention! You'll love it! An anime of the year contender for sure!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I would've said Gotou is best girl but she's the only main girl, so... Aoyama best boy!!! <3\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S: If the folks who made this ever make a sound track album of the anime, PLEASE TELL ME, I'M WILLIHG TO PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THIS. Simply the best sound track of 2017 if not the decade.",

It's more biased toward slice of life than sports in general. If anything, I would say that it's slice of life involving soccer rather than soccer with small slice-of-life moments. \r\nBut ifyou're looking for simply another sport anime, funny (wtf) moments, fan-service, (one-sided romance), dude team-bonding, (gay-shippings), and OP character, look no further because this anime gives you all that. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime, for me, was a pretty decent one, but would have been better if they'd made it longer (wouldn't it be better if they made all anime longer?!!).

            "content": "Often times i find myself enjoying dumb but funny anime and Aoyama Kun is no exception. \r\nStory: Aoyama Kun gives off a very Sakamoto vibe (If you havent watched Sakamoto desu ga? you should really watch it), everyone loves him but he doesn't seem to need to try. The only difference is that Aoyama is a germophobe, an interesting and comedic trope that gets kinda stale by the end of the anime. However each episode isn't always centred around Aoyama which leaves open space for both people living around Aoyama and himself to grow. Unlike Sakamoto, Aoyama isn't too mysterious, his intentions aren't confusing andhis past isn't shrouded in mystery, the only mystery is his family. Aoyama isn't all fun games every episode, some episodes explore characters and give another point of view like 5 which explores one of the 3 goofball's tragic past. The anime isn't a sports anime, even though there's a lot of soccer, the main focus of the anime is Aoyama and his obsession to be clean.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Clean Freak Aoyama-Kun, is how do I say it? Clean\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is enjoyable, I often find myself sitting through the OP and ED. Especially the OP is super catchy\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character in Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama Kun is unique and no 2 characters are the same. Even the 3 goofball's are differentiated 2 of them given their own episodes. Each character is well explored but only enough so they can keep the humour in. Almost every character is likeable and even the ones who aren't, isn't obnoxiously annoying having at least some likable quality. Aoyama Kun is a very enjoyable character, however the Germaphobe thing gets pretty old by the end of the anime. However his obsession of having everything clean creates comedic potential and his ability to play soccer well alongside his germaphobe creates some very enjoyable moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama Kun is most definitely an enjoyable anime and very worth picking up for a bit of goofs and gaffs.",

So if you came here to watch something specifically about soccer, try to find something else because that is definitely not what you will get. \r\nThis anime mainly revolves around Aoyama andhis cleaning habits. All the girls love him and want him, but he is totally dense and seems to never care what they think. People either love him or they hate him but then end up joining the loving side. It's pretty great, to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nI have a good laugh every episode, and what's great is that every episode is a new story that centers around the one main topic: Aoyama. \\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those animes that you watch to have fun and laugh at, not to be taken seriously. Think of Sakamoto Desu Ga. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great comdey anime that I highly recommend if you are in need of a good smile :)",

            "content": "This was... an experience. If you're expecting a sports anime, it's probably time for you to leave, because this is definitely not what you're looking for. This was a mess-- a good mess-- but a mess nonetheless. I'm gonna unravel what happened in this series for the people who are on the fence about watching this. \r\nFirst off, I started watching this show because I saw a clip of a cute scene from around episode 8-ish on youtube, and expected the whole show to be somewhat similar. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, but it wasn't all bad either.\r\nTo begin with, the plot is a strange,strange thing. I have never played or been interested in watching soccer, so I expected to be bored. However, there is strangely little actual soccer content. While it does have some aspects of a sports anime, I think it's very little and a little inaccurate. Overall, it does a better job as an episodic comedy with a few running gags. It wasn't exactly my style of humor, but I enjoyed it somewhat still. In addition to a comedy, it's almost partially Food Wars and has a few Ouran High School Host Club-style jokes tied in. Overall, it's not a bad plot, but it's not really overarching and doesn't make a lot of sense a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nHands down, this is some of the most beautifully simple animation I've seen in a while. I watched this after watching a lot of shoujos and old anime, so maybe it impacted me more than I thought, but every character is honestly so beautiful. The backgrounds are done with great precision and everything seems pretty realistic, in all honesty, despite being anime. In addition, some of the water/sports graphics in general were honestly so well done that I rewound to watch it again. It was also one of the main reasons I wanted to watch the show in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were honestly nothing special. All of them were pretty forgettable except the closing, which was supposed to be somewhat of a parody.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series being named after him, Aoyama himself is not very interesting other than his being mysterious. He is pretty much perfect in everything. The only time we see any character in him is through his video game avatar where is isn't limited by his crippling fear of germs. Other than that, he hardly shows any real human feelings. On the other hand, some of the other characters were honestly pretty fun and unique, but none enough so that they stand out from the crowd of millions of other anime characters. Overall, pretty humdrum as far as that goes. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't bad. I'll say that upright. At the same time, in my standards, it wasn't all that good either. It was honestly pretty lukewarm. I enjoyed it enough to get through it, but I probably will never watch it again. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like perfect main characters, like sports anime bc of the hot guys, like running gags\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: are here bc you like soccer/serious sports anime, are expecting this to be about Aoyama's crippling germophobia (I mean it is, but not really dealing with the issue or getting him any help, is what I mean), like a lot of plot or character development \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

He does not like cheating, he helps his friends, he notices their efforts and encourages them, and with this he manages to unite the whole team creating an unparalleled fun!\\n\\n\r\ntalking about art, I liked it, it's quite average but since anime is more focused on comedy than soccer is understandable, the animation was above average but only at specific moments like the final 5 minutes of the matches when aoyama stay his \" very hard mode \"\\n\\n\r\nsound, the anime itself does not have many osts but the ones they had were quite iconic, the opening and ending for example are sensational, it seems until the anime is really serious\\n\\n\r\nthe characters as I mentioned above are great, they are not totally exploited at maximum but in the moments that appeared in the episode they captivate you enough making you create an attachment for their personalities\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is truly the best part of this anime, not massive to watch, always putting something to work on an episode, funny moments with iconic personalities that contributed to the comedy\\n\\n\r\nFinally ending, aoyama is a very entertaining anime, do not watch waiting for a masterpiece, watch casually that I have sure it will have fun\\n\r\ntaking all the previous points my final grade is 8/10\\n\r\nI especially recommend it for those who like comedy!",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun. This was a semi fun watch. I don't know if it's like other sports anime, but it plays out like a character driven slice of life show.\r\nThe story doesn't really matter as nothing much comes about in this show. The only information you need is the main character is named Aoyama and he is a germaphobe. The start of the show introduces him and the small cast of side characters and seems to be a comedy show revolving around the struggles of a boy not able to deal with germs. However after the firstfew episodes it switches pace.\\n\\n\r\nAfter we are introduced and are comfortable with Aoyama, they decide to give most of the prominent side characters their own episode in which they resolve some problems with the help of Aoyama. The side stories where pretty lame, and it was kind of jarring to go from the Aoyama being the main character to a side character or not even in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. Everything was smooth and pretty, and the way that they gave some characters their own style was cute. Gotou's chibi character was adorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as mentioned before were the driving force of the show. Aoyama was a fun character as a staunch germaphobe he cleans everything, wont eat food others prepare, doesn't want to be touched..etc. It was fun watching him deal with the struggles of playing soccer with that condition. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else has their own shtick but it really doesn't feel like it matters. They give some characters their own issues and episodes but nobody sticks out from the crowd, and even when they do they never become part of the show. Like what happened to abs guy, or any of the girls, or the other clean freak...etc. They introduce characters, then drop them. It's so bad that towards the end of the show a character changes their hairstyle and it took me most of the episode to realize he wasn't a new character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show. The writers wanted a comedy show and they stuck with that. There were points where you think the show might go another direction, but nope. Aoyama was a great character, and his personality isn't seen very often. Even though they shelve Aoyama several times, they bring it back around and allows you to take in the other characters. The only thing I can complain about is how bland the characters turned out to be. I mean the characters themselves have traits that allow them to stick out. How can you not remember a guy that always busts out his abs and flexes them, or a yandere-esque girls with a flower sticker bat with nails in it. However that's what makes it so sad, they are all pointless.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It's alright. Characters are a bit lame, but Aoyama is fun and pulls it all together. It's a tossup not sure if its worth recommending.",

The actual comedy isn't anything hilarious in my opinion but more serves to make everything entertaining. The main character Aoyama-kun isn't really the focal point for a lot of the show. Instead you see how the daily lives of the cast of characters surrounding Aoyama-kun are sometimes affected simply by him just existing. \r\nThere isn't really a progressing story here, its more of an episodic series which can be a negative to some. The art and animation are okay and I guess there isn't really a need forthe animation to be better when a majority of time is spent away from the football field.\\n\r\nOverall Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun is an anime I enjoyed watching from week to week but it's not a show that i could say was amazing.",

As i said i was looking for something to watch this just popped up thought there would be romance, some story but nope all i got was a mildlyfunny sports anime with almost no story.\\n\\n\r\n     Story: the only question i have here is that is there even a story to be told? Or just a guy going about his life? You might be arguing that oh what about dragon ball? What story does it have? None its basically just fighting to entertain the people. This \u201cstory\u201d is not a journey nor an actual story, it doesn\u2019t tell anything and when it does it actually has potential to do so, but all of that wasted potential on long boring episodes, in each episode i\u2019d say is pretty much the same thing no devolopment its just comedy with sports nothing else, unlike some other popular animes like naruto, tokyo ghoul, fairy tail, you might say well they just go around and find something to do so isnt that the same? In this case anime like these have adventure a sense of journey something always new, then we turn to this anime, same thing, no character devlopment, nothing really.\\n\\n\r\n     Art: The art i\u2019d say deserves an okay rating as it\u2019s quire dececent\\n\\n\r\n     Sound: Uh sorry can\u2019t really rate this, i\u2019m not a sound expert so i\u2019d just say its okay\\n\\n\r\n     Characters: the characters were quite enjoyable with some being actually unique in a way unlike some generic character let\u2019s say.\\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment: me saying that i hate this anime is a wrong term for this nor me saying that i like this anime is also wrong, i enjoyed some of the episodes most of them were just bland and boring,\\n\\n\r\n     Overall: I mean the anime is okay, it\u2019s just not for me, but if your a persom who has a sense of humour i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy this anime,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "We were expecting a football animation. Instead, we received a comedy with some interesting and funny moments. \r\nAoyama is a soccer star that suffers from a cleaning complex. He hates being touched. He needs to see everything clean. He needs to cook his food. How can a person like this be the center of the attention and one of the youth soccer stars from Japan?\r\nIn the beginning, I was waiting to see a sports anime and football matches every time. After some episodes, the football became irrelevant. The story focus on the events full of jokes and actions from the football squad and all thepersons related to it. The jokes aren't bad, sometimes are silly but are executed smartly. However, there are few moments dull.   \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are standard as we can expect from this kind of comedy. Aoyama is another guy that is good in everything that he does and sometimes is annoying. Also, he needs to clean everything. His friends are the ones that carry all the responsibility of the comedy. Without them, Aoyama could sink in boredom. Let's thank the other characters for the jokes.  Ayoma has lots of admirers, including a person that loves him. The plot mixes everything, football, manga, a love triangle, fights, challenges and maybe some stupid actions. You will laugh at the situations. You will laugh after seeing some epic moments, but after some hours you will forget the fun and will focus on other things. \\n\\n\r\nThis kind of animation is fun for the first time, but you aren't going to repeat it. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and the music are standard. Do not expect too much from it. It was created to fill the time. At least the art isn't like the ending of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound isn't a big thing. It is standard, and the OST isn't that amazing but does the job, same for the OP and ED. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, yes you will laugh but nothing more. The show isn't a great comedy but has some fresh, hilarious moments. Do not hope to see a competitor for Captain Tsubasa because it isn't. Expect to spend some minutes laughing at the situations, but that's all. \\n\\n\r\nIf you are a freak (kidding) that loves sports anime, this won't be the right anime for you. If you are a soccer fan, you will get disappointed and will say \"what a waste of time.\"  \\n",

            "content": "This anime made me feel conflicted in my feelings for it because I really enjoyed it yet had some serious gripes with it. It's hard to put everything into a good review because I'm not a reviewer, this is just a regular viewer take on it, so I'll try to be as coherent as possible. This is just what I thought of it, but somehow it didn't affect my enjoyment so please take my gripes with a grain of salt.\r\n-Spoiler Alert-\r\nI'll start off by saying that Aoyama shines as a main character. He's funny, talented, and overall a somehow very strong character without being toodetailed. The rest of the football team (minus Gotou) shine best when they're only support characters highlighting Aoyama. Their individual episodes are mediocre at best, though some of the topics handled are unique to a lot of anime I've seen, and overall they don't deserve a lot of main screen time. Heads up, I'm going to talk about Gotou like a main character because she's arguably the most enjoyable of any character. Her love for Aoyama is genuine, her anger and signature weapon is entertaining, and her ability to bring life into this anime is there. I don't think I would've liked this anime half as much without her. As well, the only time I really cared about Zaizen, who's portrayed as some sort of main character but is really only a side character, is during the last 10 minutes of the last episode. Maybe the issue with having a character like Aoyama is that most of the other teammates are useless in any sort of actual sports situation compared to him, and Zaizen is especially useless up until these last moments. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime tries to push some sort of idea that Aoyama cares about his teammates deep down by eye contact alone and that never really holds up. It's joked about that he's there for the toilets and the white uniforms only, and it really made me think at the end that was all there is to it. There are really no moments when the anime makes you think they all care about each other as friends rather than just teammates, as most everyone is very selfish in the sense that they're using Aoyama as a way to get to nationals.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the more interesting characters come from people we only see once or twice, like Ozaki. Though it really seemed like they were scrambling for filler episodes despite only having a 12 episode air schedule, which seemed like too little of an amount of time to have to flesh out the characters they already started out with.\\n\\n\r\nI had a huge gripe with the character of Odagiri, not because of any sort of \"shipping\" issue but because she seemed to be thrown in as some sort of development plot point for Aoyama that really never came to have any lasting effect. The entire time I saw her, I wasn't positive if she was supposed to be a love interest or just solely some sort of outlet for Aoyama to practice contact. If she was going to have a lasting effect, it would've made sense for them to introduce her earlier on in the anime so that we could see that change. In any case, they could've spent that wasted character time fleshing out Zaizen as a good friend, or Gotou as a solid rock for Aoyama to lean on, as both always came off as genuine and trustworthy people more so than the rest of the football team. \\n\\n\r\nI can't say much for the art or sound, as I don't know what would be good or bad, I really don't have talent on that end. If it was atrocious, I'm sure it would've been obvious to me so I guess it wasn't bad.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, if this somehow gets a Season 2, they really have a lot of work to do, as they didn't lay a very solid foundation in the first season.\\n\\n\r\nI still enjoyed it though? Somehow I was still laughing at the jokes and watching along. It's a dumb fun kind of anime, you have to be willing to enjoy it for what it is, which is a whole lot of comedic nothingness.",

            "content": "Currently, I've watched 10 episodes of this, but I can already tell that nothing I say about it will change.\r\nOkay, so I won't waste your time with a long, boring, synopsis, but I can tell you that every episode is basically the same thing:\r\n-Aoyoma is a 'model student' with a cleanliness obsession who is an amazing *soccer* player and doesn't talk much.\r\n-Either:\r\nA. He's being 'cheered on' by his obnoxious legion of fangirls\r\nB. He's being stalked by his... friends?... who go crazy and yell when they see him do something a normal person would\r\nC. He says a few words to someone who is struggling and theysuddenly have a revelation and become a better person, or find out they love him and join the stalking train\\n\\n\r\nor\\n\\n\r\nD. He's cleaning because \"wow haha that's so funny let's have him clean something every episode because it's so random and entertaining\"\\n\\n\r\n...So that's the whole thing. You don't need to watch this now. I honestly don't understand why it has such positive reviews--I suppose it's because people were so desperate to find a decent anime this season they just thought \"hey, this is nice, I'll give it a 10 because I laughed once\" and left it at that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: If you're still not sure whether to watch this or not... don't. The story is about as interesting as a piece of plain white bread. When I started watching this, I thought it would just be a decent sports anime with alright characters I could be entertained by. WRONG. The plot progresses nowhere. Well, actually, there is no plot. Each episode just contains Aoyama and some person who either loves him or hates him and they see him do a cool thing and re-evaluate their entire life and convert to his disciple. That's it. I would rather watch a plastic bag decompose than sit through that again. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nArt: Not much to say here. Art was decent, nothing memorable nor abysmal, and the animation was quite good in some scenes. However, something that ruined it a bit for me was the over-reliance of chibi scenes... at least half of every episode uses some awkwardly-moving chibi animation where some character glides along the screen and makes a noise. B o r i n g. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nSound: The opening and ending were kinda catchy, but the ost was completely forgettable; the voice acting was nothing special either. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh God, where do I begin? Well, here's a list of the characters I remembered:\\n\r\n-Aoyama\\n\r\n-Angry tsundere stalker man\\n\r\n-Chubby dog-faced guy who's only shown eating\\n\r\n-Glasses guy who does keepie-uppies with his butt (and has a tragic backstory episode about it because people stopped finding it funny, boo-hoo)\\n\r\n-Quiet stalker who loves Aoyama and... something else probably, I forget\\n\r\n-Guy who aggressively gyrates and shows his abs when he gets excited\\n\r\n-???\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are one of the worst things about this for me, aside from its appalling story (or lack of one). They're so annoying I want to rip my hair out every time they appear. More and more characters keep on getting introduced with such poor development and situations, I can't even sympathise with them. They make me so frustrated I could write an entire book about their flaws, but I fear if I keep writing about them, I'll become as angry and stupid as they are. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Ugh. 3/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: An anime I initially hoped I was going to enjoy became a steaming pile of forgettable waste in less than 6 episodes. I tried to like it, I really did, but it made me feel so cynical, hopeless and bored, I had to break about 4 times each episode just to labour through it. Please don't adhere to the positive reviews because it definitely will not live up to the high expectations they set. 3/10\\n",

A clean freak playing soccer. Normally soccer leans more toward the dirty side and I really wanted to see how they pull this off, and trust me they did it really  well.\r\nThis anime is so absurd yet so funny,  and what makes this anime so good are its ART, Characters and Story. \r\nLets begin with Art, this animeis one of those, which switches to chibi every now and then and I have no complaints here. The motions are also fluid and in some part the character are like teleporting (not fluid) and its works out well. And remember the iconic doodle-ish eyes of Saitama, you will see something similar to that here ever so often. \\n\\n\r\nMoving on to the characters, when I say characters I ACTUALLY MEAN CHARACTERS, NOT SOME LIFE LESS GENERIC SHITS, most of the characters (not all) have few traits and makes unique and funny and even the generic one are funny and seem to blend well. \\n\\n\r\nStory, this anime is not that story heavy. Its more focused on making you laugh (or thats what I think it is) and the sports part is also there just for the sake of making this show funny(also what i think). 4 episodes in i really dont see a serious story, nor do I think it will in later episodes.  For me I watch it for enjoyment not story. \\n\\n\r\nSo this anime is funny, has varieties of characters and is funny, and has great art style which fits the theme and makes it funny(ier), I know i said funny 3 times coz ITS LEGITIMATELY FUNNY!!! What more could you ask for?\\n",

            "content": "\"Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun\" is kinda strange show. My experience with sport shows is I had two categories: the competitive and serious one such as Haikyuu and then the non competitive (or just not focused on the competitions) comedic one such as Yuri!!! on Ice. Yes, Yuri!!! on Ice does have the main character enter a competition but the anime doesn't really focus on the competition. It focuses on the characters. Back to Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun, it doesn't fit in those two types I'm familiar with. This show was weird because it focus on comedy half of the time.\r\nBeing a comedic show with sort of plotprogression with end game objective, the story becomes fragmented with the episodes dedicated to 2 character spotlights. The show doesn't just focus on Aoyama and his sport team. We do the coach, manager, a mangaka, a basketball girl (yes, we had an episode on basketball instead of soccer), and a fellow germaphobe student. Since comedy is binary, you will have some episodes which give you laughter or not. I had my favorite characters, the manager/stalker who loves Aoyama and the judo guy. \\n\\n\r\nSince I'm not good with names and didn't bother with checking it for the review, the characters in this show might be hard to remember for those who aren't good with names like me. You will remember their quirks. \\n\\n\r\nThat's pretty much the strength of the show's comedy: the wacky characters and their interactions. For sports, the show does up its animation during its few intense soccer matches. It doesn't feature as much if you wanted soccer.\\n\\n\r\nThe weakness of the show for me is it ends with a weak bang. It doesn't really entice me for a second season. It was like a one trick pony ice cream that you just wanted to taste first time and won't go back. It's a shame because I loved the show when I saw the first few episodes. \\n\\n\r\n6/10 for me in rating this show. I wish it went out with a bang or have some plot objective but being a comedic show, it might have killed its sport element. With a cast huge, you can barely remember all of them. You will be sure to have some favorites.",

And I'm exaggerating a little bit. But if you're a comedy lover like me, then you'll definitely get a couple laughs and have a good time.\r\nAlthough sometimes you get the impression that the anime wants to pushcertain subjects, such as romance for example, but I must admit that the art is really good and one of the top reasons why I watched it till the end. The characters are very particular and you get used to them, mainly the protagonist, who until the end (literally) doesn't lose the characteristic touch that defines him. The music in general is quite acceptable.\\n\\n\r\nI'd have liked a deeper development of the side characters, like the team goalkeeper for example. In fact, even the protagonist is left with dilemmas at the end of the series. But after all, it's comedy, what could you expect from that? All the chapters focus on the same thing and that's what the plot is about. If you are expecting something more serious related to sport, then you need to keep looking.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I really enjoyed it.\\n\r\nAnd that's why I hesitated to rate it 6 or 7.",

The story doesn't really exist and none of the characters are fleshed out more than the bare minimum, but the art is surprisingly well done and comedy hits right where it needs to once the show picks up some steam. Give it 3 episodes, its actually better than you think. \r\nI believe many people might not have the best first impression of this show because of the false notion they watch it with -- thinking that this is a sports anime. Viewing this show in such a light makes the comedy and quickchibi animation jarring and out of place. However, if you go into this show knowing full well its a comedy anime with soccer players, its much more enjoyable. Please don't make the same mistake I did.\\n\\n\r\nMany others might be put off from this show by its average episode one. The first episode felt as though it was one huge set up/ exposition for the clean freak element of the titular character, Aoyama-kun. At the end of the episode it almost felt as though the clean freak joke had already run its course. I was afraid that this show would pull a Sakamoto and just play on one joke over and over again ad nauseam. I was pleasantly surprised by episode two. The towel gag had me rolling on the floor laughing. The part where half the school gathered on the soccer field to get a glimpse of Aoyama's towel was hilarious. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of the only shows I have rated higher than the average MAL rating.

            "content": "\"CLEAN, CLEAN, A-O-YA-MA!\"\r\nAt first, in my previous review I had stated that Aoyama kun was a fun comedy anime which had less story in it, now, I update my statement saying that Aoyama-kun is a quintessential piece of art, comedy and character development and sound!\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nIn the first 4 episodes (when I reviewed this) the story hadn't kicked off yet (pun intended) and so I'd rated it low, but once you get past the episode 4 mark you notice that even though there wasn't a big focus on story, it definitely was a ball in for me (pun!). The story moves smoothly, and doesn't muddleup multiple things at once IYKWIM, it focuses on one thing at a time which was perfect for Aoyama-kun. Not too deeply story driven, and not too shallow either, it was just right. And did I mention how satisfying that ending was?\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAh, the art. What a beauty it was. You can clearly see that effort was made into *every Character* whether you're Aoyama or Zaizen or just a random extra who has to say one line, every Character looks wonderful and *clean* (pun!). The way the backgrounds look is also another amazing feat as a lot of effort was put into that too! And so, I found no faults in the art section of the anime and so rated it as mentioned.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAnother 10? For sound? Yes! I rarely give an anime a full on 10 for sound (altthough I'm guilty of giving a 9 to almost every anime in the sound category), and I feel that Aoyama couldn't get any lower than 10. The VAs did an outstanding job with the voice acting. Zaizen was great, Gotou was great, Aoyama was... *clean* (repeated pun!) and so on. It'd take me a few years to point out an error or fault with the sound of Aoyama-kun. The OP and ED were an excellent and brilliant job. They was upbeat, and totally gave you the chills (in a good way). Not trying to fanboy, but these were way better than any other OP/ED in an anime. (In the sense that both were great). So far no anime I've watched has had both the OP *and* ED to such a brilliant level. You might bring up Unravel, but that was great as an opening and the ending was forgettable, which is why I put Aoyama-kun's OP+ED the top ranking for best OP+ED combination in all of anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly the lowest focused part of the anime, the presentation of character development may make you feel that it was lacking, but after a double or focused insight, you'd realise that \"Oh yes, Aoyama-kun's character development *is* good after all!\" And that's why it got an 8 by me.\\n\\n\r\nAoyama: The main character (duh!), Aoyama doesn't just develop himself during the anime, but plays the important part of influencing and developing *other characters* as well. Which is quite the feat. Although a star player he learns and teaches others the importance of teamwork and tries his best to manage his football and germaphobe tendencies too. The reason for him playing for Fujimi was teased at multiple times (***SPOILER*** It was maybe what you expect from a germaphobe ***END SPOILER***) but the simple act or expression he makes at the end (which is common everywhere and I mean even in sad anime) totally seals the deal for me. ***SPOILERS*** That smile killed me by the way, he reached a whole new league with that glorious smile!!! So adorable!!! ^_^ ***END SPOILER***).\\n\\n\r\nZaizen: Not a main character but one who appeared the most AFAIK apart from our MC, Zaizen had the dream of getting Fujimi to the finals in the tournament and had his own motivations for it too. The rich-boy was kinda like a close friend of Aoyama and was hilarious to watch whenever he encountered the said character. He was brilliant in the last episode and ultimately got to be the center of the last episode (where his and Aoyama-kun's performance almost brought me to tears).\\n\\n\r\nGotou: Resident Shy-dere, she was afraid of talking to Aoyama at first because she thought he wouldn't remember their only encounter in their younger years (Guess what happened?) and later on works as the team manager (because anime cliches, not complaining). Her character was easily the cutest I've seen in a while from a female character (specified because I watched Tanaka kun recently and that was Sugar in it's most literal sense) and so I loved watching her how she behaved when Aoyama talked to her or when she played football (and let me tell you, without spoilers, Underestimating your opponent is the biggest mistake you could make) and so is also another important character who also got a lot of screen time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved watching Aoyama-kun. It was something different and something relatable all at the same time. The comedy was amazing, the art was breathtaking, the story was simple but fun, it kinda made me think why other anime can't make something this amazing and why it's so hard to make something like Aoyama-kun. And so obviously it ranks as one of my fav shows out there.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.2\\n\\n\r\nAoyama-kun takes a 9.2 from me. It had it's great moments and I loved every but of it. If you're in it for the comedy, sports, or just wanna watch a random anime that is *good*, watch Aoyama-kun, because it's the complete package any anime could ask for. Definitely one of the most underrated anime of this year! This is one of those anime that totally deserved more attention! You'll love it! An anime of the year contender for sure!\\n\\n\r\nP.S: I would've said Gotou is best girl but she's the only main girl, so... Aoyama best boy!!! <3\\n\\n\r\nP.P.S: If the folks who made this ever make a sound track album of the anime, PLEASE TELL ME, I'M WILLIHG TO PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THIS. Simply the best sound track of 2017 if not the decade.",

It's more biased toward slice of life than sports in general. If anything, I would say that it's slice of life involving soccer rather than soccer with small slice-of-life moments. \r\nBut ifyou're looking for simply another sport anime, funny (wtf) moments, fan-service, (one-sided romance), dude team-bonding, (gay-shippings), and OP character, look no further because this anime gives you all that. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime, for me, was a pretty decent one, but would have been better if they'd made it longer (wouldn't it be better if they made all anime longer?!!). Anyway, I think this anime will, probably, worth your time so give it a shot!",

            "content": "Often times i find myself enjoying dumb but funny anime and Aoyama Kun is no exception. \r\nStory: Aoyama Kun gives off a very Sakamoto vibe (If you havent watched Sakamoto desu ga? you should really watch it), everyone loves him but he doesn't seem to need to try. The only difference is that Aoyama is a germophobe, an interesting and comedic trope that gets kinda stale by the end of the anime. However each episode isn't always centred around Aoyama which leaves open space for both people living around Aoyama and himself to grow. Unlike Sakamoto, Aoyama isn't too mysterious, his intentions aren't confusing andhis past isn't shrouded in mystery, the only mystery is his family. Aoyama isn't all fun games every episode, some episodes explore characters and give another point of view like 5 which explores one of the 3 goofball's tragic past. The anime isn't a sports anime, even though there's a lot of soccer, the main focus of the anime is Aoyama and his obsession to be clean.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art in Clean Freak Aoyama-Kun, is how do I say it? Clean\\n\\n\r\nSound: The soundtrack is enjoyable, I often find myself sitting through the OP and ED. Especially the OP is super catchy\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Every character in Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama Kun is unique and no 2 characters are the same. Even the 3 goofball's are differentiated 2 of them given their own episodes. Each character is well explored but only enough so they can keep the humour in. Almost every character is likeable and even the ones who aren't, isn't obnoxiously annoying having at least some likable quality. Aoyama Kun is a very enjoyable character, however the Germaphobe thing gets pretty old by the end of the anime. However his obsession of having everything clean creates comedic potential and his ability to play soccer well alongside his germaphobe creates some very enjoyable moments.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment: Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama Kun is most definitely an enjoyable anime and very worth picking up for a bit of goofs and gaffs.",

So if you came here to watch something specifically about soccer, try to find something else because that is definitely not what you will get. \r\nThis anime mainly revolves around Aoyama andhis cleaning habits. All the girls love him and want him, but he is totally dense and seems to never care what they think. People either love him or they hate him but then end up joining the loving side. It's pretty great, to be honest. \\n\\n\r\nI have a good laugh every episode, and what's great is that every episode is a new story that centers around the one main topic: Aoyama. \\n\\n\r\nIt's one of those animes that you watch to have fun and laugh at, not to be taken seriously. Think of Sakamoto Desu Ga. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, it's a great comdey anime that I highly recommend if you are in need of a good smile :)",

            "content": "This was... an experience. If you're expecting a sports anime, it's probably time for you to leave, because this is definitely not what you're looking for. This was a mess-- a good mess-- but a mess nonetheless. I'm gonna unravel what happened in this series for the people who are on the fence about watching this. \r\nFirst off, I started watching this show because I saw a clip of a cute scene from around episode 8-ish on youtube, and expected the whole show to be somewhat similar. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case, but it wasn't all bad either.\r\nTo begin with, the plot is a strange,strange thing. I have never played or been interested in watching soccer, so I expected to be bored. However, there is strangely little actual soccer content. While it does have some aspects of a sports anime, I think it's very little and a little inaccurate. Overall, it does a better job as an episodic comedy with a few running gags. It wasn't exactly my style of humor, but I enjoyed it somewhat still. In addition to a comedy, it's almost partially Food Wars and has a few Ouran High School Host Club-style jokes tied in. Overall, it's not a bad plot, but it's not really overarching and doesn't make a lot of sense a lot of the time. \\n\\n\r\nHands down, this is some of the most beautifully simple animation I've seen in a while. I watched this after watching a lot of shoujos and old anime, so maybe it impacted me more than I thought, but every character is honestly so beautiful. The backgrounds are done with great precision and everything seems pretty realistic, in all honesty, despite being anime. In addition, some of the water/sports graphics in general were honestly so well done that I rewound to watch it again. It was also one of the main reasons I wanted to watch the show in the first place. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks were honestly nothing special. All of them were pretty forgettable except the closing, which was supposed to be somewhat of a parody.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the series being named after him, Aoyama himself is not very interesting other than his being mysterious. He is pretty much perfect in everything. The only time we see any character in him is through his video game avatar where is isn't limited by his crippling fear of germs. Other than that, he hardly shows any real human feelings. On the other hand, some of the other characters were honestly pretty fun and unique, but none enough so that they stand out from the crowd of millions of other anime characters. Overall, pretty humdrum as far as that goes. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime isn't bad. I'll say that upright. At the same time, in my standards, it wasn't all that good either. It was honestly pretty lukewarm. I enjoyed it enough to get through it, but I probably will never watch it again. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this if you: like perfect main characters, like sports anime bc of the hot guys, like running gags\\n\\n\r\nI would NOT recommend this if you: are here bc you like soccer/serious sports anime, are expecting this to be about Aoyama's crippling germophobia (I mean it is, but not really dealing with the issue or getting him any help, is what I mean), like a lot of plot or character development \\n\\n\r\nHave a great day everyone!",

He does not like cheating, he helps his friends, he notices their efforts and encourages them, and with this he manages to unite the whole team creating an unparalleled fun!\\n\\n\r\ntalking about art, I liked it, it's quite average but since anime is more focused on comedy than soccer is understandable, the animation was above average but only at specific moments like the final 5 minutes of the matches when aoyama stay his \" very hard mode \"\\n\\n\r\nsound, the anime itself does not have many osts but the ones they had were quite iconic, the opening and ending for example are sensational, it seems until the anime is really serious\\n\\n\r\nthe characters as I mentioned above are great, they are not totally exploited at maximum but in the moments that appeared in the episode they captivate you enough making you create an attachment for their personalities\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is truly the best part of this anime, not massive to watch, always putting something to work on an episode, funny moments with iconic personalities that contributed to the comedy\\n\\n\r\nFinally ending, aoyama is a very entertaining anime, do not watch waiting for a masterpiece, watch casually that I have sure it will have fun\\n\r\ntaking all the previous points my final grade is 8/10\\n\r\nI especially recommend it for those who like comedy!",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun. This was a semi fun watch. I don't know if it's like other sports anime, but it plays out like a character driven slice of life show.\r\nThe story doesn't really matter as nothing much comes about in this show. The only information you need is the main character is named Aoyama and he is a germaphobe. The start of the show introduces him and the small cast of side characters and seems to be a comedy show revolving around the struggles of a boy not able to deal with germs. However after the firstfew episodes it switches pace.\\n\\n\r\nAfter we are introduced and are comfortable with Aoyama, they decide to give most of the prominent side characters their own episode in which they resolve some problems with the help of Aoyama. The side stories where pretty lame, and it was kind of jarring to go from the Aoyama being the main character to a side character or not even in some episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was great. Everything was smooth and pretty, and the way that they gave some characters their own style was cute. Gotou's chibi character was adorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters as mentioned before were the driving force of the show. Aoyama was a fun character as a staunch germaphobe he cleans everything, wont eat food others prepare, doesn't want to be touched..etc. It was fun watching him deal with the struggles of playing soccer with that condition. \\n\\n\r\nEveryone else has their own shtick but it really doesn't feel like it matters. They give some characters their own issues and episodes but nobody sticks out from the crowd, and even when they do they never become part of the show. Like what happened to abs guy, or any of the girls, or the other clean freak...etc. They introduce characters, then drop them. It's so bad that towards the end of the show a character changes their hairstyle and it took me most of the episode to realize he wasn't a new character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show. The writers wanted a comedy show and they stuck with that. There were points where you think the show might go another direction, but nope. Aoyama was a great character, and his personality isn't seen very often. Even though they shelve Aoyama several times, they bring it back around and allows you to take in the other characters. The only thing I can complain about is how bland the characters turned out to be. I mean the characters themselves have traits that allow them to stick out. How can you not remember a guy that always busts out his abs and flexes them, or a yandere-esque girls with a flower sticker bat with nails in it. However that's what makes it so sad, they are all pointless.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: It's alright. Characters are a bit lame, but Aoyama is fun and pulls it all together. It's a tossup not sure if its worth recommending.",

            "content": "Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun is mainly a comedy series with the sports elements playing a supporting role here. The actual comedy isn't anything hilarious in my opinion but more serves to make everything entertaining. The main character Aoyama-kun isn't really the focal point for a lot of the show. Instead you see how the daily lives of the cast of characters surrounding Aoyama-kun are sometimes affected simply by him just existing. \r\nThere isn't really a progressing story here, its more of an episodic series which can be a negative to some. The art and animation are okay and I guess there isn't really a need forthe animation to be better when a majority of time is spent away from the football field.\\n\r\nOverall Keppeki Danshi! Aoyama-kun is an anime I enjoyed watching from week to week but it's not a show that i could say was amazing.",

As i said i was looking for something to watch this just popped up thought there would be romance, some story but nope all i got was a mildlyfunny sports anime with almost no story.\\n\\n\r\n     Story: the only question i have here is that is there even a story to be told? Or just a guy going about his life? You might be arguing that oh what about dragon ball? What story does it have? None its basically just fighting to entertain the people. This \u201cstory\u201d is not a journey nor an actual story, it doesn\u2019t tell anything and when it does it actually has potential to do so, but all of that wasted potential on long boring episodes, in each episode i\u2019d say is pretty much the same thing no devolopment its just comedy with sports nothing else, unlike some other popular animes like naruto, tokyo ghoul, fairy tail, you might say well they just go around and find something to do so isnt that the same? In this case anime like these have adventure a sense of journey something always new, then we turn to this anime, same thing, no character devlopment, nothing really.\\n\\n\r\n     Art: The art i\u2019d say deserves an okay rating as it\u2019s quire dececent\\n\\n\r\n     Sound: Uh sorry can\u2019t really rate this, i\u2019m not a sound expert so i\u2019d just say its okay\\n\\n\r\n     Characters: the characters were quite enjoyable with some being actually unique in a way unlike some generic character let\u2019s say.\\n\\n\r\n     Enjoyment: me saying that i hate this anime is a wrong term for this nor me saying that i like this anime is also wrong, i enjoyed some of the episodes most of them were just bland and boring,\\n\\n\r\n     Overall: I mean the anime is okay, it\u2019s just not for me, but if your a persom who has a sense of humour i\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy this anime,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

I was kinda dissapointed because i thought the sport element would stand out more.Whats a good plus in the score department this anime has occasional funny scenes. The art,sound,character and enjoyment levels are fair but notgreat.\\n\r\nScore 6/10",

It'sa basic series in alot of ways, but I didn't mind it at all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and over all:   it's a far cry from a great series but at the same time I very much enjoyed it and the characters, and wouldn't mind a second season, it's at the least passable, though don't expect a huge amount of soccer, it's in there, but quiet a few episodes barly if at all focus on soccer, it's more slice of life with soccer in it.",
