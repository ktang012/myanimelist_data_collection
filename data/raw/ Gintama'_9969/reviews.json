So is Gintama, and the news of the new season were salvation to many sad Gintabros all over the globe.\r\nThat's right. The #1 show is back - and I am damn excite, son.\r\nTo any of you who haven't watched the first season, please do. but if you wouldn't want to commit yourself to a 201 episode show, feel free to just skip ahead to season two and try an episode or two. The storyline's arranged in inconsistent arcs, meaning you can pick it up from any arc- as long as you get an explanation on the origins of the different characters.\\n\\n\r\nI assume all of you know the general setting - a Samurai who lives in a modern era in which aliens are a part of our (humans) daily lives. There's an ongoing ban on swords, so being a Samurai is obviously forbidden by law.\\n\r\nThough there's no rule against a wooden sword, is there?\\n\\n\r\nIn the last year, our friendly studio Sunrise had enough time to stack up material for a long-lasting second season, while our beloved mangaka had time to improve and write arcs which without a doubt - have the Gintama effect. Holding tears in your throat, and two minutes later laughing like a maniac - only to be in tears again a few minutes later. The long touchy speeches are back, the unexpected plot turns are back, everything we longed for in this Gintama-less year, is back.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be important to specify the fact that Gintama is now well funded, and is in HD. Can you imagine seeing Gintoki pick his nose in 720p?! Insane!!!\\n\r\nThe first arc is the comeback we all wished for, every character you knew is making an appearance, though you should ready yourself for a surprise - they've all changed.\\n\\n\r\nI promise this - starting at the first 15 seconds up to the end of the 24 minutes of awesome, you'll be smiling, laughing, perhaps even crying if you're touchy. Enjoy.",

            "content": "Edit after episode 13: I cried big wet tears at the excellent storytelling and well placed character development. SUCH. BIG. TEARS.\r\nI was skeptical as hell for the return of the Gintama anime. To be honest, I went into this anime wanting to slam it as hard as possible, especially upon seeing it's overbearingly high-score. But I won't, because to be frank, I can't.\r\nI don't really think a lot of reviews, complex and heavily-illustrated need to be written about this anime to get a feel for what it's about so let me get straight to the point: It's ridiculous over-the-top comedy, plain and simple. Of courseyou can't forget the awesome stories built from these insane gags, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe scripting, the scenario, specifically the way that the anime envelops you inside - making you a returning character as well, are all ingeniously meshed together.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, after five years... brought to you in 16:9 format.\\n\\n\r\n...With even better songs than ever (hard to believe, I know).\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Gintama before, I recommend checking it out, and I know 201 episodes sounds like a grueling task, but after seeing the pilot episode for the second series, I was left more than satisfied. This episode is reason alone to watch the over two-hundred preceding it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you're familiar with Gintama and think you're ready for Gintama', let me be the first to tell you; you aren't.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I don't believe this review needs to be edited every week, as most episodes are either episodic or self-contained within an arc. If you've braved the first 201 episodes, don't miss season two.",

Not having watched this anime is like missing out on a classic movie and that means that you haven't fully lived yet. I watch an episode every night before I go to sleep so that I can sleep in pure comfort and relaxation. Watching Gintama for me is not a hobby. It is a life style. I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone who likes anime and especially comedies.",

            "content": "\"Please continue it, it gets good at around episode 57\" \r\n\"Oh, it's still not good? Well I promise it becomes a masterpiece after the first 201 episodes!\"\r\nThese were the words of a desperate Gintama fan trying to reel me into the series and hoping I would see it as the \"masterpiece\" that it is. Spoiler alert: It wasn't, it wasn't even good.\r\nI'll just go ahead and spill it out for you people: This has to be the most overrated Anime series of all time, with more than one million entries to it's name at the top of MAL, I have yet to find an Animemore overrated and hyped than this, but my search continues nonetheless. Granted this is a shonen series, so it will be popular with the masses and will gain a very large number of fanboys who will defend it to death, and give it perfect reviews, but Jesus Christ look at all these 10's sucking the show off as if it were the greatest thing ever made since sliced bread! \\n\\n\r\nThis series should have been called Kintama instead of Gintama, due to how terrible it is. Why did I give this second season a 3/10, but gave the \"vastly inferior\" first season a 6, you say? Well, little Johnny, there comes a time when a man realizes that he has went through so much bullshit, to the point where he just stops looking for the small hidden gems in that pile of bullshit, and just gives up. If I were to describe my experience with Gintama metaphorically, I would compare it to a man who works for days in a mine just to find that one little ring, I would compare it to an unhappy marriage where one of the married couple is in it for the money. You see, Johnny, Gintama has these good things about it, but it also has these bad things about it too, and the negatives are far too obvious for me to say that this deserves all the praise it gets. Gintama can be good if you force yourself to enjoy it, shut your brain off and endure the boring parts as well just to get to the good parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4\\n\\n\r\nGintama's story was never interesting to me and never hooked me in, just a bunch of filler episodes with no plot or substance, some of the episodes in the beginning were good, the vast majority weren't. I had to force myself through sixty hellish episodes for the first serious arc to show up. I've said it many times and I'll say it again, if a show takes 60 episodes to start getting interesting, then it is a failure of a show. The story during the first season was generic at best, it had these boring episodes that were 20 minutes long, but felt like a movie or a lecture, and had uninteresting side characters who magically showed up to ask our hero Gintoki for help. It also became a bit interesting and emotional at other times, with good written characters who had unique qualities about them and gained some form of character development (mostly the main villains and the Shinsengumi). The narrative was all over the place, Gintama had a serious arc that made you cry at first, but the next episode was all about poop jokes and toilet paper. I'll give the show credit for having interesting arcs, even though it had no continuity and was random. Those interesting arcs that made me cry in Gintama's first season were not present here, the funny episodes were not present here, the boring and stupid episodes were though. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of having one good episode at the very least, this season insults your intelligence by presenting you with characters who come out of nowhere and are still unfunny (insert the same lame joke used by Sarutobi about her love for Gintoki, or Zur- I mean Katsura saying \"Zura ja nai, Katsura da\" for the millionth time), gags that did not make me laugh one bit (Oh no, another lame DBZ parody) and villains that were laughable at best (Insert loser ninjas who wanted to kill Sarutobi and lame empress who wanted to take over Gintoki's town). With the first season, the parodies were actually funny at times, since they were actually well made and had a good premise and buildup to begin with. An example of this would be Gintama episode 119, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series, and it managed to do a DBZ parody the right way. This season also had no good serious arcs, villains just show up and then are magically beaten by our annoying mary sue MC and his very annoying sidekick (you know which sidekick I am talking about). Characters are shown to die, but are healthy and alive, standing atop of buildings the next day! Wow! Gintama might as well insert the Dragon Balls into the show as an explanation for this amazing plot armor, that would actually make sense and would be funny. The story is just uninteresting, cheesy and another generic shonen at this point, the only difference is that filler is said to be canon here. Nobody dies, heroes win in the end and the plot moves at a very slow pace. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art became more detailed this time, and the quality improved over the previous season, but you can only go up when you are already at rock bottom. Some of Gintama's characters look stupid, Shinpachi is an example of looking boring and bland with nothing interesting about him. Shinpachi's sister, Shimura Tae, is a carbon copy of Shinpachi but with no glasses and with taller hair (Gintama even makes a joke about this, most characters are based off of Shinpachi's bland design). I gave the art a 6 because some of the characters had good designs (My lovely Kagura, Kondo, Hijikata and Sugo). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\\n\r\nThere are really well written characters in Gintama, and then there are the one dimensional annoying pieces of filth in Gintama. The good ones I already mentioned countless times above in this review, the Shinsengumi. The Shinsengumi are the ones who made me endure more than 200 episodes of this show. Hijikata was funny in every gag he was in (2 of my favorite episodes involved the guy), his backstory and his development were brilliant, and his shining moments were fun to watch. Sugo was amazing as well, his character was by far the most developed in the whole show, his backstory was emotional and made me cry, and he had his bad-ass moments too. These characters did not only feel real, three dimensional and brilliant, but they also had an interesting chemistry between them, seeing them interact with each other was the best part of this show. Kondo was also a good and interesting character, though he did become annoying at times. Ito and Housen were one dimensional villains at first, but slowly became more developed as their arcs went on, and their goals and ideals started to make more sense by the time their arcs concluded. Kagura by far has the best backstory of the bunch, and episodes involving her were so sweet to watch, her relationship with others, and the contrast she has with her brother made me want to see them meet and interact (Unfortunately, I dropped the show, sorry Kagura). Gintoki is a good character, having him be a grown up loser was interesting to see when all you find in shonen are these optimistic happy go lucky young protagonists, though the fact that he can beat any character through plot armor annoys me. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, these were all the good characters. Now unto the awful ones. Shinpachi, this guy is so bad to the point where even some fans don't like him, he has to be the most annoying character I have ever seen in all of Anime. If he is not screaming in your ears every 5 seconds, or explaining the joke to you and ruining it in the process, be certain that he is doing another equally annoying thing to piss you off. Shinpachi is a creepy character and a big hypocrite, he has this fan club where him and his Otaku followers obsess over a pop singer called Otsu, he tells his followers that they should not love any other girl, instead their love should be devoted to this pop singer, who will not even look them in the eyes. Shinpachi is not only satisfied with being a creepy weirdo as we can see, he also goes next level and becomes infuriating when he beats up his Otaku followers for having normal relationships with other females. He's also a hypocrite because he does the same shit, yet nobody beats him up. \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, but it's a just a gag and it's funnay!!!\" - Random Gintama fan who thinks poop jokes are funny. Listen, if you think that being a creep and an asshole who beats up others is comedy, then I just feel sorry for you. \\n\\n\r\nKatsura is a character who can be funny and unpredictable at times (Episode 110), but he's sort of one dimensional as a whole. His entire character is not developed in the first 201 episodes of the show, so I just gave up on him becoming an actual developed character. Instead, he became predictable. Whenever Katsura shows up, all he does is say his iconic phrase, call Kagura boss, do something stupid and place bombs on the Shinsengumi. This is what his entire character boils down to. I want to like Katsura as I have found moments where he's shown actual development, and episodes where he's made me die laughing, but until now he's not a good character. I dropped this second season at around episode 21, and Katsura still had not developed by then.\\n\\n\r\nSarutobi is also a character who is committed to one unfunny gag, predictable. Tsukuyo is introduced for fanservice and for the shippers to ship her with Gintoki, I find her to be more annoying that Otae, that's an accomplishment in itself. Otae is a bully, though her relationship with Kyubei was certainly executed well, and she had a bit of depth and some funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nHad some interesting arcs, good characters and funny episodes. Also had boring arcs, annoying characters and unfunny episodes. My enjoyment was a 5. Whenever Gintama surprised me with three or five good episodes, and I finally was beginning to think that the show was starting to become consistently good, it came back to punch me with three or five terrible episodes. Whenever it surprised me with a well made, exciting and tear jerking arc, it came back to disappoint me with a boring arc I had no interest in. A show that is good for only half of it's entirety, does not deserve the praise it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3\\n\\n\r\nThis season was bad, I thought maybe Gintama's second season would develop some characters or have a death or two, maybe avoid plot armor and become a bit more well written? The writer instead kept writing generic arcs with bad villains instead of good ones this time. And no I'm not going to watch more episodes for it to become \"good\"",

[Mata Itsuka] [See you Again Someday!].\r\nGintama' is not the end of the Gintama Anime.\r\n[ REVIEW ]\r\nDONDAKEEEE!!\r\nGintama' is a series that, without doubt, captures almost every important essence of Anime (Comedy, Action, Drama, etc.) all within one show.\r\nWhile it may be true that Gintama is mainly focused on the comedy aspect, the series is able to embody many action scenes, especially in the Arcs, as well as drama and sadness.\r\nContrary to popular belief, many don't want to start watching Gintama either because the series is too long, too 'overrated' in their eyes, or just does not pique their interest. However, when you actually getaround to giving the series a chance, you will not be disappointed, and you will definitely be hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second airing of the Gintama Anime proves to be as enjoyable as the first one. Despite being shorter (51 episodes), Gintama' managed to pull off arcs filled with action, hilarious comedy, and more lovable characters (Such as Jugem-Jugem!)\\n\\n\r\nThe second season also has a more improved animation style and a widescreen showing, unlike the first one. This is a definite plus for the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really tough to describe Gintama in a review. So, if you're sitting down reading this one, I only have one thing to say: GO watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, don't forget, this is not the end. Gintama will definitely come back one day.",

            "content": "its nearly one year since the second season of Gintama has started and the loyal fans can remember the Joy and the life it gave us back then when it was aired again.the story that once was supposed to be about an school for demon dispellers and then about the Shinsengumi finally turned into something bizzare called Gintama which u can say is the Golden Work of Hideaki Sorachi.\r\nthe beginning of the second season is a perfect example of a great parody episode with updated jokes about famous Mangas which will make you burst into laugh if you only know about the parodies.although i amnot suggesting to start this anime without watching the first season.but that's not the first thing that will get your attention.that would be Opening and later the Ending.yeah they are catchy and Gintama-like and thats a Plus for me.the rest is your regular Gintama.normal funny episodes with some serious arcs between them that focuses on the main story.well some say Gintama doesn't have a main story but i disagree.the first serious arc focuses on Gintoki's Mother Figure character aka Otose and her background story which introduce a monster that was in love with Otose.as a final touch for this arc we have the Takasugi group and their progress as well as the new Kamui and Takasugi alliance which can be a real threat for Gintoki since Kamui is like the Second King of the Night and Gintoki  had to gang the first one up to defeat him.this arc is filled with emotional scenes and a lot of characters from the previous season which is a good way to start the news season.the later serious and important arc is a Thorny arc about the beloved Shinsengumi with a new semi cool villain that uses a combo of Sword and Gun.oh and lets not forget the cool collaboration of GintamaxSketdance which is created by Sorachi\u2019s previous assistant and have the same theme as Gintama.this episode also used the chance to parody the latest collaboration between Onepiece and Toriko.all and all unlike the first season this one starts pretty good since it is already shaped before and the timing was good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Gintama  Have many chances for development even in normal comical episodes because of Gintama\u2019s bizzare storyline.you can almost see most of the important characters in normal episodes.although they are just there for the sake of the comedy they are adding features to their own characters or at the very least sometimes they make them selves look cool which in results give them more fans.but since they have these chances often and all of em have potential  its still a shame that they couldn\u2019t use them better.(except for those that won\u2019t show up for a long time even though they could).thats why although all the characters in Gintama are likeable pretty much the only one that most of us can call special is either Kagura or Gintoki himself (sorry to other character\u2019s fans.i am a Kamui and Tsuki fan myself but if I have to make a list of top favorite characters they won\u2019t be in the top 10\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nas i said before the first thing you will notice about this season is the music.the ost used in the first serious arcs is a great piece of work and i love how they make special soundtracks for each serious arc.the voice actors in this anime are experienced and well known ppl that we all have good memories from them with previous characters they voiced which you may find this as one of the Gintama Jokes like how Toshiro uses the catch phrase of \u201cLet\u2019s Party\u201d which belongs to another character also voiced by the same voice actor.although some of the voice actors didn\u2019t had any real challenge or opportunity to show themselves in my opinion Gintoki\u2019s Voice actor didn\u2019t do as good as the first season and he seemed more lively to me in the first season but still he did great and professional  job and its just an expectation I had from him based on his previous works.\\n\\n\r\nas for the animation you can say the budget is saved for serious arc or battle scenes like the graveyard scene but still its better than the first season so it\u2019s a plus for the fans of the previous one.the art is still as good as always with little improvement and its easy on the eyes \\n\\n\r\nas for the score I will give it a 9.5 from 10 but will round it to 10/10 in here.all and all Gintama is a bizzare anime that managed to catches this bizzareness from manga pretty good and i think the animators and the studio did a great job and gave life and color to the manga with each episode.\\n\r\nits a shame that the series is coming to an end again but in my opinion its better this way since they finished it like a boss without filling it with fillers and will probably come back like a boss as well.\\n",

            "content": "I finished season 1 of gintama already and i got to admit it was the best thing i ever watched in the anime industry, this is the only anime that will keep me waiting patiently(well i did crack sometimes) for the next episode,then when it finally ended i there was a hole in my heart a deep black hole that was mended with other animes that i watched until now and when they finally announced a second season, i was like 'Praise the lord...... for making a season 2' waiting for its first release was the most horrible Time ever(seriously).Now that 'waiting' feeling came backand i'm still patiently waiting for the next episode to release.\\n\\n\r\nTo me Gintama is (one) the only worthy anime to deserve a full ranking of all aspects maxed out to a 10!\\n\\n\r\nNow that's done,I'll move one to the review, The first episode was unlike any other, It left a very good impression on me to keep waiting for the next episode and very happy about the new 16:9 aspect ratio. Either way the first couple of episodes were fillers that have extreme amounts of comedy(i couldn't stop laughing to the point my stomach hurts). \\n\\n\r\nStory:Perfect 10\\n\r\nThe story follows the some basic plot and story line which is Heavy,heartfelt,groundbreaking,thrilling of disastrous proportions then 3~5/6(sometimes more) episodes of fanservice and comedy *Usually with new, very interesting characters. and despite being PG-13 it does show a lot of sexual reference in a very comedic way but still watchable to children if controlled.In the fanservice part Characters are usually seen breaking the fourth wall.\\n\\n\r\nArt:Perfect 10 \\n\r\nI don't care what anybody says but if you compare the art from the previous season to this one its like comparing heaven and earth,or having a harem of 5 super cute girls and sitting on your seat in front of the computer(*if you know what i mean :|), if you don't understand, well the art is just amazing, it's like candy to my eyes^^.\\n\\n\r\nSound:Perfect 10'\\n\r\nFor starters all three opening & ending music was awesome really nice to hear, sometimes I even got caught singing in class(ugh..never wanna go through that again...),Sound effects in the show were very well produced and synthesized and fits perfectly to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nAhh,Time for my favorite part...\\n\r\nCharacters:perfect 10(would have given an 11 if it was possible.\\n\r\nMost of them are my all time favorites, All characters have very interesting backgrounds and hidden stories behind them which still keeps bugging me, Every one of them makes me laugh even the very evil ones(for some reason),Each one of them are very good at something except for MADAO((ma)ru de (da)me na (o)ssan: good-for-nothing old man and many more http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=madao),Gin with his silver hair and carefree attitude,Sougo with this sadistic smile, all gave me a reason to keep on going with my life. They are all really funny and extremely powerful when provoked, and for some reason most girls in the show*including new ones* are shown to have feelings for Gin but not sure them selves this makes a perfect semi-harem plot when it comes to fanservice :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10!!!\\n\r\nReally enjoyed the series, like i said the best anime to me ever released in the anime industry(well to me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10~\\n\r\nIt was very Fun,exciting, splendid,amazing,fantastic,mouth(brain)watering, humorous etc. all of this words fit into this anime.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this series and i would recommend this anime to people who like deep plot with some fanservice in the middle with the main aspect of comedy involved.\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys and sorry it's too long it's my first review^^",

            "content": "So as I was watching the first Gintama Series and about half way through I got sad and almost broke down into tears. Why? Because this is probably one of the Greatest Anime's ever made and I was terrified that it was coming to an end. But as to my good fortune before I was completely forsaken and gave up on living I caught wind of a season two and received the strength to carry on. The story of Gintama is full of unexpected twists and turns that always keep you guessing. The characters are hilarious and at times the fight scenes show a lotof depth and even be compared to anime's like Dragonball Z or even Bleach. Overall, this anime is one of the best anime's ever released in my opinion, and since this is the continuation for the original series, I have a lot of hope for this as well.",

It has consistently maintained a fresh feel, despite airing over 200 episodes. Some humor requires some background understanding or investigation of Japanese culture to be truly appreciated however. Often breaks down the fourth wall.  Easily my favorite anime.\r\nHighs: Animation assists humor, likeable characters, humor is punctuated by enough story to create direction, Japan's \"Family Guy\"\r\nLows: Length of series makes it increasingly difficult to be innovative with humor",

            "content": "What makes an anime great?  \r\n*Action\r\n*Comedy\r\n*Drama\r\nAnd what anime has it all? Gintama!\r\n At first I was a little bit reluctant to watch this anime because of its different art style, (because then I used to judge an anime mainly on it's art style). But now, I can tell you I'm heaps glad that I entered the World of Gintama.\r\n  When Gintama ended I lost a week's worth of laughing, the end did seem a bit sudden- after searching up billions of blogs and \"YAHOO ANSWERS\" did I find out it would be continued. Boy was I glad.\r\n   Now lets get tothe point:\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9.9\\n\r\n Before you bring out your swords, lightsabers or sharp objects and kill me- hear my explanation. One of Gintama's previous flaws was that its plot wandered a bit- but Gintama kept hold of its fans by using arcs and interesting battle scenes- not to forget, Comedy. The continuation by the looks of the episodes, the creators have strengthened the plot, with a good plot, funny and loveable characters- with the most amazing action scenes- Gintama will always be a hit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\n   I know I did complain about the art style a little at first but now I'm completely used to it. The exaggeration of some expressions, the flow of animation and not once were the character's proportioned weird. Despite how many characters there are, they have managed to keep the good quality throughout the episodes. Very pleased. They are now in high quality, which just makes the lineart and animation feel and look much more smoother. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n   Gintama always had the best sound tracks, the OPS- EDS, background music and voice actors. The OPS would always make you wanna copy the character's actions, the EDS are soothing and the background music is perfect, it fits the scene and during fights- the music makes my blood pump faster. Voice actors, Gintama chose some very special voices to play the roles of our most liked characters.\\n\\n\r\nGintoki Sakata's voice actor Sugita, Tomokazu (voice acted these charas: Gintoki, Kyon, Hoshi, and Mayama) Of course, he may not have voice acted some of the most well-known characters, but Gintoki has definitely made him become a legend.\\n\\n\r\nKagura's voice actor (Kugimiya, Rie) At first I was surprised to find out this was her voice, after all- she was a \"Tsundere Queen\" I could recognize her voice when she's a Tsundere (e.g- Shana, Louise or Astarotte.)  but for once- she isn't! \\n\\n\r\nShinpachi's Voice actor (Sakaguchi, Daisuke) I could not even tell that he voice acted for Sunohara (Clannad) Or Jacuzzi (Bacanno!) It just amazes me how he can almost change voice for every character, a special addition to Gintama!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\n Gintama is one of the most non-stereotypical anime out there with the most widest, loveable variety of characters. Gintama does a great thing: \"It makes the villains likeable\" not only that, each character has a very unique personality which makes the anime stand out even more. Gintama is more of a Character-driven anime- as the plot has a few loose ends. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n A good anime should be able to make you laugh when it wants to, make you cry when it wants you to, make you feel angry when it wants you to, and Gintama does all of that. \\n\r\n It's the best in comedy, the best in action, the best in drama.\\n\r\n We all welcome back Gintama!",

            "content": "~~ENGLISH & SPANISH REVIEW~~ [7,3/10]\r\nThe reasons why Gintama is so beloved are perfectly understandable, but they end up being a double-edged sword that does not allow the series or its followers to notice their mistakes. In a world full of comedy, breaks of the fourth wall, parodies, absurdity, drama and action is this sequel to Gintama, which in this case adds an apostrophe to his name.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nGintama 'is very similar in formula to its previous series, much of the series is comedy and another is composed of serious bows that leave a good taste in your mouth. But when I say that Gintama is notas good as they say, it is not because of the comedy or the parodies themselves, they are certain errors of comedy that ruin the seriousness of their world. And precisely one of those big mistakes is the unbridled breakage of the fourth wall. Breaking the fourth wall is a classic resource that as long as it is used in its proper measure and in an intelligent way (Example, when Hitagi tells Koyomi that his seiyuu is very good) it turns out quite well as a contribution. But in Gintama this does not happen, the use of the fourth wall is not very creative and the problem of this is that it takes you many times out of the seriousness of the world and therefore goes on to carry the construction that the same series has been counterproductive. The problem also of the fourth wall is that it is used too much, and every time they say, in the last episode this, in this anime this other, and makes us think that really we are not facing something serious, and although the anime has a lot of comedy, it ends being totally harmful for the seriousness of its serious bows like that of Yoshiwara, or in this case that of the 4 Devas of Kabuki. On the other hand, the comedy is creative in turn and uses its jokes well and its serious bows develop their characters well and end up shaping the plot and vice versa to give something interesting, such as knowing the organization of the society of the District Kabuki Despite good aspects, what I said before is a fact and the plot ends up being good.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn this series the art is taken more seriously than in the previous one, since they use different colored palettes for the atmosphere they want to give, and using the use of black and white to focus a color or nothing helps the drama of the series, There is still room for improvement but a good job was done in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Gintama 'is not that it is characterized by being memorable, it has good melodies and used at right times, but it is not that most of it is like that and sometimes it happens without having a clear presence to complement a feeling and in others .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nGintama's characters are good, just like in the last series. But the problem is that in this series their characters have less development, and it is not even in Gintama ': Enchousen which is an epilogue to this series where they develop more. Honorary mention to the Shinsengumi that is structured better and to the characters of Kabuki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10 = 7/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nLas razones por las cual Gintama es tan querido son perfectamente comprensibles, pero terminan siendo un arma de doble filo que no permite a la serie o sus seguidores notar sus errores. En un mundo lleno de comedia, roturas de la cuarta pared, parodias, absurdo, drama y acci\u00f3n se encuentra esta secuela de Gintama, que en este caso suma un ap\u00f3strofe a su nombre.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGintama' es muy parecido en formula a su anterior serie, gran parte de la serie es comedia y otra se compone de arcos serios que te dejan un buen sabor de boca. Pero cuando digo que Gintama no es tan buena como dicen, no es por la comedia o las parodias en s\u00ed, son ciertos errores de la comedia que arruinan la seriedad de su mundo. Y precisamente uno de esos grandes errores es la desenfrenada rotura de la cuarta pared. Romper la cuarta pared es un recurso cl\u00e1sico que mientras sea usado en su justa medida y de una forma inteligente (Ejemplo, cuando Hitagi le dice a Koyomi que su seiyuu es muy buena) resulta bastante bien como aporte. Pero en Gintama esto no pasa, el uso de la cuarta pared no es muy creativo y el problema de esto es que te saca muchas veces de la seriedad del mundo y por ende pasa a llevar la construcci\u00f3n que la misma serie lleva siendo contraproducente. El problema tambi\u00e9n de la cuarta pared es que se usa demasiado, y a cada rato dicen, en el episodio pasado esto, en este anime esto otro, y hace pensar que realmente no estamos ante algo serio, y aunque el anime tenga mucha comedia, termina siendo totalmente da\u00f1ino para la seriedad de sus arcos serios como el de Yoshiwara, o bien en este caso la de los 4 Devas de Kabuki. Por otra parte, la comedia es creativa a su vez y usa bien sus chistes y sus arcos serios desarrollan bien sus personajes y terminan moldeando la trama y viceversa para dar en algo interesante, como por ejemplo al saber de la organizaci\u00f3n de la sociedad del Distrito Kabuki. A pesar de buenos aspectos, lo que dije antes es un hecho y la trama termina siendo buena.\\n\\n\r\nArte (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEn esta serie se toman el arte mas en serio que en la anterior, ya que utilizan diferentes paletas de coloreado para la atm\u00f3sfera que quieren dar, y usar el uso del blanco y negro para enfocar un color o nada ayuda al drama de la serie, a\u00fan queda por mejorar pero se hizo un buen trabajo al respecto.\\n\\n\r\nSonido (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nEl sonido de Gintama' no es que se caracterice por ser memorable, tiene buenas melod\u00edas y usadas en momentos correctos, pero no es que la mayor\u00eda sea as\u00ed y pasa a veces sin tener una presencia clara para complementarse a un sentimiento y en otras al contrario.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nLos personajes de Gintama' son buenos, al igual que en la serie pasada. Pero el problema es que en esta serie sus personajes tienen menos desarrollo, y no es hasta en Gintama': Enchousen que es un ep\u00edlogo a esta serie donde se desarrollan mas. Menci\u00f3n honoraria al Shinsengumi que se estructura mejor y a los personajes de Kabuki.\\n\\n\r\nDisfrute (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 7,3/10 = 7/10",

But I'll do my best.\r\nStory-10: I think overall Gintama has a pretty good story with comedy, action, to drama and I always have that feeling of satisfaction in every episode .Gintama Season 2 never really gets me bored. I find the comedy in season 2 better than the first somehow. I literally cried out of laughter. The serious arcs were also pretty epic and has a beautiful story to it. So i give it a 10\r\nArt-9: Not much really change in art. It's much more high quality though but Ithink that its best for Gintama. The art style on the fight scenes also improved alot. And the facial expressions on the Characters are alot more funnier than it used to.  \\n\\n\r\nSound-9: The music in Gintama' is pretty epic. The OPs and EDs are awsome. And I really enjoy the background music in every episode and it really gives life and the mood of the scene.Still  I give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10: Characters in Season 2 is still awsome as they were in season 1. With new characters showing that makes Gintama even more awsome. Definitely a 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: Hell yeah it was awsome! In Gintama, every episode is epic to the core. It's really fun to watch, especially the serious arcs. All in all I give it a 10. If it's possible maybe an 11, but that's just me. :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10: Gintama is fun anime that I really. Each episode is worth it. And the comedy killed me. And the fight scenes are very epic and badass. \\n\\n",

It's that good. after watching The first Series Gintama I moved on to this show which is now in HD btw. From its amazing comedy and complex characters to its awesome fight scenes Gintama can make anyones mood turn to complete happiness. If your on the fence about it because maybe you don't like long series try a few episodes out and it doesnt matter where either start at episode 1 or check out episode 30 every episode is enjoyable and asthe series goes on you think there is no way it can be funnier but it always does time after time. The art is good and music as well, the voice actors for example Kagura have a very unique accent and its just great adding to the shows originality. While I do say this anime is for just about everyone I will tell you now this anime has no romance so if thats what you're looking for Gintama isn't it but... You should probably know that...  Overall I have seen all of the first series and a large portion of Gintama' and it is my favorite anime of all time for enjoyment so keep in mind this anime should be watched with your brain off.",

Anyway, I would not write it. Even some people say that this anime is --- whatever, but setting aside those jokes you would see that this anime is really unique. Even if some of the episodes are not really connected or not in the series it is woven neatly. \r\nI really likethe opening and closing song of Gintama. Maybe, we have the same taste of music. When you watch Gintama the remarkable would be the seiyuu. I love how the seiyuu of Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura portrays or give life to the character. I like how the seiyuu of Gintoki energetic voice the word troublesome in Japanese. Even when reading the manga it echoes in my ear. I just want to give them a round of applause because this is the first time I appreciate the seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to character I like the stupidness of the characters.

            "content": "Gintama is the most hilarious series I\u2019ve ever seen in my more than a decade of watching animes and reading mangas. It is number one on my top lists of best animes in comedy and in the top ten on my hundred lists of best animes in the history of anime world. So when I learned that they are coming back, I was more than delighted, I was so thankful for the whole production who decided to bring them back.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nFirst, I strongly believe that you wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate this to the extent if you haven\u2019t watched theprevious one. Let me also just mention that the last episode of the previous one didn\u2019t felt like it was the ending and so this new anime adaptation is really like a continuation. And the very first episode is really a blast, a very appropriate opening episode for this amazing series. The jokes, comical acts, and most especially the parodies are more hilarious than ever. Not that I didn\u2019t love the hilarious lines from the previous one but this time it is polish even more. Not only they are making parodies about several other famous series but this time they are doing some international TV series as well which are extremely hilarious. The arcs are even better and a lot more exciting and interesting. As much as I love how the different arcs from the previous one was made but the truth is, there were a lot of moments that it became so dramatic and too clich\u00e9. The lines were also too damn cheesy when they were trying to make it cool but instead it became so mushy and cheesy. But to my surprise and delight, this time the arcs improve a lot and when I say a lot as in drastically. The drama is more expressed in a way that it is no longer over the top. It is a lot more clean and very much touching. Even the dialogues or lines are nicer; it is delivered so well that it really brings out the coolness of the words and the characters who are delivering them. It is also so amazing how the serious lines are well incorporated with hilarious lines. It makes the lines even greater. Until now, it is still bewildering yet very much amazing how the mangaka is able to create such jokes and parodies. Sometimes, it is just insane how he is able to that because there are even jokes and parodies that you wouldn\u2019t normally think would be funny at all. But for the mangaka, he can even make the smallest things and most ordinary in our everyday life so hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nLike I said, you wouldn\u2019t understand this if you haven\u2019t watched the first one. That also goes with the characters. In the previous series, even for a very long airing time or many episodes, there were very few characters whose backgrounds were expressed enough. I guess, the protagonists and main characters were the only ones who had revelations about their pasts. In fact, even for them it was still not enough or not everything about them was known. So I am very grateful that this time, even the supporting characters\u2019 backgrounds are being revealed. The characters are made even cooler and a lot more amazing most especially Gin-chan who I love more and more. Not that I didn\u2019t love his character from the previous series but you could say his character is even more polished. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t know how to express it enough but for some reasons the animation is definitely even better. It gives off a feeling of watching an anime film. Let\u2019s not forget how the fight scenes improve a lot as well. Even for a comedy type of series, Gintama has one of the best fight scenes in the anime world and you could even compare it to some famous action series of today. And in this new adaptation, it is just brilliant. It could even be compared with a film. It is very detailed which brings out the amazing movements of the characters while fighting. Even the sounds are greater than ever. It gives the whole thing a complete package. The amazing music gives the final touch to the series.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, there are tons of improvements and almost every element is polish. Not that I don\u2019t love as much the previous one but I will admit that there were really space for improvements. I could definitely say that this time, Gintama is at its best so far. I was really sad when they\u2019ve decided to end the series because this series is one of the very few which I genuinely want to continue watching in anime adaptation. To be honest, I just want it to continue even for so many years. Even when the time comes when I am too old to move much, I would want to still watch this magnificent series. NO ONE DO PARODIES LIKE GINTAMA DOES.\\n",

Not only that, but they do quote things that have to do with life, which when you look at, is true. This anime is random. It's filled with action, comedy, drama, bits of horror, and lots of copy right mentioned titles you might recognize! The characters areperfect in many aspects as well. Unique in their own way, but together, they make up the perfect team. A slacker of a leader, a monster of a girl, and Four-eyes. I wouldn't say it's for everyone. Gintama isn't concentrated on one genre, rather, it's mixed with everything.\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's hard to say, but there's enough arcs to explain the placement of the story.\\n\r\nArt: Not the best, not the worst, but just right.\\n\r\nSound: everything's fine. No blotching.\\n\r\nCharacters: every character is unique, but they're all trolls.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: not really for all serious purpose.\\n\r\nOverall: Funny, action-packed, life quotes, great!",

So is Gintama, and the news of the new season were salvation to many sad Gintabros all over the globe.\r\nThat's right. The #1 show is back - and I am damn excite, son.\r\nTo any of you who haven't watched the first season, please do. but if you wouldn't want to commit yourself to a 201 episode show, feel free to just skip ahead to season two and try an episode or two. The storyline's arranged in inconsistent arcs, meaning you can pick it up from any arc- as long as you get an explanation on the origins of the different characters.\\n\\n\r\nI assume all of you know the general setting - a Samurai who lives in a modern era in which aliens are a part of our (humans) daily lives. There's an ongoing ban on swords, so being a Samurai is obviously forbidden by law.\\n\r\nThough there's no rule against a wooden sword, is there?\\n\\n\r\nIn the last year, our friendly studio Sunrise had enough time to stack up material for a long-lasting second season, while our beloved mangaka had time to improve and write arcs which without a doubt - have the Gintama effect. Holding tears in your throat, and two minutes later laughing like a maniac - only to be in tears again a few minutes later. The long touchy speeches are back, the unexpected plot turns are back, everything we longed for in this Gintama-less year, is back.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be important to specify the fact that Gintama is now well funded, and is in HD. Can you imagine seeing Gintoki pick his nose in 720p?! Insane!!!\\n\r\nThe first arc is the comeback we all wished for, every character you knew is making an appearance, though you should ready yourself for a surprise - they've all changed.\\n\\n\r\nI promise this - starting at the first 15 seconds up to the end of the 24 minutes of awesome, you'll be smiling, laughing, perhaps even crying if you're touchy.

            "content": "Edit after episode 13: I cried big wet tears at the excellent storytelling and well placed character development. SUCH. BIG. TEARS.\r\nI was skeptical as hell for the return of the Gintama anime. To be honest, I went into this anime wanting to slam it as hard as possible, especially upon seeing it's overbearingly high-score. But I won't, because to be frank, I can't.\r\nI don't really think a lot of reviews, complex and heavily-illustrated need to be written about this anime to get a feel for what it's about so let me get straight to the point: It's ridiculous over-the-top comedy, plain and simple. Of courseyou can't forget the awesome stories built from these insane gags, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe scripting, the scenario, specifically the way that the anime envelops you inside - making you a returning character as well, are all ingeniously meshed together.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, after five years... brought to you in 16:9 format.\\n\\n\r\n...With even better songs than ever (hard to believe, I know).\\n\\n\r\nIf you haven't seen Gintama before, I recommend checking it out, and I know 201 episodes sounds like a grueling task, but after seeing the pilot episode for the second series, I was left more than satisfied. This episode is reason alone to watch the over two-hundred preceding it.\\n\\n\r\nEven if you're familiar with Gintama and think you're ready for Gintama', let me be the first to tell you; you aren't.\\n\\n\r\nNote: I don't believe this review needs to be edited every week, as most episodes are either episodic or self-contained within an arc. If you've braved the first 201 episodes, don't miss season two.",

I watch an episode every night before I go to sleep so that I can sleep in pure comfort and relaxation. Watching Gintama for me is not a hobby. It is a life style. I HIGHLY recommend this show to anyone who likes anime and especially comedies.",

            "content": "\"Please continue it, it gets good at around episode 57\" \r\n\"Oh, it's still not good? Well I promise it becomes a masterpiece after the first 201 episodes!\"\r\nThese were the words of a desperate Gintama fan trying to reel me into the series and hoping I would see it as the \"masterpiece\" that it is. Spoiler alert: It wasn't, it wasn't even good.\r\nI'll just go ahead and spill it out for you people: This has to be the most overrated Anime series of all time, with more than one million entries to it's name at the top of MAL, I have yet to find an Animemore overrated and hyped than this, but my search continues nonetheless. Granted this is a shonen series, so it will be popular with the masses and will gain a very large number of fanboys who will defend it to death, and give it perfect reviews, but Jesus Christ look at all these 10's sucking the show off as if it were the greatest thing ever made since sliced bread! \\n\\n\r\nThis series should have been called Kintama instead of Gintama, due to how terrible it is. Why did I give this second season a 3/10, but gave the \"vastly inferior\" first season a 6, you say? Well, little Johnny, there comes a time when a man realizes that he has went through so much bullshit, to the point where he just stops looking for the small hidden gems in that pile of bullshit, and just gives up. If I were to describe my experience with Gintama metaphorically, I would compare it to a man who works for days in a mine just to find that one little ring, I would compare it to an unhappy marriage where one of the married couple is in it for the money. You see, Johnny, Gintama has these good things about it, but it also has these bad things about it too, and the negatives are far too obvious for me to say that this deserves all the praise it gets. Gintama can be good if you force yourself to enjoy it, shut your brain off and endure the boring parts as well just to get to the good parts.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 4\\n\\n\r\nGintama's story was never interesting to me and never hooked me in, just a bunch of filler episodes with no plot or substance, some of the episodes in the beginning were good, the vast majority weren't. I had to force myself through sixty hellish episodes for the first serious arc to show up. I've said it many times and I'll say it again, if a show takes 60 episodes to start getting interesting, then it is a failure of a show. The story during the first season was generic at best, it had these boring episodes that were 20 minutes long, but felt like a movie or a lecture, and had uninteresting side characters who magically showed up to ask our hero Gintoki for help. It also became a bit interesting and emotional at other times, with good written characters who had unique qualities about them and gained some form of character development (mostly the main villains and the Shinsengumi). The narrative was all over the place, Gintama had a serious arc that made you cry at first, but the next episode was all about poop jokes and toilet paper. I'll give the show credit for having interesting arcs, even though it had no continuity and was random. Those interesting arcs that made me cry in Gintama's first season were not present here, the funny episodes were not present here, the boring and stupid episodes were though. \\n\\n\r\nInstead of having one good episode at the very least, this season insults your intelligence by presenting you with characters who come out of nowhere and are still unfunny (insert the same lame joke used by Sarutobi about her love for Gintoki, or Zur- I mean Katsura saying \"Zura ja nai, Katsura da\" for the millionth time), gags that did not make me laugh one bit (Oh no, another lame DBZ parody) and villains that were laughable at best (Insert loser ninjas who wanted to kill Sarutobi and lame empress who wanted to take over Gintoki's town). With the first season, the parodies were actually funny at times, since they were actually well made and had a good premise and buildup to begin with. An example of this would be Gintama episode 119, which was one of the funniest episodes in the series, and it managed to do a DBZ parody the right way. This season also had no good serious arcs, villains just show up and then are magically beaten by our annoying mary sue MC and his very annoying sidekick (you know which sidekick I am talking about). Characters are shown to die, but are healthy and alive, standing atop of buildings the next day! Wow! Gintama might as well insert the Dragon Balls into the show as an explanation for this amazing plot armor, that would actually make sense and would be funny. The story is just uninteresting, cheesy and another generic shonen at this point, the only difference is that filler is said to be canon here. Nobody dies, heroes win in the end and the plot moves at a very slow pace. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\\n\r\nThe art became more detailed this time, and the quality improved over the previous season, but you can only go up when you are already at rock bottom. Some of Gintama's characters look stupid, Shinpachi is an example of looking boring and bland with nothing interesting about him. Shinpachi's sister, Shimura Tae, is a carbon copy of Shinpachi but with no glasses and with taller hair (Gintama even makes a joke about this, most characters are based off of Shinpachi's bland design). I gave the art a 6 because some of the characters had good designs (My lovely Kagura, Kondo, Hijikata and Sugo). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 5\\n\\n\r\nThere are really well written characters in Gintama, and then there are the one dimensional annoying pieces of filth in Gintama. The good ones I already mentioned countless times above in this review, the Shinsengumi. The Shinsengumi are the ones who made me endure more than 200 episodes of this show. Hijikata was funny in every gag he was in (2 of my favorite episodes involved the guy), his backstory and his development were brilliant, and his shining moments were fun to watch. Sugo was amazing as well, his character was by far the most developed in the whole show, his backstory was emotional and made me cry, and he had his bad-ass moments too. These characters did not only feel real, three dimensional and brilliant, but they also had an interesting chemistry between them, seeing them interact with each other was the best part of this show. Kondo was also a good and interesting character, though he did become annoying at times. Ito and Housen were one dimensional villains at first, but slowly became more developed as their arcs went on, and their goals and ideals started to make more sense by the time their arcs concluded. Kagura by far has the best backstory of the bunch, and episodes involving her were so sweet to watch, her relationship with others, and the contrast she has with her brother made me want to see them meet and interact (Unfortunately, I dropped the show, sorry Kagura). Gintoki is a good character, having him be a grown up loser was interesting to see when all you find in shonen are these optimistic happy go lucky young protagonists, though the fact that he can beat any character through plot armor annoys me. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, these were all the good characters. Now unto the awful ones. Shinpachi, this guy is so bad to the point where even some fans don't like him, he has to be the most annoying character I have ever seen in all of Anime. If he is not screaming in your ears every 5 seconds, or explaining the joke to you and ruining it in the process, be certain that he is doing another equally annoying thing to piss you off. Shinpachi is a creepy character and a big hypocrite, he has this fan club where him and his Otaku followers obsess over a pop singer called Otsu, he tells his followers that they should not love any other girl, instead their love should be devoted to this pop singer, who will not even look them in the eyes. Shinpachi is not only satisfied with being a creepy weirdo as we can see, he also goes next level and becomes infuriating when he beats up his Otaku followers for having normal relationships with other females. He's also a hypocrite because he does the same shit, yet nobody beats him up. \\n\\n\r\n\"Oh, but it's a just a gag and it's funnay!!!\" - Random Gintama fan who thinks poop jokes are funny. Listen, if you think that being a creep and an asshole who beats up others is comedy, then I just feel sorry for you. \\n\\n\r\nKatsura is a character who can be funny and unpredictable at times (Episode 110), but he's sort of one dimensional as a whole. His entire character is not developed in the first 201 episodes of the show, so I just gave up on him becoming an actual developed character. Instead, he became predictable. Whenever Katsura shows up, all he does is say his iconic phrase, call Kagura boss, do something stupid and place bombs on the Shinsengumi. This is what his entire character boils down to. I want to like Katsura as I have found moments where he's shown actual development, and episodes where he's made me die laughing, but until now he's not a good character. I dropped this second season at around episode 21, and Katsura still had not developed by then.\\n\\n\r\nSarutobi is also a character who is committed to one unfunny gag, predictable. Tsukuyo is introduced for fanservice and for the shippers to ship her with Gintoki, I find her to be more annoying that Otae, that's an accomplishment in itself. Otae is a bully, though her relationship with Kyubei was certainly executed well, and she had a bit of depth and some funny moments. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 5\\n\\n\r\nHad some interesting arcs, good characters and funny episodes. Also had boring arcs, annoying characters and unfunny episodes. My enjoyment was a 5. Whenever Gintama surprised me with three or five good episodes, and I finally was beginning to think that the show was starting to become consistently good, it came back to punch me with three or five terrible episodes. Whenever it surprised me with a well made, exciting and tear jerking arc, it came back to disappoint me with a boring arc I had no interest in. A show that is good for only half of it's entirety, does not deserve the praise it gets.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3\\n\\n\r\nThis season was bad, I thought maybe Gintama's second season would develop some characters or have a death or two, maybe avoid plot armor and become a bit more well written? The writer instead kept writing generic arcs with bad villains instead of good ones this time. And no I'm not going to watch more episodes for it to become \"good\"",

[Mata Itsuka] [See you Again Someday!].\r\nGintama' is not the end of the Gintama Anime.\r\n[ REVIEW ]\r\nDONDAKEEEE!!\r\nGintama' is a series that, without doubt, captures almost every important essence of Anime (Comedy, Action, Drama, etc.) all within one show.\r\nWhile it may be true that Gintama is mainly focused on the comedy aspect, the series is able to embody many action scenes, especially in the Arcs, as well as drama and sadness.\r\nContrary to popular belief, many don't want to start watching Gintama either because the series is too long, too 'overrated' in their eyes, or just does not pique their interest. However, when you actually getaround to giving the series a chance, you will not be disappointed, and you will definitely be hooked.\\n\\n\r\nThe Second airing of the Gintama Anime proves to be as enjoyable as the first one. Despite being shorter (51 episodes), Gintama' managed to pull off arcs filled with action, hilarious comedy, and more lovable characters (Such as Jugem-Jugem!)\\n\\n\r\nThe second season also has a more improved animation style and a widescreen showing, unlike the first one. This is a definite plus for the show.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really tough to describe Gintama in a review. So, if you're sitting down reading this one, I only have one thing to say: GO watch.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, don't forget, this is not the end. Gintama will definitely come back one day.",

            "content": "its nearly one year since the second season of Gintama has started and the loyal fans can remember the Joy and the life it gave us back then when it was aired again.the story that once was supposed to be about an school for demon dispellers and then about the Shinsengumi finally turned into something bizzare called Gintama which u can say is the Golden Work of Hideaki Sorachi.\r\nthe beginning of the second season is a perfect example of a great parody episode with updated jokes about famous Mangas which will make you burst into laugh if you only know about the parodies.although i amnot suggesting to start this anime without watching the first season.but that's not the first thing that will get your attention.that would be Opening and later the Ending.yeah they are catchy and Gintama-like and thats a Plus for me.the rest is your regular Gintama.normal funny episodes with some serious arcs between them that focuses on the main story.well some say Gintama doesn't have a main story but i disagree.the first serious arc focuses on Gintoki's Mother Figure character aka Otose and her background story which introduce a monster that was in love with Otose.as a final touch for this arc we have the Takasugi group and their progress as well as the new Kamui and Takasugi alliance which can be a real threat for Gintoki since Kamui is like the Second King of the Night and Gintoki  had to gang the first one up to defeat him.this arc is filled with emotional scenes and a lot of characters from the previous season which is a good way to start the news season.the later serious and important arc is a Thorny arc about the beloved Shinsengumi with a new semi cool villain that uses a combo of Sword and Gun.oh and lets not forget the cool collaboration of GintamaxSketdance which is created by Sorachi\u2019s previous assistant and have the same theme as Gintama.this episode also used the chance to parody the latest collaboration between Onepiece and Toriko.all and all unlike the first season this one starts pretty good since it is already shaped before and the timing was good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in Gintama  Have many chances for development even in normal comical episodes because of Gintama\u2019s bizzare storyline.you can almost see most of the important characters in normal episodes.although they are just there for the sake of the comedy they are adding features to their own characters or at the very least sometimes they make them selves look cool which in results give them more fans.but since they have these chances often and all of em have potential  its still a shame that they couldn\u2019t use them better.(except for those that won\u2019t show up for a long time even though they could).thats why although all the characters in Gintama are likeable pretty much the only one that most of us can call special is either Kagura or Gintoki himself (sorry to other character\u2019s fans.i am a Kamui and Tsuki fan myself but if I have to make a list of top favorite characters they won\u2019t be in the top 10\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nas i said before the first thing you will notice about this season is the music.the ost used in the first serious arcs is a great piece of work and i love how they make special soundtracks for each serious arc.the voice actors in this anime are experienced and well known ppl that we all have good memories from them with previous characters they voiced which you may find this as one of the Gintama Jokes like how Toshiro uses the catch phrase of \u201cLet\u2019s Party\u201d which belongs to another character also voiced by the same voice actor.although some of the voice actors didn\u2019t had any real challenge or opportunity to show themselves in my opinion Gintoki\u2019s Voice actor didn\u2019t do as good as the first season and he seemed more lively to me in the first season but still he did great and professional  job and its just an expectation I had from him based on his previous works.\\n\\n\r\nas for the animation you can say the budget is saved for serious arc or battle scenes like the graveyard scene but still its better than the first season so it\u2019s a plus for the fans of the previous one.the art is still as good as always with little improvement and its easy on the eyes \\n\\n\r\nas for the score I will give it a 9.5 from 10 but will round it to 10/10 in here.all and all Gintama is a bizzare anime that managed to catches this bizzareness from manga pretty good and i think the animators and the studio did a great job and gave life and color to the manga with each episode.\\n\r\nits a shame that the series is coming to an end again but in my opinion its better this way since they finished it like a boss without filling it with fillers and will probably come back like a boss as well.\\n",

            "content": "I finished season 1 of gintama already and i got to admit it was the best thing i ever watched in the anime industry, this is the only anime that will keep me waiting patiently(well i did crack sometimes) for the next episode,then when it finally ended i there was a hole in my heart a deep black hole that was mended with other animes that i watched until now and when they finally announced a second season, i was like 'Praise the lord...... for making a season 2' waiting for its first release was the most horrible Time ever(seriously).Now that 'waiting' feeling came backand i'm still patiently waiting for the next episode to release.\\n\\n\r\nTo me Gintama is (one) the only worthy anime to deserve a full ranking of all aspects maxed out to a 10!\\n\\n\r\nNow that's done,I'll move one to the review, The first episode was unlike any other, It left a very good impression on me to keep waiting for the next episode and very happy about the new 16:9 aspect ratio. Either way the first couple of episodes were fillers that have extreme amounts of comedy(i couldn't stop laughing to the point my stomach hurts). \\n\\n\r\nStory:Perfect 10\\n\r\nThe story follows the some basic plot and story line which is Heavy,heartfelt,groundbreaking,thrilling of disastrous proportions then 3~5/6(sometimes more) episodes of fanservice and comedy *Usually with new, very interesting characters. and despite being PG-13 it does show a lot of sexual reference in a very comedic way but still watchable to children if controlled.In the fanservice part Characters are usually seen breaking the fourth wall.\\n\\n\r\nArt:Perfect 10 \\n\r\nI don't care what anybody says but if you compare the art from the previous season to this one its like comparing heaven and earth,or having a harem of 5 super cute girls and sitting on your seat in front of the computer(*if you know what i mean :|), if you don't understand, well the art is just amazing, it's like candy to my eyes^^.\\n\\n\r\nSound:Perfect 10'\\n\r\nFor starters all three opening & ending music was awesome really nice to hear, sometimes I even got caught singing in class(ugh..never wanna go through that again...),Sound effects in the show were very well produced and synthesized and fits perfectly to each scene.\\n\\n\r\nAhh,Time for my favorite part...\\n\r\nCharacters:perfect 10(would have given an 11 if it was possible.\\n\r\nMost of them are my all time favorites, All characters have very interesting backgrounds and hidden stories behind them which still keeps bugging me, Every one of them makes me laugh even the very evil ones(for some reason),Each one of them are very good at something except for MADAO((ma)ru de (da)me na (o)ssan: good-for-nothing old man and many more http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=madao),Gin with his silver hair and carefree attitude,Sougo with this sadistic smile, all gave me a reason to keep on going with my life. They are all really funny and extremely powerful when provoked, and for some reason most girls in the show*including new ones* are shown to have feelings for Gin but not sure them selves this makes a perfect semi-harem plot when it comes to fanservice :)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:10!!!\\n\r\nReally enjoyed the series, like i said the best anime to me ever released in the anime industry(well to me).\\n\\n\r\nOverall:10~\\n\r\nIt was very Fun,exciting, splendid,amazing,fantastic,mouth(brain)watering, humorous etc. all of this words fit into this anime.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoy this series and i would recommend this anime to people who like deep plot with some fanservice in the middle with the main aspect of comedy involved.\\n\r\nThanks for reading guys and sorry it's too long it's my first review^^",

            "content": "So as I was watching the first Gintama Series and about half way through I got sad and almost broke down into tears. Why? Because this is probably one of the Greatest Anime's ever made and I was terrified that it was coming to an end. But as to my good fortune before I was completely forsaken and gave up on living I caught wind of a season two and received the strength to carry on. The story of Gintama is full of unexpected twists and turns that always keep you guessing. The characters are hilarious and at times the fight scenes show a lotof depth and even be compared to anime's like Dragonball Z or even Bleach. Overall, this anime is one of the best anime's ever released in my opinion, and since this is the continuation for the original series, I have a lot of hope for this as well.",

            "content": "Bottom Line Up Front: Although some may be turned off by what Gintama is not, it is very witty, funny, and has some very good characters. It has consistently maintained a fresh feel, despite airing over 200 episodes. Some humor requires some background understanding or investigation of Japanese culture to be truly appreciated however. Often breaks down the fourth wall.  Easily my favorite anime.\r\nHighs: Animation assists humor, likeable characters, humor is punctuated by enough story to create direction, Japan's \"Family Guy\"\r\nLows: Length of series makes it increasingly difficult to be innovative with humor",

            "content": "What makes an anime great?  \r\n*Action\r\n*Comedy\r\n*Drama\r\nAnd what anime has it all? Gintama!\r\n At first I was a little bit reluctant to watch this anime because of its different art style, (because then I used to judge an anime mainly on it's art style). But now, I can tell you I'm heaps glad that I entered the World of Gintama.\r\n  When Gintama ended I lost a week's worth of laughing, the end did seem a bit sudden- after searching up billions of blogs and \"YAHOO ANSWERS\" did I find out it would be continued. Boy was I glad.\r\n   Now lets get tothe point:\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 9.9\\n\r\n Before you bring out your swords, lightsabers or sharp objects and kill me- hear my explanation. One of Gintama's previous flaws was that its plot wandered a bit- but Gintama kept hold of its fans by using arcs and interesting battle scenes- not to forget, Comedy. The continuation by the looks of the episodes, the creators have strengthened the plot, with a good plot, funny and loveable characters- with the most amazing action scenes- Gintama will always be a hit.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\n   I know I did complain about the art style a little at first but now I'm completely used to it. The exaggeration of some expressions, the flow of animation and not once were the character's proportioned weird. Despite how many characters there are, they have managed to keep the good quality throughout the episodes. Very pleased. They are now in high quality, which just makes the lineart and animation feel and look much more smoother. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\n   Gintama always had the best sound tracks, the OPS- EDS, background music and voice actors. The OPS would always make you wanna copy the character's actions, the EDS are soothing and the background music is perfect, it fits the scene and during fights- the music makes my blood pump faster. Voice actors, Gintama chose some very special voices to play the roles of our most liked characters.\\n\\n\r\nGintoki Sakata's voice actor Sugita, Tomokazu (voice acted these charas: Gintoki, Kyon, Hoshi, and Mayama) Of course, he may not have voice acted some of the most well-known characters, but Gintoki has definitely made him become a legend.\\n\\n\r\nKagura's voice actor (Kugimiya, Rie) At first I was surprised to find out this was her voice, after all- she was a \"Tsundere Queen\" I could recognize her voice when she's a Tsundere (e.g- Shana, Louise or Astarotte.)  but for once- she isn't! \\n\\n\r\nShinpachi's Voice actor (Sakaguchi, Daisuke) I could not even tell that he voice acted for Sunohara (Clannad) Or Jacuzzi (Bacanno!) It just amazes me how he can almost change voice for every character, a special addition to Gintama!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:10\\n\r\n Gintama is one of the most non-stereotypical anime out there with the most widest, loveable variety of characters. Gintama does a great thing: \"It makes the villains likeable\" not only that, each character has a very unique personality which makes the anime stand out even more. Gintama is more of a Character-driven anime- as the plot has a few loose ends. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\n A good anime should be able to make you laugh when it wants to, make you cry when it wants you to, make you feel angry when it wants you to, and Gintama does all of that. \\n\r\n It's the best in comedy, the best in action, the best in drama.\\n\r\n We all welcome back Gintama!",

            "content": "~~ENGLISH & SPANISH REVIEW~~ [7,3/10]\r\nThe reasons why Gintama is so beloved are perfectly understandable, but they end up being a double-edged sword that does not allow the series or its followers to notice their mistakes. In a world full of comedy, breaks of the fourth wall, parodies, absurdity, drama and action is this sequel to Gintama, which in this case adds an apostrophe to his name.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nGintama 'is very similar in formula to its previous series, much of the series is comedy and another is composed of serious bows that leave a good taste in your mouth. But when I say that Gintama is notas good as they say, it is not because of the comedy or the parodies themselves, they are certain errors of comedy that ruin the seriousness of their world. And precisely one of those big mistakes is the unbridled breakage of the fourth wall. Breaking the fourth wall is a classic resource that as long as it is used in its proper measure and in an intelligent way (Example, when Hitagi tells Koyomi that his seiyuu is very good) it turns out quite well as a contribution. But in Gintama this does not happen, the use of the fourth wall is not very creative and the problem of this is that it takes you many times out of the seriousness of the world and therefore goes on to carry the construction that the same series has been counterproductive. The problem also of the fourth wall is that it is used too much, and every time they say, in the last episode this, in this anime this other, and makes us think that really we are not facing something serious, and although the anime has a lot of comedy, it ends being totally harmful for the seriousness of its serious bows like that of Yoshiwara, or in this case that of the 4 Devas of Kabuki. On the other hand, the comedy is creative in turn and uses its jokes well and its serious bows develop their characters well and end up shaping the plot and vice versa to give something interesting, such as knowing the organization of the society of the District Kabuki Despite good aspects, what I said before is a fact and the plot ends up being good.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn this series the art is taken more seriously than in the previous one, since they use different colored palettes for the atmosphere they want to give, and using the use of black and white to focus a color or nothing helps the drama of the series, There is still room for improvement but a good job was done in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound of Gintama 'is not that it is characterized by being memorable, it has good melodies and used at right times, but it is not that most of it is like that and sometimes it happens without having a clear presence to complement a feeling and in others .\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nGintama's characters are good, just like in the last series. But the problem is that in this series their characters have less development, and it is not even in Gintama ': Enchousen which is an epilogue to this series where they develop more. Honorary mention to the Shinsengumi that is structured better and to the characters of Kabuki.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.3/10 = 7/10\\n\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nLas razones por las cual Gintama es tan querido son perfectamente comprensibles, pero terminan siendo un arma de doble filo que no permite a la serie o sus seguidores notar sus errores. En un mundo lleno de comedia, roturas de la cuarta pared, parodias, absurdo, drama y acci\u00f3n se encuentra esta secuela de Gintama, que en este caso suma un ap\u00f3strofe a su nombre.\\n\\n\r\nHistoria: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nGintama' es muy parecido en formula a su anterior serie, gran parte de la serie es comedia y otra se compone de arcos serios que te dejan un buen sabor de boca. Pero cuando digo que Gintama no es tan buena como dicen, no es por la comedia o las parodias en s\u00ed, son ciertos errores de la comedia que arruinan la seriedad de su mundo. Y precisamente uno de esos grandes errores es la desenfrenada rotura de la cuarta pared. Romper la cuarta pared es un recurso cl\u00e1sico que mientras sea usado en su justa medida y de una forma inteligente (Ejemplo, cuando Hitagi le dice a Koyomi que su seiyuu es muy buena) resulta bastante bien como aporte. Pero en Gintama esto no pasa, el uso de la cuarta pared no es muy creativo y el problema de esto es que te saca muchas veces de la seriedad del mundo y por ende pasa a llevar la construcci\u00f3n que la misma serie lleva siendo contraproducente. El problema tambi\u00e9n de la cuarta pared es que se usa demasiado, y a cada rato dicen, en el episodio pasado esto, en este anime esto otro, y hace pensar que realmente no estamos ante algo serio, y aunque el anime tenga mucha comedia, termina siendo totalmente da\u00f1ino para la seriedad de sus arcos serios como el de Yoshiwara, o bien en este caso la de los 4 Devas de Kabuki. Por otra parte, la comedia es creativa a su vez y usa bien sus chistes y sus arcos serios desarrollan bien sus personajes y terminan moldeando la trama y viceversa para dar en algo interesante, como por ejemplo al saber de la organizaci\u00f3n de la sociedad del Distrito Kabuki. A pesar de buenos aspectos, lo que dije antes es un hecho y la trama termina siendo buena.\\n\\n\r\nArte (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEn esta serie se toman el arte mas en serio que en la anterior, ya que utilizan diferentes paletas de coloreado para la atm\u00f3sfera que quieren dar, y usar el uso del blanco y negro para enfocar un color o nada ayuda al drama de la serie, a\u00fan queda por mejorar pero se hizo un buen trabajo al respecto.\\n\\n\r\nSonido (6/10)\\n\\n\r\nEl sonido de Gintama' no es que se caracterice por ser memorable, tiene buenas melod\u00edas y usadas en momentos correctos, pero no es que la mayor\u00eda sea as\u00ed y pasa a veces sin tener una presencia clara para complementarse a un sentimiento y en otras al contrario.\\n\\n\r\nPersonajes (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nLos personajes de Gintama' son buenos, al igual que en la serie pasada. Pero el problema es que en esta serie sus personajes tienen menos desarrollo, y no es hasta en Gintama': Enchousen que es un ep\u00edlogo a esta serie donde se desarrollan mas. Menci\u00f3n honoraria al Shinsengumi que se estructura mejor y a los personajes de Kabuki.\\n\\n\r\nDisfrute (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nTotal: 7,3/10 = 7/10",

But I'll do my best.\r\nStory-10: I think overall Gintama has a pretty good story with comedy, action, to drama and I always have that feeling of satisfaction in every episode .Gintama Season 2 never really gets me bored. I find the comedy in season 2 better than the first somehow. I literally cried out of laughter. The serious arcs were also pretty epic and has a beautiful story to it. So i give it a 10\r\nArt-9: Not much really change in art. It's much more high quality though but Ithink that its best for Gintama. The art style on the fight scenes also improved alot. And the facial expressions on the Characters are alot more funnier than it used to.  \\n\\n\r\nSound-9: The music in Gintama' is pretty epic. The OPs and EDs are awsome. And I really enjoy the background music in every episode and it really gives life and the mood of the scene.Still  I give it a 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-10: Characters in Season 2 is still awsome as they were in season 1. With new characters showing that makes Gintama even more awsome. Definitely a 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-10: Hell yeah it was awsome! In Gintama, every episode is epic to the core. It's really fun to watch, especially the serious arcs. All in all I give it a 10. If it's possible maybe an 11, but that's just me. :D\\n\\n\r\nOverall-10: Gintama is fun anime that I really. Each episode is worth it. And the comedy killed me. And the fight scenes are very epic and badass. \\n\\n",

It's that good. after watching The first Series Gintama I moved on to this show which is now in HD btw. From its amazing comedy and complex characters to its awesome fight scenes Gintama can make anyones mood turn to complete happiness. If your on the fence about it because maybe you don't like long series try a few episodes out and it doesnt matter where either start at episode 1 or check out episode 30 every episode is enjoyable and asthe series goes on you think there is no way it can be funnier but it always does time after time. The art is good and music as well, the voice actors for example Kagura have a very unique accent and its just great adding to the shows originality. While I do say this anime is for just about everyone I will tell you now this anime has no romance so if thats what you're looking for Gintama isn't it but... You should probably know that...  Overall I have seen all of the first series and a large portion of Gintama' and it is my favorite anime of all time for enjoyment so keep in mind this anime should be watched with your brain off.",

Anyway, I would not write it. Even some people say that this anime is --- whatever, but setting aside those jokes you would see that this anime is really unique. Even if some of the episodes are not really connected or not in the series it is woven neatly. \r\nI really likethe opening and closing song of Gintama. Maybe, we have the same taste of music. When you watch Gintama the remarkable would be the seiyuu. I love how the seiyuu of Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura portrays or give life to the character. I like how the seiyuu of Gintoki energetic voice the word troublesome in Japanese. Even when reading the manga it echoes in my ear. I just want to give them a round of applause because this is the first time I appreciate the seiyuu.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to character I like the stupidness of the characters.

            "content": "Gintama is the most hilarious series I\u2019ve ever seen in my more than a decade of watching animes and reading mangas. It is number one on my top lists of best animes in comedy and in the top ten on my hundred lists of best animes in the history of anime world. So when I learned that they are coming back, I was more than delighted, I was so thankful for the whole production who decided to bring them back.\r\nThere\u2019s a long review coming\u2026\u2026\u2026..\r\nAbout the STORY\r\nFirst, I strongly believe that you wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate this to the extent if you haven\u2019t watched theprevious one. Let me also just mention that the last episode of the previous one didn\u2019t felt like it was the ending and so this new anime adaptation is really like a continuation. And the very first episode is really a blast, a very appropriate opening episode for this amazing series. The jokes, comical acts, and most especially the parodies are more hilarious than ever. Not that I didn\u2019t love the hilarious lines from the previous one but this time it is polish even more. Not only they are making parodies about several other famous series but this time they are doing some international TV series as well which are extremely hilarious. The arcs are even better and a lot more exciting and interesting. As much as I love how the different arcs from the previous one was made but the truth is, there were a lot of moments that it became so dramatic and too clich\u00e9. The lines were also too damn cheesy when they were trying to make it cool but instead it became so mushy and cheesy. But to my surprise and delight, this time the arcs improve a lot and when I say a lot as in drastically. The drama is more expressed in a way that it is no longer over the top. It is a lot more clean and very much touching. Even the dialogues or lines are nicer; it is delivered so well that it really brings out the coolness of the words and the characters who are delivering them. It is also so amazing how the serious lines are well incorporated with hilarious lines. It makes the lines even greater. Until now, it is still bewildering yet very much amazing how the mangaka is able to create such jokes and parodies. Sometimes, it is just insane how he is able to that because there are even jokes and parodies that you wouldn\u2019t normally think would be funny at all. But for the mangaka, he can even make the smallest things and most ordinary in our everyday life so hilarious.\\n\\n\r\nAbout the CHARACTERS\\n\r\nLike I said, you wouldn\u2019t understand this if you haven\u2019t watched the first one. That also goes with the characters. In the previous series, even for a very long airing time or many episodes, there were very few characters whose backgrounds were expressed enough. I guess, the protagonists and main characters were the only ones who had revelations about their pasts. In fact, even for them it was still not enough or not everything about them was known. So I am very grateful that this time, even the supporting characters\u2019 backgrounds are being revealed. The characters are made even cooler and a lot more amazing most especially Gin-chan who I love more and more. Not that I didn\u2019t love his character from the previous series but you could say his character is even more polished. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the ANIMATION and SOUND\\n\r\nI really don\u2019t know how to express it enough but for some reasons the animation is definitely even better. It gives off a feeling of watching an anime film. Let\u2019s not forget how the fight scenes improve a lot as well. Even for a comedy type of series, Gintama has one of the best fight scenes in the anime world and you could even compare it to some famous action series of today. And in this new adaptation, it is just brilliant. It could even be compared with a film. It is very detailed which brings out the amazing movements of the characters while fighting. Even the sounds are greater than ever. It gives the whole thing a complete package. The amazing music gives the final touch to the series.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, there are tons of improvements and almost every element is polish. Not that I don\u2019t love as much the previous one but I will admit that there were really space for improvements. I could definitely say that this time, Gintama is at its best so far. I was really sad when they\u2019ve decided to end the series because this series is one of the very few which I genuinely want to continue watching in anime adaptation. To be honest, I just want it to continue even for so many years. Even when the time comes when I am too old to move much, I would want to still watch this magnificent series. NO ONE DO PARODIES LIKE GINTAMA DOES.\\n",

Not only that, but they do quote things that have to do with life, which when you look at, is true. This anime is random. It's filled with action, comedy, drama, bits of horror, and lots of copy right mentioned titles you might recognize! The characters areperfect in many aspects as well. Unique in their own way, but together, they make up the perfect team. A slacker of a leader, a monster of a girl, and Four-eyes. I wouldn't say it's for everyone. Gintama isn't concentrated on one genre, rather, it's mixed with everything.\\n\\n\r\nStory: It's hard to say, but there's enough arcs to explain the placement of the story.\\n\r\nArt: Not the best, not the worst, but just right.\\n\r\nSound: everything's fine. No blotching.\\n\r\nCharacters: every character is unique, but they're all trolls.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: not really for all serious purpose.\\n\r\nOverall: Funny, action-packed, life quotes, great!",

            "content": "Episodes 38 and 39 (239 and 240) are the best episodes of this season\r\nChange my mind\r\nGintama, I do not know if by the number of episodes of being smaller or because I am more adept to the anime, this season improved the anime itself, the confusion between the screen times for the high number of characters that I had quoted was better performed. For being short, the serious bows were closer, but that air of gintama did not disappear, the random episodes, the references, are all there, besides fitting the jokes better, I think they noticed that people on this side of the hemisphere donot understand jokes with relation to Japanese comedians. The songs remain magnificent, extremely comic and well used, the comic time has improved, I can only remember about 3 to 4 episodes that I found annoying, compared to the first one that had about 20 to 30 annoying (for me). They remembered Sakamoto-san, which we agreed had only appeared in the openings. And finally they gave a light on an arch that will surpass Benizakura, in the episode 14 we see Kamui and Takasugi becoming allies, going towards the land where a idiot samurai lives, I am very anxious for that moment. So that's it, Gintama continues the same with some improvements, I think the shorter model (50-100) matches more with it than the long (100+). (I apologize for my spelling mistakes)\\n\\n\r\n(PT-Br) Os epis\u00f3dios 38 e 39 (239 e 240) s\u00e3o os melhores epis\u00f3dios dessa temporada\\n\r\nChange my mind\\n\r\nGintama, n\u00e3o sei se pelo n\u00famero de epis\u00f3dios de ter sido menor ou por eu estar mais adepto ao anime, essa temporada melhorou o anime em si, a confus\u00e3o entre a os tempos de tela para o alto n\u00famero de personagens que eu havia citado foi melhor executada. Por ser curto os arcos s\u00e9rios ficaram mais pr\u00f3ximos, mas aquele ar de gintama n\u00e3o sumiu, os epis\u00f3dios aleat\u00f3rios, as refer\u00eancias, est\u00e3o todas l\u00e1, al\u00e9m de adequarem melhor as piadas, acho que notaram que as pessoas deste lado do hemisf\u00e9rio n\u00e3o entendem piadas com rela\u00e7\u00e3o a comediantes japoneses. As m\u00fasicas continuam magnificas, s\u00e3o extremamente c\u00f4micas e bem utilizadas, o time c\u00f4mico melhorou, eu s\u00f3 consigo lembrar de uns 3 a 4 epis\u00f3dios que eu achei chato, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com a primeira que tinha uns 20 a 30 chatos (para mim). Eles lembraram do Sakamoto-san, que convenhamos s\u00f3 tinha aparecido nas aberturas. E finalmente deram uma luz sobre um arco que ir\u00e1 superar Benizakura, no epis\u00f3dio 14 vemos Kamui e Takasugi se tornando aliados, indo em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a terra onde vive um samurai idiota, eu estou muito ansioso para esse momento. Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 isso, Gintama continuo o mesmo com algumas melhoras, acho que o modelo mais curto (50-100) combina mais com ele do que o longo (100+).",

Even if some of its episodes are repeated but they got their own trait.\r\n Music :\r\nIncluding internal music , openings and endings\r\nIt's great !\r\nIt's suitable for this kind of anime. \r\nIt makes you got excited when you watch the pivotal moments.\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe best thing that makes Gintama special is the characters.\\n\r\nEvery single character in the series has his/her own unique personality . Even if he/she is not a main character.\\n\r\nOther thing that even if this anime rate is +13 but it's suitable for people who are more than 17 y.o like me ^^ because a lot of its events are similar to reality .\\n\r\nLast thing , the comedy scenes are really amazing\\n\r\nI advise people who want to enjoy an anime full of comedy to watch Gintama.\\n",

It's one of those animes that lures you with fanservice and then you continue watching for the amazing plotand character development I highly recommend it.",

            "content": "There are some differences between seasons of Gintama one of most important is that Gintama is getting more serious first season is more like a comedy one second and third and bit serious and like this till the end. There are lot of people who don't really like this and i will say its personal, I like where it\u2019s going because it has potential this way too and i like that they are using it and I must also say that comedy part isn't lost its just got less. Second season is still more comedy, also new characters were added and more \"love story\" theoriesbecome possible: D. Second season is more really close to season one so not to review whole first season I will leave link to it. You can find review of first season here  https://myanimelist.net/profile/ManOfDuty/reviews",
