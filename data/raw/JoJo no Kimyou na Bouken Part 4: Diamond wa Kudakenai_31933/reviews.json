            "content": "Before I get into my actual review, as well as not to distract from its quality I\u2019m going to breakdown (See what I did there) common questions that people have asked before, are sure to ask now and for every subsequent part of Jojo\u2019s going forward, this is for you people, newcomers and otherwise.  I want to give future readers the most complete understanding of this series and by extension this franchise as humanly possible, so-----here you go:\r\nACT 1- The Q & A\r\nQ: What is Diamond is Unbreakable?\r\nA:  Diamond is Unbreakable is the fourth part of the long running Jojo\u2019s franchise.  Itis one of the more story heavy out of the bunch. It isn\u2019t particularly hard to follow,but there are quite a few intricate plot points that come into play over time in the story rather than immediately like most battles/ segments in previous parts. While it is also easy to follow and quickly gain a grasp of, this isn\u2019t your best starting point.\\n\\n\r\nQ:  Can I start Jojo\u2019s here?  If not what is my best starting point?\\n\\n\r\nA:  Yes.  You\u2019ll still be able to understand what is going on to a certain extent.  However I highly suggest against it.  Watching Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure (2012), Stardust Crusaders Season 1 and Season 2, then this, in that order would better engross you in the franchise and maximize your experience.  Also no, I don\u2019t suggest skipping parts there\u2019s no filler so there is really no point in doing so.(Plus I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re like me at all you like feeling like a smart ass when people ask you information on a series.)\\n\\n\r\nQ:  Is the series worth watching?  Would I be wasting my time?\\n\\n\r\nA:  Again, yes.  Even if you don\u2019t enjoy it, it is worth the look.  There\u2019s just such rich and deep history behind the Jojo\u2019s franchise.  It began as a homage to the late Fist of the North Star series which inspired other beloved franchises such as Berserk and Street Fighter.  Jojo\u2019s carries with it a powerful legacy inspiring its own fair share of series such as Persona.  In short Jojo\u2019s understands what a winning formula is, it takes some of the best aspects of battle Shonen anime and breathes life into the genre with unbelievable flare.  It is definitely worth a peek if not just to understand why it is so popular.  \\n\\n\r\nQ:  What makes Jojo\u2019s so good?  Why is everyone so interested in it?\\n\\n\r\nA:  Depends on who you ask really.  For some people it\u2019s clever writing and flamboyant, masculine style.  For other people Jojo\u2019s hit its peak in part 2 and will never be as good as the masterpiece that is Battle Tendency.  Others the over the top characters and the powerful, legitimate bonds they share. For me, the constantly changing narrative and wonderful world and lore are why I love Jojo\u2019s.  There\u2019s really not one person that\u2019s going to see the exact same thing from Jojo\u2019s, even between parts.  To advertise one as definitively the best or worst to you would be insincere on my part, as I really love them all.\\n\\n\r\nQ:  The Manga, how is it?  Am I missing anything by not reading it?\\n\\n\r\nA:  I suggest it. Some characters are handled slightly different, but I must say David productions takes so much care with this series. There are plenty of scenes and small bits that are not present in the manga, primarily in this part, that flesh out the world a lot more.  On the other hand, some of the fluff, such as certain conversations were shortened, reduced or completely removed. In short you aren\u2019t missing much other than actually consistent art work,  some dialogues that don\u2019t really matter to be honest and a certain character ( Okuyasu) changing from more of a thug who\u2019s kind of a softie, to a softie that kind of pretends to be a thug, but really isn\u2019t if that makes sense.\\n\\n\\n\r\nACT 2- The Review:\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, how I have waited for this day.  I get to review DiU and by extension give my minor thoughts on some of the rest of the series.  If you just want the short answer, Diamond is Unbreakable is a good series.  Go read it, go watch it, I don\u2019t care.  If you even remotely like Shonen the likes of Yu Yu Hakusho, Hunter X Hunter, One Piece, Fist of The North Star,  etc.  you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice by not watching this series. This was hands down my favorite show of this season.  After the shit fest that were the Berserk 2016 and Ace Attorney anime adaptions, I was disappointed, but there was one show that never failed to put a smile on my face.  It may sound like I\u2019m sugarcoating it but I have such a love for Jojo\u2019s.  After those failures, OH YEAH, I believe a bit of positivity is in order.\\n\\n\r\nDiU follows the lives of three seemingly ordinary teenagers,  Josuke Higashikata, Okuyasu Nijimura, and Koichi Hirose,  who would be leading similarly ordinary lives as they start a new high school life, but of course that won\u2019t be the case.  Jotaro, the main protagonist of the part 3, now a side character, is investigating the mysterious forces within the town of Morioh.  Josuke, Okuyasu, Koichi and those around them awaken to extraordinary powers which lead to strange encounters and deadly showdowns.  The series is primarily broken into two groups for most episodes,  Josuke and his group of friends and Koichi and his group of friends (which take up a surprising majority of episodes).\\n\\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, that summary I just gave you is less than about \u00bd of the series.  It is a common belief that DiU is episodic which could not be further from the truth.  I don\u2019t know any other way of putting it, telling someone that is literally a straight out lie. While on the surface, the audience jumping into this straight off of the heels of Stardust Crusaders may think from the setup that Diamond is Unbreakable is just a less interesting version of SC\u2019s \u201cvillain of the week\u201d plot it really isn\u2019t.  Episodes 1 through 16, actually serves as a way to introduce the supporting cast and develop character relationships.  In other words, the antagonists are more than just obstacles to overcome. The ACTUAL plot from episode 17 through 39 revolves around Josuke and the gang chasing down a murderer who shares a similar power to theirs (albeit with a few more of those \"obstacles\" to overcome).  The series from here on out gets much darker, with many twists and turns and some of the best fights in the series.  I won\u2019t say more about the story, as doing so would ruin it and it is without doubt the best thing about DiU.  Just know this commonly accepted \u201cfact\u201d,  much like any badly held stigma, is not true.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cHow\u2019s the animation?\u201d  I won\u2019t lie; I believe Stardust Crusaders was the best season animation wise. Take note, because I\u2019m really going to focus on SC here.  The character designs in DiU are neither as crisp nor as detailed to be honest.  The characters however are really smooth looking in most scenes, giving off almost rubber appearances. As far as errors, well\u2026.some of the animation errors were too consistent in the initial run of this series.  I\u2019m obviously not going to spoil anything here, but there are a few episodes that were handed over to a completely different studio from David Productions.  They got their hands on an episode where a character reveals something VERY important and I don\u2019t even need to mention it.  People who watched it know what I\u2019m talking about and if you plan on watching it you will too.  At this point it\u2019s like bringing up episode 5 of Dragon Ball Super. That\u2019s still a thing people talk about right?  To be blunt, it damn near killed the hype of one of the most badass reveals ever and in truth it really upset me how little care was taken with that in particular.  However, where DiU lacks in comparison to SC it actually fixes a lot of the problems I had with the previous part.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fix as far as animation I must say is that they severely toned down the amount of color changing.  It may not have been a big deal to anyone else, but SC inverted color sections were not always easy on the eyes and seemed to happen a little too often.  DiU thankfully has bright colors, but  it\u2019s a much more mellow and pleasant color scheme, rather than looking like an explosive comic book.  The auras also look a lot nicer and much more distinct than in previous parts. However, the best additions to me are the old film filter and the way signature poses are portrayed.  The still shots are a lot more interesting and much more dynamic than they ever have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fantastic.  Each intro from the catchy yet mysterious Crazy, Noisy Bizarre Town, the melancholic but fitting Chase, and the triumphant and conclusive Great Days are visual and audio treats.  The ending theme, I Want You by Savage Garden is  also just, for a lack of a better word, perfect.  The rest of the soundtrack you will find has more rock and synthesized \u201csounding\u201d music this time around.  The soundtrack is quite memorable, If you\u2019re curious about that, they\u2019re all floating around on the internet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nACT 3- The Conclusion:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tListen by the time this review goes up I\u2019ve already watched all but the last episode of this series twice.  I\u2019ve gotten friends, family into this great franchise, not that I suggest you showing the series to someone who\u2019s sensitive or easily disgusted.  There\u2019s some content even in DiU that isn\u2019t for everyone.  I may sound a bit biased. I may be gushing way too hard. But I\u2019ve had some of the best conversations of my life just discussing Jojo\u2019s. I earnestly believe that it is series like Parasyte, Hunter X Hunter, Kill La Kill, Jojo\u2019s, etc. that will be defined in the future as the \u201c New\u201d anime classics.  There\u2019s a lot to value here, interesting characters, clever writing, stylish animation, catchy music, and in truth a series that is both like and unlike anything and well\u2026.everything I\u2019ve ever seen.  There were faults to be sure, which is what kept this series just shy of a higher score, but I have to be somewhat objective.  If anything I hope this review was helpful to you and gave you a bit of an understanding of what the series is and my personal perspective on it.  I\u2019ll leave you with this, if you enjoyed nothing else in 2016, if you\u2019re tired of the shallow end of anime to point where you feel you\u2019re in a never ending loop,  if the sheer amount of crazy caused you to break--- what\u2019s one more chance to fix it?\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I dont' know why there aren't more negative reviews about this series, but the JoJo series had been my favorite anime to watch (I don't read any manga), and this arc was a huge letdown after 3 solid, enjoyable, and often amazing arcs. The Stardust Crusader OVA from long ago got me hooked, and I was really looking forward to seeing Diamond is Unbreakable after finishing the TV series version of Stardust Crusaders.\r\nI understand this TV series stays pretty true to the manga, but I feel that the writer Hirohiko Araki simply ran out of ideas after the EPIC Stardust Crusader arc and made thisfiller arc (for the money) about nothing significant, creating characters that were hard to appreciate because they were whiny, talkative, immature, stupid, and simply lucky, in some sense, when defeating these super random unmemorable opponents with vaguely-defined abilities. I understand the characters are supposed to be young and immature, but I got tired of constantly seeing the characters suddenly act immature over and over in the middle of life-and-death situations.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the JoJo series as a whole because of amazing powers and the characters having to be clever and creative in order to win, but this arc barely tries. Or perhaps the characters are so unlikable I don't care if the main characters actually lost/died.\\n\\n\r\nThe series brings back the main characters from the past storylines, Joseph Joestar and Jotaro Kujo, but Joseph is completely useless in this series and the reasons change from him barely having any memory and barely able to walk to being able to walk and think but having to take care of a pointless baby. I assume the baby becomes a major character in a future arc, but it's super lame how they introduced the baby and how Jonathan was completely out of commission.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a hardcore fan of the series like I am, watch it just to get it over with. If you are new to the series, I highly recommend checking out the first 3 arcs over this one.",

            "content": "Morioh, an insignificant town that sits out in the sun for anyone to visit and the new home for the never-ending battle carried out by one family. Somewhere in this scrambled slice of suburbia, we're introduced to the latest member of the Joestar lineage, as we encroach on what would be one of many fights to come.\r\nA new enemy Stand makes its entrance; veins protruding through swollen biceps; wrinkled brow plaster the expression of a robust figure; eyes fixated on the opposition; pompadour takes aim, a tangerine sky hanging above; onomatopoeias floods the screen\u2014BAM! MENACING! RUMBLE!\u2014with wall-to-wall color dancing around on the border of psychedeliaand pop art. Head titled, shoulders rolled back, chest puffed out; an epic pose is struck. A feeble old geezer hunched over in the background, hands clasping his cheek, lets out a compulsory \"Oh my Gawd!\" in Engrish. A powerful aura exudes from the frame of the young Joestar. A muscle-bound, apparition clad in lavender emerges from within him, as he lets out a herculean roar: \"CRAZY DIAMOND!!!\"..., Gritted teeth, fist wound up, body arched back\u2014fades to black..., trumpets blare, cue intro, welcome to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable!\\n\\n\r\nSince 2012, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has been spearheading a campaign to bring GAR and all things manly back to the limelight; introducing newcomers to an anime staple that's been underrepresented in the 2000s, while also shamelessly serving as a form of fanservice for veteran viewers who self-indulge in all things retro. For those people that miss the blockbuster era of beefy action heroes that were deep-rooted in the product of 80s Americana. With a dedicated following that only grows bigger year after year, Jojo's crusade for \"manly ass men doing manly ass things\" has proven to be a successful one. A fact that's made all the more surprising when accounting for the current cultural shift in anime that favors infectiously cute shows or those garishly showered in 2edgy4u content. Jojo stands firm, pressing forward to the beat of its own drum while giving sensitivity the middle finger as it flexes its biceps in the name of awesome. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the strongest aspect of Jojo isn't this flippant disregard towards popular trends, but the way it goes about expressing itself within it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few cardinal rules that most writers try their best to abide by, one of which is maintaining some semblance of plausibility within the realm of the written work being presented. Whether the story in question is grounded in reality or contains plenty of fantastical elements, maintaining some level of plausible \"cause and effect\" is what helps the audience experience immersion. Even in a fictional universe that contains many otherworldly themes, there are still constants that are expected to be maintained. In the same way, the theoretical law in our universe remains consistent no matter the time or location; the same is also expected with works of fiction. Anything that doesn't uphold established in-world laws tends to be perceived as poorly constructed or just outright \"bad writing.\" We may not always identify it up front, but somewhere in our subconscious, the \"bullshit\" meter is going off. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, even with this unspoken rule in mind, there are some stories that purposefully leave common sense at the front door. They're shows that are propelled by nonsensical conclusions, improbable physics, and pure absurdity. But somehow, despite this, or perhaps because of it, they have been adored the world over. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is that kind of show. A show driven forward by madness, adrenaline, and a gratuitous amount of machismo. It embraces the \"Bizarre\" in its namesake to the utmost extent, doing whatever it pleases with total conviction and never looking back at the body count trailing behind it.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd like the hyperactive installments before it, Part 4 continues to keep the ball rolling, following the lineage of the Joestar family and all the inherent problems that come with the blood-line. This brings us to the next Joestar tasked with carrying on the legacy, the ever-fabulous Jousuke Higashikata; a man of few words, unless the words addressed to him are insults directed at his ultra sleek Greece Lightening hairdo. Unlike the hard-boiled demeanor of Joutarou, Jousuke actions are driven by hot-tempered impulses, choosing to punch first and ask questions later. He wears his heart on his sleeve, an attribute that would usually be perceived as weak in the testosterone-filled world of Jojo, except for the fact that Jousuke kicks all kinds of ass with his Stand, Crazy Diamond. A Stand that grants him the ability to restore any damage inflicted to something back to its original state or alter it to its base elements. Pairing that with his hair-trigger personality makes for a formidable combo, something that many enemy Stands find out the hard way.\\n\\n\r\nAs the aftermath surrounding Dio Brando begins to settle down, remnants of his misdeeds are still spreading when the Bow and Arrow\u2014the weapon used to create Stands\u2014ends up in the wrong hands. Because of this, Joutarou finds himself traveling to the town of Moriah where his illegitimate nephew Jousuke calls home. And as the Joestars team up to rid the town of Stand users hellbent on causing harm to the citizens, they find themselves encountering greater threats along the way.  \\n\\n\r\nWith a narrative that solely exists to have as many physical encounters as possible, Part 4 manages the impossible task of circumventing the trappings of episodic content while using that exact structure to create bottle episodes filled with high-octane battles. Whether it's pounding the snot out of an enemy Stand or simply going to a restaurant to eat, Part 4 is continuously pressing down on the gas peddle. For those that don't like stagnation, this sequel is a Godsend. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no calm moment of clarity to reflect on the situation at hand, all that's left on display is brittle logical leaps followed up by gonzo wall-texts flying in with a flurry of saturated color. It's vivid, it's spastic, it's a mural hacked up on PCP. And while this commitment to never slowing down may seem like a detriment for any other show, for Jojo\u2014a show that's as straightforward as the content being displayed\u2014there couldn't have been a better marriage of purposeful storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nJojo's brilliance is in its simplicity. It isn't a show that's out to have an intricate story-line filled with multifaceted themes, nor does it try to craft layered personalities that appear 3-dimensional. Jojo personifies the mindset of a neanderthal, where problems are solved with fists and beating enemies into submission. Loyalty is proven with actions and not half-baked words. And motivations that's as explicit as the expository dialogue being used to express them. The only thought process being taken is assuring that they properly utilize their Stand abilities to defeat their enemy with optimal results. These muscle-bound brutes painted up like Easter eggs leave no room for interpretation, what you see is what you get.  \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say there's no thought placed into Jojo's production. The show is littered with inventive encounters that overlap Stand abilities to create a chess game of wits, seeing both sides constantly fighting for the upper hand over one another. Matches that eventually dissolve into pissing contests to see who would cave in first. Each Stand ability is accounted for, creating interesting back and forths between the combatants. And with there being countless possible Stand abilities that could manifest in someone, the end result is no two fights being the same. The battlefield is forever morphing, with something as simple as the changes in partnership or location altering the very course of a how a match can turn out. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this very ingenuity that demonstrates that behind the burly men clashing fists, there's still a thought process keeping the madness together. This also includes the more straightforward parts of Jojo's production, such as the naming of the characters and the reasoning for its brightly-colored world. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've made it all the way to Part 4, then this should come as no surprise to you that Hirohiko Araki, the creator of the Jojo manga, has consciously decided to name characters after musicians and songs, mostly from western pop culture. It's an inconsequential bit of trivia that doesn't do much for the long-haul but despite that, adds to the overall appeal of his work. And with French post-impressionist artist Paul Gauguin being cited as an influential person in his approach to color theory, there's always a sense that Jojo was much more than just a whim being held up by simple admiration for a particular era. If you've ever felt like the colors used was oddly at home despite the constant clash of sassy meet gusto, that's because of this conscious effort on Araki's part to blend the two. This well-cultured sensibility is what gives Jojo such a distinct personality from its counterparts. It's an entity birthed outside of typical circular influence, having a unique appeal while winning the admiration of a broader market in the process. \\n\\n\r\nBut let's not mistake all this appraisal of Jojo as the show being a flawless creation, it does suffer from its fair share of issues. For one, because of its straightforward approach, there's never any questions posed at the actions being taken. And as such, this is an anime that only works because of the universe pre-established before it. Had we not seen the impossible happen time and time again, Jojo would have never worked. Its absurdity disallows genuine immersion in the circumstances taking place. You're entertained but never for a second buy into the ridiculousness of it all. It's a show where you laugh at the nonsense and take enjoyment out of how committed it is to seeing it through, despite the apparent shortcomings of said actions making close to little sense. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is always entertaining but never something to be held up as proper literature. It's the show's greatest strength but sadly its greatest weakness as well. \\n\\n\r\nThis issue also means that all of the characters are usually dwindled down to becoming internet memes or lovable caricatures. No one is looking onto Jojo for enriched characterization. All that's expected out of it is hyperactive personalities with cool abilities trading blow for blow in an environment that allow these occurrences to go on undisturbed. This is usually the trade-off for dumb-fun entertainment. Finding a balance between the absurd and tightly written is a rarity that escapes Jojo. But what it still has is an unshakable commitment to do everything at 110%, so even when you question the logic of a scenario, it doesn't take long before you accept it for what it is to continue seeing the Joestars pummel enemies into submission. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if this fact can be accepted for what it is, then Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable should be nothing short of an entertaining ride for most fans of this bizarre adventure. With more epic poses, more stands, more cool ass character designs, and too much awesome shit to know what to do with, Jojo Part 4 has been one hell of a ride. And with this being another successful adaptation by David Production, here's hoping it's an adventure with many more iterations to come.\\n\\n\r\n-Sepia bathe the screen, title card cropped in an arrow: To Be Continued-\\n",

            "content": "David Production was hardly a household name in the otaku community a few years ago. However everything changed when the fire nation attacked...I mean when they released their JoJo's Bizarre Adventure adaptation in 2012! While the budget was pretty low, David Production blew the community away with their attention to detail and loyalty to the source material and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable is no exception to this.\r\nJoJo Part 4 tells the story of Josuke Higashikata, Joesephs illegitimate son. In Josuke's home town Morioh someone used a magical bow and arrow to transform normal people into Stand users. This time we getto know a little bit more about the origin of the Stand abilities, which has something to do with these arrows. Of course, Josuke and his friends have to stop them. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the time they just encounter random enemies, but later they try to find out the identity of a certain someone with an especially dangerous Stand who is living in Morioh, who is the main focus of the second half of this story arc. This person is commiting gruesome murders for several years, but was never caught, so it's up to JoJo and his pals to stop him.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this plot works so much better than Part 3's, is because it feels much more natural. In Stardust Crusader, the plot felt very video game-ish, but in Part 4 fighting Stand users is more of a daily routine and not part of a journey to save the world or something. Araki succesfully mixed Part 3's semi-episodic structure with some slice of life elements. Since they never leave their home town, there is also a lot of attention to the city Morioh itself, almost like the city is it's own character. I wouldn't go so far and call it \"world building\", but all these little things about Morioh + the recurring places definitely gives this arc it's own flavor and identity compared to the rest of JJBA. \\n\\n\r\nMost enemies they fight turn into friends later on or are at least somewhat relevant for the plot later. This causes the team of allies to be very large, almost twice the size of Part 3's.However the last third of the show has very simmiliar issues as Stardust Crusaders (TOO obvious monster of the week) and some episodes are obviously more exiting than others, but in the end Part 4 feels much more tightly written than it's predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great in Diamond is unbreakable! Almost all of them are interesting and their interactions are super entertaining. Of the 4 JoJos that are introduced at this point, Part 4's main character Josuke is probably the most interestig. He is introduced as a polite delinquent, but he gets series when it comes to his hair: when someones insults it, the person get's his ass kicked! This is pretty much Josuke's thing. Joseph had his predicting thing, Jotaro his \"yare yare daze\" and Josuke has his hair thing.There is even a little flashback about why he is so sensitive about his hair in the first place. He doesn't use it as much as Joseph and Jotaro though and his tick is pretty much dropped later on and his flashback never received any further explanation, but it was still a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain of Part 4, Yoshikage Kira, is also great. He is not as \"EPIC\" as Dio, but he is very memorable in his own way. Unlike Dio, who was more of a cartoon villain (wants to take over the world etc) Kira just wants to commit murders without being disturbed by other people. He doesn't want world domination or anything like that, just a quite and peaceful life. Unlike Dio or Kars, Kira feels like a person who could actually exist in real life, which makes him legimately scary. The final battle against him was a little messy and the way he died was pretty anticlimatic, but I guess that made sense in this context and steting, since Kira is a more of a realistic villain. The fight was still exiting nontheless and the way they used their Stands was pretty creative.\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect from JoJo, the fights are awesome. The Stands are much more creative than in the previous story arc and they are used in very creative ways. You can really tell how much Araki improved the fighting mechanic in this arc. This is probably the most bizarre aspect of Part 4: melting bodies together, turning people into books or trapping people in a time loop; these are just a few examples for the crazy abilities. There were even new types of Stands introduced: automatic Stands and Stands that evolve into a more powerful form over time.\\n\\n\r\nSadly DiU is much less \"GAR\" and manly that the previous parts. The characters are also not nearly as buff anymore. This was around the time when the mangaka started to change up his art style. David Production chose to make the whole arc look more like the second half the DiU manga, insteadt of having this (admittedly awkward) transition from bulky to skinny. \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the earlier seasons of JoJo, the animation looks very low budget at times. However David Production makes up for that with an unique artstyle, great use of color and lots of crazy effects. In the end it's very nice looking anime, despite some derpy faces and low quality character models here and there (they'll be probably fixing these things until the Bluy Ray release anyway).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack however was a bit less memorable than in previous parts, but I guess that's a matter of preference. I like how they remixed Jotaro's theme from Part 3 and the way they mixed up the opening theme in the last couple episodes was really creative.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Part 4 has all the bizarre action, manly tears and likeable characters that would you would expect from this series and it even improves quite a bit on some of the flaws in Stardust Crusaders. How do I say this...? It's a bit crude, but...hehe...I got a boner!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating:\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nGeneral production value: 7,5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n",

            "content": "To anime and manga fans, Jojo is a classic that many may have heard of. Even if you\u2019re not familiar with the franchise, you\u2019ll bound to hear something related to Jojo somewhere whether it\u2019d be a joke, meme, or reference. Diamond is Unbreakable chronicles the fourth expansion of the franchise and it\u2019s among one of the most celebrated. As a personal favorite, Diamond is Unbreakable sets up for an adventure that is far more than bizarre.\r\nAs the four story arc in the Jojo franchise, Diamond is Unbreakable unites a lot of similar themes from the previous series. These would include the unorthodox style of theadventures, the colorful character cast, the creative Stands that characters uses, and most importantly, its bizarre yet infectious humor. The first few episodes reintroduces a character we should already be familiar with, Jotaro Kujo. He travels to the town of Morioh and encounters a young man named Josuke Higashikata, the latest in line of the Jojo family tree. As a youthful man sporting an unusual hairstyle, Josuke is your typical teenager with a kind heart. Even his Stand (Crazy Diamond) represents his personality as it\u2019s able to heal and repair injuries. So in essence, don\u2019t be surprised if you see him helping out some stranger out of kindness. In many ways, he is similar to Jotaro despite their age gap. Furthermore, Josuke is a guy that I think most of us can relate to. He likes to hang out with friends at school while always eager to make more, is often curious about unusual events, and is incredibly protective of his family and friends. For most part, I think Josuke is a character that many of us will like quickly.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, Josuke isn\u2019t just the main star of the show. His friends Koichi and Okuyasu also gets involved in the strange bizarre occurrences as their lives changes forever. They discover the existence of Stands as the show sets up for the many storytelling about them and their users. In some ways, the show is similar to the previous installment. However, one of the main difference is that the show takes place mostly in Morioh as opposed to a world journey. With that being said, the series does a decent job at crafting the town with its many features. These ranges from Josuke\u2019s home, school, and the places he enjoy visiting. Then, there\u2019s also other places that strange occurrences happen thanks to one of Dio\u2019s lackeys and his supernatural Bow and Arrow. The storytelling of Diamond is Unbreakable follows many arcs that each feature a different antagonist, their Stand, and the problem they cause. It has a pseudo slice of life feel as most of these arcs are nonlinear in terms of plot. However, these arcs are important to develop the character cast. A prominent example would be Koichi as his Stand (Echoes) undergoes an evolution of change. It presents his development as a character from a timid kid to a courageous hero during his various confrontation with other Stand users. Okuyasu is also an example as a character that originally started out as an enemy of Josuke but changes into his best friend as the story progressed. Representing a more delinquent\u2019s side of the character cast, Okuyasu\u2019s personality changes as he takes devious risks to protect his friends and understanding them. Finally, I think a special mention should be given to Rohan Kishibe, a manga artist who serves more as a foil to Josuke. With his talent and abilities (including his Stand), he casts a narcissistic vibe with stubbornness. In essence, he\u2019s the type of that guy that is hard to make friends with and throughout the show, we can see his growing rivalry with Josuke. \\n\\n\r\nTo get the full enjoyment out of Diamond is Unbreakable, it\u2019s best to watch the previous series and get familiar with the Jojo universe. Part four introduces many new characters, some recurring while others are part of the \u2018monster of the week\u2019 structure. Noticeable characters such as Yukako, Mikitaka, etc will be more memorable while other may not be. Unfortunately for fans of Joseph Joestar, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed by his role for part 4 as his presence and significance is reduced to be only involved in minor story arcs. However, have no fear as part 4 also introduces one of most interesting antagonists in the entire Jojo franchise, Yoshikage Kira. As a serial killer and hand fetishist with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, you\u2019ll recognize that his role transform the story into a darker thriller. His appearance in the show adds a unique flavor that creates an aura of psychology. It\u2019s a contrast to the bizarre humor of the series, something that has existed since the beginning of part 4. By balancing the humor and darker elements, Diamond is Unbreakable brings out the best of its storytelling with its characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, I am generally satisfied with the faithfulness of the adaptation. Only a few arcs are rushed while most of the story flows consistent with the source. I\u2019m also impressed by how the adaptation captured the expressions of the facial reactions as it\u2019s not always easy. Kudos to David Production for making a good promise to deliver the best it can be. In the meantime, fans will also probably notice a change in the art style of this season. The backgrounds has a much radiant style with multilayer colors. Moriah town also deceptively look simple yet many complex events develop as the story unfolds. Most impressively are the character and Stand designs. Each character looks unique ranging from Josuke\u2019s infamous hairstyle to Kira\u2019s trademark Killer Queen Stand. \\n\\n\r\nThe evolution of Jojo\u2019s soundtrack still retains its depth and presence with its theme songs. \u201cCrazy Bizarre Town\u201d represents exactly how bizarre the show can be while the ED theme surprisingly has a more melancholic tone. However, what impresses me most is the overall directing of the soundtrack with its battle scenarios. Iwanami Yoshikazu\u2019s talents are recognized easily as he is able to work around between balancing the slice of life moments and the intense fight scenes. Furthermore, character voice mannerism is credible to their characters. Kira\u2019s voice tone is perhaps the most memorable for his egocentric personality and sadism while others like Koichi will be recognized for their courage and loyalty.\\n\\n\r\nSo what should fans look forward to most from Diamond is Unbreakable in the end? To be honest, it\u2019s very simple. A show like this will be best enjoyed as a bizarre entertainment with what it presents. It\u2019s essentially a series that takes creativity to extraordinary levels. Every story arc delivers some sort of unusual conflict to bring the bizarreness true to its form. The fights are crafted with creativity that rather than relying on strategy can be enjoyed with sheer entertainment value. And that really is what Jojo is about. It\u2019s bizarre entertainment at its finest.\\n",

            "content": "I'd like to preface this review by saying I totally understand why you might enjoy this show. Don't just look at this review, see its rating then click off. This review is a thorough dissection of Araki's Manga and DP's adaption of DiU. It's more of a fun than deep experience but I'm going to explain why DiU's critical flaws make the show very VERY difficult for me to enjoy. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story starts off insanely strong with a shot of a severed hand being in someone we don't knows home. The story is about a serial killer using his Stand to hide himself andkill. That's an awesome premise. Too bad its hardly a factor of the story and it's mostly just the cast stumbling upon enemies that are just trying to use their stand to regenerate their body and petty theft. It loses so much focus. YUKAKO HAS A DEVELOPMENT ARC AND THEN HAS LITERALLY NO IMPACT OR TIME IN THE STORY AFTERWARD. IT WAS PROBABLY THERE JUST TO SHOW AYA TSUJI EXISTED.\\n\r\nNow onto why these fights and arcs have no impact on the story and why its downright purposeless...\\n\\n\r\nI will accept the fights could be entertaining but the fights of this part are just not as well executed or choreographed as those from other parts. There are some exceptions like Highway Star but Araki even recycles ideas for stands and the environments are very strained as its mostly taking place in a house or on a street. Also these fights have minimal stakes due to Crazy Diamond being able to perfectly regenerate people. AND these brawls just have really forgettable, uninteresting enemy abilities. It puts these at even more discredit because these fights DON'T feel connected to the plot. Unlike parts like 1, 3, 5, and 7 where the enemies are either other members of the mafia that want something the heroes have, opponent racers pursuing the same goals, assassins hired by the enemy, minions, etc. The enemies in DiU are mostly just randoms. Plus the characters associated with the fight and some of the unique ideas usually carry the bland and boring execution on its back. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks great and on model at times as does the animation but the key word is sometimes. Its animation can be fluid. The character designs are honestly great even for the minor villains. Although the characters can look great but even with the very simplified facial designs and vibrant colors the show still has big aesthetic problems. There is constantly bad frames. This is likely because the seasonal split that SDC had wasn't there. So they didn't have time to break or get back budget. The constant outsourcing made the main villains stand reveal a literal laughing stock. So much so I still see it getting meme-d on social media. The animation and art in DiU can be vibrant and fluid but it also gets unattractive and stiff. So much so you start to wish there was a seasonal gap.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music is catchy and fits the situation but it feels like a drop from SDC. Also Savage Garden all the way through instead of something as calming and beautiful as Last Train Home was a huge mistake. Last Train Home surpasses it in every way. You just get this tranquil feel of the Crusaders comradery. As you see them casually moving around Egypt together. It paints a very peaceful picture in your head. With I Want You, you have a very out of place song with very out of place direction. The Josuke in the end credits singing is so spontaneous and out of place. Its not remotely edited well is really forced in. (I'm not gonna criticize I Want You as a song because I am not into music criticism so that's why I more criticized its sloppy direction and what it does for the anime as opposed to dissecting the lyrics of a song from a 90's Boyband)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nHere's where we get to DiU's biggest problem as well as it's best part. \\n\r\nI'll start by putting it simply Rohan, Koichi, and Kira are the best characters of this arc. Their characterization, development, and their focus almost always makes the episode great. I could do an essay on why Rohan is such an amazing character BUT simply put he is an excellent, greatly developed, incredibly layered and interesting character. Also the fights on the aforementioned tend to have impact on their character more so than ANYONE else in the show. Araki also does a very poor job at doing mass characterization AND making characters likable. Unfortunately you see a lot of Josuke and Okuyasu. Now I know A LOT of people like these characters. But hear me out. I do not hate these characters but they have very BIG problems as basically the leads of the part.\\n\r\n1) They have confused character motivation\\n\r\n2) They are stagnant and their development arcs doesn't effect them as characters\\n\r\n3) They are less interesting than characters that could've got more spot light \\n\\n\r\nOkuyasu:\\n\r\nHis brother dying is one of his main drives into the plot. That and his attachment to Josuke leading him in conflict by association. But Okuyasu wants revenge even though he accepts his brother is a bad person. They do not flesh out the fact Okuyasu wanted to avenge someone he knew was wicked. It doesn't dive into his psyche or feelings of justice or ideals. Just simple revenge motivation. It's insanely shallow and doesn't do ANYTHING fresh or unique. Now maybe I would forgive this if Okuyasu just didn't feel so bare. He meets his brothers killer, the person he wanted to commit revenge on. Then he loses. Then he meets him again. Can't beat him and then Josuke beats him. So Okuyasu gets no resolution with his brothers killer AT ALL. He doesn't confront him in the hospital. He doesn't kill him. They have no excuse because Kakyoin and Polnareff just is so much more satisfactory in terms of ending Pol's revenge arc. Kakyoin even helps him on what to say so he can feel fully satisfied when murdering the man who killed and raped his sister. And after this arc that goes literally nowhere Okuyasu doesn't get any more development for the rest of the show. Which honestly makes him just a one dimensional comic relief. He's entertaining but his character goes nowhere, is shallow, and has a really lame arc that doesn't effect him.\\n\\n\r\nJosuke:\\n\r\nJosuke is nowhere near as bad of a case as Okuyasu. Josuke just gets less development and less consistent development than side characters like Yukako. And often forgets everything about his development where he wanted to become a force of justice. He commits fraud, tries to scam Rohan out of a ton of money, bullies and manipulates a 12 year old for money, and it wouldn't be such a problem if his greed didn't undermine his one development arc. You CAN NOT make his ONE development arc motivate him to become a force of good to protect the town and then have him not FEEL LIKE protecting the town he was so motivated to save. Especially when he literally wants to go against the law he wanted to uphold earlier in the show. It creates some interesting and funny conflicts but just really hurts his character. He doesn't get development outside of that arc and the arc REALLY doesn't affect his character. Like I can't do a page long analysis of their character because its just contrary traits and shallow personalities. Which is a huge problem as they are the big main characters of the show and suck away characters like Koichi and Rohans time.\\n\\n\r\nNow one problem about a really good character; Kira is they try to introduce this part of his personality where he's falling for Shinobu but they bring it up once, don't expand on it, and it just feels forced in and Araki probably just forgot to capitalize on it.\\n\\n\r\nBack to one horrid aspect about Araki's mass characterization... you can't make a psychotic outcast like Hazamada likable when in the same arc you're trying to make him likable in you make Rohan read off that he tried to rape a girl and then chickened out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall DiU has some of the best characters in the franchise but also some of the weakest. And Araki despite making a great villain has a very hard time at naturally tying characters to the plot AND handling mass characterization well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it sometimes. It could be fun. It could look pretty. Its story could hook me in. And it genuinely has AMAZING characters. But for all the fun that I had, I was too distracted with problems to enjoy myself. For all the beauty there's ugliness. For all the times the story had me, the payouts and dicking around on side stuff lost me. For every good character's time in the spotlight there's a significant amount of time spent on a much weaker, shallow character. Every time DiU does something great or good it does some thing to balance out its positively with very damning problems.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a perfect score for DiU. I feel like its truly great characters save it from a 4/10. It's also pretty damn weird and pretty damn funny. But the animation and art problems. And the shallow leads. And the poor mass characterization. And the much weaker soundtrack compared to other parts sits it in a very rough place in terms of JoJo parts and other seasonal anime at the time. Definitely not a bad show, I can see why a lot of people would find enjoyment in it. But its lack of focus on its best characters, its lack of focus on its originally incredible story, sits it in a purgatory. Stuck between giving it audience something to love and shooting itself in the foot for 39 whole episodes.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Jojo: Diamond (PT 4).\r\nWhen Diamond tells the main story it usually repeats the excitement and anticipation that Jojo is known for.  \r\nDiamond has certain interesting stands like Crazy Diamond & The Hand which makes you anticipate their uses and potential. \r\nThe art direction in Diamond is a better step for Jojo, character designs are slim. Diamond removes the over-masculine/stiff design that Jojo 1-3 had. \r\nThe color palette accompanies the new character designs with smooth and soft fills.\r\nThe opening themes fit in the 1/3 and 3/3 sections of Diamond. The ending theme like in all the Jojos borrows a popular western tune. \"I Want You\"by Savage Garden is a catchy 90s pop tune fitting the aesthetic of Diamond. \\n\\n\r\nNow the issues with Diamond are substantial.\\n\\n\r\nDiamond takes a new approach to the structure of events, Diamond is full of fillers, which erode the main story. I appreciate the neighborly approach but it doesn`t help tell a good story. \\n\r\nDiamond constantly picks up the pace and suddenly turns away from major events to have \"fun.\" \\n\r\nDiamond has many characters which lack screen time and ultimately make you not care about them. \\n\r\nDiamond shows Jojo characters at their peak of stupidity, characters shout; nothing happens; no one runs, noises and events are ignored, and there are many scenes where no one summons their stands to help a struggling cooperator. \\n\r\nOur protagonist Josuke`s lack of appearance and action make it appropriate to label his friend Koichi as a more important character.\\n\r\nJojo 3.5 Egypt has a terrible ending and it is repeated in Diamond, the ending isn`t clever, it`s all ended with a big whammy.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and illustration quality degrade at many points in the season, however, it hardly detracts from the season. \\n\\n\r\n\"Chase\" by Batta is a good song off Diamond but it doesn`t match. Jojo isn`t a straightforward bad-ass series, Jojo always indulged in campiness, over the top characters and actions. Jojo gets serious but retains its core elements, which makes the \"Chase\" OP a strange approach visually and sonically. \\n\\n\r\nDiamond like Egypt is disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nSuggestion Rate for a Jojo Fan: 10/10, All the Jojos tie, you have to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI don`t want to suggest a sequel to someone who hasn`t seen the predecessors.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You though Stardust Crusaders would be the last of the JoJo adaptations, but it was me, Diamond is Unbreakable! Jokes aside, the adaptation of the next part is finally over after a 39-episode run. David Production has proven to be a very loyal studio when it comes to adaptations. For the last couple of years, David Production have been working on adapting the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series written by Araki Hirohiko into an anime format. After doing an adaptation for the first three JoJo parts, David Production has adapted the fourth Part of the series, Diamond wa Kudakenai also known as Diamond is Unbreakableor\u2026 Diamond is not Crash if that\u2019s what you prefer. Though Diamond is Unbreakable isn\u2019t quite popular in Japan as to let\u2019s say the previous part, Stardust Crusaders, or the next one, Vento Aureo, it\u2019s still well respected. However, in the west it is much more popular. Diamond is Unbreakable is my personal all-time favorite JoJo part\u2026 even more than Steel Ball Run. But does this adaptation manage to be perfect like the previous parts? Well in all honesty, this might just be the least loyal JoJo adaptation from David Production, yet it\u2019s better than most adaptations of this generation. That says something\u2026\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise in Diamond is Unbreakable is just as simplistic as the previous part. The story revolved around the town of Duwang, um, I mean Morioh and how after the presence of an arrow that can give people the ability to use Stands, Morioh is now filled with an ever-growing amount of Stand users (both enemies and allies) and it\u2019s up to Josuke and his buddies to handle this issue. However, within the Stand users in Morioh hides a serial killer who targets women in the town (well their hands to be precise) and the allied Stand users must work together to stop this hidden serial killer and protect Morioh. First of all, unlike the previous and the upcoming JoJo parts, Diamond is Unbreakable takes place in one town and never leaves this setting. The characters don\u2019t go on an adventure all around the world, nor do they take a month to get to Egypt. It\u2019s just one town with one goal; to protect Morioh. Diamond is Unbreakable is known as the slice-of-life JoJo since its more about the characters fooling around while there\u2019s Stand users to handle every week. Despite the fact that Diamond is Unbreakable is written in a smaller scale and that its initial premise is simplistic, there is no doubt that this part is the most interesting part story-wise, when compared to the previous parts. Even when compared to the future parts, it\u2019s still better than all of them (though Steel Ball Run is on the same level). The first half of the series is simple fun, but once the main antagonist gets introduced, Diamond is Unbreakable ends up becoming an intense and somewhat unpredictable cat-and-mouse chase. Despite the fact that it\u2019s not as large-scaled as Stardust Crusaders, its climax ends up being a satisfying fight that uses more strategy than brute strength. Diamond is Unbreakable proves that bigger is not always better.\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nDavid Production has always managed to be the top of their game when it comes to loyal adaptations and they proved so with the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series. They manage to capture the style and essence the manga has. David Production is so loyal about the adaptation that they even write out the sound effects in the series. But not only are they loyal, but they\u2019re also dedicated to the series. Whether animating the meme moments in proper quality, or changing up the OP to match the antagonist\u2019s ability, these little things show how much David Production cares about this adaptation and how they\u2019re not making this anime simply to cash off from the fame the manga has. Diamond is Unbreakable is adapted in full glory here, especially with David Production changing up their art style to what the manga series ends up being. Starting from the fourth part, Araki changed up his art style from the original gritty, gar, and manly art style with tank-style characters, to the new vivid, stylish, fancy, fashionable art-style with skinnier characters. Despite the art style change, it still feels like JoJo. You still have those epic sound-effect text, disproportional poses, epic one-liners, cool battle cries, and the weird alterations of color and lighting. However, due to the length of Diamond is Unbreakable being 11 episodes less than Stardust Crusaders, yet the manga being a volume longer, some tiny moments ended up being cut out. One or two lines from each episode would get cut out and some comic relief moments too, but they\u2019re nothing bad enough to be noticeable. These cut outs are similar to Phantom Blood\u2019s and Battle Tendency\u2019s.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure never falls behind with their characters and Diamond is Unbreakable is no exception. As a matter of a fact, Diamond is Unbreakable has the best JoJo cast I have ever seen, with every character feeling likable and fun. Josuke is a fantastic protagonist with a fantastic personality. He\u2019s my favorite JoJo, just right after Joseph. He\u2019s the perfect mixture of Joseph\u2019s lightheartedness and Jotaro\u2019s chillness, while having Jonathan\u2019s gentleman personality to him. With him having a running gag about how he can\u2019t tolerate someone making fun of this hair, to him showing his dedication towards protecting Morioh, Josuke proved to be an all-rounder. Stardust Crusaders is completely gone as Jotaro is part of the main cast in Diamond is Unbreakable. He\u2019s just as important in this arc as Joseph was in Stardust Crusaders. Throughout Part 3, Jotaro have more of a fixed personality and in some way, he was a bit bland, however Diamond is Unbreakable makes his character have more personality and feel more enjoyable. He still cool and relaxed, but he\u2019s also wise and makes some jokes too. This might be due to him being a decade older than he was before, but either way he\u2019s a lot more interesting. And then we have the JoBro of the part, Okuyasu, and he\u2019s just as dumb as most other JoBro\u2019s, but that\u2019s what makes him fun. His unintentional humor makes the series feel more lighthearted and fun to watch. Every JoJo part always has that one little kid that plays some type of role. In Part 4, Koichi is one of the main characters of the series and he really grows on you. He originally starts as a kid that kind of ruins the fun by describing everything that goes on (I\u2019m looking at you, Speedwagon\u2026 but you withdrew coolly). However, managed to be a lot more badass than he originally seemed, and he can be quite smart too. And then we have Rohan\u2026 Araki\u2019s self-insert. A mangaka who also joins the gang later in the series and he easily is the most interesting character besides Josuke and the main antagonist of the series. But with all said and done, the character that truly steals the show and the one who ends up being the best and most complexly written JoJo antagonist ever, is Kira Yoshikage. Simply put, he\u2019s weird yet normal, awkward yet cool, and a scumbag yet likable. From his hand fetishes to his will to stay in Morioh and continue his hobbies, Kira proves to be an absurd, yet believable character. With his appearance coming late in the series after many buildup, all of it gets payed off. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAs mentioned before, David Production did an amazing job in adapting in Diamond is Unbreakable\u2019s art style. In the previous parts, the series had a more darker look to it and the characters were the size of a football stadium, in Diamond is Unbreakable, the art is much more brighter and the characters don\u2019t look like as if they bathe in steroids. Though the previous parts used that art style for its charm, Diamond is Unbreakable has its own charm, one that gets used in the future parts too. The previous parts used to alter its color palette at times to add a greater affect. Diamond is Unbreakable does that too, but it happens a lot more often. And this are sometimes colored in an unnatural way for style, such as the sky being purple or yellow at times. Despite the art having so many good qualities about it, its undeniable that the quality is pretty inconsistent. There\u2019s some moments when character models were lack proper detailed or look deformed, especially if the characters are shown from a greater distance. However, the series makes up for it with its killer close-ups and some of them have a better quality than what was in the original manga, such as the close ups for the Stand, Killer Queen. Also, any issues with the art quality are being fixed with the Blu-ray and DVD release. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animation quality is really good in Diamond is Unbreakable, however when compared to Stardust Crusaders, it is a bit lacking. The thing about Stardust Crusaders is that it originally started off with mind-boggling animations that seemed like as if David Production is a masochist and they enjoy putting too much detail into the tiniest things. However, as the series went on, the animation quality started becoming normal. Diamond is Unbreakable starts off from the normal quality of Stardust Crusaders, however, this quality remains the same throughout the series. There are some moments when the animation quality gets inconsistent and things aren\u2019t as smooth as they should be, but Stardust Crusaders also suffered from the same issue. You won\u2019t be able to expect anything legendary from Diamond is Unbreakable\u2019s animations, but you won\u2019t be disappointed either. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe recurring characters have the same seiyuu as they original had. Josuke\u2019s seiyuu in the anime is different from the one that played him in the video games. And with these 39 episodes, it\u2019s clear that Ono Yuuki is the perfect match for Josuke. He gets Josuke\u2019s delinquent feel right, while making him a nice and kindhearted man. Also, he says \u201cDORARARARA\u201d the best. Ono Daisuke returns to voice act Jotaro, and he does just as good of a job as he did in Stardust Crusaders. He manages to make Jotaro feel a badass and you will never get enough of that \u201cORA, ORA, ORA\u201d. Okuyasu\u2019s seiyuu is the same as the one that was used in the games. Master of delinquent voice acting, Takagi Wataru does a great job in making his character sound like a complete idiot, while making him likable. Koichi\u2019s seiyuu is also changed and the game\u2019s seiyuu wasn\u2019t used. Though I was kind of disappointed that Romi Park didn\u2019t reprise her role, but Kaji Yuki does a great job as Koichi and he doesn\u2019t disappoint. Though it\u2019s a little weird since Kaji Yuki voice acted Johnny in the games, so I wonder who will voice act Johnny is Steel Ball Run gets an adaptation again. Kaji Yuki? And even Rohan\u2019s seiyuu gets changed too. Though Kamiya Hiroshi might be the better seiyuu, Sakurai Takahiro proves to be the better match for Rohan. Kamiya made Rohan sound a little too rough when Rohan\u2019s supposed to have more chill than that. Sakurai executes that perfectly. Also, Kira\u2019s seiyuu has been changed too, for the better. Koyama Rikiya was great and all, but Morikawa Toshiyuki was completely sinister\u2026 as expected from Griffith\u2019s old seiyuu. He delivers the lines perfectly, especially the creepy ones. Overall, all of the seiyuu changes in Diamond is Unbreakable is for the better.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nA JoJo part isn\u2019t a JoJo part without great music, and I got to say, this has got to be the best music I\u2019ve heard in a JoJo part. The series has three openings and one ending. The first OP \u201cCrazy Noisy Bizarre Town\u201d is a funky and fun opening that capture the slice-of-life charm of the series. It\u2019s super catchy and the music for it has good beats. The second OP, \u201cChase\u201d, isn\u2019t something you would hear you would expect from JoJo since it has more of a shounen-y feel to it, but the song is really good and the vocals and music for it amazing. The final OP, \u201cGreat Days\u201d, is easily the best one from Diamond is Unbreakable. It represents the theme of justice and hope the series used throughout, plus its really upbeat and fun to listen too. Just like the previous JoJo seasons, Diamond is Unbreakable\u2019s ED is a western song from the last century. \u201cI Want You\u201d is a fantastic ED that feels really catchy and matches the slice-of-life tone of the series. Though it would\u2019ve been nice if it had another ED (maybe something from Queen would\u2019ve been nice, but the license would cost a fortune), but it\u2019s fine the way it is. Kanno Yugo strikes gold with the OST of Diamond is Unbreakable. He did a great job with Stardust Crusaders and Ajin and with Diamond is Unbreakable, he showed the best of his work. The main theme of the Part is fantastic and is on par with Part 3\u2019s theme. And the variation of the theme \u201cStand Activated\u201d is really good too. The OST, \u201cThe Stardust Man Appears\u201d is really cool to and it matched Jotaro very well. \u201cSudden Battle\u201d is always perfectly used, \u201cThe Hand\u201d is perfect for Okuyasu, \u201cIrreversible Sadness\u201d is used perfectly for the saddest death in the part, and \u201cCourage\u201d works well with Koichi. But the best OSTs are the ones that are used for Kira. Kira\u2019s main theme, \u201cKiller\u201d, is perfectly composed to add that mysterious and uncomforting feel. \u201cSecond Bomb\u201d and \u201cThrid Bomb\u201d felt very intense when it was used in the series and \u201cAnother Face, Same Mind\u201d is another great Kira track. Overall, all of the OST manages to elevate the enjoyment for this series and there\u2019s no doubt that Diamond is Unbreakable has the best soundtrack of the year. \\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nSaying that I didn\u2019t enjoy Diamond is Unbreakable is like saying Trump in not the U.S. president\u2026 it\u2019s utterly false. Right after the latest season of Gintama ended, I needed something that could fill up that emptiness inside me. JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure did that. Not only is Diamond is Unbreakable amazing, but it\u2019s also the best part of the entire JoJo series. With so many hype moments with great voice acting and music used, it felt immensely satisfying. Even with some moments being cut out and some \u201cquality\u201d moments, David Production makes up for it with its stellar close-up art quality, and managing to represent the new tone and style of the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series. David Production was the best thing that happened to JoJo and JoJo was one of the best thing that happened in the anime industry. Simply put, there\u2019s no other anime like JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, and Diamond is Unbreakable simply continues on that legacy. Plus, another gureto doze of amazing memes!\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve watched the previous JoJo parts and liked them, I don\u2019t need to recommend Diamond is Unbreakable to you because you\u2019ve either already watched or you were just waiting for it to end. For those who found Stardust Crusaders to be a hit-or-miss or found Jotaro to be a bland protagonist, don\u2019t worry, Diamond is Unbreakable is a much more consistent Part and Josuke is a great mix of the previous JoJo protagonists. With a much stronger story than the previous parts, and a new and stylish art style, Diamond is Unbreakable stands out more than the previous parts. And Part 4 easily has the best soundtrack of not just the entire JoJo series, but also the best of the year. The voice acting cast is perfect and it was a smart choice to change up some of them and use seiyuu who didn\u2019t do those characters in the games. If you haven\u2019t gotten into the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series yet, don\u2019t worry, you have the holidays to catch up if you\u2019re interested. With Diamond is Unbreakable, JoJo proves that it has its still creative with its ideas and still have a bright future ahead with David Production\u2019s support. \\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic characters, including an entertaining protagonist and the best antagonist the JoJo series has ever seen.\\n\r\n+ The story in Part 4 is much more complex than usual with unexpected twists and turns and keeps the viewers captivated. \\n\r\n+ David Production does an excellent job in maintaining the manga\u2019s style and representing the new JoJo art style.\\n\r\n+ Fantastic OPs and ED and the OST is the best of the JoJo series, and in particular, the Kira OSTs are brilliantly composed.  \\n\r\n+ The new art style is stylish and vivid and the art looks exceptionally good at times, especially during the close ups.\\n\r\n- Production values are a bit inconsistent at times as some characters models far away can lack detailing, however, the BD/DVDs fix that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10",

            "content": "(If you're 11 and haven't experienced JoJo, skip to the safe space for my 'spoiler free' interview)\r\n1999\r\n\"Let the joy of love give you cancer\"-Araki\r\nThere's a reason why DiU sits near the top of almost any JoJo fans ranking.\r\nBecause its an absolutely and positively inspired piece of work.\r\nLet's get the obvious criticism out of the way first. While the voice acting is grade A, this show puts the ugh in ugly, (I.E Quality Queen). But some episodes (I.E Bug Eaten) are stellar looking, with strong color pallets and character design. It's just quite obvious the budget from part 2 isn't there, which, while a shame, isn'tdeal breaking. At this point the Duwang scans have made me feel like Oliver Twist, I just want some more you know? I'll take what I can get from David Productions, as long as they deliver my beloved part 4, from Tony to Rock Paper Scissors to Ambulance, we're cool.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is what they did. \\n\\n\r\nA common criticism leveled at part 4 is it's lack of focus. It doesn't start the \"plot\" and introduce the main villain until a third of the way through; but can you blame Araki for not knowing (at first) how to follow up a planned trilogy with a clear conclusion? While its unfortunate the first section of DiU isn't so smoothly connected to the rest of itself (Josuke time traveling, Araki how did you forget that), it is an undeniable fact that when Araki is provided breathing room to experiment, he gives his best work (See SBR). \\n\\n\r\nStands positively SHINE in part 4; gone are the \"monster of the week\" stands of part 3, which are replaced by a variety of stands that complement their given user. Echoes evolves alongside the growing Koichi, Heavens Door fits a mangaka such as Rohan like a glove, and The Hands overwhelming power is balanced only by the sheer stupidity of Okuyasu. Some stands have zero combat potential whatsoever (Cinderella, Pearl Jam) and exist solely to further the atmosphere of Morioh. While punch ghosts are fun, and Jotaro gets plenty of strong screen time, it's Araki's unbounded creativity that makes DiU so fun and unforgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said the lack of Josephs mannerisms and catchphrases doesn't leave a bit of a hole in my funny bone. However, Araki does manage to preserve the magical humor of previous parts in DiU. If anything, JoJo has never been funnier. Jotaro's straight faced autism remains strangely both bad-ass and comedic, and Josuke's new personality mixes well with characters like Rohan and Okuyasu to create those bizarre situations we love. Then there's stands such as Stray Cat, Boy 2 Man, Earth Wind and Fire, and of course, Cheap Trick. Cheap Trick will leave you in a pool of piss on your hospital bed that you can't clean up because you're restrained and sedated. It's unfortunate that part 5 and 6 didn't take some notes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked how Araki could possibly follow up DIO, then I imagine Kira as the proverbial slap in the face as his response. Whether or not you think he deserves a quiet life, the sheer presence Kira exerts on the show from the get-go is undeniable. Kira has personality, wit, motivation, luck (are those sirens?) and mother-fucking Killer Queen. A serial killer is a logical conclusion to the question of a villain in a setting such as small town Morioh, and Kira is as competent as his real life look alike. (R.I.P David Bowie)\\n\\n\\n\r\nJoJo op's are legendary, and for good reason. They're love letters; with hand-crafted songs tailored to fit certain parts of the story, bundled with little references for veterans to the series. As songs, CNBT and Chase are worthy successors, but as opening videos, they fall just short of Stand Proud or Sono Chi no Sodome. Still good op's, but the budget just doesn't seem to warrant a video I could call gre...\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Great Days.\\n\r\nI've never seen or heard an opening embody a series so perfectly. And the rewind version features absolutely genius cuts and sound effects, making the DiO version of End of the World look like a linkin park amv.\\n\\n\r\nAnd \"1999 Bizarre Summer\"? Holy shit that's a lyric? \\n\\n\r\nI got a boner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only proof anyone should need to understand that David P is the studio worthy to adapt JoJo to the end, is Morioh Radio. It's a foreign element to the manga, but who would know? That high energy radio jingle only seeks to heighten the atmosphere of bizarre Morioh; and it speak volumes about the love and dedication the series is being shown by its creators.\\n\\n\r\nSasuga David. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Kiddie friendly zone)\\n\\n\r\nMe: How's the show, Josuke?\\n\\n\r\nJ: Great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai Review\r\nStory (9/10) Great\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\r\nThe Story for Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure I felt was great for it's uniqueness and laid back atmosphere presented in majority of the Part. It's definitely nothing like the first 3 Parts when it comes to tone as the first 3 were a combination of comedy, tension, hype fights and bizarre situations. Now although you can say that this Part of JoJo's had all of those things it definitely added it's own flavor of slice of life to the series which at first (back in 2015 when i read themanga) I thought it was odd (or should i say Bizarre) but Part 4 makes it work. Now back when I wrote my review for the manga I gave this section a 9.15. I do think the anime as far as from a presentation standpoint did present Araki's story very well, not perfectly but definitely nothing to complain about from an adaptation standpoint of quality. Now the actual issues I have with the story plot still exist which to name a few... Mikitaka (The Alien Character) his whole character straight to the end of the Part is still a mystery never do we find out if he is an alien or not and the Invisible never do we get to figure who where the hell it came from (spoiler nor do we ever get to see that baby in future parts grown which would have been cool but I'm saying this here to not get your hopes up, now if the baby did it wouldn't bother me so much but whatever). But the biggest plot that bothers me the absolute most and the reason that stops me from giving this section anything more than a 9.50 is Josuke's past. You remember when Josuke how he got his hairstyle? Do your remember that flash back?? Yeah the Josuke look alike? I bet you (and I sure did myself) assumed that Josuke later in the series went back in time to save himself somehow and it'll all come back around by the time the Part concluded NOPE. Guess what! and Here's a fun fact Araki (creator of JoJo's) actually wanted to do that! He wanted to somehow make Josuke (just like Kira) get a power up to his Stand to the point where he has the ability to go back in time which would make sense for how Josuke's Crazy Diamond ability works already (reverting things back to the way they were) so reverting time some how via a power to the Stand wouldn't have made me scratch my head. Kira was suppose to do something that forces Josuke to go back in time, he wanted to incorporate Josuke going back and saving himself during or after his final fight with Kira, but the idea was scrapped because Araki himself didn't know how to make it flow well by the time he got to the final fight. (This is what happens when you don't think your story plot through before writing it) it just has somewhat of an idea of what he wants to do and writes it as he goes. This Araki story structure mind-set has (in my opinion) hurt the overall JoJo's series as since Part 3-Part 7 all have certain things in their overall story plot that is similar to this Part as far as Araki having an initial and amazing idea that he wants to incorporate that eventually doesn't play out because he either didn't know how to incorporate it by the time it was time or he changes his mind on the initial plot point which SUCKS because if you hear some of the things he wanted to do for Part 3, Part 5, Part 6 and Part 7 it'll make you pissed off, I digress since it doesn't ruin any of the stories of those Parts (except Part 6.. fuck Part 6.. just kidding). Great story for Part 4 nonetheless and the anime is the better way to experience it in my opinion even thought the manga still has great art style which wasn't adapted perfectly over but we'll talk about that in the next section.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation for this Part of JoJo's was great. Although like I said a little in the story section certain scenes from an art style standpoint was not done justice (like the time they first showed of Killer Queen.. but then was cleaned up in the next episode). And the fact that the overall art style for Part 4 was changed from the manga as in the manga the noses for the characters are similar to how Araki draws the noses of his character in Part 6 which is a weird decision DP (David Productions) decided to go with.. Either way the whole presentation from an animation standpoint was great every ORA and DORA was greatly animated and I'm far from unsatisfied with DP's work.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Outstanding \\n\\n\r\nEvery single voice actor, every single ost, every single sound effect were all outstanding. All of the opening songs was fire and i never skipped them once. The fact that when Jotaro get his shine they'll play his \"Jotaro is about ORA dafuq outta someone\" song from Stardust Crusaders is nostalgic and outstanding. David Productions did an outstanding job with this section no more is needed to be said. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\n*So when it comes to characters I'm going to paste basically what I said with some modifications to what I said from my manga review is it's basically the same.*\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in Part 4 are straight up great. All of the characters (this includes the side characters and enemies) felt unique and great. I can't think of any character that felt like a waste of time or generic (now Tamami is debatable if u want to consider him i wouldn't) everyone's role they were suppose to play felt fitting and entertaining. The MC Josuke is definitely different from the previous Joestars before him which is good because when I saw is stand Crazy Diamond I thought he was going to be just like Jotaro, and to an extent they do have similarities when it comes to their stands (ORA ORA to DORA RA RA) and their sense of and for expensive real life fashion wear is similar also. But other than that, that's where it ends. But the other character indeed do remind me of characters from Part 3 with Okuyasu reminding me of Polnareff and Rohan reminding me of Kakyouin but that's only 2/6 from Part 3's crew that have similarities from the crew from Part 4. Kouichi gets a lot of spot light and shows off great character development and never before seen features from the abilities from the Stands. Mikitaka the \"alien\" as he calls himself was never really explained which urked me a quite alot and he's not the only one that's like this (invisible baby to name another). Like I said earlier the mystery behind the character who inspires Josuke's hairstyle we never really get to find out who that is although we can make assumptions and say that was him from the future and HOPEFULLY something happens in future parts to showcase that but for now it does bother me that we didn't get to figure it out in this part. The main antagonist Kira Yoshikage definitely had some shoes to fill because Lord Kars and Dio Brando are some big shoes to fill. Did he live up to the expectations of a OP JoJo's antagonist/villain? Ehhh debatable, I'll tell you what though out of the 3 of them Kira probably got the most screen time then both Kars and Dio by far, Kira has episodes and mini arcs dedicated just to him, we definitely got a big insight on the sick and weird mentality he had going on with him and with just that alone I think he was a great antagonist for Part 4. His stand Killer Queen was deadly and his companion the Stray Cat definitely had a great climatic battle between Josuke. The main reason i felt i couldn't give this section anything higher than a 9.50 was because there were still some unanswered questions that I felt are most likely never going to be answered that are directly related to characterization like who the guy was that inspired Josuke's hair style, even though I hope it gets explained in a future part I highly doubt that is going to be answered in future Parts but if it is then props to that specific part I'll give the credit to THAT part not this one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Part 4 was my reason for waking up one Friday. JoJo Fridays as people call it and every single week it was a treat to look forward to. Even after reading the majority more than a year ago it still was the anime I looked forward to the most every week. Now that it's over man.. Fridays are going to be a drag. This Part of JoJo's definitely taught me that JoJo's is best watched weekly vs binged (at least in my opinion).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) Great \\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.70/10) Great+ \\n\r\n(Or should I say Gureto desu!)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching Part 3 of JoJo's a year ago I didn't think David Productions was going to animate Part 4 so I went ahead and hoped over to the manga to read it only to be surprised a couple weeks after I finish reading it that it's getting animated! David Productions did a phenomenal job with Part 4's adaptation and I can't are for future Parts to be animated by them! Ougon No Kaze Let's go!\\n",

            "content": "The JoJo franchise is one I have some fondness for. It has an absurd naming scheme, over the top machismo & action, but I've still found it pretty endearing. I've talked about JoJo, Stardust Crusaders series 1 & 2. This time around, I'll be discussing Diamond is Unbreakable. Like the others, this is brought to us by David Production. It aired from April to December of 2016. I look forward to seeing a bunch of characters named after musicians & bands fighting in an absurdly over the top fashion. Let's get right to it.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Joutarou heading to a small town called Morioh tomeet Joseph's bastard son, Jousuke. Yeah, apparently Joseph had an affair with a woman forty years younger than him when he was in his sixties. Way to keep it classy, Joseph. Arsehole. Joutarou wants to discuss the old man's inheritance because, at this point, Joseph's really old and could die from a heavy wind. Actually, now seems like an opportune time to go into a detail that bothered me in the last series, but I couldn't go into too much detail about because it was a spoiler. But, since this series takes place after the ending of that one and goes over the basics of what happened, I can talk about it freely here. Okay, so Vanilla Ice is turned into a vampire by taking Dio's blood but we also saw Joseph take Dio's blood so why isn't he an ageless vampire with the same appearance that he ad in the last series while being unable to go out in sunlight. Rather like I can't on account of being a pale ginger. That seems to be a thing with this franchise, the internal logic doesn't always hold up. Any way, it turns out that there's some dangerous stand user on the loose in Morioh with an arrow that can create more stand users. So, Jousuke begins his own bizarre adventure, aided by Joutarou and some friends to find the arrow. This quest ultimately brings them into conflict with the town's most notorious criminal and stand user.\\n\\n\r\nLet's look at the issues with the series first. And it starts with the aforementioned internal consistency problem. Here's the thing, our group of heroic stand users summons an elderly Joseph to Morioh to help them find the stand user who controls Red Hot Chili Pepper. He arrives but they end up not needing his help. So, he sticks around doing bugger all. Then they encounter our main antagonist for the series with his stand, Killer Queen. He escapes them and they begin the hunt for him. So, no one thinks to have Joseph use his Hermit Purple, the stand that he was going to use to find a stand user for you, to find this guy? He's literally right there. He could do it with no real risk to himself and you could find this guy in five minutes. Another example comes with Jousuke's stand, Crazy Diamond. It's established that his stand can heal, but can't bring someone back to life and yet, he manages to put someone back together who gets blown apart. How does instantaneous death not happen in that situation? We also have Kouichi's super unhealthy romance sub-plot that serves no purpose but makes for an awkward, uncomfortable time. This series also gets some rather dreadful attempts at \u201cstreet\u201d dialogue from Kouichi's Stand, Echoes. This thing spells out the word shit on multiple occasions and it does it with the mannerisms of someone who thinks they're tough, but they just come across as cringey and trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, the series still retains its sense of over the top machismo fun. It's also very much self aware about it. It's not asking you to take it really seriously, it's asking you to join in the fun. That's especially apparent in scenes where the characters monologue about why they're going to win and strike over the top poses. It's also pretty obvious in, for example, the Pearl Jam episode where everything is a bit of a goof. I also do appreciate the way this franchise establishes its battles as being less about brute forcing your way past an opponent and more about tricking them into a corner. I rather like seeing the characters playing mind games.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth iteration of JoJo and his Amazing friends is just as archetypical and trite as all the others. Similarly, the antagonists are just as much evil for the evils. There are three major ones. The first is a serial murderer and rapist. Has been since he was all of twelve. The second is a murderer and thief, which isn't as bad. The final one is a long-running serial killer who makes women disappear and keeps one of their hands to serve as his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d Dude, just buy a mannequin and use its hand. Still weird, but at least it won't make you terrible. All three of them are completely unrepentant for their crimes. This series also maintains the franchise's tradition of having a main cast that's largely enjoyable in spite of their relative shallowness as characters. The naming theme of band & song names continues, although this time it's used for the stands. Araki Hirohiko must have really liked Pink Floyd since two of the main stands, Crazy Diamond & Echoes, are named after their songs. In addition to the other ones I've mentioned so far we also have Super Fly, Cheap Trick, Highway Star, Heaven's Door and others. Stay tuned for the tenth JoJo where someone has the stand, Dinosaur Laser Fight. (I don't actually know if he's gotten that far or what the stands are called if he has, but that would be amazing.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAre you ready for muscular boys with absurd hair to strike over the top poses? If that sounds awesome, this anime has you covered. The art style continues to be overwhelmingly macho. I think my beard actually grew by ten centimetres just from watching it. It's that macho and my beard wasn't exactly short before. I do like a lot of the action sequences in this. That's one arena where I'll keep giving this franchise credit. Even with the pauses for monologues and dramatic posing, it has some solid, creative action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSo, what kinds of performances can you expect? If you said that it's going to be largely over the top and exaggerated, congratulations on your pattern recognition skills. That is exactly right. The cast they got is good at that. Ono Yuuki, Ono Daisuke, Kaji Yuki, Sakurai Takahiro (Hi, Cloud) & Morikawa Toshiyuki (Hi, Sephiroth) are all good choices for that. This time around the ending theme tune is a selection from Savage Garden's I Want You, which is appropriately ridiculous for the ending theme tune of an action anime. Kanno Yugo's score is quite good too.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nJousuke & Okuyasu get a bit of a \u201cbromance\u201d going. But this franchise has never been big on romance and this one's no exception. Even Kouichi's kind of shit het romance is pretty downplayed.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis series... this entire franchise is ridiculous and I can't deny that I enjoy watching it. I didn't like Diamond is Unbreakable as much as I liked the first half of Stardust Crusaders, but it's still solid and I liked it bout as much as I have most of the franchise. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week will kick off horror anime month and I'm going to start things off with a review of Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror.",

            "content": "Jojo's part four continues the pattern of following the hereditary lineage of Joestars and taking you on a bizarre adventure packed with creativity, action and heart. Unlike the previous iterations, there is no crossing of borders or seas with life or death stakes. Instead it's set in the comfy but no less intriguing community of Morioh.\r\nThe characters are no less colourful than the bright pink and yellow skies of Morioh. The beginning is set into motion with Joutarou arriving with an agenda regarding the growing number of cases involving Stands. It follows Jousuke, a delinquent looking yet loyal to those he cares about high schoolstudent with a hot temper when it comes to his hair. While he likes to partake in questionable money making schemes, he is always there for a friend in need and this sensitive side to him makes him the most likable JoJo protagonist yet. \\n\\n\r\nHe is also Joseph Joestar illegitimate son and while that felt a bit out of place with the Joseph's character the estranged relationship was handled nicely with bitterness, acceptance and a dash of awkwardness. This was highlighted in the final episode with Jousuke using his Stand ability to steal his money and picture of his mother as they departed. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the story revolves around Morioh and has a Slice of Life feel along with the typical Stand of the week. The fights always involved a level of tactics and creativity to overcome odds and the outcome is never quiet what you expect. At the same time these encounters helped build the world, not everyone who was given a Stand was a bad guy. Often characters and places return in unsuspecting and often clever ways. While the adventuring is scaled down in geographical measurements, it explores the concept of the place between life and death and while only touched upon lightly it is an example of one of the locations Jousuke used for strategic purposes a multiple number of times. Or the way the cat plant Stand was reused by Kira and then again by Hayato. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I liked was how all the characters felt like different shades of gray. Rohan, Shigekiyo and Okuyasu all had antagonistic roles before becoming acquaintances with Jousuke. Even the main antagonist Kira was humanised; he wanted to live a peaceful, quiet life and while he had his morbid urges and sociopath tendencies, it made him into a multidimensional villain. The second half is more focused on chasing down Kira and it was as just as thrilling to see a Killer Queen vs what-have-you Stand as it was to see Kira try his best to adapt into a new life. \\n\\n\r\nOST, voice acting and sound design were all excellent and exuding with manliness. Props to the classic rock ED which suits the time period of 1999 really well. While some episodes stood out more than others animation wise they all retained a level of solidness. This might of been helped by the unique and stylistic character designs and vibrant color palette.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable is filled with intense and some of the most ridiculous battles ever, great colour coordination and a cast of memorable and fun characters. It doesn't deliver the same level of globe trotting as it's for-bearers but it's journey having spent more time on each character individually creates a down to earth yet epic feeling that is unparalleled.",

            "content": "\u2022 Foreword for those interested in Diamond is Unbreakable with no knowledge of the JoJo universe.\r\nOk, as a note to people that maybe are reading this that have no knowledge of the other seasons or parts of JoJo and are interesting in picking it up, I can say that each JoJo part can work independently of the others and can be consumed in any order you want, although the most optimal way is watching them in order as to not be spoiled. You see, JoJo is organized in parts, with each part following the story of a different protagonist from the Joestar family, in acompletely different setting, location and time and each capable of working indepedently of each other, with the story arc starting and concluding in each respective part. So if you're not interested in lets say in the premise of Part 1, which is: a man called Dio Brando seeks to rise from poverty and get a better position in life by trying to inherit the Joestar's family wealth after succesfully being adopted by them. In the process Dio comes in contact with a stone mask tied to supernatural powers, this setting a chain of events that etched in stone the entire JoJoverse. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the premise of Part 4 may sound more to your liking: Through an ancient artifact, people have been granted special abilities called stands, with each stand having varying capabilities most often very different and unique from each other. This story follows Josuke Higashikata, a descendant of the Joestar family, trying to uncover different stand users as to make sure his town will stay safe from the constant danger created by an influx of stand users created by the artifact, and stop whoever is responsible of this from creating more users.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I've presented the premise of two different parts was to give an example of how different the premises of both parts can be and how they follow different settings with different characters, although, again, each part has some major spoiler for its former parts. If you're not interested in the former parts for one reason of the other, or you'd rather watch this part first after learning about it, only then start with this.\\n\\n\r\nYou will most likely enjoy any JoJo if you're looking for a series with over the top action where they can be either downright silly, (intentionally) really hype or really unsettling. You will most likely dislike any JoJo if you're not gonna be willing to treat its story or its universe as somewhat senseless to some extent and aren't willing to enjoy its ridiculousness when it serves it.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Differences between previous parts.\\n\\n\r\nNow from this point on this might help people that have had dropped the former parts, because I'm gonna compare Part 4 to its predecessors. There's two key differences between Part 4 and all the previous JoJo parts. The first one is a style shift, with JoJo dropping its initial GAR look and going for a more smooth looking style. While there's still some manly man in the style of JoJo, now the masculine features put into the characters have dropped a bunch. The second key difference is the fact that the characters are now in a stationary setting, rather than having them travel from point A to point B. This is what I mean by this:\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: Protagonist trains his powers to seek out a villain around the country and stop them, with most enemies being allies of that villain trying to stop him.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: Protagonist trains his powers to seek out a villain within the continent and stop them, with most enemies being either allies of the villain or seeking to understand the villain's powers.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3: Protagonist gets powers because stands are now a thing and seeks out a villain across the globe while the villain's allies are sent after him.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm severely dissapointed that this part isn't named Diamond Is On Mars, I have to admit that it was a pretty good decision since the characters presented in Diamond is Unbreakable don't have an one track mind and they can have motivations outside the premise of the story itself. The worst problem that Part 3 had, Stardust Crusaders, is that any characters it has had introduced are confided under one goal and have only one motivation, while the story is not trying to do anything out of the ordinary, and only banks on the novelty of the stand concept at that point. You knew exactly why a stand user did whatever they did as soon as you've seen them, that being the villain existing. It was so bad in Stardust Crusaders that you could literally skip after the first few episodes to the last few episodes while probably understanding most of that story arc due to how many insignificant events it had. Which was probably a result of JoJo trying to find its footing because during the first two parts it drew large influences from Hokuto no Ken, and why the first two parts are far more story focused than Part 3.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm here to say that the same problem I've mentioned about Stardust Crusaders isn't here. While the series still retained the structure of stand user of the week that Stardust Crusaders had, the fights have different implications and presentations, because of the particular setting of Diamond is Unbreakable. You see instead of being limited to \"i'm working for villain-sama\" this is a town full of people living normal lives whilst 1/75 people has special abilities. In a realistic scenario, people would find different uses for their powers, some would use them for the betterment of the community, some would use them for personal gain and satisfaction, some would use them to wreak havoc and most importantly, due to the sheer number of them, they would most likely be living independent of the villain. This gives the writer of the series the opportunity to develop the personality and motivations of the character far more uniquely and realistically.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to the other parts of JoJo, those before Stardust Crusaders, Part 4 has very little to do with fantastical elements with the series having now almost nothing to do with the powers presented in Part 1 and Part 2, while Stardust Crusaders still retains them for obvious reasons. That is to say that if you disliked the powers in Part 1 and Part 2, Part 4 is when they are pretty much fully dropped.\\n\\n\r\nOne difference that is worth noting that Part 4 is very stationary compared to pretty much any other JoJo Part written. Due to the nature of things happening in an enclosed space with seemingly random encounters, it will feel far less adventurous than the other parts, since the protagonist won't go on a journey with a goal to get something or stop some villain from achieving a goal that would have some fairly large repercussions. Part 4 is captivating in a more mysterious and bizarre way where anyone can be someone dangerous unbeknowst to each other that they may be a threat to your family, friends or people you just pass by everyday, while everywhere else in the JoJoverse the confrontations are obvious.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another very significant difference is the drop of the frequency of sound effects presented in the series that may displease some because of the missing lingering menacing, but this is due to the fact that there's a stand of who's powers are represented that exact way in this part. They seem to tone them back up at one point.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Essentially what you should expect from the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo what you need to know about Diamond Is Unbreakable is the following. It is a series where characters are presented in situations either silly, ridiculous, creepy or all the aforementioned at the same time in confrontation with each other. It will be mostly comprised of action scenes but there will be some episodes where the stands won't be doing any fighting. The plot of the series is mostly a device to form these situations and it is not thoroughly complex but no way worse than its predecessor, Stardust Crusaders, as its initial scenario will keep suffering some changes and it will explore the motivations of a multitude of people which usually will still be there living in the town rather than be there just once.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series is generally over the top and bizarre, just like you'd expect from the title, with some (censored) gore and pretty unusual situations. Although the series if presented out of context could look quite ridiculous, in the context of the world, it can easily be taken seriously as far as the action goes and the fights are always well thought-out and very well planned strategically, featuring powers that prove more worthwhile the more witty and creative you are. Although sometimes the strategies do fall apart due to sheer occasional ridiculousness of the characters. For those looking for the type of action I've described, it's very unlikely that you will not enjoy JoJo a lot for this reason alone as I can hardly think of anything that can match it in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle of Diamond is Unbreakable is a result of dropping its former GAR look for a more realistic and more fitting for its setting look where the people in the series look now more normal than before and their features aren't pronounced in a way that looks them that make them look that super manly men. The design of the world is mostly comprised of a mix of some light or darker shades of yellow, green and purple textures, blended in a way that makes the town inconspicuous, quiet, but still represembling a somewhat lively community living around. Most of the designs of the world and characters are well done and blend really well with everything that goes around creating a modest town where some bizarre things happen.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are well represented and nicely fleshed out usually in this part, you shouldn't expect them to be essential to the story, despite being more involved than in the former part. You still need to keep in mind that the style will depict them in over the top ways to take them seriously as this is part of the style of the series and merely an artistic way of depicting them as to exaggerate some traits. The character motivations will vary from seeking personal gain, to trying to protect their community, to fuck it.\\n\\n\r\nYou are likely to enjoy Diamond is Unbreakable if you're already a JoJo fan or seeking a series with some very entertaining action and some over the top downright bizarre scenarios which focuses the interaction between different people with different motivations with superpowers. But only as long as you can accept that JoJo's purpose is to build upon these scenarios even at the expense of the story, with the premise itself having to adapt more to the scenarios and ideas for characters presented in the story, rather than the character and scenarios presented be tailored specifically for the premise given. Diamond is Unbreakable is a very entertaining action series that you might enjoy if you've liked what you've heard about the series. If most of what you heard turned you off, you shouldn't expect enjoying Diamond is Unbreakable.",

            "content": "Plot: The beginning of part 4 of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (Diamond is Unbreakable) Is kinda all over the place. It isn't until the introduction of the part's main antagonist where the show begins to shine. \r\nArt: The art style was changed drastically from the previous parts. As a fan of the old art I was disappointed at first but I quickly got used to the new one. Aside from the introduction of Killer Queen all the stands look beautiful as well as the fights. The color pallet is constantly changing throughout fights which adds a really cool effect.\r\nSound: The sound is one of the highlightsof this parts. Three AMAZING opening songs. AMAZING character themes my favorite being: \"Morioh Cho Radio\", \"The Hand\", \"Killer\", and \"Another Face, Same Mind'. Lastly the sound effects used in fights are not over-the-top and subtly compliment the epic fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is THE best part of Diamond is Unbreakable. The entire main cast are well-written characters. The main villain is the greatest villain I have ever experienced in ANYTHING. The return of old friends from previous parts. Honestly, this part's main Jojo, Josuke Higashikata, gets really shadowed by the awesome characters in his part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.\\n\\n\r\nFriday was the highlight of my week every week this was airing.

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in general is an interesting show because I don't like it for a very specific reason. I dislike Jojo because I cannot ignore the fact people explain the plot or fight moves while standing by spectating. Yes, sometimes the show will poke fun at itself with Jojo saying \"Why are you just standing there\" (or something to that effect) but I just can't. It reminds me of shows where suddenly the hero gains some ridiculous power or strength because love, friendship, or intense emotional states. Bleh. \r\nLike \"Oh my god, look! He isn't digging in the ground, he's building up forceful energyto better kick his opponent in the head! Oh no, look! his foot fell off!\" (this is exgaggerated on purpose). But, you get the point. \\n\\n\r\nThis is in no way meant to bash Jojo, or those who love him (I believe I may be in the minority here) but another reason Jojo is a bit over-rated (literally, people over rate this show) because it is associated with childhood....and any show that reminds people of the freedom, innocence, lack of responsibility, and that \"oh i'm having so much fun I gotta go poop!\" feeling....will show up in the \"All Time Top 10s\" until a new generation replaces them. \\n\\n\r\nFor example: Cowboy Bebop, Mobile Suit Gundam, Geon Genesis Evangeleaveitalone, Digimon, Pokemon....etc. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Jojo DOES stand out because it has a story that CAN be argued to not be just for kids, or teens. IT is a wonderful story and balances the plot, action, comedy, feels, and goofy humor in a way that reminds me of Gintama. But I can't get over people explaining moves and plot details like a conversation or joke. Maybe this is on purpose. maybe its a paraody. IDK can't watch it!",

            "content": "DORARARARA!\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai brings us to the quaint *cough* mundane city of Morioh, a new Jojo with Josuke Higashikata, new Stand users be it allies or villains and our major focus for Part 4 being searching for a serial murderer who's been out on the loose for almost 15 years...\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai's core cast for the most part LA enjoyed alot though there were some aspects of the \"Morioh Warriors\" that could had more potential from them. The newest Jojo of Josuke voiced by Yuuki Ono reminded LA alot of Joseph Joestar in Battle Tendencymixed in with Stardust Crusaders, as Josuke implements and uses his Stand \"Crazy Diamond\" to constantly unique and inventive ways of combat even though at the start it's more a defensively overpowered ability of \"fixing things\" and yeah it's kinda weird yet awesome having three generations of Jojo's all in one due to Joseph, Jotaro and Josuke all being in Morioh to the lurking threat of the major villain hidden away in Morioh and trying to find him.  But nonetheless Josuke was an excellent addition to the lineage of Jojo's and a proud one at that. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the Morioh Warriors, Koichi Hirose voiced by Yuki Kaji was an all round extremely useful character outright and he had MANY shining moments for himself, he was pretty integral to the plot as well as his own misadventures and he was some of the few core members who developed immensely throughout the anime and that showed in both appearance and his Stand as it literally grew stronger and stronger as the episodes past. Okuyasu Nijimura voiced by Wataru Takagi being the first villain turned ally for Josuke like Koichi developed along the way but his was picked up and finished for the weakness he portrayed of being dumb and only taking orders as he didn't know any better, but over time, he was usually by Josuke's side and was even in the same wavelength as him and he grew out of taking orders and him thinking for himself to save the core cast at times, LA \"did\" wished he got some more development but nonetheless he was still fine in terms of plot. Rohan Kishibe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai, was something of a reference to Hirohiko Araki, as Rohan is a manga artist and he portrayed some of Araki's weirder aspects of himself, but Rohan was kinda of an interesting character in a ways, being \"friends\" with Koichi and doing anything it'll take to be a mangaka by experiencing everything and that obviously applies into his Stand. But development-wise, he wasn't exactly an enemy Stand, but once the major plotline of serial killer arose, he too toke hold of the plot and helped immensely with the plot. If anything Rohan and Koichi were almost working as deuteragonists outside of the Jojo's. The last of the core cast LA will talk about is Yukako Yamagishi voiced by Mamiko Noto and she gets the least screentime from the Morioh Warriors, not helped by the fact she turns into a satellite character for Koichi and being a yandere but like many of the core cast develops (albeit with one episode dedicated to herself) but at the end she kinda flips from yandere to shy girl with a crush (LA says it's odd as it's usually the other way around). With that, LA liked Rohan and Koichi the most from the Morioh Warriors, but Josuke being the main protagonist was great too  and as much as LA wanted to put Joseph in LA's favorites but really couldn't from his very limited screentime, Jotaro stole the show even though HIS screentime was limited as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo to go a little in-depth with Josuke and his Stand powers, his is used uniquely in comparison to Jotaro's no holds-bar mental fisticuffs all due to how defensive Crazy Diamond is applied, but it allows not only his powers to manifest in his personality but allows us to show that his powers are used not for himself but to help others as the only downside to his Stand powers is that he can't fix his own injuries and thus it allows the other core cast members to help or even be in the limelight from either fights or their own character arcs due to his defensively overpowered powers. LA did say that Josuke is a bit like Joseph and this is kinda weird since he's the illegitimate son of Joseph and thus in turn Jotaro's nephew, so LA can easily see how his personality is like Joseph but the even more carefree and reckless version of him (this due to the setting of Morioh, not unlike Jotaro's save the world setting) in this regard. So all in all, Josuke as a Jojo is fine addition with his Stand powers complimenting his personality that in turn helps with the other supporting cast and the core cast as a result.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, well LA will be here all day if LA talked about all of them, so let's get LA's most notable characters down, Yuuya Fungami voiced by Kishou Taniyama was one of the enemy Stands that turned over a new leaf and was added into the plot afterwards well as odd of a Stand power he had, Tonio Trussardi voiced by Tokuyoshi Kawashima had the least screentime in the ENTIRE ANIME and had thee most bizarre Stand power in the anime at that, Shigekiyo Yangu voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi had prominence in the middle of the anime and kickstarted the major plotline of the anime and for what little time he had in the anime, he was kinda awesome, if it wasn't for his greedy personality. Finally Reimi Sugimoto voiced by Sayuri Hara was something like the core goal and belief that the Jojo's and Morioh Warriors were striving for and her presences in the anime was greatly helped.\\n\\n\r\nSo LA will now be going into spoilers and talking about the major villain of  JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai, LA did it for Stardust Crusaders with Dio and LA wants to talk about the major villain here, LA just has to.\\n\\n\r\nSo, our major villain of JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai, is that of Kira Yoshikage and is the serial killer that's been out on the loose in Morioh, but here's the thing, he's a serial killer that just wants peace in his life, going about his daily grind and the come and kill an innocent woman for her hands (no seriously) as it's an urge for him to suppress the stress in his life. So yeah Kira is a psychopath and shows ALL the signs for it. As for his Stand \"Killer Queen\",  well much like how Josuke utilized his powers in inventive and unique ways, so does Kira and he uses explosive powers to anything his Stand touches, you can see how this makes things interesting or intense in this case, let's not get to the point of the bow and arrow Enyaba had from Stardust Crusaders came into his possession and most probably how he got Killer Queen Stand. Dio Brando was a human villain mixed in with force of nature villain for Stardust Crusaders due to his THE WORLD Stand, but Kira Yoshikage is a completely different brand of villain, of being an entirely human villain for the entire cast but being a complete psychopathic murderer and Hirohiko Araki gave a new twist on his villains with Kira as although he is evil and malicious to achieve his peace in life and still murder in the process in comparison to Dio's \"evil to achieve immortality but needing to kill out the Joestar lineage in order to do so\". Kira Yoshikage was a brilliant villain in which you both want to sympathize with him, but his explosively murderous tendencies and the lengths he'll go to hide it is immeasurably villainous.\\n\\n\r\nSo those Stand powers, LA will easily say that Araki has nailed the usage of new and bizarre Stand powers now, Stardust Crusaders was his testing grounds using Egyptian and Tarot Cards themed Stands, but with Morioh, it's all free reign and Araki went all out with the Stands and their usages, LA said about Kira and Josuke, but even one off Stands like Cheap Trick or Rohan's Heaven's Door were explored and utilized throughout the plot incredibly well, even to the point that one shot Stands turned into Chekhov's Guns for the plot that easily made the anime intense and changed the game of the anime many times over. \\n\\n\r\nHell LA will even say that due to the expansive ways Stands were used and the plethora of characters by extension, that MORIOH itself was a character due this, with all the quirky landmarks and oddities that Morioh itself experienced in the anime. Araki made it that it was like your typical city filled with living characters going abut their day and if you managed to make your CITY be alive through it's bizarre incidents and characters, THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, done once again by David Production, well what can LA say, it's typical high ended, crazily well done animation from them, again implementing color changes and palette swaps on a whim to the bizarrely crazy battles that was adrenaline pumping even for some of the more one shot cases. Character designs were vibrant, exotic and unique and always coming from Araki's blueprints from the manga and of course Jojo's brand of quirkiness it had to it. Really what can LA say about David Productions and Jojo's, they just go hand in hand high quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was great as well with major props to Yuuki Ono as Josuke, Yuki Kaji as Koichi, Takahiro Sakurai as Rohan, Rina Satou as Hayato, Toshiyuki Morikawa as Kira,  Sayuri Hara as Reimi, LA could go on but nonetheless the voice cast was AMAZING especially from Yuuki Ono. Toshiyuki Morikawa and Rina Satou. LA will say this as this is Joseph's departure from the series but also to Unshou Ishizuka the voice actor for Joseph who passed away in 2018, rest in peace my man, you will forever be Joseph Joestar and an incredible Jojo at that.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai was another fresh take of finding a serial killer in a city and running with it with all the Stands and whatnot for Araki and is probably one of the best parts of Jojo's for LA as of now, Stardust Crusaders is too awesome in it's own regards, but Diamond wa Kudakenai just had that something, was fully realized and was fully executed in all it's glory in it's own bizarrely awesome way, sure Diamond wa Kudakenai had it's problems with development of it's characters which was LA's only gripe with and the occasional \"Araki forgot moments\" of  Part 4 but that's small potatoes to the bigger picture. Diamond wa Kudakenai was just amazingly well set up and executed and LA was quite literally at the edge of LA's seat alot of the time and not alot of animes does that for LA. JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai is bloody brilliant and unbreakable, what else can LA say but... \\n\\n\r\nWhat a beautiful Duwang.",

The story has an interesting beginning, then loses some of the quality, but still something medium. To summarize, the story of \"Diamond wa Kudakenai\" is beautiful, perhaps one of the most beautiful of Jojo's, has a happy ending, different from others, has narrative elements beyond the center line and works very well the villain and other characters.\r\nArt: Likeall Jojo's art, always very original, detailed, and well made. Some characters have the traces as reference to the famous of the music, as it is the case of Kira (David Bowie). Magnificent and wonderful art. It is worth mentioning that the Stands here, get much more stylish and well made visuals than the other parts. Killer Queen is a good example of this!\\n\r\nSound production: In the openings? Impeccable! In the anime itself? Nothing much different, it has good ost's but nothing that is as epic or differential as the previous parts.\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, here it is worth noting that my note is above what I expected from the anime myself, and the culprit of this is the character Yoshikage Kira, one of the most worked villains I have ever seen in the shounens, something worth mentioning. The anime's preoccupation with putting other characters as narrative masters is always brilliant in Jojo's, it makes us closer to the character.\\n\r\nJosuke may not be the best character in the anime, but he's still a good character with a kinder soul, which reminds us of Jonathan Joestar.\\n\r\nSeveral characters gain prominence in the work, and have their moments as owners of the narrative.\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Well, I admit that this part may not be the most attractive, at first really it seems that nothing will happen great, but from the moment Kira is inserted into the work as a villain, the narrative accelerates!\\n\r\nDiamond Wa Kudakenai is one of the best parts of Jojo's, incredibly able to make a villain more built than the greatest villainous icon of the Work: Dio Brando. Yes, Kira manages to be a better villain than him in technical matters.\\n\r\nDiamond features dramatic moments, moments of tension and extreme distress, which puts the viewer's mind to work.\\n\r\nI do not recommend that you watch without first watching the previous ones, because it's very worth seeing the whole connection between the characters!\\n\r\nA good work, with a good ending and good characters!",

            "content": "The JoJo franchise has long appealed to those who are appreciative of fashionable character designs, attractive visuals, over the top action with a dash of absurdist comedy. Diamond is Unbreakable takes that formula, adds a Slice of Life mystery to the equation, throws it all in a blender and turns the dial on high speed. It took people some time to adjust to the new flavor, but the result was arguably the best JoJo has ever been.\r\nUnlike previous seasons this story takes place in a single location - the town of Morioh where stand users are popping up for unknown reasons and an outbreak ofmurders have become rampant. This town is an incredibly fun environment where every corner of the street has a unique story to tell and each character has an odd quirk that defines them in a memorable way. If not the best character cast, it is certainly the most robust headlined by three generations of Joestar decedents and and the infamous Kira Yoshikage.\\n\\n\r\nAs per usual in this franchise, art is a strong point. This anime makes up for not having a ton of fluid animation scenes by creating a beautiful aesthetic that is appealing to the eye. The colors leap out of the screen almost telling the story itself, and the attractive character designs make them all very easy to identify.\\n\\n\r\nThis is JoJo at its finest, told in way never seen before in the franchise, and in a manner that is easier for more people to enjoy than just it's former target audience.",

After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winningand losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom this very quote I could tell the brilliance in character that makes Diamond is Unbreakable a fantastic continuation from Jojo. Even after finishing the series a year ago, I still very bizarrely remember this same monologue given by one of the characters. It has left such a mark on me that I will surely always remember this series for what it is. The story takes place in a city known as Morioh, where our character Josuke lives his regular high-school life until a series of murders occur in his quiet town. The setting is typical and the premise is nothing special, but that's not what makes this diamond shine bright...\\n\\n\r\nAside from the very vibrant color palette that very nicely characterizes the bright nature of the city of Morioh making it feel alive, and aside from the phenomenal OST that brilliantly captures the essence of several characters, and aside from the genius stand inventions that you will see across this series (which, for the record, is leagues better than Stardust Crusaders), it's the characters that really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nIn comes our antagonist. A man who leads a casual life that goes to work, enjoys his day, comes home, relaxes, and then sleeps at a regular and coordinated schedule. Completely normal. Yet, that's what makes this character so brilliant. He's the definition of normalcy and all he wants is to live his own quiet life - until he experiences intruders in his personal lifestyle. Time after time, it is a relentless struggle of him trying to avoid these new intruders - what do they want and why are they intruding? Naturally, if you wanted to live a quiet life like this, you'd be annoyed when someone interrupts it, no?\\n\\n\r\nAnd here lies the issue with our antagonist. His perception of reality is completely average and mediocre and he fails to understand why anybody would ruin his normal life. He wants to avoid trouble at all costs. The antagonist is a walking paradox of trying to live a quiet life, but also does anything to obtain this mean - an inherent contradiction in introducing noise in his calm and typical lifestyle. His drive to continue living this way pushes him to extremes, and even near the end of the series, I found it so disgustingly human in how he pushes himself to the absolute limits to prevent anyone from shattering this ideal. \\n\\n\r\nNever have I seen such a character that has captured the essence of \"what is human\" in being an antagonist; minus a certain deviation which would be a spoiler, if revealed. His paradoxical nature and the absolute trait of being a mediocre civilian makes it sheer brilliance. Villains don't have to be extravagant, they don't have to have a corrupt wish to bring destruction to the universe, nor do they need to exist for the sole reason of stopping the protagonist. Sometimes, villains are completely normal people too, and this concept was masterfully executed in Diamond is Unbreakable.",

            "content": "Before I get into my actual review, as well as not to distract from its quality I\u2019m going to breakdown (See what I did there) common questions that people have asked before, are sure to ask now and for every subsequent part of Jojo\u2019s going forward, this is for you people, newcomers and otherwise.  I want to give future readers the most complete understanding of this series and by extension this franchise as humanly possible, so-----here you go:\r\nACT 1- The Q & A\r\nQ: What is Diamond is Unbreakable?\r\nA:  Diamond is Unbreakable is the fourth part of the long running Jojo\u2019s franchise.  Itis one of the more story heavy out of the bunch. It isn\u2019t particularly hard to follow,but there are quite a few intricate plot points that come into play over time in the story rather than immediately like most battles/ segments in previous parts. While it is also easy to follow and quickly gain a grasp of, this isn\u2019t your best starting point.\\n\\n\r\nQ:  Can I start Jojo\u2019s here?  If not what is my best starting point?\\n\\n\r\nA:  Yes.  You\u2019ll still be able to understand what is going on to a certain extent.  However I highly suggest against it.  Watching Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure (2012), Stardust Crusaders Season 1 and Season 2, then this, in that order would better engross you in the franchise and maximize your experience.  Also no, I don\u2019t suggest skipping parts there\u2019s no filler so there is really no point in doing so.(Plus I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re like me at all you like feeling like a smart ass when people ask you information on a series.)\\n\\n\r\nQ:  Is the series worth watching?  Would I be wasting my time?\\n\\n\r\nA:  Again, yes.  Even if you don\u2019t enjoy it, it is worth the look.  There\u2019s just such rich and deep history behind the Jojo\u2019s franchise.  It began as a homage to the late Fist of the North Star series which inspired other beloved franchises such as Berserk and Street Fighter.  Jojo\u2019s carries with it a powerful legacy inspiring its own fair share of series such as Persona.  In short Jojo\u2019s understands what a winning formula is, it takes some of the best aspects of battle Shonen anime and breathes life into the genre with unbelievable flare.  It is definitely worth a peek if not just to understand why it is so popular.  \\n\\n\r\nQ:  What makes Jojo\u2019s so good?  Why is everyone so interested in it?\\n\\n\r\nA:  Depends on who you ask really.  For some people it\u2019s clever writing and flamboyant, masculine style.  For other people Jojo\u2019s hit its peak in part 2 and will never be as good as the masterpiece that is Battle Tendency.  Others the over the top characters and the powerful, legitimate bonds they share. For me, the constantly changing narrative and wonderful world and lore are why I love Jojo\u2019s.  There\u2019s really not one person that\u2019s going to see the exact same thing from Jojo\u2019s, even between parts.  To advertise one as definitively the best or worst to you would be insincere on my part, as I really love them all.\\n\\n\r\nQ:  The Manga, how is it?  Am I missing anything by not reading it?\\n\\n\r\nA:  I suggest it. Some characters are handled slightly different, but I must say David productions takes so much care with this series. There are plenty of scenes and small bits that are not present in the manga, primarily in this part, that flesh out the world a lot more.  On the other hand, some of the fluff, such as certain conversations were shortened, reduced or completely removed. In short you aren\u2019t missing much other than actually consistent art work,  some dialogues that don\u2019t really matter to be honest and a certain character ( Okuyasu) changing from more of a thug who\u2019s kind of a softie, to a softie that kind of pretends to be a thug, but really isn\u2019t if that makes sense.\\n\\n\\n\r\nACT 2- The Review:\\n\\n\\n\r\nOh, how I have waited for this day.  I get to review DiU and by extension give my minor thoughts on some of the rest of the series.  If you just want the short answer, Diamond is Unbreakable is a good series.  Go read it, go watch it, I don\u2019t care.  If you even remotely like Shonen the likes of Yu Yu Hakusho, Hunter X Hunter, One Piece, Fist of The North Star,  etc.  you are doing yourself a HUGE disservice by not watching this series. This was hands down my favorite show of this season.  After the shit fest that were the Berserk 2016 and Ace Attorney anime adaptions, I was disappointed, but there was one show that never failed to put a smile on my face.  It may sound like I\u2019m sugarcoating it but I have such a love for Jojo\u2019s.  After those failures, OH YEAH, I believe a bit of positivity is in order.\\n\\n\r\nDiU follows the lives of three seemingly ordinary teenagers,  Josuke Higashikata, Okuyasu Nijimura, and Koichi Hirose,  who would be leading similarly ordinary lives as they start a new high school life, but of course that won\u2019t be the case.  Jotaro, the main protagonist of the part 3, now a side character, is investigating the mysterious forces within the town of Morioh.  Josuke, Okuyasu, Koichi and those around them awaken to extraordinary powers which lead to strange encounters and deadly showdowns.  The series is primarily broken into two groups for most episodes,  Josuke and his group of friends and Koichi and his group of friends (which take up a surprising majority of episodes).\\n\\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, that summary I just gave you is less than about \u00bd of the series.  It is a common belief that DiU is episodic which could not be further from the truth.  I don\u2019t know any other way of putting it, telling someone that is literally a straight out lie. While on the surface, the audience jumping into this straight off of the heels of Stardust Crusaders may think from the setup that Diamond is Unbreakable is just a less interesting version of SC\u2019s \u201cvillain of the week\u201d plot it really isn\u2019t.  Episodes 1 through 16, actually serves as a way to introduce the supporting cast and develop character relationships.  In other words, the antagonists are more than just obstacles to overcome. The ACTUAL plot from episode 17 through 39 revolves around Josuke and the gang chasing down a murderer who shares a similar power to theirs (albeit with a few more of those \"obstacles\" to overcome).  The series from here on out gets much darker, with many twists and turns and some of the best fights in the series.  I won\u2019t say more about the story, as doing so would ruin it and it is without doubt the best thing about DiU.  Just know this commonly accepted \u201cfact\u201d,  much like any badly held stigma, is not true.\\n\\n\r\nYou\u2019re probably wondering, \u201cHow\u2019s the animation?\u201d  I won\u2019t lie; I believe Stardust Crusaders was the best season animation wise. Take note, because I\u2019m really going to focus on SC here.  The character designs in DiU are neither as crisp nor as detailed to be honest.  The characters however are really smooth looking in most scenes, giving off almost rubber appearances. As far as errors, well\u2026.some of the animation errors were too consistent in the initial run of this series.  I\u2019m obviously not going to spoil anything here, but there are a few episodes that were handed over to a completely different studio from David Productions.  They got their hands on an episode where a character reveals something VERY important and I don\u2019t even need to mention it.  People who watched it know what I\u2019m talking about and if you plan on watching it you will too.  At this point it\u2019s like bringing up episode 5 of Dragon Ball Super. That\u2019s still a thing people talk about right?  To be blunt, it damn near killed the hype of one of the most badass reveals ever and in truth it really upset me how little care was taken with that in particular.  However, where DiU lacks in comparison to SC it actually fixes a lot of the problems I had with the previous part.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest fix as far as animation I must say is that they severely toned down the amount of color changing.  It may not have been a big deal to anyone else, but SC inverted color sections were not always easy on the eyes and seemed to happen a little too often.  DiU thankfully has bright colors, but  it\u2019s a much more mellow and pleasant color scheme, rather than looking like an explosive comic book.  The auras also look a lot nicer and much more distinct than in previous parts. However, the best additions to me are the old film filter and the way signature poses are portrayed.  The still shots are a lot more interesting and much more dynamic than they ever have been.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is fantastic.  Each intro from the catchy yet mysterious Crazy, Noisy Bizarre Town, the melancholic but fitting Chase, and the triumphant and conclusive Great Days are visual and audio treats.  The ending theme, I Want You by Savage Garden is  also just, for a lack of a better word, perfect.  The rest of the soundtrack you will find has more rock and synthesized \u201csounding\u201d music this time around.  The soundtrack is quite memorable, If you\u2019re curious about that, they\u2019re all floating around on the internet.\\n\\n\\n\r\nACT 3- The Conclusion:\\n\\n\\n\r\n\tListen by the time this review goes up I\u2019ve already watched all but the last episode of this series twice.  I\u2019ve gotten friends, family into this great franchise, not that I suggest you showing the series to someone who\u2019s sensitive or easily disgusted.  There\u2019s some content even in DiU that isn\u2019t for everyone.  I may sound a bit biased. I may be gushing way too hard. But I\u2019ve had some of the best conversations of my life just discussing Jojo\u2019s. I earnestly believe that it is series like Parasyte, Hunter X Hunter, Kill La Kill, Jojo\u2019s, etc. that will be defined in the future as the \u201c New\u201d anime classics.  There\u2019s a lot to value here, interesting characters, clever writing, stylish animation, catchy music, and in truth a series that is both like and unlike anything and well\u2026.everything I\u2019ve ever seen.  There were faults to be sure, which is what kept this series just shy of a higher score, but I have to be somewhat objective.  If anything I hope this review was helpful to you and gave you a bit of an understanding of what the series is and my personal perspective on it.  I\u2019ll leave you with this, if you enjoyed nothing else in 2016, if you\u2019re tired of the shallow end of anime to point where you feel you\u2019re in a never ending loop,  if the sheer amount of crazy caused you to break--- what\u2019s one more chance to fix it?\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I dont' know why there aren't more negative reviews about this series, but the JoJo series had been my favorite anime to watch (I don't read any manga), and this arc was a huge letdown after 3 solid, enjoyable, and often amazing arcs. The Stardust Crusader OVA from long ago got me hooked, and I was really looking forward to seeing Diamond is Unbreakable after finishing the TV series version of Stardust Crusaders.\r\nI understand this TV series stays pretty true to the manga, but I feel that the writer Hirohiko Araki simply ran out of ideas after the EPIC Stardust Crusader arc and made thisfiller arc (for the money) about nothing significant, creating characters that were hard to appreciate because they were whiny, talkative, immature, stupid, and simply lucky, in some sense, when defeating these super random unmemorable opponents with vaguely-defined abilities. I understand the characters are supposed to be young and immature, but I got tired of constantly seeing the characters suddenly act immature over and over in the middle of life-and-death situations.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed the JoJo series as a whole because of amazing powers and the characters having to be clever and creative in order to win, but this arc barely tries. Or perhaps the characters are so unlikable I don't care if the main characters actually lost/died.\\n\\n\r\nThe series brings back the main characters from the past storylines, Joseph Joestar and Jotaro Kujo, but Joseph is completely useless in this series and the reasons change from him barely having any memory and barely able to walk to being able to walk and think but having to take care of a pointless baby. I assume the baby becomes a major character in a future arc, but it's super lame how they introduced the baby and how Jonathan was completely out of commission.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are a hardcore fan of the series like I am, watch it just to get it over with. If you are new to the series, I highly recommend checking out the first 3 arcs over this one.",

            "content": "Morioh, an insignificant town that sits out in the sun for anyone to visit and the new home for the never-ending battle carried out by one family. Somewhere in this scrambled slice of suburbia, we're introduced to the latest member of the Joestar lineage, as we encroach on what would be one of many fights to come.\r\nA new enemy Stand makes its entrance; veins protruding through swollen biceps; wrinkled brow plaster the expression of a robust figure; eyes fixated on the opposition; pompadour takes aim, a tangerine sky hanging above; onomatopoeias floods the screen\u2014BAM! MENACING! RUMBLE!\u2014with wall-to-wall color dancing around on the border of psychedeliaand pop art. Head titled, shoulders rolled back, chest puffed out; an epic pose is struck. A feeble old geezer hunched over in the background, hands clasping his cheek, lets out a compulsory \"Oh my Gawd!\" in Engrish. A powerful aura exudes from the frame of the young Joestar. A muscle-bound, apparition clad in lavender emerges from within him, as he lets out a herculean roar: \"CRAZY DIAMOND!!!\"..., Gritted teeth, fist wound up, body arched back\u2014fades to black..., trumpets blare, cue intro, welcome to Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable!\\n\\n\r\nSince 2012, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has been spearheading a campaign to bring GAR and all things manly back to the limelight; introducing newcomers to an anime staple that's been underrepresented in the 2000s, while also shamelessly serving as a form of fanservice for veteran viewers who self-indulge in all things retro. For those people that miss the blockbuster era of beefy action heroes that were deep-rooted in the product of 80s Americana. With a dedicated following that only grows bigger year after year, Jojo's crusade for \"manly ass men doing manly ass things\" has proven to be a successful one. A fact that's made all the more surprising when accounting for the current cultural shift in anime that favors infectiously cute shows or those garishly showered in 2edgy4u content. Jojo stands firm, pressing forward to the beat of its own drum while giving sensitivity the middle finger as it flexes its biceps in the name of awesome. \\n\\n\r\nBut perhaps the strongest aspect of Jojo isn't this flippant disregard towards popular trends, but the way it goes about expressing itself within it. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few cardinal rules that most writers try their best to abide by, one of which is maintaining some semblance of plausibility within the realm of the written work being presented. Whether the story in question is grounded in reality or contains plenty of fantastical elements, maintaining some level of plausible \"cause and effect\" is what helps the audience experience immersion. Even in a fictional universe that contains many otherworldly themes, there are still constants that are expected to be maintained. In the same way, the theoretical law in our universe remains consistent no matter the time or location; the same is also expected with works of fiction. Anything that doesn't uphold established in-world laws tends to be perceived as poorly constructed or just outright \"bad writing.\" We may not always identify it up front, but somewhere in our subconscious, the \"bullshit\" meter is going off. \\n\\n\r\nAnd yet, even with this unspoken rule in mind, there are some stories that purposefully leave common sense at the front door. They're shows that are propelled by nonsensical conclusions, improbable physics, and pure absurdity. But somehow, despite this, or perhaps because of it, they have been adored the world over. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is that kind of show. A show driven forward by madness, adrenaline, and a gratuitous amount of machismo. It embraces the \"Bizarre\" in its namesake to the utmost extent, doing whatever it pleases with total conviction and never looking back at the body count trailing behind it.   \\n\\n\r\nAnd like the hyperactive installments before it, Part 4 continues to keep the ball rolling, following the lineage of the Joestar family and all the inherent problems that come with the blood-line. This brings us to the next Joestar tasked with carrying on the legacy, the ever-fabulous Jousuke Higashikata; a man of few words, unless the words addressed to him are insults directed at his ultra sleek Greece Lightening hairdo. Unlike the hard-boiled demeanor of Joutarou, Jousuke actions are driven by hot-tempered impulses, choosing to punch first and ask questions later. He wears his heart on his sleeve, an attribute that would usually be perceived as weak in the testosterone-filled world of Jojo, except for the fact that Jousuke kicks all kinds of ass with his Stand, Crazy Diamond. A Stand that grants him the ability to restore any damage inflicted to something back to its original state or alter it to its base elements. Pairing that with his hair-trigger personality makes for a formidable combo, something that many enemy Stands find out the hard way.\\n\\n\r\nAs the aftermath surrounding Dio Brando begins to settle down, remnants of his misdeeds are still spreading when the Bow and Arrow\u2014the weapon used to create Stands\u2014ends up in the wrong hands. Because of this, Joutarou finds himself traveling to the town of Moriah where his illegitimate nephew Jousuke calls home. And as the Joestars team up to rid the town of Stand users hellbent on causing harm to the citizens, they find themselves encountering greater threats along the way.  \\n\\n\r\nWith a narrative that solely exists to have as many physical encounters as possible, Part 4 manages the impossible task of circumventing the trappings of episodic content while using that exact structure to create bottle episodes filled with high-octane battles. Whether it's pounding the snot out of an enemy Stand or simply going to a restaurant to eat, Part 4 is continuously pressing down on the gas peddle. For those that don't like stagnation, this sequel is a Godsend. \\n\\n\r\nThere's no calm moment of clarity to reflect on the situation at hand, all that's left on display is brittle logical leaps followed up by gonzo wall-texts flying in with a flurry of saturated color. It's vivid, it's spastic, it's a mural hacked up on PCP. And while this commitment to never slowing down may seem like a detriment for any other show, for Jojo\u2014a show that's as straightforward as the content being displayed\u2014there couldn't have been a better marriage of purposeful storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nJojo's brilliance is in its simplicity. It isn't a show that's out to have an intricate story-line filled with multifaceted themes, nor does it try to craft layered personalities that appear 3-dimensional. Jojo personifies the mindset of a neanderthal, where problems are solved with fists and beating enemies into submission. Loyalty is proven with actions and not half-baked words. And motivations that's as explicit as the expository dialogue being used to express them. The only thought process being taken is assuring that they properly utilize their Stand abilities to defeat their enemy with optimal results. These muscle-bound brutes painted up like Easter eggs leave no room for interpretation, what you see is what you get.  \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't to say there's no thought placed into Jojo's production. The show is littered with inventive encounters that overlap Stand abilities to create a chess game of wits, seeing both sides constantly fighting for the upper hand over one another. Matches that eventually dissolve into pissing contests to see who would cave in first. Each Stand ability is accounted for, creating interesting back and forths between the combatants. And with there being countless possible Stand abilities that could manifest in someone, the end result is no two fights being the same. The battlefield is forever morphing, with something as simple as the changes in partnership or location altering the very course of a how a match can turn out. \\n\\n\r\nIt's this very ingenuity that demonstrates that behind the burly men clashing fists, there's still a thought process keeping the madness together. This also includes the more straightforward parts of Jojo's production, such as the naming of the characters and the reasoning for its brightly-colored world. \\n\\n\r\nIf you've made it all the way to Part 4, then this should come as no surprise to you that Hirohiko Araki, the creator of the Jojo manga, has consciously decided to name characters after musicians and songs, mostly from western pop culture. It's an inconsequential bit of trivia that doesn't do much for the long-haul but despite that, adds to the overall appeal of his work. And with French post-impressionist artist Paul Gauguin being cited as an influential person in his approach to color theory, there's always a sense that Jojo was much more than just a whim being held up by simple admiration for a particular era. If you've ever felt like the colors used was oddly at home despite the constant clash of sassy meet gusto, that's because of this conscious effort on Araki's part to blend the two. This well-cultured sensibility is what gives Jojo such a distinct personality from its counterparts. It's an entity birthed outside of typical circular influence, having a unique appeal while winning the admiration of a broader market in the process. \\n\\n\r\nBut let's not mistake all this appraisal of Jojo as the show being a flawless creation, it does suffer from its fair share of issues. For one, because of its straightforward approach, there's never any questions posed at the actions being taken. And as such, this is an anime that only works because of the universe pre-established before it. Had we not seen the impossible happen time and time again, Jojo would have never worked. Its absurdity disallows genuine immersion in the circumstances taking place. You're entertained but never for a second buy into the ridiculousness of it all. It's a show where you laugh at the nonsense and take enjoyment out of how committed it is to seeing it through, despite the apparent shortcomings of said actions making close to little sense. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is always entertaining but never something to be held up as proper literature. It's the show's greatest strength but sadly its greatest weakness as well. \\n\\n\r\nThis issue also means that all of the characters are usually dwindled down to becoming internet memes or lovable caricatures. No one is looking onto Jojo for enriched characterization. All that's expected out of it is hyperactive personalities with cool abilities trading blow for blow in an environment that allow these occurrences to go on undisturbed. This is usually the trade-off for dumb-fun entertainment. Finding a balance between the absurd and tightly written is a rarity that escapes Jojo. But what it still has is an unshakable commitment to do everything at 110%, so even when you question the logic of a scenario, it doesn't take long before you accept it for what it is to continue seeing the Joestars pummel enemies into submission. \\n\\n\r\nAnd if this fact can be accepted for what it is, then Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable should be nothing short of an entertaining ride for most fans of this bizarre adventure. With more epic poses, more stands, more cool ass character designs, and too much awesome shit to know what to do with, Jojo Part 4 has been one hell of a ride. And with this being another successful adaptation by David Production, here's hoping it's an adventure with many more iterations to come.\\n\\n\r\n-Sepia bathe the screen, title card cropped in an arrow: To Be Continued-\\n",

            "content": "David Production was hardly a household name in the otaku community a few years ago. However everything changed when the fire nation attacked...I mean when they released their JoJo's Bizarre Adventure adaptation in 2012! While the budget was pretty low, David Production blew the community away with their attention to detail and loyalty to the source material and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable is no exception to this.\r\nJoJo Part 4 tells the story of Josuke Higashikata, Joesephs illegitimate son. In Josuke's home town Morioh someone used a magical bow and arrow to transform normal people into Stand users. This time we getto know a little bit more about the origin of the Stand abilities, which has something to do with these arrows. Of course, Josuke and his friends have to stop them. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the time they just encounter random enemies, but later they try to find out the identity of a certain someone with an especially dangerous Stand who is living in Morioh, who is the main focus of the second half of this story arc. This person is commiting gruesome murders for several years, but was never caught, so it's up to JoJo and his pals to stop him.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why this plot works so much better than Part 3's, is because it feels much more natural. In Stardust Crusader, the plot felt very video game-ish, but in Part 4 fighting Stand users is more of a daily routine and not part of a journey to save the world or something. Araki succesfully mixed Part 3's semi-episodic structure with some slice of life elements. Since they never leave their home town, there is also a lot of attention to the city Morioh itself, almost like the city is it's own character. I wouldn't go so far and call it \"world building\", but all these little things about Morioh + the recurring places definitely gives this arc it's own flavor and identity compared to the rest of JJBA. \\n\\n\r\nMost enemies they fight turn into friends later on or are at least somewhat relevant for the plot later. This causes the team of allies to be very large, almost twice the size of Part 3's.However the last third of the show has very simmiliar issues as Stardust Crusaders (TOO obvious monster of the week) and some episodes are obviously more exiting than others, but in the end Part 4 feels much more tightly written than it's predecessor.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are great in Diamond is unbreakable! Almost all of them are interesting and their interactions are super entertaining. Of the 4 JoJos that are introduced at this point, Part 4's main character Josuke is probably the most interestig. He is introduced as a polite delinquent, but he gets series when it comes to his hair: when someones insults it, the person get's his ass kicked! This is pretty much Josuke's thing. Joseph had his predicting thing, Jotaro his \"yare yare daze\" and Josuke has his hair thing.There is even a little flashback about why he is so sensitive about his hair in the first place. He doesn't use it as much as Joseph and Jotaro though and his tick is pretty much dropped later on and his flashback never received any further explanation, but it was still a nice touch.\\n\\n\r\nThe main villain of Part 4, Yoshikage Kira, is also great. He is not as \"EPIC\" as Dio, but he is very memorable in his own way. Unlike Dio, who was more of a cartoon villain (wants to take over the world etc) Kira just wants to commit murders without being disturbed by other people. He doesn't want world domination or anything like that, just a quite and peaceful life. Unlike Dio or Kars, Kira feels like a person who could actually exist in real life, which makes him legimately scary. The final battle against him was a little messy and the way he died was pretty anticlimatic, but I guess that made sense in this context and steting, since Kira is a more of a realistic villain. The fight was still exiting nontheless and the way they used their Stands was pretty creative.\\n\\n\r\nAs you would expect from JoJo, the fights are awesome. The Stands are much more creative than in the previous story arc and they are used in very creative ways. You can really tell how much Araki improved the fighting mechanic in this arc. This is probably the most bizarre aspect of Part 4: melting bodies together, turning people into books or trapping people in a time loop; these are just a few examples for the crazy abilities. There were even new types of Stands introduced: automatic Stands and Stands that evolve into a more powerful form over time.\\n\\n\r\nSadly DiU is much less \"GAR\" and manly that the previous parts. The characters are also not nearly as buff anymore. This was around the time when the mangaka started to change up his art style. David Production chose to make the whole arc look more like the second half the DiU manga, insteadt of having this (admittedly awkward) transition from bulky to skinny. \\n\\n\r\nSimilar to the earlier seasons of JoJo, the animation looks very low budget at times. However David Production makes up for that with an unique artstyle, great use of color and lots of crazy effects. In the end it's very nice looking anime, despite some derpy faces and low quality character models here and there (they'll be probably fixing these things until the Bluy Ray release anyway).\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack however was a bit less memorable than in previous parts, but I guess that's a matter of preference. I like how they remixed Jotaro's theme from Part 3 and the way they mixed up the opening theme in the last couple episodes was really creative.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Part 4 has all the bizarre action, manly tears and likeable characters that would you would expect from this series and it even improves quite a bit on some of the flaws in Stardust Crusaders. How do I say this...? It's a bit crude, but...hehe...I got a boner!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal rating:\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\r\nGeneral production value: 7,5/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10 \\n",

            "content": "To anime and manga fans, Jojo is a classic that many may have heard of. Even if you\u2019re not familiar with the franchise, you\u2019ll bound to hear something related to Jojo somewhere whether it\u2019d be a joke, meme, or reference. Diamond is Unbreakable chronicles the fourth expansion of the franchise and it\u2019s among one of the most celebrated. As a personal favorite, Diamond is Unbreakable sets up for an adventure that is far more than bizarre.\r\nAs the four story arc in the Jojo franchise, Diamond is Unbreakable unites a lot of similar themes from the previous series. These would include the unorthodox style of theadventures, the colorful character cast, the creative Stands that characters uses, and most importantly, its bizarre yet infectious humor. The first few episodes reintroduces a character we should already be familiar with, Jotaro Kujo. He travels to the town of Morioh and encounters a young man named Josuke Higashikata, the latest in line of the Jojo family tree. As a youthful man sporting an unusual hairstyle, Josuke is your typical teenager with a kind heart. Even his Stand (Crazy Diamond) represents his personality as it\u2019s able to heal and repair injuries. So in essence, don\u2019t be surprised if you see him helping out some stranger out of kindness. In many ways, he is similar to Jotaro despite their age gap. Furthermore, Josuke is a guy that I think most of us can relate to. He likes to hang out with friends at school while always eager to make more, is often curious about unusual events, and is incredibly protective of his family and friends. For most part, I think Josuke is a character that many of us will like quickly.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, Josuke isn\u2019t just the main star of the show. His friends Koichi and Okuyasu also gets involved in the strange bizarre occurrences as their lives changes forever. They discover the existence of Stands as the show sets up for the many storytelling about them and their users. In some ways, the show is similar to the previous installment. However, one of the main difference is that the show takes place mostly in Morioh as opposed to a world journey. With that being said, the series does a decent job at crafting the town with its many features. These ranges from Josuke\u2019s home, school, and the places he enjoy visiting. Then, there\u2019s also other places that strange occurrences happen thanks to one of Dio\u2019s lackeys and his supernatural Bow and Arrow. The storytelling of Diamond is Unbreakable follows many arcs that each feature a different antagonist, their Stand, and the problem they cause. It has a pseudo slice of life feel as most of these arcs are nonlinear in terms of plot. However, these arcs are important to develop the character cast. A prominent example would be Koichi as his Stand (Echoes) undergoes an evolution of change. It presents his development as a character from a timid kid to a courageous hero during his various confrontation with other Stand users. Okuyasu is also an example as a character that originally started out as an enemy of Josuke but changes into his best friend as the story progressed. Representing a more delinquent\u2019s side of the character cast, Okuyasu\u2019s personality changes as he takes devious risks to protect his friends and understanding them. Finally, I think a special mention should be given to Rohan Kishibe, a manga artist who serves more as a foil to Josuke. With his talent and abilities (including his Stand), he casts a narcissistic vibe with stubbornness. In essence, he\u2019s the type of that guy that is hard to make friends with and throughout the show, we can see his growing rivalry with Josuke. \\n\\n\r\nTo get the full enjoyment out of Diamond is Unbreakable, it\u2019s best to watch the previous series and get familiar with the Jojo universe. Part four introduces many new characters, some recurring while others are part of the \u2018monster of the week\u2019 structure. Noticeable characters such as Yukako, Mikitaka, etc will be more memorable while other may not be. Unfortunately for fans of Joseph Joestar, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed by his role for part 4 as his presence and significance is reduced to be only involved in minor story arcs. However, have no fear as part 4 also introduces one of most interesting antagonists in the entire Jojo franchise, Yoshikage Kira. As a serial killer and hand fetishist with an obsessive-compulsive disorder, you\u2019ll recognize that his role transform the story into a darker thriller. His appearance in the show adds a unique flavor that creates an aura of psychology. It\u2019s a contrast to the bizarre humor of the series, something that has existed since the beginning of part 4. By balancing the humor and darker elements, Diamond is Unbreakable brings out the best of its storytelling with its characters. \\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, I am generally satisfied with the faithfulness of the adaptation. Only a few arcs are rushed while most of the story flows consistent with the source. I\u2019m also impressed by how the adaptation captured the expressions of the facial reactions as it\u2019s not always easy. Kudos to David Production for making a good promise to deliver the best it can be. In the meantime, fans will also probably notice a change in the art style of this season. The backgrounds has a much radiant style with multilayer colors. Moriah town also deceptively look simple yet many complex events develop as the story unfolds. Most impressively are the character and Stand designs. Each character looks unique ranging from Josuke\u2019s infamous hairstyle to Kira\u2019s trademark Killer Queen Stand. \\n\\n\r\nThe evolution of Jojo\u2019s soundtrack still retains its depth and presence with its theme songs. \u201cCrazy Bizarre Town\u201d represents exactly how bizarre the show can be while the ED theme surprisingly has a more melancholic tone. However, what impresses me most is the overall directing of the soundtrack with its battle scenarios. Iwanami Yoshikazu\u2019s talents are recognized easily as he is able to work around between balancing the slice of life moments and the intense fight scenes. Furthermore, character voice mannerism is credible to their characters. Kira\u2019s voice tone is perhaps the most memorable for his egocentric personality and sadism while others like Koichi will be recognized for their courage and loyalty.\\n\\n\r\nSo what should fans look forward to most from Diamond is Unbreakable in the end? To be honest, it\u2019s very simple. A show like this will be best enjoyed as a bizarre entertainment with what it presents. It\u2019s essentially a series that takes creativity to extraordinary levels. Every story arc delivers some sort of unusual conflict to bring the bizarreness true to its form. The fights are crafted with creativity that rather than relying on strategy can be enjoyed with sheer entertainment value. And that really is what Jojo is about. It\u2019s bizarre entertainment at its finest.\\n",

            "content": "I'd like to preface this review by saying I totally understand why you might enjoy this show. Don't just look at this review, see its rating then click off. This review is a thorough dissection of Araki's Manga and DP's adaption of DiU. It's more of a fun than deep experience but I'm going to explain why DiU's critical flaws make the show very VERY difficult for me to enjoy. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThe story starts off insanely strong with a shot of a severed hand being in someone we don't knows home. The story is about a serial killer using his Stand to hide himself andkill. That's an awesome premise. Too bad its hardly a factor of the story and it's mostly just the cast stumbling upon enemies that are just trying to use their stand to regenerate their body and petty theft. It loses so much focus. YUKAKO HAS A DEVELOPMENT ARC AND THEN HAS LITERALLY NO IMPACT OR TIME IN THE STORY AFTERWARD. IT WAS PROBABLY THERE JUST TO SHOW AYA TSUJI EXISTED.\\n\r\nNow onto why these fights and arcs have no impact on the story and why its downright purposeless...\\n\\n\r\nI will accept the fights could be entertaining but the fights of this part are just not as well executed or choreographed as those from other parts. There are some exceptions like Highway Star but Araki even recycles ideas for stands and the environments are very strained as its mostly taking place in a house or on a street. Also these fights have minimal stakes due to Crazy Diamond being able to perfectly regenerate people. AND these brawls just have really forgettable, uninteresting enemy abilities. It puts these at even more discredit because these fights DON'T feel connected to the plot. Unlike parts like 1, 3, 5, and 7 where the enemies are either other members of the mafia that want something the heroes have, opponent racers pursuing the same goals, assassins hired by the enemy, minions, etc. The enemies in DiU are mostly just randoms. Plus the characters associated with the fight and some of the unique ideas usually carry the bland and boring execution on its back. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art looks great and on model at times as does the animation but the key word is sometimes. Its animation can be fluid. The character designs are honestly great even for the minor villains. Although the characters can look great but even with the very simplified facial designs and vibrant colors the show still has big aesthetic problems. There is constantly bad frames. This is likely because the seasonal split that SDC had wasn't there. So they didn't have time to break or get back budget. The constant outsourcing made the main villains stand reveal a literal laughing stock. So much so I still see it getting meme-d on social media. The animation and art in DiU can be vibrant and fluid but it also gets unattractive and stiff. So much so you start to wish there was a seasonal gap.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe music is catchy and fits the situation but it feels like a drop from SDC. Also Savage Garden all the way through instead of something as calming and beautiful as Last Train Home was a huge mistake. Last Train Home surpasses it in every way. You just get this tranquil feel of the Crusaders comradery. As you see them casually moving around Egypt together. It paints a very peaceful picture in your head. With I Want You, you have a very out of place song with very out of place direction. The Josuke in the end credits singing is so spontaneous and out of place. Its not remotely edited well is really forced in. (I'm not gonna criticize I Want You as a song because I am not into music criticism so that's why I more criticized its sloppy direction and what it does for the anime as opposed to dissecting the lyrics of a song from a 90's Boyband)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 \\n\\n\r\nHere's where we get to DiU's biggest problem as well as it's best part. \\n\r\nI'll start by putting it simply Rohan, Koichi, and Kira are the best characters of this arc. Their characterization, development, and their focus almost always makes the episode great. I could do an essay on why Rohan is such an amazing character BUT simply put he is an excellent, greatly developed, incredibly layered and interesting character. Also the fights on the aforementioned tend to have impact on their character more so than ANYONE else in the show. Araki also does a very poor job at doing mass characterization AND making characters likable. Unfortunately you see a lot of Josuke and Okuyasu. Now I know A LOT of people like these characters. But hear me out. I do not hate these characters but they have very BIG problems as basically the leads of the part.\\n\r\n1) They have confused character motivation\\n\r\n2) They are stagnant and their development arcs doesn't effect them as characters\\n\r\n3) They are less interesting than characters that could've got more spot light \\n\\n\r\nOkuyasu:\\n\r\nHis brother dying is one of his main drives into the plot. That and his attachment to Josuke leading him in conflict by association. But Okuyasu wants revenge even though he accepts his brother is a bad person. They do not flesh out the fact Okuyasu wanted to avenge someone he knew was wicked. It doesn't dive into his psyche or feelings of justice or ideals. Just simple revenge motivation. It's insanely shallow and doesn't do ANYTHING fresh or unique. Now maybe I would forgive this if Okuyasu just didn't feel so bare. He meets his brothers killer, the person he wanted to commit revenge on. Then he loses. Then he meets him again. Can't beat him and then Josuke beats him. So Okuyasu gets no resolution with his brothers killer AT ALL. He doesn't confront him in the hospital. He doesn't kill him. They have no excuse because Kakyoin and Polnareff just is so much more satisfactory in terms of ending Pol's revenge arc. Kakyoin even helps him on what to say so he can feel fully satisfied when murdering the man who killed and raped his sister. And after this arc that goes literally nowhere Okuyasu doesn't get any more development for the rest of the show. Which honestly makes him just a one dimensional comic relief. He's entertaining but his character goes nowhere, is shallow, and has a really lame arc that doesn't effect him.\\n\\n\r\nJosuke:\\n\r\nJosuke is nowhere near as bad of a case as Okuyasu. Josuke just gets less development and less consistent development than side characters like Yukako. And often forgets everything about his development where he wanted to become a force of justice. He commits fraud, tries to scam Rohan out of a ton of money, bullies and manipulates a 12 year old for money, and it wouldn't be such a problem if his greed didn't undermine his one development arc. You CAN NOT make his ONE development arc motivate him to become a force of good to protect the town and then have him not FEEL LIKE protecting the town he was so motivated to save. Especially when he literally wants to go against the law he wanted to uphold earlier in the show. It creates some interesting and funny conflicts but just really hurts his character. He doesn't get development outside of that arc and the arc REALLY doesn't affect his character. Like I can't do a page long analysis of their character because its just contrary traits and shallow personalities. Which is a huge problem as they are the big main characters of the show and suck away characters like Koichi and Rohans time.\\n\\n\r\nNow one problem about a really good character; Kira is they try to introduce this part of his personality where he's falling for Shinobu but they bring it up once, don't expand on it, and it just feels forced in and Araki probably just forgot to capitalize on it.\\n\\n\r\nBack to one horrid aspect about Araki's mass characterization... you can't make a psychotic outcast like Hazamada likable when in the same arc you're trying to make him likable in you make Rohan read off that he tried to rape a girl and then chickened out. \\n\\n\r\nOverall DiU has some of the best characters in the franchise but also some of the weakest. And Araki despite making a great villain has a very hard time at naturally tying characters to the plot AND handling mass characterization well. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it sometimes. It could be fun. It could look pretty. Its story could hook me in. And it genuinely has AMAZING characters. But for all the fun that I had, I was too distracted with problems to enjoy myself. For all the beauty there's ugliness. For all the times the story had me, the payouts and dicking around on side stuff lost me. For every good character's time in the spotlight there's a significant amount of time spent on a much weaker, shallow character. Every time DiU does something great or good it does some thing to balance out its positively with very damning problems.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a perfect score for DiU. I feel like its truly great characters save it from a 4/10. It's also pretty damn weird and pretty damn funny. But the animation and art problems. And the shallow leads. And the poor mass characterization. And the much weaker soundtrack compared to other parts sits it in a very rough place in terms of JoJo parts and other seasonal anime at the time. Definitely not a bad show, I can see why a lot of people would find enjoyment in it. But its lack of focus on its best characters, its lack of focus on its originally incredible story, sits it in a purgatory. Stuck between giving it audience something to love and shooting itself in the foot for 39 whole episodes.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Jojo: Diamond (PT 4).\r\nWhen Diamond tells the main story it usually repeats the excitement and anticipation that Jojo is known for.  \r\nDiamond has certain interesting stands like Crazy Diamond & The Hand which makes you anticipate their uses and potential. \r\nThe art direction in Diamond is a better step for Jojo, character designs are slim. Diamond removes the over-masculine/stiff design that Jojo 1-3 had. \r\nThe color palette accompanies the new character designs with smooth and soft fills.\r\nThe opening themes fit in the 1/3 and 3/3 sections of Diamond. The ending theme like in all the Jojos borrows a popular western tune. \"I Want You\"by Savage Garden is a catchy 90s pop tune fitting the aesthetic of Diamond. \\n\\n\r\nNow the issues with Diamond are substantial.\\n\\n\r\nDiamond takes a new approach to the structure of events, Diamond is full of fillers, which erode the main story. I appreciate the neighborly approach but it doesn`t help tell a good story. \\n\r\nDiamond constantly picks up the pace and suddenly turns away from major events to have \"fun.\" \\n\r\nDiamond has many characters which lack screen time and ultimately make you not care about them. \\n\r\nDiamond shows Jojo characters at their peak of stupidity, characters shout; nothing happens; no one runs, noises and events are ignored, and there are many scenes where no one summons their stands to help a struggling cooperator. \\n\r\nOur protagonist Josuke`s lack of appearance and action make it appropriate to label his friend Koichi as a more important character.\\n\r\nJojo 3.5 Egypt has a terrible ending and it is repeated in Diamond, the ending isn`t clever, it`s all ended with a big whammy.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and illustration quality degrade at many points in the season, however, it hardly detracts from the season. \\n\\n\r\n\"Chase\" by Batta is a good song off Diamond but it doesn`t match. Jojo isn`t a straightforward bad-ass series, Jojo always indulged in campiness, over the top characters and actions. Jojo gets serious but retains its core elements, which makes the \"Chase\" OP a strange approach visually and sonically. \\n\\n\r\nDiamond like Egypt is disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nSuggestion Rate for a Jojo Fan: 10/10, All the Jojos tie, you have to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI don`t want to suggest a sequel to someone who hasn`t seen the predecessors.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You though Stardust Crusaders would be the last of the JoJo adaptations, but it was me, Diamond is Unbreakable! Jokes aside, the adaptation of the next part is finally over after a 39-episode run. David Production has proven to be a very loyal studio when it comes to adaptations. For the last couple of years, David Production have been working on adapting the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series written by Araki Hirohiko into an anime format. After doing an adaptation for the first three JoJo parts, David Production has adapted the fourth Part of the series, Diamond wa Kudakenai also known as Diamond is Unbreakableor\u2026 Diamond is not Crash if that\u2019s what you prefer. Though Diamond is Unbreakable isn\u2019t quite popular in Japan as to let\u2019s say the previous part, Stardust Crusaders, or the next one, Vento Aureo, it\u2019s still well respected. However, in the west it is much more popular. Diamond is Unbreakable is my personal all-time favorite JoJo part\u2026 even more than Steel Ball Run. But does this adaptation manage to be perfect like the previous parts? Well in all honesty, this might just be the least loyal JoJo adaptation from David Production, yet it\u2019s better than most adaptations of this generation. That says something\u2026\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise in Diamond is Unbreakable is just as simplistic as the previous part. The story revolved around the town of Duwang, um, I mean Morioh and how after the presence of an arrow that can give people the ability to use Stands, Morioh is now filled with an ever-growing amount of Stand users (both enemies and allies) and it\u2019s up to Josuke and his buddies to handle this issue. However, within the Stand users in Morioh hides a serial killer who targets women in the town (well their hands to be precise) and the allied Stand users must work together to stop this hidden serial killer and protect Morioh. First of all, unlike the previous and the upcoming JoJo parts, Diamond is Unbreakable takes place in one town and never leaves this setting. The characters don\u2019t go on an adventure all around the world, nor do they take a month to get to Egypt. It\u2019s just one town with one goal; to protect Morioh. Diamond is Unbreakable is known as the slice-of-life JoJo since its more about the characters fooling around while there\u2019s Stand users to handle every week. Despite the fact that Diamond is Unbreakable is written in a smaller scale and that its initial premise is simplistic, there is no doubt that this part is the most interesting part story-wise, when compared to the previous parts. Even when compared to the future parts, it\u2019s still better than all of them (though Steel Ball Run is on the same level). The first half of the series is simple fun, but once the main antagonist gets introduced, Diamond is Unbreakable ends up becoming an intense and somewhat unpredictable cat-and-mouse chase. Despite the fact that it\u2019s not as large-scaled as Stardust Crusaders, its climax ends up being a satisfying fight that uses more strategy than brute strength. Diamond is Unbreakable proves that bigger is not always better.\\n\r\nStory: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nDavid Production has always managed to be the top of their game when it comes to loyal adaptations and they proved so with the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series. They manage to capture the style and essence the manga has. David Production is so loyal about the adaptation that they even write out the sound effects in the series. But not only are they loyal, but they\u2019re also dedicated to the series. Whether animating the meme moments in proper quality, or changing up the OP to match the antagonist\u2019s ability, these little things show how much David Production cares about this adaptation and how they\u2019re not making this anime simply to cash off from the fame the manga has. Diamond is Unbreakable is adapted in full glory here, especially with David Production changing up their art style to what the manga series ends up being. Starting from the fourth part, Araki changed up his art style from the original gritty, gar, and manly art style with tank-style characters, to the new vivid, stylish, fancy, fashionable art-style with skinnier characters. Despite the art style change, it still feels like JoJo. You still have those epic sound-effect text, disproportional poses, epic one-liners, cool battle cries, and the weird alterations of color and lighting. However, due to the length of Diamond is Unbreakable being 11 episodes less than Stardust Crusaders, yet the manga being a volume longer, some tiny moments ended up being cut out. One or two lines from each episode would get cut out and some comic relief moments too, but they\u2019re nothing bad enough to be noticeable. These cut outs are similar to Phantom Blood\u2019s and Battle Tendency\u2019s.\\n\r\nPresentation: 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure never falls behind with their characters and Diamond is Unbreakable is no exception. As a matter of a fact, Diamond is Unbreakable has the best JoJo cast I have ever seen, with every character feeling likable and fun. Josuke is a fantastic protagonist with a fantastic personality. He\u2019s my favorite JoJo, just right after Joseph. He\u2019s the perfect mixture of Joseph\u2019s lightheartedness and Jotaro\u2019s chillness, while having Jonathan\u2019s gentleman personality to him. With him having a running gag about how he can\u2019t tolerate someone making fun of this hair, to him showing his dedication towards protecting Morioh, Josuke proved to be an all-rounder. Stardust Crusaders is completely gone as Jotaro is part of the main cast in Diamond is Unbreakable. He\u2019s just as important in this arc as Joseph was in Stardust Crusaders. Throughout Part 3, Jotaro have more of a fixed personality and in some way, he was a bit bland, however Diamond is Unbreakable makes his character have more personality and feel more enjoyable. He still cool and relaxed, but he\u2019s also wise and makes some jokes too. This might be due to him being a decade older than he was before, but either way he\u2019s a lot more interesting. And then we have the JoBro of the part, Okuyasu, and he\u2019s just as dumb as most other JoBro\u2019s, but that\u2019s what makes him fun. His unintentional humor makes the series feel more lighthearted and fun to watch. Every JoJo part always has that one little kid that plays some type of role. In Part 4, Koichi is one of the main characters of the series and he really grows on you. He originally starts as a kid that kind of ruins the fun by describing everything that goes on (I\u2019m looking at you, Speedwagon\u2026 but you withdrew coolly). However, managed to be a lot more badass than he originally seemed, and he can be quite smart too. And then we have Rohan\u2026 Araki\u2019s self-insert. A mangaka who also joins the gang later in the series and he easily is the most interesting character besides Josuke and the main antagonist of the series. But with all said and done, the character that truly steals the show and the one who ends up being the best and most complexly written JoJo antagonist ever, is Kira Yoshikage. Simply put, he\u2019s weird yet normal, awkward yet cool, and a scumbag yet likable. From his hand fetishes to his will to stay in Morioh and continue his hobbies, Kira proves to be an absurd, yet believable character. With his appearance coming late in the series after many buildup, all of it gets payed off. \\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~, \\n\r\nAs mentioned before, David Production did an amazing job in adapting in Diamond is Unbreakable\u2019s art style. In the previous parts, the series had a more darker look to it and the characters were the size of a football stadium, in Diamond is Unbreakable, the art is much more brighter and the characters don\u2019t look like as if they bathe in steroids. Though the previous parts used that art style for its charm, Diamond is Unbreakable has its own charm, one that gets used in the future parts too. The previous parts used to alter its color palette at times to add a greater affect. Diamond is Unbreakable does that too, but it happens a lot more often. And this are sometimes colored in an unnatural way for style, such as the sky being purple or yellow at times. Despite the art having so many good qualities about it, its undeniable that the quality is pretty inconsistent. There\u2019s some moments when character models were lack proper detailed or look deformed, especially if the characters are shown from a greater distance. However, the series makes up for it with its killer close-ups and some of them have a better quality than what was in the original manga, such as the close ups for the Stand, Killer Queen. Also, any issues with the art quality are being fixed with the Blu-ray and DVD release. \\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nThe animation quality is really good in Diamond is Unbreakable, however when compared to Stardust Crusaders, it is a bit lacking. The thing about Stardust Crusaders is that it originally started off with mind-boggling animations that seemed like as if David Production is a masochist and they enjoy putting too much detail into the tiniest things. However, as the series went on, the animation quality started becoming normal. Diamond is Unbreakable starts off from the normal quality of Stardust Crusaders, however, this quality remains the same throughout the series. There are some moments when the animation quality gets inconsistent and things aren\u2019t as smooth as they should be, but Stardust Crusaders also suffered from the same issue. You won\u2019t be able to expect anything legendary from Diamond is Unbreakable\u2019s animations, but you won\u2019t be disappointed either. \\n\r\nAnimation: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe recurring characters have the same seiyuu as they original had. Josuke\u2019s seiyuu in the anime is different from the one that played him in the video games. And with these 39 episodes, it\u2019s clear that Ono Yuuki is the perfect match for Josuke. He gets Josuke\u2019s delinquent feel right, while making him a nice and kindhearted man. Also, he says \u201cDORARARARA\u201d the best. Ono Daisuke returns to voice act Jotaro, and he does just as good of a job as he did in Stardust Crusaders. He manages to make Jotaro feel a badass and you will never get enough of that \u201cORA, ORA, ORA\u201d. Okuyasu\u2019s seiyuu is the same as the one that was used in the games. Master of delinquent voice acting, Takagi Wataru does a great job in making his character sound like a complete idiot, while making him likable. Koichi\u2019s seiyuu is also changed and the game\u2019s seiyuu wasn\u2019t used. Though I was kind of disappointed that Romi Park didn\u2019t reprise her role, but Kaji Yuki does a great job as Koichi and he doesn\u2019t disappoint. Though it\u2019s a little weird since Kaji Yuki voice acted Johnny in the games, so I wonder who will voice act Johnny is Steel Ball Run gets an adaptation again. Kaji Yuki? And even Rohan\u2019s seiyuu gets changed too. Though Kamiya Hiroshi might be the better seiyuu, Sakurai Takahiro proves to be the better match for Rohan. Kamiya made Rohan sound a little too rough when Rohan\u2019s supposed to have more chill than that. Sakurai executes that perfectly. Also, Kira\u2019s seiyuu has been changed too, for the better. Koyama Rikiya was great and all, but Morikawa Toshiyuki was completely sinister\u2026 as expected from Griffith\u2019s old seiyuu. He delivers the lines perfectly, especially the creepy ones. Overall, all of the seiyuu changes in Diamond is Unbreakable is for the better.\\n\r\nVoice Acting: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nA JoJo part isn\u2019t a JoJo part without great music, and I got to say, this has got to be the best music I\u2019ve heard in a JoJo part. The series has three openings and one ending. The first OP \u201cCrazy Noisy Bizarre Town\u201d is a funky and fun opening that capture the slice-of-life charm of the series. It\u2019s super catchy and the music for it has good beats. The second OP, \u201cChase\u201d, isn\u2019t something you would hear you would expect from JoJo since it has more of a shounen-y feel to it, but the song is really good and the vocals and music for it amazing. The final OP, \u201cGreat Days\u201d, is easily the best one from Diamond is Unbreakable. It represents the theme of justice and hope the series used throughout, plus its really upbeat and fun to listen too. Just like the previous JoJo seasons, Diamond is Unbreakable\u2019s ED is a western song from the last century. \u201cI Want You\u201d is a fantastic ED that feels really catchy and matches the slice-of-life tone of the series. Though it would\u2019ve been nice if it had another ED (maybe something from Queen would\u2019ve been nice, but the license would cost a fortune), but it\u2019s fine the way it is. Kanno Yugo strikes gold with the OST of Diamond is Unbreakable. He did a great job with Stardust Crusaders and Ajin and with Diamond is Unbreakable, he showed the best of his work. The main theme of the Part is fantastic and is on par with Part 3\u2019s theme. And the variation of the theme \u201cStand Activated\u201d is really good too. The OST, \u201cThe Stardust Man Appears\u201d is really cool to and it matched Jotaro very well. \u201cSudden Battle\u201d is always perfectly used, \u201cThe Hand\u201d is perfect for Okuyasu, \u201cIrreversible Sadness\u201d is used perfectly for the saddest death in the part, and \u201cCourage\u201d works well with Koichi. But the best OSTs are the ones that are used for Kira. Kira\u2019s main theme, \u201cKiller\u201d, is perfectly composed to add that mysterious and uncomforting feel. \u201cSecond Bomb\u201d and \u201cThrid Bomb\u201d felt very intense when it was used in the series and \u201cAnother Face, Same Mind\u201d is another great Kira track. Overall, all of the OST manages to elevate the enjoyment for this series and there\u2019s no doubt that Diamond is Unbreakable has the best soundtrack of the year. \\n\r\nMusic: 10/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nSaying that I didn\u2019t enjoy Diamond is Unbreakable is like saying Trump in not the U.S. president\u2026 it\u2019s utterly false. Right after the latest season of Gintama ended, I needed something that could fill up that emptiness inside me. JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure did that. Not only is Diamond is Unbreakable amazing, but it\u2019s also the best part of the entire JoJo series. With so many hype moments with great voice acting and music used, it felt immensely satisfying. Even with some moments being cut out and some \u201cquality\u201d moments, David Production makes up for it with its stellar close-up art quality, and managing to represent the new tone and style of the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series. David Production was the best thing that happened to JoJo and JoJo was one of the best thing that happened in the anime industry. Simply put, there\u2019s no other anime like JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure, and Diamond is Unbreakable simply continues on that legacy. Plus, another gureto doze of amazing memes!\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve watched the previous JoJo parts and liked them, I don\u2019t need to recommend Diamond is Unbreakable to you because you\u2019ve either already watched or you were just waiting for it to end. For those who found Stardust Crusaders to be a hit-or-miss or found Jotaro to be a bland protagonist, don\u2019t worry, Diamond is Unbreakable is a much more consistent Part and Josuke is a great mix of the previous JoJo protagonists. With a much stronger story than the previous parts, and a new and stylish art style, Diamond is Unbreakable stands out more than the previous parts. And Part 4 easily has the best soundtrack of not just the entire JoJo series, but also the best of the year. The voice acting cast is perfect and it was a smart choice to change up some of them and use seiyuu who didn\u2019t do those characters in the games. If you haven\u2019t gotten into the JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure series yet, don\u2019t worry, you have the holidays to catch up if you\u2019re interested. With Diamond is Unbreakable, JoJo proves that it has its still creative with its ideas and still have a bright future ahead with David Production\u2019s support. \\n\\n\r\n+ Fantastic characters, including an entertaining protagonist and the best antagonist the JoJo series has ever seen.\\n\r\n+ The story in Part 4 is much more complex than usual with unexpected twists and turns and keeps the viewers captivated. \\n\r\n+ David Production does an excellent job in maintaining the manga\u2019s style and representing the new JoJo art style.\\n\r\n+ Fantastic OPs and ED and the OST is the best of the JoJo series, and in particular, the Kira OSTs are brilliantly composed.  \\n\r\n+ The new art style is stylish and vivid and the art looks exceptionally good at times, especially during the close ups.\\n\r\n- Production values are a bit inconsistent at times as some characters models far away can lack detailing, however, the BD/DVDs fix that. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.6/10",

            "content": "(If you're 11 and haven't experienced JoJo, skip to the safe space for my 'spoiler free' interview)\r\n1999\r\n\"Let the joy of love give you cancer\"-Araki\r\nThere's a reason why DiU sits near the top of almost any JoJo fans ranking.\r\nBecause its an absolutely and positively inspired piece of work.\r\nLet's get the obvious criticism out of the way first. While the voice acting is grade A, this show puts the ugh in ugly, (I.E Quality Queen). But some episodes (I.E Bug Eaten) are stellar looking, with strong color pallets and character design. It's just quite obvious the budget from part 2 isn't there, which, while a shame, isn'tdeal breaking. At this point the Duwang scans have made me feel like Oliver Twist, I just want some more you know? I'll take what I can get from David Productions, as long as they deliver my beloved part 4, from Tony to Rock Paper Scissors to Ambulance, we're cool.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is what they did. \\n\\n\r\nA common criticism leveled at part 4 is it's lack of focus. It doesn't start the \"plot\" and introduce the main villain until a third of the way through; but can you blame Araki for not knowing (at first) how to follow up a planned trilogy with a clear conclusion? While its unfortunate the first section of DiU isn't so smoothly connected to the rest of itself (Josuke time traveling, Araki how did you forget that), it is an undeniable fact that when Araki is provided breathing room to experiment, he gives his best work (See SBR). \\n\\n\r\nStands positively SHINE in part 4; gone are the \"monster of the week\" stands of part 3, which are replaced by a variety of stands that complement their given user. Echoes evolves alongside the growing Koichi, Heavens Door fits a mangaka such as Rohan like a glove, and The Hands overwhelming power is balanced only by the sheer stupidity of Okuyasu. Some stands have zero combat potential whatsoever (Cinderella, Pearl Jam) and exist solely to further the atmosphere of Morioh. While punch ghosts are fun, and Jotaro gets plenty of strong screen time, it's Araki's unbounded creativity that makes DiU so fun and unforgettable.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI'd be lying if I said the lack of Josephs mannerisms and catchphrases doesn't leave a bit of a hole in my funny bone. However, Araki does manage to preserve the magical humor of previous parts in DiU. If anything, JoJo has never been funnier. Jotaro's straight faced autism remains strangely both bad-ass and comedic, and Josuke's new personality mixes well with characters like Rohan and Okuyasu to create those bizarre situations we love. Then there's stands such as Stray Cat, Boy 2 Man, Earth Wind and Fire, and of course, Cheap Trick. Cheap Trick will leave you in a pool of piss on your hospital bed that you can't clean up because you're restrained and sedated. It's unfortunate that part 5 and 6 didn't take some notes. \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf someone asked how Araki could possibly follow up DIO, then I imagine Kira as the proverbial slap in the face as his response. Whether or not you think he deserves a quiet life, the sheer presence Kira exerts on the show from the get-go is undeniable. Kira has personality, wit, motivation, luck (are those sirens?) and mother-fucking Killer Queen. A serial killer is a logical conclusion to the question of a villain in a setting such as small town Morioh, and Kira is as competent as his real life look alike. (R.I.P David Bowie)\\n\\n\\n\r\nJoJo op's are legendary, and for good reason. They're love letters; with hand-crafted songs tailored to fit certain parts of the story, bundled with little references for veterans to the series. As songs, CNBT and Chase are worthy successors, but as opening videos, they fall just short of Stand Proud or Sono Chi no Sodome. Still good op's, but the budget just doesn't seem to warrant a video I could call gre...\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Great Days.\\n\r\nI've never seen or heard an opening embody a series so perfectly. And the rewind version features absolutely genius cuts and sound effects, making the DiO version of End of the World look like a linkin park amv.\\n\\n\r\nAnd \"1999 Bizarre Summer\"? Holy shit that's a lyric? \\n\\n\r\nI got a boner.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe only proof anyone should need to understand that David P is the studio worthy to adapt JoJo to the end, is Morioh Radio. It's a foreign element to the manga, but who would know? That high energy radio jingle only seeks to heighten the atmosphere of bizarre Morioh; and it speak volumes about the love and dedication the series is being shown by its creators.\\n\\n\r\nSasuga David. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n(Kiddie friendly zone)\\n\\n\r\nMe: How's the show, Josuke?\\n\\n\r\nJ: Great.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Everything about the show just pleases you, the art, characters, the fights.\r\nThis season is definitely the best Jojo season and I can't wait for the next one to come out.  \r\nTo be honest, its first few episodes were so different from the previous seasons that I was kind of confused, the way the story started out and honestly you could argue that it was a bit slow. But when it reaches the main story, oh boy you are in for a treat. \r\nAs for theart and characters, its amazing. The art is even more crispy and vibrant than stardust crusaders and there are just so many colorful personalities that you can not get bored of it. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I can say for sure is that, if you were a fan of jojo you will definitely give this a 10/10, but if you are a first timer watching a jojo series, you will be extremely confused and probably find it stupid/boring since they don't spend too much time explaining everything. But trust me on this one, this is definitely one of the best anime of the season \\n\r\n10/10",

            "content": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai Review\r\nStory (9/10) Great\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\r\nThe Story for Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure I felt was great for it's uniqueness and laid back atmosphere presented in majority of the Part. It's definitely nothing like the first 3 Parts when it comes to tone as the first 3 were a combination of comedy, tension, hype fights and bizarre situations. Now although you can say that this Part of JoJo's had all of those things it definitely added it's own flavor of slice of life to the series which at first (back in 2015 when i read themanga) I thought it was odd (or should i say Bizarre) but Part 4 makes it work. Now back when I wrote my review for the manga I gave this section a 9.15. I do think the anime as far as from a presentation standpoint did present Araki's story very well, not perfectly but definitely nothing to complain about from an adaptation standpoint of quality. Now the actual issues I have with the story plot still exist which to name a few... Mikitaka (The Alien Character) his whole character straight to the end of the Part is still a mystery never do we find out if he is an alien or not and the Invisible never do we get to figure who where the hell it came from (spoiler nor do we ever get to see that baby in future parts grown which would have been cool but I'm saying this here to not get your hopes up, now if the baby did it wouldn't bother me so much but whatever). But the biggest plot that bothers me the absolute most and the reason that stops me from giving this section anything more than a 9.50 is Josuke's past. You remember when Josuke how he got his hairstyle? Do your remember that flash back?? Yeah the Josuke look alike? I bet you (and I sure did myself) assumed that Josuke later in the series went back in time to save himself somehow and it'll all come back around by the time the Part concluded NOPE. Guess what! and Here's a fun fact Araki (creator of JoJo's) actually wanted to do that! He wanted to somehow make Josuke (just like Kira) get a power up to his Stand to the point where he has the ability to go back in time which would make sense for how Josuke's Crazy Diamond ability works already (reverting things back to the way they were) so reverting time some how via a power to the Stand wouldn't have made me scratch my head. Kira was suppose to do something that forces Josuke to go back in time, he wanted to incorporate Josuke going back and saving himself during or after his final fight with Kira, but the idea was scrapped because Araki himself didn't know how to make it flow well by the time he got to the final fight. (This is what happens when you don't think your story plot through before writing it) it just has somewhat of an idea of what he wants to do and writes it as he goes. This Araki story structure mind-set has (in my opinion) hurt the overall JoJo's series as since Part 3-Part 7 all have certain things in their overall story plot that is similar to this Part as far as Araki having an initial and amazing idea that he wants to incorporate that eventually doesn't play out because he either didn't know how to incorporate it by the time it was time or he changes his mind on the initial plot point which SUCKS because if you hear some of the things he wanted to do for Part 3, Part 5, Part 6 and Part 7 it'll make you pissed off, I digress since it doesn't ruin any of the stories of those Parts (except Part 6.. fuck Part 6.. just kidding). Great story for Part 4 nonetheless and the anime is the better way to experience it in my opinion even thought the manga still has great art style which wasn't adapted perfectly over but we'll talk about that in the next section.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation for this Part of JoJo's was great. Although like I said a little in the story section certain scenes from an art style standpoint was not done justice (like the time they first showed of Killer Queen.. but then was cleaned up in the next episode). And the fact that the overall art style for Part 4 was changed from the manga as in the manga the noses for the characters are similar to how Araki draws the noses of his character in Part 6 which is a weird decision DP (David Productions) decided to go with.. Either way the whole presentation from an animation standpoint was great every ORA and DORA was greatly animated and I'm far from unsatisfied with DP's work.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) Outstanding \\n\\n\r\nEvery single voice actor, every single ost, every single sound effect were all outstanding. All of the opening songs was fire and i never skipped them once. The fact that when Jotaro get his shine they'll play his \"Jotaro is about ORA dafuq outta someone\" song from Stardust Crusaders is nostalgic and outstanding. David Productions did an outstanding job with this section no more is needed to be said. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10) Great\\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.50/10) Great+\\n\\n\r\n*So when it comes to characters I'm going to paste basically what I said with some modifications to what I said from my manga review is it's basically the same.*\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters in Part 4 are straight up great. All of the characters (this includes the side characters and enemies) felt unique and great. I can't think of any character that felt like a waste of time or generic (now Tamami is debatable if u want to consider him i wouldn't) everyone's role they were suppose to play felt fitting and entertaining. The MC Josuke is definitely different from the previous Joestars before him which is good because when I saw is stand Crazy Diamond I thought he was going to be just like Jotaro, and to an extent they do have similarities when it comes to their stands (ORA ORA to DORA RA RA) and their sense of and for expensive real life fashion wear is similar also. But other than that, that's where it ends. But the other character indeed do remind me of characters from Part 3 with Okuyasu reminding me of Polnareff and Rohan reminding me of Kakyouin but that's only 2/6 from Part 3's crew that have similarities from the crew from Part 4. Kouichi gets a lot of spot light and shows off great character development and never before seen features from the abilities from the Stands. Mikitaka the \"alien\" as he calls himself was never really explained which urked me a quite alot and he's not the only one that's like this (invisible baby to name another). Like I said earlier the mystery behind the character who inspires Josuke's hairstyle we never really get to find out who that is although we can make assumptions and say that was him from the future and HOPEFULLY something happens in future parts to showcase that but for now it does bother me that we didn't get to figure it out in this part. The main antagonist Kira Yoshikage definitely had some shoes to fill because Lord Kars and Dio Brando are some big shoes to fill. Did he live up to the expectations of a OP JoJo's antagonist/villain? Ehhh debatable, I'll tell you what though out of the 3 of them Kira probably got the most screen time then both Kars and Dio by far, Kira has episodes and mini arcs dedicated just to him, we definitely got a big insight on the sick and weird mentality he had going on with him and with just that alone I think he was a great antagonist for Part 4. His stand Killer Queen was deadly and his companion the Stray Cat definitely had a great climatic battle between Josuke. The main reason i felt i couldn't give this section anything higher than a 9.50 was because there were still some unanswered questions that I felt are most likely never going to be answered that are directly related to characterization like who the guy was that inspired Josuke's hair style, even though I hope it gets explained in a future part I highly doubt that is going to be answered in future Parts but if it is then props to that specific part I'll give the credit to THAT part not this one. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) Outstanding\\n\\n\r\nJoJo's Part 4 was my reason for waking up one Friday. JoJo Fridays as people call it and every single week it was a treat to look forward to. Even after reading the majority more than a year ago it still was the anime I looked forward to the most every week. Now that it's over man.. Fridays are going to be a drag. This Part of JoJo's definitely taught me that JoJo's is best watched weekly vs binged (at least in my opinion).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10) Great \\n\r\nMore Specifically (9.70/10) Great+ \\n\r\n(Or should I say Gureto desu!)\\n\\n\r\nWhen I finished watching Part 3 of JoJo's a year ago I didn't think David Productions was going to animate Part 4 so I went ahead and hoped over to the manga to read it only to be surprised a couple weeks after I finish reading it that it's getting animated! David Productions did a phenomenal job with Part 4's adaptation and I can't are for future Parts to be animated by them! Ougon No Kaze Let's go!\\n",

            "content": "The JoJo franchise is one I have some fondness for. It has an absurd naming scheme, over the top machismo & action, but I've still found it pretty endearing. I've talked about JoJo, Stardust Crusaders series 1 & 2. This time around, I'll be discussing Diamond is Unbreakable. Like the others, this is brought to us by David Production. It aired from April to December of 2016. I look forward to seeing a bunch of characters named after musicians & bands fighting in an absurdly over the top fashion. Let's get right to it.\r\nStory:\r\nWe open with Joutarou heading to a small town called Morioh tomeet Joseph's bastard son, Jousuke. Yeah, apparently Joseph had an affair with a woman forty years younger than him when he was in his sixties. Way to keep it classy, Joseph. Arsehole. Joutarou wants to discuss the old man's inheritance because, at this point, Joseph's really old and could die from a heavy wind. Actually, now seems like an opportune time to go into a detail that bothered me in the last series, but I couldn't go into too much detail about because it was a spoiler. But, since this series takes place after the ending of that one and goes over the basics of what happened, I can talk about it freely here. Okay, so Vanilla Ice is turned into a vampire by taking Dio's blood but we also saw Joseph take Dio's blood so why isn't he an ageless vampire with the same appearance that he ad in the last series while being unable to go out in sunlight. Rather like I can't on account of being a pale ginger. That seems to be a thing with this franchise, the internal logic doesn't always hold up. Any way, it turns out that there's some dangerous stand user on the loose in Morioh with an arrow that can create more stand users. So, Jousuke begins his own bizarre adventure, aided by Joutarou and some friends to find the arrow. This quest ultimately brings them into conflict with the town's most notorious criminal and stand user.\\n\\n\r\nLet's look at the issues with the series first. And it starts with the aforementioned internal consistency problem. Here's the thing, our group of heroic stand users summons an elderly Joseph to Morioh to help them find the stand user who controls Red Hot Chili Pepper. He arrives but they end up not needing his help. So, he sticks around doing bugger all. Then they encounter our main antagonist for the series with his stand, Killer Queen. He escapes them and they begin the hunt for him. So, no one thinks to have Joseph use his Hermit Purple, the stand that he was going to use to find a stand user for you, to find this guy? He's literally right there. He could do it with no real risk to himself and you could find this guy in five minutes. Another example comes with Jousuke's stand, Crazy Diamond. It's established that his stand can heal, but can't bring someone back to life and yet, he manages to put someone back together who gets blown apart. How does instantaneous death not happen in that situation? We also have Kouichi's super unhealthy romance sub-plot that serves no purpose but makes for an awkward, uncomfortable time. This series also gets some rather dreadful attempts at \u201cstreet\u201d dialogue from Kouichi's Stand, Echoes. This thing spells out the word shit on multiple occasions and it does it with the mannerisms of someone who thinks they're tough, but they just come across as cringey and trying too hard.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that being said, the series still retains its sense of over the top machismo fun. It's also very much self aware about it. It's not asking you to take it really seriously, it's asking you to join in the fun. That's especially apparent in scenes where the characters monologue about why they're going to win and strike over the top poses. It's also pretty obvious in, for example, the Pearl Jam episode where everything is a bit of a goof. I also do appreciate the way this franchise establishes its battles as being less about brute forcing your way past an opponent and more about tricking them into a corner. I rather like seeing the characters playing mind games.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe fourth iteration of JoJo and his Amazing friends is just as archetypical and trite as all the others. Similarly, the antagonists are just as much evil for the evils. There are three major ones. The first is a serial murderer and rapist. Has been since he was all of twelve. The second is a murderer and thief, which isn't as bad. The final one is a long-running serial killer who makes women disappear and keeps one of their hands to serve as his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d Dude, just buy a mannequin and use its hand. Still weird, but at least it won't make you terrible. All three of them are completely unrepentant for their crimes. This series also maintains the franchise's tradition of having a main cast that's largely enjoyable in spite of their relative shallowness as characters. The naming theme of band & song names continues, although this time it's used for the stands. Araki Hirohiko must have really liked Pink Floyd since two of the main stands, Crazy Diamond & Echoes, are named after their songs. In addition to the other ones I've mentioned so far we also have Super Fly, Cheap Trick, Highway Star, Heaven's Door and others. Stay tuned for the tenth JoJo where someone has the stand, Dinosaur Laser Fight. (I don't actually know if he's gotten that far or what the stands are called if he has, but that would be amazing.)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nAre you ready for muscular boys with absurd hair to strike over the top poses? If that sounds awesome, this anime has you covered. The art style continues to be overwhelmingly macho. I think my beard actually grew by ten centimetres just from watching it. It's that macho and my beard wasn't exactly short before. I do like a lot of the action sequences in this. That's one arena where I'll keep giving this franchise credit. Even with the pauses for monologues and dramatic posing, it has some solid, creative action sequences.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nSo, what kinds of performances can you expect? If you said that it's going to be largely over the top and exaggerated, congratulations on your pattern recognition skills. That is exactly right. The cast they got is good at that. Ono Yuuki, Ono Daisuke, Kaji Yuki, Sakurai Takahiro (Hi, Cloud) & Morikawa Toshiyuki (Hi, Sephiroth) are all good choices for that. This time around the ending theme tune is a selection from Savage Garden's I Want You, which is appropriately ridiculous for the ending theme tune of an action anime. Kanno Yugo's score is quite good too.\\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nJousuke & Okuyasu get a bit of a \u201cbromance\u201d going. But this franchise has never been big on romance and this one's no exception. Even Kouichi's kind of shit het romance is pretty downplayed.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nThis series... this entire franchise is ridiculous and I can't deny that I enjoy watching it. I didn't like Diamond is Unbreakable as much as I liked the first half of Stardust Crusaders, but it's still solid and I liked it bout as much as I have most of the franchise. My final rating is going to be a 7/10. Next week will kick off horror anime month and I'm going to start things off with a review of Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror.",

            "content": "Jojo's part four continues the pattern of following the hereditary lineage of Joestars and taking you on a bizarre adventure packed with creativity, action and heart. Unlike the previous iterations, there is no crossing of borders or seas with life or death stakes. Instead it's set in the comfy but no less intriguing community of Morioh.\r\nThe characters are no less colourful than the bright pink and yellow skies of Morioh. The beginning is set into motion with Joutarou arriving with an agenda regarding the growing number of cases involving Stands. It follows Jousuke, a delinquent looking yet loyal to those he cares about high schoolstudent with a hot temper when it comes to his hair. While he likes to partake in questionable money making schemes, he is always there for a friend in need and this sensitive side to him makes him the most likable JoJo protagonist yet. \\n\\n\r\nHe is also Joseph Joestar illegitimate son and while that felt a bit out of place with the Joseph's character the estranged relationship was handled nicely with bitterness, acceptance and a dash of awkwardness. This was highlighted in the final episode with Jousuke using his Stand ability to steal his money and picture of his mother as they departed. \\n\\n\r\nThe first half of the story revolves around Morioh and has a Slice of Life feel along with the typical Stand of the week. The fights always involved a level of tactics and creativity to overcome odds and the outcome is never quiet what you expect. At the same time these encounters helped build the world, not everyone who was given a Stand was a bad guy. Often characters and places return in unsuspecting and often clever ways. While the adventuring is scaled down in geographical measurements, it explores the concept of the place between life and death and while only touched upon lightly it is an example of one of the locations Jousuke used for strategic purposes a multiple number of times. Or the way the cat plant Stand was reused by Kira and then again by Hayato. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the things I liked was how all the characters felt like different shades of gray. Rohan, Shigekiyo and Okuyasu all had antagonistic roles before becoming acquaintances with Jousuke. Even the main antagonist Kira was humanised; he wanted to live a peaceful, quiet life and while he had his morbid urges and sociopath tendencies, it made him into a multidimensional villain. The second half is more focused on chasing down Kira and it was as just as thrilling to see a Killer Queen vs what-have-you Stand as it was to see Kira try his best to adapt into a new life. \\n\\n\r\nOST, voice acting and sound design were all excellent and exuding with manliness. Props to the classic rock ED which suits the time period of 1999 really well. While some episodes stood out more than others animation wise they all retained a level of solidness. This might of been helped by the unique and stylistic character designs and vibrant color palette.\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable is filled with intense and some of the most ridiculous battles ever, great colour coordination and a cast of memorable and fun characters. It doesn't deliver the same level of globe trotting as it's for-bearers but it's journey having spent more time on each character individually creates a down to earth yet epic feeling that is unparalleled.",

            "content": "\u2022 Foreword for those interested in Diamond is Unbreakable with no knowledge of the JoJo universe.\r\nOk, as a note to people that maybe are reading this that have no knowledge of the other seasons or parts of JoJo and are interesting in picking it up, I can say that each JoJo part can work independently of the others and can be consumed in any order you want, although the most optimal way is watching them in order as to not be spoiled. You see, JoJo is organized in parts, with each part following the story of a different protagonist from the Joestar family, in acompletely different setting, location and time and each capable of working indepedently of each other, with the story arc starting and concluding in each respective part. So if you're not interested in lets say in the premise of Part 1, which is: a man called Dio Brando seeks to rise from poverty and get a better position in life by trying to inherit the Joestar's family wealth after succesfully being adopted by them. In the process Dio comes in contact with a stone mask tied to supernatural powers, this setting a chain of events that etched in stone the entire JoJoverse. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps the premise of Part 4 may sound more to your liking: Through an ancient artifact, people have been granted special abilities called stands, with each stand having varying capabilities most often very different and unique from each other. This story follows Josuke Higashikata, a descendant of the Joestar family, trying to uncover different stand users as to make sure his town will stay safe from the constant danger created by an influx of stand users created by the artifact, and stop whoever is responsible of this from creating more users.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I've presented the premise of two different parts was to give an example of how different the premises of both parts can be and how they follow different settings with different characters, although, again, each part has some major spoiler for its former parts. If you're not interested in the former parts for one reason of the other, or you'd rather watch this part first after learning about it, only then start with this.\\n\\n\r\nYou will most likely enjoy any JoJo if you're looking for a series with over the top action where they can be either downright silly, (intentionally) really hype or really unsettling. You will most likely dislike any JoJo if you're not gonna be willing to treat its story or its universe as somewhat senseless to some extent and aren't willing to enjoy its ridiculousness when it serves it.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Differences between previous parts.\\n\\n\r\nNow from this point on this might help people that have had dropped the former parts, because I'm gonna compare Part 4 to its predecessors. There's two key differences between Part 4 and all the previous JoJo parts. The first one is a style shift, with JoJo dropping its initial GAR look and going for a more smooth looking style. While there's still some manly man in the style of JoJo, now the masculine features put into the characters have dropped a bunch. The second key difference is the fact that the characters are now in a stationary setting, rather than having them travel from point A to point B. This is what I mean by this:\\n\\n\r\nPart 1: Protagonist trains his powers to seek out a villain around the country and stop them, with most enemies being allies of that villain trying to stop him.\\n\\n\r\nPart 2: Protagonist trains his powers to seek out a villain within the continent and stop them, with most enemies being either allies of the villain or seeking to understand the villain's powers.\\n\\n\r\nPart 3: Protagonist gets powers because stands are now a thing and seeks out a villain across the globe while the villain's allies are sent after him.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm severely dissapointed that this part isn't named Diamond Is On Mars, I have to admit that it was a pretty good decision since the characters presented in Diamond is Unbreakable don't have an one track mind and they can have motivations outside the premise of the story itself. The worst problem that Part 3 had, Stardust Crusaders, is that any characters it has had introduced are confided under one goal and have only one motivation, while the story is not trying to do anything out of the ordinary, and only banks on the novelty of the stand concept at that point. You knew exactly why a stand user did whatever they did as soon as you've seen them, that being the villain existing. It was so bad in Stardust Crusaders that you could literally skip after the first few episodes to the last few episodes while probably understanding most of that story arc due to how many insignificant events it had. Which was probably a result of JoJo trying to find its footing because during the first two parts it drew large influences from Hokuto no Ken, and why the first two parts are far more story focused than Part 3.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I'm here to say that the same problem I've mentioned about Stardust Crusaders isn't here. While the series still retained the structure of stand user of the week that Stardust Crusaders had, the fights have different implications and presentations, because of the particular setting of Diamond is Unbreakable. You see instead of being limited to \"i'm working for villain-sama\" this is a town full of people living normal lives whilst 1/75 people has special abilities. In a realistic scenario, people would find different uses for their powers, some would use them for the betterment of the community, some would use them for personal gain and satisfaction, some would use them to wreak havoc and most importantly, due to the sheer number of them, they would most likely be living independent of the villain. This gives the writer of the series the opportunity to develop the personality and motivations of the character far more uniquely and realistically.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to the other parts of JoJo, those before Stardust Crusaders, Part 4 has very little to do with fantastical elements with the series having now almost nothing to do with the powers presented in Part 1 and Part 2, while Stardust Crusaders still retains them for obvious reasons. That is to say that if you disliked the powers in Part 1 and Part 2, Part 4 is when they are pretty much fully dropped.\\n\\n\r\nOne difference that is worth noting that Part 4 is very stationary compared to pretty much any other JoJo Part written. Due to the nature of things happening in an enclosed space with seemingly random encounters, it will feel far less adventurous than the other parts, since the protagonist won't go on a journey with a goal to get something or stop some villain from achieving a goal that would have some fairly large repercussions. Part 4 is captivating in a more mysterious and bizarre way where anyone can be someone dangerous unbeknowst to each other that they may be a threat to your family, friends or people you just pass by everyday, while everywhere else in the JoJoverse the confrontations are obvious.\\n\\n\r\nAnd another very significant difference is the drop of the frequency of sound effects presented in the series that may displease some because of the missing lingering menacing, but this is due to the fact that there's a stand of who's powers are represented that exact way in this part. They seem to tone them back up at one point.\\n\\n\r\n\u2022 Essentially what you should expect from the series.\\n\\n\r\nSo what you need to know about Diamond Is Unbreakable is the following. It is a series where characters are presented in situations either silly, ridiculous, creepy or all the aforementioned at the same time in confrontation with each other. It will be mostly comprised of action scenes but there will be some episodes where the stands won't be doing any fighting. The plot of the series is mostly a device to form these situations and it is not thoroughly complex but no way worse than its predecessor, Stardust Crusaders, as its initial scenario will keep suffering some changes and it will explore the motivations of a multitude of people which usually will still be there living in the town rather than be there just once.\\n\\n\r\nThe action of the series is generally over the top and bizarre, just like you'd expect from the title, with some (censored) gore and pretty unusual situations. Although the series if presented out of context could look quite ridiculous, in the context of the world, it can easily be taken seriously as far as the action goes and the fights are always well thought-out and very well planned strategically, featuring powers that prove more worthwhile the more witty and creative you are. Although sometimes the strategies do fall apart due to sheer occasional ridiculousness of the characters. For those looking for the type of action I've described, it's very unlikely that you will not enjoy JoJo a lot for this reason alone as I can hardly think of anything that can match it in this department.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle of Diamond is Unbreakable is a result of dropping its former GAR look for a more realistic and more fitting for its setting look where the people in the series look now more normal than before and their features aren't pronounced in a way that looks them that make them look that super manly men. The design of the world is mostly comprised of a mix of some light or darker shades of yellow, green and purple textures, blended in a way that makes the town inconspicuous, quiet, but still represembling a somewhat lively community living around. Most of the designs of the world and characters are well done and blend really well with everything that goes around creating a modest town where some bizarre things happen.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters are well represented and nicely fleshed out usually in this part, you shouldn't expect them to be essential to the story, despite being more involved than in the former part. You still need to keep in mind that the style will depict them in over the top ways to take them seriously as this is part of the style of the series and merely an artistic way of depicting them as to exaggerate some traits. The character motivations will vary from seeking personal gain, to trying to protect their community, to fuck it.\\n\\n\r\nYou are likely to enjoy Diamond is Unbreakable if you're already a JoJo fan or seeking a series with some very entertaining action and some over the top downright bizarre scenarios which focuses the interaction between different people with different motivations with superpowers. But only as long as you can accept that JoJo's purpose is to build upon these scenarios even at the expense of the story, with the premise itself having to adapt more to the scenarios and ideas for characters presented in the story, rather than the character and scenarios presented be tailored specifically for the premise given. Diamond is Unbreakable is a very entertaining action series that you might enjoy if you've liked what you've heard about the series. If most of what you heard turned you off, you shouldn't expect enjoying Diamond is Unbreakable.",

            "content": "Plot: The beginning of part 4 of Jojo's Bizarre Adventure (Diamond is Unbreakable) Is kinda all over the place. It isn't until the introduction of the part's main antagonist where the show begins to shine. \r\nArt: The art style was changed drastically from the previous parts. As a fan of the old art I was disappointed at first but I quickly got used to the new one. Aside from the introduction of Killer Queen all the stands look beautiful as well as the fights. The color pallet is constantly changing throughout fights which adds a really cool effect.\r\nSound: The sound is one of the highlightsof this parts. Three AMAZING opening songs. AMAZING character themes my favorite being: \"Morioh Cho Radio\", \"The Hand\", \"Killer\", and \"Another Face, Same Mind'. Lastly the sound effects used in fights are not over-the-top and subtly compliment the epic fight scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: This is THE best part of Diamond is Unbreakable. The entire main cast are well-written characters. The main villain is the greatest villain I have ever experienced in ANYTHING. The return of old friends from previous parts. Honestly, this part's main Jojo, Josuke Higashikata, gets really shadowed by the awesome characters in his part.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9.\\n\\n\r\nFriday was the highlight of my week every week this was airing.

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure in general is an interesting show because I don't like it for a very specific reason. I dislike Jojo because I cannot ignore the fact people explain the plot or fight moves while standing by spectating. Yes, sometimes the show will poke fun at itself with Jojo saying \"Why are you just standing there\" (or something to that effect) but I just can't. It reminds me of shows where suddenly the hero gains some ridiculous power or strength because love, friendship, or intense emotional states. Bleh. \r\nLike \"Oh my god, look! He isn't digging in the ground, he's building up forceful energyto better kick his opponent in the head! Oh no, look! his foot fell off!\" (this is exgaggerated on purpose). But, you get the point. \\n\\n\r\nThis is in no way meant to bash Jojo, or those who love him (I believe I may be in the minority here) but another reason Jojo is a bit over-rated (literally, people over rate this show) because it is associated with childhood....and any show that reminds people of the freedom, innocence, lack of responsibility, and that \"oh i'm having so much fun I gotta go poop!\" feeling....will show up in the \"All Time Top 10s\" until a new generation replaces them. \\n\\n\r\nFor example: Cowboy Bebop, Mobile Suit Gundam, Geon Genesis Evangeleaveitalone, Digimon, Pokemon....etc. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, Jojo DOES stand out because it has a story that CAN be argued to not be just for kids, or teens. IT is a wonderful story and balances the plot, action, comedy, feels, and goofy humor in a way that reminds me of Gintama. But I can't get over people explaining moves and plot details like a conversation or joke. Maybe this is on purpose. maybe its a paraody. IDK can't watch it!",

            "content": "DORARARARA!\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai brings us to the quaint *cough* mundane city of Morioh, a new Jojo with Josuke Higashikata, new Stand users be it allies or villains and our major focus for Part 4 being searching for a serial murderer who's been out on the loose for almost 15 years...\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai's core cast for the most part LA enjoyed alot though there were some aspects of the \"Morioh Warriors\" that could had more potential from them. The newest Jojo of Josuke voiced by Yuuki Ono reminded LA alot of Joseph Joestar in Battle Tendencymixed in with Stardust Crusaders, as Josuke implements and uses his Stand \"Crazy Diamond\" to constantly unique and inventive ways of combat even though at the start it's more a defensively overpowered ability of \"fixing things\" and yeah it's kinda weird yet awesome having three generations of Jojo's all in one due to Joseph, Jotaro and Josuke all being in Morioh to the lurking threat of the major villain hidden away in Morioh and trying to find him.  But nonetheless Josuke was an excellent addition to the lineage of Jojo's and a proud one at that. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the Morioh Warriors, Koichi Hirose voiced by Yuki Kaji was an all round extremely useful character outright and he had MANY shining moments for himself, he was pretty integral to the plot as well as his own misadventures and he was some of the few core members who developed immensely throughout the anime and that showed in both appearance and his Stand as it literally grew stronger and stronger as the episodes past. Okuyasu Nijimura voiced by Wataru Takagi being the first villain turned ally for Josuke like Koichi developed along the way but his was picked up and finished for the weakness he portrayed of being dumb and only taking orders as he didn't know any better, but over time, he was usually by Josuke's side and was even in the same wavelength as him and he grew out of taking orders and him thinking for himself to save the core cast at times, LA \"did\" wished he got some more development but nonetheless he was still fine in terms of plot. Rohan Kishibe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai, was something of a reference to Hirohiko Araki, as Rohan is a manga artist and he portrayed some of Araki's weirder aspects of himself, but Rohan was kinda of an interesting character in a ways, being \"friends\" with Koichi and doing anything it'll take to be a mangaka by experiencing everything and that obviously applies into his Stand. But development-wise, he wasn't exactly an enemy Stand, but once the major plotline of serial killer arose, he too toke hold of the plot and helped immensely with the plot. If anything Rohan and Koichi were almost working as deuteragonists outside of the Jojo's. The last of the core cast LA will talk about is Yukako Yamagishi voiced by Mamiko Noto and she gets the least screentime from the Morioh Warriors, not helped by the fact she turns into a satellite character for Koichi and being a yandere but like many of the core cast develops (albeit with one episode dedicated to herself) but at the end she kinda flips from yandere to shy girl with a crush (LA says it's odd as it's usually the other way around). With that, LA liked Rohan and Koichi the most from the Morioh Warriors, but Josuke being the main protagonist was great too  and as much as LA wanted to put Joseph in LA's favorites but really couldn't from his very limited screentime, Jotaro stole the show even though HIS screentime was limited as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo to go a little in-depth with Josuke and his Stand powers, his is used uniquely in comparison to Jotaro's no holds-bar mental fisticuffs all due to how defensive Crazy Diamond is applied, but it allows not only his powers to manifest in his personality but allows us to show that his powers are used not for himself but to help others as the only downside to his Stand powers is that he can't fix his own injuries and thus it allows the other core cast members to help or even be in the limelight from either fights or their own character arcs due to his defensively overpowered powers. LA did say that Josuke is a bit like Joseph and this is kinda weird since he's the illegitimate son of Joseph and thus in turn Jotaro's nephew, so LA can easily see how his personality is like Joseph but the even more carefree and reckless version of him (this due to the setting of Morioh, not unlike Jotaro's save the world setting) in this regard. So all in all, Josuke as a Jojo is fine addition with his Stand powers complimenting his personality that in turn helps with the other supporting cast and the core cast as a result.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the supporting cast, well LA will be here all day if LA talked about all of them, so let's get LA's most notable characters down, Yuuya Fungami voiced by Kishou Taniyama was one of the enemy Stands that turned over a new leaf and was added into the plot afterwards well as odd of a Stand power he had, Tonio Trussardi voiced by Tokuyoshi Kawashima had the least screentime in the ENTIRE ANIME and had thee most bizarre Stand power in the anime at that, Shigekiyo Yangu voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi had prominence in the middle of the anime and kickstarted the major plotline of the anime and for what little time he had in the anime, he was kinda awesome, if it wasn't for his greedy personality. Finally Reimi Sugimoto voiced by Sayuri Hara was something like the core goal and belief that the Jojo's and Morioh Warriors were striving for and her presences in the anime was greatly helped.\\n\\n\r\nSo LA will now be going into spoilers and talking about the major villain of  JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai, LA did it for Stardust Crusaders with Dio and LA wants to talk about the major villain here, LA just has to.\\n\\n\r\nSo, our major villain of JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai, is that of Kira Yoshikage and is the serial killer that's been out on the loose in Morioh, but here's the thing, he's a serial killer that just wants peace in his life, going about his daily grind and the come and kill an innocent woman for her hands (no seriously) as it's an urge for him to suppress the stress in his life. So yeah Kira is a psychopath and shows ALL the signs for it. As for his Stand \"Killer Queen\",  well much like how Josuke utilized his powers in inventive and unique ways, so does Kira and he uses explosive powers to anything his Stand touches, you can see how this makes things interesting or intense in this case, let's not get to the point of the bow and arrow Enyaba had from Stardust Crusaders came into his possession and most probably how he got Killer Queen Stand. Dio Brando was a human villain mixed in with force of nature villain for Stardust Crusaders due to his THE WORLD Stand, but Kira Yoshikage is a completely different brand of villain, of being an entirely human villain for the entire cast but being a complete psychopathic murderer and Hirohiko Araki gave a new twist on his villains with Kira as although he is evil and malicious to achieve his peace in life and still murder in the process in comparison to Dio's \"evil to achieve immortality but needing to kill out the Joestar lineage in order to do so\". Kira Yoshikage was a brilliant villain in which you both want to sympathize with him, but his explosively murderous tendencies and the lengths he'll go to hide it is immeasurably villainous.\\n\\n\r\nSo those Stand powers, LA will easily say that Araki has nailed the usage of new and bizarre Stand powers now, Stardust Crusaders was his testing grounds using Egyptian and Tarot Cards themed Stands, but with Morioh, it's all free reign and Araki went all out with the Stands and their usages, LA said about Kira and Josuke, but even one off Stands like Cheap Trick or Rohan's Heaven's Door were explored and utilized throughout the plot incredibly well, even to the point that one shot Stands turned into Chekhov's Guns for the plot that easily made the anime intense and changed the game of the anime many times over. \\n\\n\r\nHell LA will even say that due to the expansive ways Stands were used and the plethora of characters by extension, that MORIOH itself was a character due this, with all the quirky landmarks and oddities that Morioh itself experienced in the anime. Araki made it that it was like your typical city filled with living characters going abut their day and if you managed to make your CITY be alive through it's bizarre incidents and characters, THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, done once again by David Production, well what can LA say, it's typical high ended, crazily well done animation from them, again implementing color changes and palette swaps on a whim to the bizarrely crazy battles that was adrenaline pumping even for some of the more one shot cases. Character designs were vibrant, exotic and unique and always coming from Araki's blueprints from the manga and of course Jojo's brand of quirkiness it had to it. Really what can LA say about David Productions and Jojo's, they just go hand in hand high quality animation.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting was great as well with major props to Yuuki Ono as Josuke, Yuki Kaji as Koichi, Takahiro Sakurai as Rohan, Rina Satou as Hayato, Toshiyuki Morikawa as Kira,  Sayuri Hara as Reimi, LA could go on but nonetheless the voice cast was AMAZING especially from Yuuki Ono. Toshiyuki Morikawa and Rina Satou. LA will say this as this is Joseph's departure from the series but also to Unshou Ishizuka the voice actor for Joseph who passed away in 2018, rest in peace my man, you will forever be Joseph Joestar and an incredible Jojo at that.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai was another fresh take of finding a serial killer in a city and running with it with all the Stands and whatnot for Araki and is probably one of the best parts of Jojo's for LA as of now, Stardust Crusaders is too awesome in it's own regards, but Diamond wa Kudakenai just had that something, was fully realized and was fully executed in all it's glory in it's own bizarrely awesome way, sure Diamond wa Kudakenai had it's problems with development of it's characters which was LA's only gripe with and the occasional \"Araki forgot moments\" of  Part 4 but that's small potatoes to the bigger picture. Diamond wa Kudakenai was just amazingly well set up and executed and LA was quite literally at the edge of LA's seat alot of the time and not alot of animes does that for LA. JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai is bloody brilliant and unbreakable, what else can LA say but... \\n\\n\r\nWhat a beautiful Duwang.",

The story has an interesting beginning, then loses some of the quality, but still something medium. To summarize, the story of \"Diamond wa Kudakenai\" is beautiful, perhaps one of the most beautiful of Jojo's, has a happy ending, different from others, has narrative elements beyond the center line and works very well the villain and other characters.\r\nArt: Likeall Jojo's art, always very original, detailed, and well made. Some characters have the traces as reference to the famous of the music, as it is the case of Kira (David Bowie). Magnificent and wonderful art. It is worth mentioning that the Stands here, get much more stylish and well made visuals than the other parts. Killer Queen is a good example of this!\\n\r\nSound production: In the openings? Impeccable! In the anime itself? Nothing much different, it has good ost's but nothing that is as epic or differential as the previous parts.\\n\r\nCharacters: Well, here it is worth noting that my note is above what I expected from the anime myself, and the culprit of this is the character Yoshikage Kira, one of the most worked villains I have ever seen in the shounens, something worth mentioning. The anime's preoccupation with putting other characters as narrative masters is always brilliant in Jojo's, it makes us closer to the character.\\n\r\nJosuke may not be the best character in the anime, but he's still a good character with a kinder soul, which reminds us of Jonathan Joestar.\\n\r\nSeveral characters gain prominence in the work, and have their moments as owners of the narrative.\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall: Well, I admit that this part may not be the most attractive, at first really it seems that nothing will happen great, but from the moment Kira is inserted into the work as a villain, the narrative accelerates!\\n\r\nDiamond Wa Kudakenai is one of the best parts of Jojo's, incredibly able to make a villain more built than the greatest villainous icon of the Work: Dio Brando. Yes, Kira manages to be a better villain than him in technical matters.\\n\r\nDiamond features dramatic moments, moments of tension and extreme distress, which puts the viewer's mind to work.\\n\r\nI do not recommend that you watch without first watching the previous ones, because it's very worth seeing the whole connection between the characters!\\n\r\nA good work, with a good ending and good characters!",

            "content": "The JoJo franchise has long appealed to those who are appreciative of fashionable character designs, attractive visuals, over the top action with a dash of absurdist comedy. Diamond is Unbreakable takes that formula, adds a Slice of Life mystery to the equation, throws it all in a blender and turns the dial on high speed. It took people some time to adjust to the new flavor, but the result was arguably the best JoJo has ever been.\r\nUnlike previous seasons this story takes place in a single location - the town of Morioh where stand users are popping up for unknown reasons and an outbreak ofmurders have become rampant. This town is an incredibly fun environment where every corner of the street has a unique story to tell and each character has an odd quirk that defines them in a memorable way. If not the best character cast, it is certainly the most robust headlined by three generations of Joestar decedents and and the infamous Kira Yoshikage.\\n\\n\r\nAs per usual in this franchise, art is a strong point. This anime makes up for not having a ton of fluid animation scenes by creating a beautiful aesthetic that is appealing to the eye. The colors leap out of the screen almost telling the story itself, and the attractive character designs make them all very easy to identify.\\n\\n\r\nThis is JoJo at its finest, told in way never seen before in the franchise, and in a manner that is easier for more people to enjoy than just it's former target audience.",

            "content": "\"I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winningand losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nFrom this very quote I could tell the brilliance in character that makes Diamond is Unbreakable a fantastic continuation from Jojo. Even after finishing the series a year ago, I still very bizarrely remember this same monologue given by one of the characters. It has left such a mark on me that I will surely always remember this series for what it is. The story takes place in a city known as Morioh, where our character Josuke lives his regular high-school life until a series of murders occur in his quiet town. The setting is typical and the premise is nothing special, but that's not what makes this diamond shine bright...\\n\\n\r\nAside from the very vibrant color palette that very nicely characterizes the bright nature of the city of Morioh making it feel alive, and aside from the phenomenal OST that brilliantly captures the essence of several characters, and aside from the genius stand inventions that you will see across this series (which, for the record, is leagues better than Stardust Crusaders), it's the characters that really stood out to me.\\n\\n\r\nIn comes our antagonist. A man who leads a casual life that goes to work, enjoys his day, comes home, relaxes, and then sleeps at a regular and coordinated schedule. Completely normal. Yet, that's what makes this character so brilliant. He's the definition of normalcy and all he wants is to live his own quiet life - until he experiences intruders in his personal lifestyle. Time after time, it is a relentless struggle of him trying to avoid these new intruders - what do they want and why are they intruding? Naturally, if you wanted to live a quiet life like this, you'd be annoyed when someone interrupts it, no?\\n\\n\r\nAnd here lies the issue with our antagonist. His perception of reality is completely average and mediocre and he fails to understand why anybody would ruin his normal life. He wants to avoid trouble at all costs. The antagonist is a walking paradox of trying to live a quiet life, but also does anything to obtain this mean - an inherent contradiction in introducing noise in his calm and typical lifestyle. His drive to continue living this way pushes him to extremes, and even near the end of the series, I found it so disgustingly human in how he pushes himself to the absolute limits to prevent anyone from shattering this ideal. \\n\\n\r\nNever have I seen such a character that has captured the essence of \"what is human\" in being an antagonist; minus a certain deviation which would be a spoiler, if revealed. His paradoxical nature and the absolute trait of being a mediocre civilian makes it sheer brilliance. Villains don't have to be extravagant, they don't have to have a corrupt wish to bring destruction to the universe, nor do they need to exist for the sole reason of stopping the protagonist. Sometimes, villains are completely normal people too, and this concept was masterfully executed in Diamond is Unbreakable.",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure part four Diamond is Unbreakable is arguably one of the most beloved and well-known works of Hirihiko Araki. \r\nStory: 10\r\nDiamond is Unbreakable, follows the daily lives of the people of the small Japanese town of Morioh. Despite being relatively peaceful, it has the highest death to population ratio in all of Japan. In order to figure out why this phenomenon has occurred in such an insignificant town, the young marine biologist and all-around badass Jotaro Kujo set off to investigate. On his journey, Jotaro enlists the help of his highschooler uncle Josuke Higashikata, Koichi Hirose a young student, the bad-tempered Okuyasu Nijimura,and Rohan Kishibe the famous manga artist. The story shows us the lives of these young men as they experience friendship and hardship discovering the dark secrets of Morioh.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\r\nThe bright, colorful, and fluid art style used in this adaptation perfectly expresses the kind of art that Araki uses in the manga. Everything blends very well, and the animation is quite impressive. The character designs are arguably just as good if not better than their manga counterpart is in my opinion. My only complaint would be the outsourcing for backgrounds and animation that David Productions did in many instances. It is, however, understandable and a great budget saver for such a long highly expensive series.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the sound other than the fact that it has some of the best intros in anime, and that the outro is \"I Want You!\" by Savage Garden. Not only do the intros have amazing music, but they are also accompanied by subtle details pertaining to the story. In a way, all of the intros together tell a story. Do I even need to say anything else about the outro?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nThe main characters were funny, relatable, and their dynamic just works. The plot was compelling, and the episodic villains were so well written despite their short screen times. The main Jojo of the season, Josuke Higashikata, is the illegitimate child of Jotaro's grandfather Joseph Joestar. He has a short fuse, is manipulative at times, but he also has a kind heart and passion for helping others. Alongside him is Koichi Hirose, a young boy breaming with willpower and kindness. He is incredibly perceptive, and quick on his feet in tough situations. Okuyasu Nijimura is Josuke's best friend. He's a punk teenager with an attitude and big heart. He has an even worse temper than Josuke and isn't very bright, but what he lacks in intelligence he makes up for in resolve and determination. And of course, we can't forget, Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist who decides to help Jotaro in order to gain inspiration for his manga writing. I wouldn't call Rohan a \"hero\" for helping Jotaro and friends; I'd say he's more of a curious cookie who does good along the way. Now, that doesn't mean he isn't a fantastic character because he is in my eyes, but I suppose that's up for whoever is reading this to decide.\\n\\n\r\n(SPOILER WARNING)\\n\\n\r\nKira Yoshikage, the main villain of part four, is by far my favorite villain of all time, and as of right now is my favorite character in all of Jojo and anime for that matter. He is a psychopathic murderer who has a creepy hand fetish and some really strange nails to boot. Although I do have to hand it to him (hehe hand), he is incredibly smart and rather clever, he also has some ridiculously bs luck that only makes him more interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nHonestly, part four of Jojo one of the most enjoyable and creative shows I've ever seen. I feel like most people who watch this will enjoy it, whether or not they like battle shounen anime or anime in general. This is probably due to its well-executed story, its relatable and strongly motivated characters, its compelling villains, and the seamlessly never-ending music references. And of course, I can't forget the crux of the series stands! Stands. are in my opinion, the most creative and cool ways to have otherworldly powers with individually specific and abilities. I've rewatched many of the fight scenes, and the innovative ways in which the protagonists defeat the enemies and their stands, still fascinate me to this day. That isn't part four specific either. Stand battles, be it part three or even part eight, are so bizarre (hehe bizarre) and they really make you think sometimes about how the protagonists are gonna get out of this one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'd say Jojo's is one of my favorite anime/manga series, if not my favorite, and I highly recommend you check it out. Besides, my stand, Hypnotized, has the ability to make anyone who reads this review instantly begin watching Jojo. If you try to resist, it will reverberate WRRRYY! in your head constantly, and this thing has an A in vitality so it won't be going away anytime soon. It's also an automatic type stand, so I can't turn it off either. Good luck!",

            "content": "Diamond is Unbreakable (hence DIU) is another TV series in the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure franchise, adapting part 4 of the original manga. Generally speaking, it is a good fighting shounen that keeps some fundamental elements of its predeccesors and also brings many new things to the table.\r\nBefore writing anything else, I would like to point out that while each part of JoJo may be viewed independently from others, it is much better to watch them in chronological order, as you may lose some important context otherwise. So, if you haven't watched anything from JoJo yet, I highly recommend to start with the first TV series.\r\nSTORY\r\nEachpart of JoJo follows the members of Joestar family at different time periods, and each of the already released series makes some shift in the formula. Since DIU is not the 1st series in the franchise, I guess it makes sense to draw some comparisons in order to put things into perspective.\\n\\n\r\nI. Unlike the first series and both parts of Stardust Crusaders (hence SC), which have a strong adventure element with the characters travelling around the world, DIU takes place entirely in one town and its surroundings. However, even though the show has a relatively small slice-of-life setting, it doesn't prevent it from being interesting or entertaining in any way, as it has a good pacing and keeps introducing new characters, powers and stories which often take place in different locations of the town.\\n\\n\r\nII. Speaking of those stories and plot continuity in general, DIU has a more continuous plot than SC. Whereas the latter has an entirely stand-of-the-week plot where events in different episodes have little influence on each other and the final outcome, this series has short story arcs where events are more directly related to each other. The fundamental similarity between the two series is that both of them are essentially about introducing many characters with interesting powers, putting them against each other and tying all those battles together. However, DIU does a better job at this because of a better plot structure.\\n\\n\r\nIII. Speaking of the powers, the characters use stands, which follows the change that happened in Stardust Crusaders. I actually like hamon/ripple from the first series a lot, because it adds an element of training to the plot, and because it's somewhat akin to using qi in Chinese martial arts. That being said, the concept of stands also has its notable strengths, as it offers a lot more variety than hamon and always keeps the viewer interested with new powers and strategies introduced.\\n\r\nOverall, whether you prefer hamon, or stands, or like them equally is a matter of personal taste more than anything.\\n\\n\r\nIV. While stands in SC are named after tarot cards and Egyptian gods, DIU returns to the practice of referencing Western rock bands that already existed in the first series: as you probably remember, it has a character named after AC/DC, and two characters named Dire and Straits, which is a reference to Dire Straits. This series, however, goes further than its predecessor and has more of these references. For example:\\n\r\n- the name of the main antagonist's stand is Killer Queen, which is a reference to a famous Queen song (and one of that stand's abilities is named after another famous song by Queen);\\n\r\n- one of the characters has a stand named Red Hot Chili Pepper, which is a reference to Red Hot Chili Peppers;\\n\r\n- another character has a stand named Highway Star, which is a reference to a famous Deep Purple song;\\n\r\n- and even the name of the protagonist's stand, Crazy Diamond, is an obvious reference to a Pink Floyd song called Shine on You Crazy Diamond.\\n\r\nBesides the rock references, the series occasionally refers to old-school manga and some famous people of that era: for example, they mention the name of some famous wrestler in one of the episodes, which is used as a pun.\\n\r\nOverall, this aspect is one of the things that I've always liked about JoJo, because it adds an interesting and unique flavour to the series, and also because I'm a rock/blues/metal guy myself, and I like many of those old-school bands very much.\\n\\n\r\nNow, when I mentioned some specifics of the story, let's talk about the controversial aspects it has.\\n\\n\r\n1) Just like other JoJo anime, DIU is very heavy on explanations and expository monologue, which is both good and bad:\\n\r\n- on the one hand, while the series constantly introduces new unusual elements to the plot (new stand powers, ghosts, aliens etc.), it also does a great job at setting the rules of how those elements work most of the time. This is something that I've always liked about JoJo and one of the things that makes this series good: no matter what crazy ideas the author comes up with, he usually gives some basic explanation and sets some limitations to the way they work, which makes the whole thing look a little less arbitrary, and also makes the characters use interesting strategies, which are undoubtedly one of the main strengths that all JoJo anime have;\\n\r\n- at the same time, the constant talking also leads to some fairly ridiculous situations. For example, one character gets attacked by the antagonist who stands several meters from him, and the attacked character and his friend somehow manage to exchange several phrases in those few seconds before the blow is landed, as if their dialogue exists in a different timeframe. Or, there is a situation when the antagonist talks to an almost defeated character, says that he has twenty seconds (!) before that character's friends arrive... and yet he doesn't hurry to leave the scene at all, keeps talking and gets beaten in the end.\\n\r\nBesides, this show is one of the biggest infringements of the \"show, don't tell\" rule I've ever seen, as the characters often comment on bloody obvious things that need no commentary at all. For example, the characters chase the antagonist, he disappears in the crowd, and one of them screams something like: \"PEOPLE ARE GOING FROM WORK! HE DISAPPEARED IN THE CROWDS!\". Well, thank you Captain Obvious: you've just ruined a dramatic moment by explaining something I totally couldn't see myself. And this thing happens quite often and, of course, detracts some points from the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n2) While most arcs of the show are very short and often limited to one or two episodes, there is a long arc involving a serial killer, who is also the user of a very powerful stand. This arc is more interesting because it has elements of a thriller and many lives at stake, which makes it feel more important than all other arcs. The problem here is that the show that loves to explain virtually everything that happens on screen (including many things that need no explanation at all) somehow drops the ball in this arc and doesn't address a number of important issues that need to be addressed. Those issues are spoilers for the most part, so I'll try to talk about them as vaguely as possible. However, if you absolutely want to avoid getting spoiled, skip the next section of the review:\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\n- one of the characters introduced in this arc is an eleven-year-old kid who spies on his parents using hidden cameras installed all around their house and a monitor in his room, and this plays a very important role in the plot. The problem is that the show never explains where this kid got the equipment and how he was able to install, use and maintain it. Even if we assume that he is a young genius who somehow developed rather specific technical skills at his age that even many adults don't have, it still doesn't explain where and how he got all that equipment in the first place;\\n\r\n- the antagonist very conveniently reveals himself by loudly pronouncing his name twice in a situation where he absolutely doesn't have to do it;\\n\r\n- in the fight that follows, the antagonist fights against two characters, while the other three stand just round the corner. The kid, who is also present at the scene, simply has to call for their help, and yet he doesn't do that even though he knows that those three characters stand there, and nothing prevents him from calling them;\\n\r\n- after one of the characters explodes because of touching another character's body with the antagonist's bomb planted in it, Jousuke saves that character by restoring his body with Crazy Diamond's ability, even though all parts of that character's body including his head were already torn in little pieces, and thus he was certainly already dead (and Jousuke's stand can't resurrect the dead, as was explained in the beginning of the series).\\n\r\nSPOILERS END\\n\r\nOverall, I think the story is still fine as it is, because it's well-paced, entertaining, and has a satisfying and conclusive ending.\\n\r\nThat being said, it could have been even better if the show didn't constantly talk about obvious things and instead addressed some aspects that needed an actual explanation.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\r\nFirst thing you will notice when watching this series is that it has some crazy colour schemes that change all the time. For example, you may see an orange sky which suddenly turns pink, or a character with grey hair which may turn blond or blue depending on the scene. This is probably a matter of a personal taste more than anything, but I personally like this feature: it is artistic, unusual and fits the general bizarrity of the series. Besides, it reminds me a lot of pop-art and those portraits by Andy Warhol where he depicted famous people like Che Guevara and Marilyn Monroe using different colours. In other words, this aspect of JoJo's animation may be considered another interesting tribute to Western culture and something that makes this show stand out of the crowd.\\n\r\nBesides, the series is marked with important change in character designs. While most characters in previous JoJo series are huge ripped men akin to those in Fist of the North Star, the proportions of characters in this series are basically those of normal people. That being said, the character designs still look very stylish, as they usually have interesting haircuts and fashion accessories, which makes them different from designs in many other anime.\\n\r\nThe fighting scenes are also well-animated, and the battles often feature good shots and close-ups that add a lot to the dramatic effect.\\n\r\nIn general, the art and animation are quite impressive in their own way, being some of the most memorable aspects this series has.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nDIU continues the tradition established in previous series by choosing a famous song in English for the ending credits. This time, it's a very good and very catchy song called I Want You by Australian duo Savage Garden. It's interesting to note that all ending songs in English which have been used so far in JoJo TV series appear in chronological progression:\\n\r\n- the first series has Roundabout - a 70s song by Yes;\\n\r\n- SC has Walk Like an Egyptian - an 80s hit by The Bangles;\\n\r\n- and this series has a 90s song by Savage Garden.\\n\r\nSo, not only it is a great music choice and another tribute to Western culture, but that time progression is also an interesting feature which I haven't seen in any other anime franchise to this day. \\n\r\nAs for the opening songs and BGM, they are all very nice, energetic and fitting for the series, but not quite as catchy and memorable as the ending song. In fact, I can't even remember any background melody that particularly stood out for me, but on the other hand, they all do a great job at supporting the mood of the show.\\n\r\nSpeaking of voice-acting, it's generally very good, with characters pronouncing various funny catchphrases, like Jousuke's \"Greato!\", Joutarou's \"Yare Yare Daze\" and, of course, Joseph's \"OH MY GOD!!!\". That being said, I really wish the characters didn't YELL all the time. I understand that YELLING is an integral part of JoJo that shows the passion and spirit of the characters, but sometimes it just sounds overly dramatic and really unnecessary, like in that scene with the antagonist disappearing in the crowds I mentioned earlier. Not saying it's a huge problem - just something the series could have improved on, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nJust like the character designs, the cast also went through certain changes. While the protagonists in previous series were all ripped, GAR men, the protagonist of this series, Jousuke Higashikata, is an illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and seemingly normal high schooler. However, while Jousuke looks like a normal guy of his age, he is by no means a generic character - rather, he is a smart, very reliable and kind guy (except when someone bad-mouths his haircut, that is), and I personally like him quite a lot.\\n\r\nHis two best friends are Okuyasu, who is strong, not very clever and somewhat of a delinquent, and Kouichi - a short and seemingly timid guy who often overcomes his fear and becomes very brave in dangerous situations. They both are ok characters, but perhaps less charismatic than the companions of Jojos in previous series.\\n\r\nThe anime also features the comeback of now older Joutarou Kuujou, who is easily one of the best, if not the best character in the series. He always talks sense and does reasonable things, and often acts like Jousuke's older brother and mentor despite being technically his nephew.\\n\r\nThe other comeback character is Joseph Joestar himself, who is now an almost eighty-year-old man. He comes to Morioh in order to use his stand ability for finding other stand users. Sadly (and strangely), he never actually does that, and generally performs few memorable actions aside from some interesting father-son interactions with Jousuke and one truly heroic moment I won't spoil here.\\n\r\nThe other memorable stand users are serial killer Kira Yoshikage and mangaka Kishibe Rohan. Rohan is one of my favourite characters in the show, as he eventually appears to be a much better guy than he seems at first: he actually cares about other people despite being a selfish bastard on the surface; his words may sound cynical, but they always make sense; and his fanatic, almost maniacal dedication to his work is actually admirable in its own way. As for Kira, he turns out to be a very good opponent for the main characters because of how ruthless and calculative he is.\\n\r\nThe other stand users are far less likeable and interesting, in my opinion, like that yandere girl (whose only memorable trait is that she is a yandere), that greedy little guy Shingekiyo (who is fairly annoying and looks as if he belongs to Dragonball or some fantasy anime), Kira's father (who is fairly annoying and serves more as a plot device to create new stand users) and Toshikazu (who is frankly pathetic and has no interesting and respectable traits whatsoever). Perhaps, the only other stand user whom I genuinely like is Tonio the chef, but he plays a very small role in the series. \\n\r\nBesides the stand users, there are regular humans (like the stand users' family members, for example) and two characters who are neither stand users nor regular humans. I won't spoil who they are, but let's just say that both of them are quite likeable, and each plays an important part in the plot.\\n\r\nOverall, the cast may be somewhat of a mixed bag, but it's still good, and I liked a number of characters in this series.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL\\n\r\nLike most, this anime has its visible drawbacks and could be surely improved in some areas. That being said, it's still a good, enjoyable and memorable series which is far better than most other shounens and most recent stuff in general. \\n\r\nSo, if you have already watched the previous JoJo series, I highly recommend to watch this one too. And if you haven't, go watch those first and enjoy the ride!",

            "content": "By far the best JoJo anime, it does things differently than the other 3 first parts, it has the best characters, and the highest overall episode quality, and here comes why.\r\nTopic Number One!\r\nStory \r\nUnlike the other parts, instead of focusing on a linear storyline, it focuses in little stories about the characters that introduces new characters and some plotpoints, or just show the characters doing cool stuff. This works really well for part 4 considering that the episodes have good premises, and set the tone of the anime pretty well, even thought it feels that some stuff could have gotten more attention, it doesn't reallysubtract from the experience.\\n\\n\r\nTopic Zwei\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nPart 4 has a different artstyle than the previous ones, being kinda of a transition from the party of immense and extremely masculine men, to something that's slightly more realistic.\\n\r\nAnd that's a change for the best, the character designs look better, and no longer look so ridiculous, however the animation budget is obviously extremely inferior to the other part, having many scenes that look weird, and various imperfections along the anime, although fortunely the blu-ray version fixed most of the animation errors.\\n\\n\\n\r\nTopic ACT THREE\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nAs any JoJo part, it has a insanely good sound design(good enough that everyone makes memes with them), every time a character appears with their stand it just has the best sound effect ever for it, every punch, every ability activation, the sound effects fir perfectly.\\n\r\nAlso the voice acting leaves nothing to complain, the characters have good voices, and they interpret their roles perfectly, making the quotes all the more memorable.\\n\r\nAnd the soundtrack as any JoJo part is solid gold, the openings kick ass, the musics fit and are also damn good on their own, the ending seems boring at first, but then you find that you can't stop listening to it. in my opinion it's the best soundtrack and sound design in all the JoJo series.\\n\\n\r\nTopic For\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nPart 4 features the best characters in the JoJo anime series(perhaps not better than part 5,but that's yet to be seen), everyone has their own cool personality and design, and their own cool power, no one aside from the extras characters feels bland.\\n\r\nAnd the villain is on par with the villains of the other JoJo parts, he manages to be believable even thought he doesn't has any specific motivation, which is something that's rare to see.\\n\\n\r\nTop Five\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt's the most enjoyable part of JoJo, every episode is engaging, even the ones that don't contribute in anyway to the story. Morioh feels just like the Crazy small town that it's supposed to be, and you will not end up bored for even a second. the pacing is perfect and the direction is gold. making up for a golden experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\\n\r\nThe best part of JoJo, it blends everything that it has to make the most fun JoJo part. it's the peak of the JoJo anime.",

            "content": "Alright before I get into this, this review most definitely represents the JoJo Franchise in it's entirety, as well as for Part 4 personally. JoJo to begin with, is something I could easily live for just to point that out. There are an infinite number of reasons why I say these words. Simply put the thrill and edge cutting uniqueness it packs, is INSANELY incredible. From character designs, color pallets, references, inventive world building, meaning/symbolism, culture, history, music, humor, mystery, and infinitely on....the JoJo Franchise is the embodiment of all these things. JoJo is literally everything. JoJo is the World itself, no puns. It isa international representation. It exhibits all aspects of the world, it's cultures and all it has to offer. This is why I say this. Araki is and ever beyond his time. \\n\\n\r\nOut of all Parts in the series, Part 4 is the perfect example of what the series is. No matter how much flack it gets. It represents what JoJo truly is and even demonstrates how it will continue to evolve into even greater. It assures that the viewer pays homage to the series previous parts and even accentuates their importance. It is heavily story driven, and even still with this task successfully blossoms with color, a sense of realism, detail, fantasy, fiction, sci-fi, brilliant stand battles, etc. It contains this seamless flow that is impossible to not enjoy. It introduces really well designed characters and stands such as Kira and Rohan, Terunosuke Miyamoto, or Echoes and Heaven's Door; which in my personal opinion are insanely genius works of Araki. Moreover, there is this sense of resourcefulness in every character that you begin to see appreciate as the story unfolds. This meticulousness that is somehow sensational. On top of all this, Araraki does what he does best---having the ability to take a basic concept and make it seem as if you've never seen it before, hence exotic. It's able to maintain this eccentric, thrilling, interesting demeanor so flawlessly. This is why JoJo is on a higher echelon of quality. This is what JoJo is and that's why there's truly nothing like it.",

            "content": "There's a phrase that says \"There's no place to go but up\". However in Jojo's case, what would be up? The last Part ended a three Arc long storyline that had been going on since the very beginning of the Manga/Anime. So really, what could have higher stakes than this?\r\nThe answer was, surprisingly, quite simple: Lower the scale of the overall plot and give us a story with generally lower stakes. That, my friends, is the basis of the fourth Part of Jojo: Diamond Is Unbreakable (Or Diamond Is Not Crash as the infamous Duwang translation called it). So, let's Jam:\r\nStory:\r\nSimilar to Part 3, Theplot is largely episodic, arguably even more so depending on your point of view. At least in Part 3, there was a definite end point that was established as early as the first Volume/Episode 3. It takes until almost the halfway point of Diamond Is Unbreakable for that end point to appear.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this kind of storytelling does have its pros. For one thing, it helps develop the setting quite well. The city of Morioh is house to many interesting locals and people, and the stationary setting allows the development of it quite well. There's also a mystery element involved here, what with the cast not even knowing who the main villain is for most of the Part.\\n\\n\r\nI also feel this Part is better paced than the last one. Again, the episodic format allows for more explanation of the characters, but most of the time some of the main plot will be happening in the background of most episodes, so most of them don't really feel wasted, which is helped by the fact that Araki got a lot more creative for this Part.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nAs always with Jojo, it's the characters that are the highlight. Jotaro and Joseph return, with Joseph mostly having a background role aside from his introductory arc, and Jotaro in turn taking up his Grandfather's role as a mentor. I quite liked this, as it gives it a weird feeling of inheritance, which is a recurring theme in the early parts of Jojo.\\n\\n\r\nHowever it's the new cast that gets the most focus, as they deserve. Josuke is probably the most similar MC to Johnatan, however it would be a mistake to call him a gentleman given that he dresses like a Freaking delinquen. I quite like him, to say the least. However it's actually newcomer Hirose Koichi who gets the most development. We see him go from a weak willed kid who is frankly pathetic to (For lack of better words) a grown as man who has grown some freaking balls. And of course there's Nijimura Okuyasu, who's just so lovable you can't bring yourself to hate him.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the real star of the show is Kishibe Rohan. He's a kinda interesting take on the whole \"Bad guy turns good guy\" character, in that he doesn't really change even after his Face Turn. He's still an egocentric jackass who's only helping out because he's not stupid enough so as to let a serial killer run loose. He has also given us some beautiful lines, with my favorite being \"Americans have shit taste\".\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course then there's Kira Yoshikage, the main antagonist. He's definitely a departure from precious antagonists, as he can be quite courteous and even polite, and overall he doesn't seem like that and a guy but instead just a normal life who just wants a normal life. But of course the guy is still a serial killer and a sociopath, so it's not as if it's an easy thing to achieve. There's also a soft reboot to his character after his second story arc that I won't even dare spoil due to how brillant it is.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's not even half the cast! There are so many other memorable characters I could mention, like Yamagishi Yukako, one of the earliest Yanderes (And still one of the best given that she actually develops as a character as she actually realizes than what she did was wrong), or even Shizuka Joestar, The invisible baby, or even the overly eccentric Italian chef Tonio Trussandi. Overall, Part 4 has one of the best casts in the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\\n\r\nOverall the show looks pretty good... in The Blu-Rays. Unfortunately the TV reproduction of the series had multiple off-model moments that I can't even begin to describe, with the most infamous being the \"Quality Queen\" shot. Now the Blu-Ray does fix this and overall, that combined with the lack of censorship increases the quality of the animation quite a lot. On the plus sude, no matter is it's the Blu-Ray or the TV Version the show looks great on movement.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is once again great. It goes for a mix of heavy techno combined with calmer classically instrumented scenes for an absolutely delicious combination. As far as the Openings go, \"Crazy Noisy Bizarre Town\" (Both in EDM and Disco flavor) is absolutely fabulous and entertaining, \"Chase\" is just a great rock song and \"Great Days\" carries a hopeful tone that cannot be matched, especially the version used for the final credits that brings together the singers of all previous Openings.\\n\\n\r\nVoice Acting:\\n\\n\r\nThe cast is great. Ono Daisuke and The Late Great Ishizuka Unsho come back and do a great job as always. Of course, they're not the Stars, of the show, oh no, the rest of the cast is. I don't have much experience with Ono Yuuki as of writing this, but I think he did a pretty good job as Josuke. Takagi Wataru was also great as Okuyasu, and it's easy to see why he was one of the two Seiyuus kept from the CC2 games (The other Being Yamaguchi Kappei as Shigechi).\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, above then all in terms of quality is Morikawa Toshiyuki as Kira. While Sephiroth might still be his most iconic role, this is hands down my favorite role of his. The guy just completely sold Kira's sociopathy, and overall did a great job at also sounding like a mostly normal sounding guy.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, the rest of the cast is great as well. We have talents such as Toyoguchi Megumi, Kaji Yuuki, Ohara Sayaka, Moribuko Showtaro, Noto Mamiko and even the one and only Chiba Shigeru. Overall, Part 4 continues the Anime's trend of having a fantastic cast.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Part 4 is nothing but fun. While it may not be flawless, I can honestly why more than a few people consider this their favorite part, and it's definitely among my three favorites. It's got it all: Drama, action, mystery, comedy... there's a little bit of everything in this one. Needless to say, this was definitely my favorite anime of the year it came out in.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 9/10",

            "content": "The MAL score suggests diamond-like quality, but this part 4 of JoJo's adventures is much more comparable to a polished crystal. It's very clean, impressively shaped, but ultimately, while it's pretty to look at, it won't make you rich.\r\nConsidering only the entertainment value, this anime is amazing in every aspect, it's audio-visually pleasing, characters have enough room for development, storytelling is decent, the occasional comedy is on point. I actually enjoyed watching it more than around 90% of shows on my list...\r\nHowever, that's it. I had a blast while watching, but the fact that I completed it today will not be on my mind tomorrow,which is a shame, really. This emotional fade-out is something I expect from a top 50-ish anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven without the additional value, \"Diamond is Unbreakable\" would probably deserve it's place in MAL ranking, if it wasn't so ridiculously flawed.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts of strong with the introduction of main protagonists, has an acceptable finish, but the middle part, which uses mostly the 1-problem-per-2-episodes formula, is kind of hit-and-miss. Almost every episode contains some form of convenient bullcrap. Jotaro ignores the effectiveness of his own power, Koichi and the others are being purposely dumb, blind and whatnot... typical anime shenanigans. While this is acceptable in a battle shounen, it doesn't complement the criminal/thriller aspect of the story very well.\\n\r\nCompared to the other parts of JoJo, the twists and climaxes are much more consistent in terms of quality, but that's not necessarily a good thing. While \"Stardust Crusaders\" had it's pathetic lows, the last 7 or so episodes were more memorable than anything from \"Diamond is Unbreakable\" simply because the hype curve went from close-to-zero right off the charts.\\n\\n\r\nThe best word I can find to describe the art of \"Diamond is Unbreakable\" is \"outstanding\", because it really stands out in terms of colors, art style and animation. The animation feels less fluid as it felt in the prequels, but it is still above average. The lighter and cooler color palette is fresh and interesting. I also have the impression that the drawing of characters has improved quite a lot (might be a thing that transitioned from manga)\\n\r\nOpening themes are good, but in my opinion way worse than the first 4 JoJo openings. Endings are about the same quality as they were before (=great).\\n\r\nSoundtrack goes well with situations and the art style, but the score is not very memorable by itself.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not very balanced personality-wise. There are some good and at least somehow complex characters like Josuke, Jotaro, Kira, Rohan, but there are also annoying simpletons like Koichi, Hazamada, Yukako. However, as I've pointed out in the beginning, each one of them has enough time to shine and they are used often and properly, which is quite unusual and commendable, even though this notably delays the story progression. Quite a shame, really, this would have been a great slice of life drama setting, but it's a battle-driven story instead... yare yare daze.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it all up, the 4th part of JoJo's adventures might be the best one of the pack (I still enjoyed \"Battle Tendency\" more), but it has it's objective flaws which shouldn't be overlooked. I would argue that the MAL community overrates it a little, but that's just my insignificant impression. Still a strong 7/10 (story 5 + 2 for the execution of the thriller aspect in battle environment, art 10, sound 7, characters 6,5, enjoyment 10)",

            "content": "I'll get right to the point and say that I thought Diamond is Unbreakable was a solid OK, it wasn't terrible but it was definitely the weakest of the 4 parts so far in my opinion.\r\nSPOILER WARNING: While I'll try not to give away spoiler moments in the show, I will talk about missed opportunities or things that I think the show could have done which basically implies that it didn't happen hence the spoiler warning (mouthful lol)\r\nStory - One of the two things I liked LEAST about the show. It started off pretty interesting with the introduction of our new hero and how he'sconnected to the JoJo lineage but after the chili pepper arc I felt like we didn't need to be in this town of Morioh anymore. Everything afterwards seemed to just kind of drag and then we got the villian of the week episodes and this new main antagonist that didn't really resonate until MUCH later in the show. The story and adventure of the previous JoJo parts were what made the show so interesting and fun but this felt very contained which made it a little boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound - Far and away the BEST part of this show is the animation and music choices. Each character has a unique look about them and the opening/ending songs perfectly fit the bizarre nature of this show. Honestly at this point, it's pretty much a given that watching this show will be visually satisfying even if the story itself is a weak.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - This is what bugged me the most about this show, the emptiness of a lot of these characters which is  a shame because we spent 39 episodes with them. The main character Jousuke is pretty good and resemble a young Joseph Joestar with his wit and humor. I really liked the creative ways he would use his stand. Kira as the main antagonist in the later half was weak at first but he definitely became more formidable as time went on. Truly a scary villian almost on the same level as Dio. Kouichi was probably the only character that showed development and it was apparent in his stand that evolved as the show went on. Okuyasa... sigh the DEFINITION of a missed opportunity since he probably has one of the coolest and most interesting stands but does basically nothing with it after the chili pepper arc. I think it was a huge writing mistake to make a character that dumb have a stand that interesting. Joutarou was like a mentor and had some standout moments while Joseph was practically handicapped and sidelined to be a caretaker of some random invisible baby. Last character I want to talk about is Rohan who was intoduced late into the show as something of a villian but quickly became one of my favorite characters and added so much to the show with his interesting Stand and investigative skills. Everyone else, hair stand girl, chef man, makeup woman, Shigechi etc were all pretty much forgettable\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - When the show was good it was GOOD. The beginning ARC and last like 10 episodes had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, etc it's just that middle portion of complete nonsense and no plot that drove me crazy. A must watch for fans.\\n\\n\r\nOverall/Closing thoughts - I think this was good but it could have been MUCH better. It's my least favorite arc to date with a story that was too contained in a town that I didn't really care that much about. Hope Part 5 adds more fun and adventure when (if) that comes out!\\n\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ll admit, I have some mixed feelings on Jojo\u2019s as a whole. While it\u2019s certainly wonderfully ridiculous and unique, I tend to find the characters kind of bland and one-note, and some running gags to be overused. That doesn\u2019t mean I hate it, it just means it\u2019s a crapshoot on whether or not I enjoy certain parts.\r\nThankfully, Diamond is Unbreakable is the most consistent Jojo\u2019s has been so far, not as ludicrously fun as Battle Tendency, but by far the most solid storytelling the series has ever had. Unlike previous parts, which were big adventure epics where the fate of the world hung in thebalance, this one centers around a single town afflicted by a Twin Peaks-esque murder mystery. The first half of the series is almost a slice-of-life story, with our new cast of characters just hanging around and bumping into Stand users every now and then. But that\u2019s actually a compliment, as this extended downtime with them really helps solve Jojo\u2019s biggest problem: it develops a large, likable cast of characters with a wide variety of personalities, motivations, and powers.\\n\\n\r\nOur latest Jojo, Josuke Higashikita, is especially charming thanks to the fact that unlike previous iterations, he\u2019s very much an underdog. Lacking the easy confidence of Jonathan, Joseph and Jotaro, he instead exudes an endearing dorkiness that matches well with his Stand\u2019s more compassionate, defensive abilities. He\u2019ll never top Joseph in terms of sheer entertainment value, but he\u2019s by far the easist Jojo to sympathize with.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast acquit themselves well too. Koichi is a coward who grows into his courage and new abilities well, Okuyasku is an entertaining dimwit with a heart of gold, and Jotaro\u2019s stoic presence plays much better as a support to a group of bigger characters than as the lead of Stardust Crusaders. Even the side characters, like Yukako and the hilarious Italian chef, are given more depth and personality than pretty much anyone before. And, of course, the murderous Yoshikage Kira is a nastier, more personal villain than anything we\u2019ve faced before, leading to some incredibly tense encounters and some surprisingly well-earned pathos.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, the creativity in the Stands themselves has grown exponentially. From the ever-evolving Echoes, to a rat that can cube meat, to the electrifying Red Hot Chili Pepper, to that one weird Stand that was just a telephone Pylon, the battles in this part are some of the most creative mind games the series has ever come up with. Heck, there are even some Stand users who aren\u2019t enemies, but are just part of the town, leading to some very different encounters than what we\u2019re used to.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I still have some problems with the series as a whole- too much damn narration, too much casual sexism- I greatly enjoyed Part 4, and I'm definitely looking forward to Vento Aureo this coming fall. Here's hoping it keeps the streak alive.",

The monster of the week format is still there, but done better and in a wonderful, trippy, charming static setting. The general atmosphere is akin to a typical slice of life comedy - riddled with urban legends and horror that disrupt it - which is literally the ongoing theme throughout the season. \r\nThe manga left more of an impression on me when reading because of Araki's amazingart style and color scans provided by Shueishas's JOJO-D. The anime tried to mimic that tone but, in my opinion, failed to do so because they focused more on static stills and stylish shots rather than dynamic animation. Some would argue this is a stylistic choice but for this medium, it doesn't realy work well in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a strong 9, if you're 3 seasons in and you want to continue with more Jojo if only to see where this show goes and to see the new setting, characters, soundtrack, animation, and fights - definitely watch this all the way. The villain of this part is probably the best villain of all time (the Queen references and American Psycho/David Bowie inspiration definitely help with this). Part 4 is among the two best written parts out of all of the Jojo parts.",

Now on the other hand they\u2019ve started on Parts 1 & 2 and re-releasing Part 3. Since the 2012 anime JoJo\u2019s popularity has sky rocketed, with Part 3 getting two seasons and Part 4 getting both an anime and a live-action film by Takashi Miike (one of my favourite directors),anyway I\u2019m here to give an overview on whether Part 4 is good or not.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s fantastic\u2026there\u2019s not really much to say, if you liked parts 1 to 3 you\u2019ll like part 4 and if your new to the JoJo series then I\u2019d recommend watching the 2012 anime first (as it covers parts 1 & 2) then move on from there. It has a unique commendable animation style, very interesting characters and a well written story. Come on the mangaka has done up to part 8 now, this should be enough proof. If you like shonen anime with good fights you\u2019ll like this what more is there to say, watch it.\\n\\n\r\nJoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable \u2013 8/10 Better than parts 1 & 2 but not as good as part 3 in my opinion.\\n",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER:\r\nYadda yadda spoilers yadda yadda\r\nLet's discuss the art and sound first shall we? Art has improved since Stardust Crusaders,it's even better than past installments. Artists seem to use changing of overall color of the scene to symbolize feelings of a character. For example a character is angered so the scene is portrayed with strong,hot colors like red and orange. There are no immediately noticeable dips in quality and you can see a lot of effort was put in every frame when fight scenes come up. Characters seem to look a bit more smoother and less muscular than past incarnations of JoJo taking out a bitof that over the top factor out. However this is compensated for by backgrounds usually looking like some weird, I daresay bizarre, dream versions of real life. There's a pretty noticeable dip in quality in episode 21, I heard it was outsourced to another studio, where there was lots of derp frames. This is something that happens in a few other episodes which does somewhat annoy me but to no great effect.\\n\r\nSound effects are top notch as always tho the first opening is much tamer than the past ones. Second one is a bit too generic, for a JoJo opening at least, but certainly intrigues with it's visual parts. Third one is definitely nowhere close to openings from part 1,2 and 3 in it's presentation. While first three JoJo's had openings bursting with energy and movement this one is much slower. Which can be good or bad depending on what you like but for me it was a pretty decent one. The art style and perfect use of sound effects are enough to boil your blood. Yeah and 10 for both tho I'd rather you just draw conclusions yourself without me numbering my opinions for you\\n\\n\r\nStory is what I'd like to touch on next.Firstly focus was set on a mystical artifact called Bow and Arrow. Err and it's literally Bow and Arrow I guess Araki wasn't imaginative enough to make it a flaming gun with tits or something of that kin.Anyway the gist of the artifact is that it grants people with Stand potential Stand powers when fired into them however if they do not have any potential the shot outright kills them. Josuke Higashikata,fourth JoJo and protagonist of this anime, is visited by Jotaro Kujo,third JoJo and protagonist of Stardust Crusaders. Jotaro explains the situation with Stands and Bow and Arrow as well as telling Josuke he's a son of Joseph Joestar,second JoJo the protagonist of Battle Tendencies. From there on most episodes boil down to Josuke,Jotaro and a few other supporting characters that later join them fighting evil Stand users. However there is a point at which certain somebody becomes the main antagonist.His appearance is teased for a long time and payoff is an arc that makes this parts plot much better.There's some plot holes and plot sometimes stagnates so much that dust settles on it so here's a 7 now bite it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are diverse and have their quirks. Jotaro seems to have much more misanthropic way of acting thus far which I prefer over his ,,too cool for y'all,, behavior in Stardust Crusaders. Josuke seems much more interesting than him and supporting cast and villains cover a wide spectrum of personalities. However they are not that overly complex and despite me liking them their behavior and looks can be a bit stereotypical. Might as well give a 7.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is guaranteed if you aren't somebody who can't go five minutes without nihilistic thoughts. The colors,the sound, the way they make every hit matter in a fight make this anime exciting. Battle Tendencies is still my favourite JoJo anime but I'd say this one is just behind it because of the mash of art and sound and yes I know I'm repeating that the whole time but it is impossible not to when today's anime always goes for dark and edgy look rather than something energetic like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. I would give it a 10 but there are times when twists are a bit too predictable or I simply wasn't enjoying the anime to the point it'd warrant a tenner so here's an 8.\\n\\n\r\n8/10 is ,I'd say, a fair score for this anime considering lackluster portions of the story and introduction of too many characters leaving them spread a bit too thin.",

Especially the villain, Kira Yoshikage. He's not your typical \"I'm going to take over the world!\" type villain. He is just a simple man with a fetish for female hands.

            "content": "Jojo's bizarre adventure: diamond is unbreakble is the 4th part of Jojo's bizarre adventure. The preceding parts of Jojo have been overall enjoyable, but noticeably flawed, to the detriment of my enjoyment. Is this the case for DIU? No!!!!!\r\nSTORY 9/10\r\nThe story is f*** amazing! It begins in the small Japanese town known as Morioh. Jotaro (from part 3) goes there to see a reletive of his. Josuke, his uncle, is now attending high school (yes, the uncle of a 30-something year old man is attending high school), and making friends with little people, a manga artist, a yandere and there's also a few serial killers.The actual story doesn't kick in until halfway through the show. Before then, it's a collection of stories about the mystery behind Morioh and it's residents. Once the story actually starts it's OH MA GAAAHHHD!!!!! The last 10 episodes or so are as intense as the Cold War, the main antagonist is one of the best anime villains out there, and there's actual character arcs!! Starting this show, I was worried that this would be another part 3; a collection of useless stories that hardly impact the overall story. This is not the case. There are exactly 4 episodes that are as formulaic and pointless as the average stardust episode. There were plenty of times where I thought it was going to take the generic route again, but I was quickly proved wrong after seeing some of the most unconventional and cleverly-written episodes of Jojo ever!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 10/10\\n\r\nOH MA GAAAHHHD!!!!! The main cast of characters are Josuke, the charismatic Jojo of this story, his friend Koichi, a short, puny kid whose character arc is one of the best ones in this show. Rohan, a seclusive manga artist, and Jotaro is back!!! The first half has a similar style to stardust crusaders; a different character fights someone every episode or 2. Again, a delight, seeing every character have their own time in the spotlight. The last time I watched a Jojo part, the villains as a whole were pointless and never brought up again and were 1 dimensional. While there are very few of those types of people in it, every \"villain\" in this show is super important! Almost all of the villains appear again in later episodes and contribute somehow. The greatest delight is when a villain character now becomes a good guy and fights alongside them. Actually, a majority of the villains are dynamic and developed enough to effectively do that.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nJojo's art style continues to impress me. Although it's still not as trippy and colorful as part 2, and the characters don't look as real as they do in part 3, what this show has going for it is color palette. A lot of purple, yellow, green, pink and blue make up what this show looks like. Not to mention the sound, which is also great. The 2nd opening is one of my favorite OPs ever, and although the soundtrack doesn't have stand-out tracks, it's still fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\r\nJojo part 4 improves upon Jojo in almost every way imaginable. From Pink Floyd references, to invisible babies, to memes, this show is great! My only apparent flaw is the pacing of the first half, and the few episodes that aren't important to the grand story. I give it my best recommendation, and urge you to get into Jojo ASAP. It's things like this that makes someone appreciate Jojo so much. If you're anything like me, you'll watch part 1 and 2 and say \"why is this so popular?\" Trust me, don't give up on it.",

            "content": "David Production's most recent adaptation of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure remains true to its source material and pulls off the most fabulous iteration in one of the franchise's best installments. Rich in action and interesting Stand fights, Diamond is not Crash or Diamond is Unbreakable is the epitome of JJBA's long-standing popularity as a unique battle shonen.\r\nDiU is based off the fourth part of JJBA, centering around a new JoJo, Josuke Higashikata, the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar, and a fifteen-year murder mystery that befalls Morioh, his hometown...or so how it goes.\r\nThe story starts off fairly slow, retaining some monster-of-the-week elements from Stardust Crusaders. The goodside to this is that we get to see Hirohiko Araki flex his creative ability to deliver far more entertaining fights that rival the Egypt Arc from Part 3. New Stands are introduced and battles get more entertaining and unpredictable in later episodes as well, especially the brilliant final arc that is possibly one of the highest points of the franchise. The bad side, aside from the fact that it becomes formulaic in setup, is that it causes some unnecessary filler.\\n\\n\r\nTake for example the episode about Tonio Trussardi, the chef with Stand powers. While with all due respect that his Stand is awesome, it doesn't really do much aside from being novelty. What's more is that for the rest of the show, he never gets some time to shine at all, and becomes an irrelevant background character in later arcs.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, what's interesting is that some fights may be filler to some extent, some episodes work as filler to actually set up future plot development. It allowed good use of foreshadowing to the eventual reveal of the series' main villain, through an episode about make-up.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of foreshadowing, this might be the most well thought-out JoJo plot yet, and you can clearly see that it had a planned direction of things to come. My favorite foreshadowing of the show is when they use Morioh Radio to reference future episodes. Almost any instance of Morioh Radio playing indicates a plot point that may or may not arrive at the next episode, and it creates a great feeling of anticipation for viewers with keen eyes.\\n\\n\r\nBut most of this smart structuring wouldn't be as apparent if not for the great color palette accompanying it. Morioh's sky, for one, does not have a permanent color, and it can be any entry from the color wheel except blue but still manage to be beautiful. I commend David Productions for going all-out with their colors this time, and I may not be an expert on the science of colors, but I know when something is visually appealing. Praise unto Hirohiko Araki, of course, for being continuously playful with colors, and it is in Part 4 where his fashion statement emphasizes the character designs even more.\\n\\n\r\nAs colorful as his designs are the characters themselves\u2014and we get a number of significant Stand users whose intentions aren't to become one-hit wonders like Stardust Crusaders had. Most of them remain in the story, actually forming an ensemble of Stand users that aren't just Josuke and the main cast, and get some time in the spotlight to show off their powers as well. Discussing all of them would be pretty long, so I will just focus on the main protagonist and antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nKeeping up with this colorful cast, we also meet the most down-to-earth JoJo yet: Josuke Higashikata is more quirky than Stardust's Jotaro, and his attitude breathes fresh air into JJBA. He isn't a bad person, nor isn't he exactly a goody-two-shoes either; he lands on the balance as a guy taking advantage of people in the least hurtful way possible, and a headstrong personality much similar to his father. While they are similar, Josuke could be likened to a watered-down version of Joseph, and at first he may be less entertaining to watch. Through time, though, we get to see more of his playful side and humble attitude, making him another fun JoJo.\\n\\n\r\nYet as much as good of a JoJo Josuke is, the praise of the series often goes to its main antagonist, Yoshikage Kira. Lauded as one of the best well-written villains in the franchise yet, Kira's characterization puts him at a significant one-up over the franchise's poster villain, Dio Brando. A sociopathic serial killer who has been silently covering tracks of his crimes for the past fifteen years prior to the beginning of the show, Kira isn't written as all-powerful as Dio, nor is he written as some invincible character that can stop time. He is on the same footing as much as the cast is, and it is this constant friction with the characters' plans that makes him and the series at a higher level than the previous installments. How he also gets more screentime than other JJBA villains also highlight his character development, making him the most fleshed-out villain so far.\\n\\n\r\nWith short mention of the supporting characters, I want to give praise to Rohan Kishibe, the town's resident mangaka for his quirky attitude and great foil to Josuke. Joseph and Jotaro also return as supporting characters, and their presence in the cast sort of gives a satisfying feeling for keeping up with JJBA through these past three installments.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation has been keeping up, too\u2014while David Production's animation isn't something you would call stellar, you could definitely see the effort in their production values, from the amazing transitions to the three well-detailed OPs\u2014of which of course particular praise goes to Great Days. Everything in this show is more fluid than the previous ones, keeping a dynamic gain for viewer attention aside from being mere lip flaps that I swear were one half of Stardust Crusaders' animation.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice cast does give their characters justice, although I would have preferred Rohan's game VA, Hiroshi Kamiya as his voice actor and not Takahiro Sakurai. It boggles my mind also that Koichi's VA is Yuki Kaji, considering how high-pitched the guy often screams. Daisuke Ono's portrayal of Jotaro just the way he should be portrayed\u2014calm, serious, and collected, is still one of the highlights of the cast's overall performance. You will somehow miss Takehito Koyasu, though...you won't be hearing those mudas anymore.\\n\\n\r\nWith JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's firm justification of the term \"bizarre,\" the franchise's initial entries weren't something you would call the best, but they sure know how to keep a person enjoyed. With the addition of DiU to the anime franchise, though, it does not only cement a new wave of uniqueness, but also a strong candidate to be one of the best solid-written action series out there.",

From a bodybuilder gay vampire in Part 1 to a... Serial Killer that has a Hand Fetish in Part 4... Huh... \r\nANYWAY, Where i am going with this is that Jojo's Bizarre Adventure's strongest point lies in its Characters and Bizarre Story. Diamond Is Unbreakable or better known as Part 4 is a great example of that. The Heroes of this Part all have their own unique Personalities and Quirks, but some are really underused and have their screen-time only once or twice aftertheir own arc. This is the only problem that Part 4 has with its Characters. \\n\r\nThe Story isn't really as Bizarre as the other parts, but it's one, If not, The Best in its whole franchise (and this is coming from a Manga Reader). It didn't make much changes from the manga, but it's basically the same. It did cut some conversations and lines, but that's it.\\n\r\nThe Openings are as good as ever (but there's no CGI anymore :[) and the OST is a masterpiece, every character theme fits. \\n\r\nThe Art is good, but the Animation can get awkward sometimes.\\n\r\nIf you haven't even touched Jojo yet, then what are you doing, mate? \\n\r\nI would definitely recommend it to everyone to try it out.\\n\\n",

OST + BGM + SFX = always as its best.\\n\\n\r\nafter 3 parts, it's awesome that the author still able create a original character without have similarities with the previous that was created from the other part. maybe there is some similarities but i haven't found any character that compare-able. it's really hard to make a simple yet quirky character, and this part MC are just really a fun gang to follow!\\n\\n\r\nedit part;\\n\r\ni love how they make the MC, Josuke, acts like a real teenager, bcs the previous jojos are just too much for character that actually still in their teens. it shows perfectly that they really are in their teens, then the breathtaking moments of the last 4 episode hit it right.. it's shocking. \\n\r\ni could say the arc and the main villain character is outstanding, perfectly written. this is the best villain so far i could find in the story i've experienced. the main villain, the david bowie aka yoshikage kira is really evil in very smart way. actually it's rather typical BUT the entire final arc makes it perfect. the thrills is really terrifying. the villain is a human yet it's scarier than our usual mighty-immortal-vampire.\\n\\n\r\n;overall;\\n\r\ni enjoy it a lot. if you skip the other part maybe it is still enjoyable, every part has its own iconic bizarre-ness feeling. the climax of final battle end this part perfectly! somehow the previous parts climax lacks some thrills but this one really mind-blowing. it is definitely a refreshment from the 'thesedays-anime' series. the best fun-thrilling bizarre adventure!",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is not Crash is one of the most disappointing adaptions that I've seen of a classic shounen manga. You might be thinking, \"well a 6/10 isn't that bad\". WRONG, this anime should be a 10/10. It should have fixed the small problems of the manga and improved on it - like what David Production did to the previous parts! Well so what went wrong?\r\nTo start, part 4 is where Araki's distinct style starts to emerge and unfortunately the adaption fails to capture that style and ends up looking completely different from what it should. Which wouldn't be so bad if DavidProduction didn't sacrifice the character's detail in the process. Personally, I hate the way that the lips and the noses are drawn in this anime. I also found the music to be a little tame in comparison to the previous parts, which made the fights alot less exciting. \\n\\n\r\nWhat this anime does get right however, is establishing a somewhat lighthearted and colourful aesthetic right from the start (so that it immediately sets it self apart from stardust crusaders). And it does this through the fantastic and vibrant colour pallet. This is better than the manga, which instead slowly begins to form an identity throughout it's run. Moreover this adaptation's pacing is perfect - no time wasted all killer no filler.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say you're much better off reading the manga, but still worth checking out regardless because of its positives.\\n",

            "content": "I've been very vocal against Jojo and its series due to its immense reliance on asspulls, but this part is a marked improvement over the earlier parts, and for once the villain is neither brain-dead nor completely overpowered. I would recommend skipping parts 1 and 3, and start at 2 or jump to 4. The stories have distinct settings, so I wouldn't say you'll lose much of the plot relative to the time you'll waste.\r\nFirstly, there's really only one villain that matters. It only makes sense, because we all know good people tend to work together while evil people are more selfish and only worktogether when they share a common goal. There's plenty of other villains, but not in the way of part 3 \"I'll give up my life for my lord, but I refuse to work with his other servants.\", and more misguided than evil. In a way you could see this part as more slice of life than other parts in the Jojo series, which were more along the lines of an epic \"The world is in danger as a super powerful villain aims to dominate the world, and there's only a handful of people to stop him.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is pretty decent, except for the ending which felt a bit rushed. I prefer this sort of pacing to the usual Jojo pacing, as it feels like it's developing the characters and setting to be more realistic and easier to imagine/picture, whereas the usual one is just rushing to tell the story, which is in contrast flatter, more generic, and less story, more tool.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Josuke, manages to utilise his ability creatively. You'd think his ability is more fitting of a support character, but he holds his own fairly often, although mostly because his stand already possesses high combat ability to begin with. This is in contrast to part 3, with half the fights being \"Punch the hell out of them, works every time\" or \"Gotta go fast\". Instead, Josuke punches the hell out of other things /s.\\n\r\nThe kid is/kids are useful, rather than just being a cheerleading sidekick like in earlier parts.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough there were still a few asspulls in this part, they were easier to swallow as they involved things that weren't explained because there was no reason/opportunity to do so, rather than \"how convenient that this should happen\" or villain stupidity.\\n\\n\r\nThings I did not like:\\n\r\n- Why was Joseph Joestar in this part? He did nothing, except adopt some kid that also did nothing. There's other characters that don't really further the plot, but at least they were either funny or feel-good, unlike these two.\\n\r\n- Okuyasu was under-utilised, another victim of Araki's tendency to create powerful/absolute characters. Half of the reason could be he's an idiot though, just like the other idiot wielding a powerful Stand.\\n\r\n- The animal was way too strong for a mere animal, they're not supposed to be smarter than DIO but they are. \\n\\n\r\nI would say this anime is more deserving of 7/10, but after considering that MAL scores are often inflated, and that this part is much better than the first 3 Jojo parts which I've already given a savage score for, I've decided to bump this up to 8/10.",

            "content": "I'm writing this review at about halfway through Part 4. I've seen Parts 1-3 as well, and am working my way up to Part 5, which is airing at the time of this review. As I promise to always do in my reviews, there will be NO SPOILERS WHATSOEVER FOR THIS PART. However, THERE WILL BE SPOILERS REGARDING PREVIOUS JOJO PARTS.\r\nTLDR: 4/8/9/8/10 Overall: 7/10\r\nStory: 4/10. This is, by far, the weakest aspect of this Part, especially when compared to the rest of the Parts. There is no real overarching goal that spans the whole Part. The first few episodes have some plotline that it looselyfollows: finding out why all these new Stand users have been appearing in Morioh, despite the death of DIO. However, this is resolved early, and it leads to the feeling that now there is no goal for the protagonists. While the plot synopsis above says that they are investigating the disappearances in Morioh, at episode 20, almost no mention of these disappearances, aside from the fact that they are happening, has occurred. Once the mystery of the Stands is resolved, it almost becomes a Slice of Life as it follows the lives of the main Stand users. Because of this, I give the story a low rating. While one may argue that I'm just not in far enough for the main story to manifest, I'd contest that by episode 20, the story should have fully materialized by now.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. I really love the character designs, especially the characters and how they dress. The show really does carry a great 1999 air about it, fitting the setting of the show well. It's like watching the Fresh Prince of Bel Air: Japan Edition. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10. The OPs are both great. Yes, even Chase, the one that gets flak. The ED is ok, not memorable or provocative like previous ones, but it's ok. The best sound, by far, is Josuke's theme, with a steady beating of the bass and a slow, menacing guitar riff. It's foreboding, and it's by far my favorite effect in the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. I want to give this a 10. I really do. Josuke, Koichi, Okuyasu, the enemy Stand users, they're all great. What brings it down for me, sadly, is Jotaro. He's not the snarky, witty man he was in Part 3. Of course, now he's 28 years old, so supposedly he's matured, but it feels more like he's been stripped of his personality to highlight Josuke's. That being said, Josuke is very likable. He's reminiscent of Jonathon Joester, being kind and helping others, and having a sense of honor, but also being schemey sometimes, as a 16-year-old should be. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10. Despite the weakness of the story, almost all of the episodes are entertaining. There are villains you'll love, villains you'll hate, and what's interesting is seeing which enemy Stand users end up becoming friends with the gang. It isn't like Part 3, where they all join in the first five episodes. The new additions to the gang as the show goes on helps keep it fresh. In addition to adding new characters, some characters recur much later following their introduction, making each character feel less like a throwaway Stand Of The Week ordeal. Josuke and Okuyasu are both fantastic. Koichi will grow on you. And the others, who I won't mention, are generally welcome additions to the cast. Also, when Jotaro uses his Stand, it's fucking awesome, I only wish he would use it more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. In general, it's very good. Sadly, I feel that it pales in comparison to other Parts. Part 3 felt like an epic odyssey as the group traveled halfway across the world in pursuit of DIO. Part 4 feels like you're following the footsteps of some high schools, without a clear goal in sight. This really brings the show down, given how the other parts were pretty plot-driven. The characters make up for this, though. Most Stand battles are interesting, although some can feel dragged out or boring (see: Heaven's Door, which I felt could've been cut to 1 episode instead of 2). All this being said, it's worth watching, if only to catch up on the show before Part 5. If you've watched all Parts up to this point, you'll enjoy this as well. The expansion of Stands helps, and they feel more balanced. It's no longer like Jotaro can just kick everyone's ass with Star Platinum, and each Stand has notable limitations that make fights more intense. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary: Stand battles are better than in Part 3 for the most part, but the plot is much weaker than in any other part. Characters are as likable as before, maybe moreso, with the exception of Jotaro, who feels washed out. Overall, worth a watch if you've liked all the Parts, especially Part 3, but you probably won't like it more than the others.",

Greato daze, as they say over there.\r\nWell, for my review, I gotta point out some stuff. The story was... a bit bland at the start, but when Kira came in, everything got hyped and serious. I had a... how do I say this... I had an erection when I saw Kira's style of living and fighting. The story was a bit slow at the start but was able to introduce the cast to usand present them before we got to the climax.\\n\\n\r\nThe art - like you know, David Production and their constant change of coloring and scenes are what keeps you going sometimes. Their animation style may have downgraded from 3D to 2D, but this is fine. It adds the emphasis and bizarre colors of the scene.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound - god, the songs and the themes are really good. They really play out the bizarre note of the series and make you want to sing along. Some of the themes go along anything in the outside world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters - as you know from the start, Kira is an amazing character. We can understand him through his way of acting and how he is written. Sure, he may be a man who wants a regular life but has a kink for hands, but he is a big threat to the main cast to the point where you know he'd be more dangerous if he actually was more aggressive. Also, the characters are quite enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment - amazing to the point where I couldn't wait for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - recommended to friends and those that watched Jojo.",

It takes the concepts of stands that we saw in part 3 and added so much insanity to it. The crazy thing about this conglomeration of insane powers is none of them feel overpowered or under powered. Each villain the boys encounter and each of the series protagonist gets both chances to shine and chances to prove themselves. While part 3 may have had some interesting concepts for how fights go it doesn't hold a candle to some of theway fights play out in Diamond in Unbreakable. That was one of my favorite parts of this season was the amount of times our heroes got into fights either at a complete disadvantage or way out of their comfort zone. This creates great moments of creativity and ingenuity in each of the fights. That's the beauty of this part, niche powers in situation where either they can thrive or prove their worth in an underdog scenario.   \\n\\n\r\nInstead of the typical approach to shounen series were during of random ass-pull power ups, Jojo's fights tend to play like more like a puzzle. Due to the nature of unique and niche powers the story looks to constantly put the Jobro's out of their comfort zone to showcase how quick witted and resourceful our heroes are. We notice small cracks in the armour of opponents or understand how the power works and how to effectively turn the tables. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the major parts that part 3 felt like it was missing was more of a cohesive world. Granted that world was well, our world at the time the events of stardust crusaders. The world of Morioh feels incredibly lively. Major events and minor fights usually leave behind some sort of \"landmark\" for the eye catcher. These typically giving some background of the area the event or fight adding to the overall town of Morioh. But it's not just the set pieces that add to the overall charm of Morioh. Instead of the usual formula of front loading our main cast and having very little change in that cast we have a smaller main cast and a larger set of recurring characters. These characters were all usually minor villains turned friend by the Jobro's. In turn most of the recruited side characters help out the main cast in some of the more important fights. This approach helps with the slow, small town vibes Morioh gives off with constantly running into familiar faces and friends just going about your business. \\n\\n\r\nThe only complaint I would have is there wasn't a major goal of the plot at the beginning and didn't have much focus there. But I don't really mind cause as it was trying to find its story we got some really fun and exciting episodes. This creates this near peaceful feeling to the town of Morioh. Making the juxtaposition of our primary villain all the more scary rears their head. Best part animated so far and I'm excited to see if the next parts are able to live up to part 4.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN HEAVY SPOILERS FROM PART 4, PLEASE READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!\r\nJoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Diamond wa Kudakenai (or in english, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Diamond is Unbreakable) is the fourth part in the series and arguably, the best that has been animated so far. This will be a review.\r\nSTORY: 8\r\nThe reason that im giving this a 8 and not a 9, is because this part has some problems in storywriting, the main problem of all, is the huge cast of characters and how they are basically useless on the fight with Yoshikage Kira/Kosaku Kawajiri, The only important supportive characters in thispart are: \\n\\n\r\nJosuke Higashikata\\n\r\nOkuyasu Nijimura\\n\r\nJotaro Kujo\\n\r\nKoichi Hirose\\n\r\nRohan Kishibe (The real MVP in this part)\\n\r\nHayato Kawajiri. (The real MVP in this part)\\n\\n\r\nThis are the \"\"Main Characters on this part\"\", but the problem erradicates in this part has a lot of characters that mean a pretty much a really big danger for the main characters (or stands that could be helpful on the fight against kira), but as always, the mayority of this \"Villian of the Week\" are either Forgotten/Killed/Became good and later basically useless, (for example, Yukako).\\n\\n\r\nThe plot starts with Keicho as a villian, later to be reedemed and killed by Red Hot Chili Pepper,  after 12-15 episodes of villian of the week, RHCP is defeated and sended to jail, and later nothing is happening rater that presenting new characters or useless conflicts.\\n\\n\r\nOBVIOUSLY this changes a lot when Kira Yoshikage is first introduced, the story becomes very straight-forward and this is a good thing for the part, im not going too deep on this, but the final fight is very good, and satisfactory like JoJo has used to do.\\n\\n\\n\r\nART: 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe style of drawing in this series is not focused in more slim bodies and focused in fashion, which still has the typical JoJo style of art. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation in some episodes has decreased, (Not to the point of Gintama: Shirogane no Tamashii), but still you can notice it mostly in the episode when Killer Queen is introduced.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is fixed in the bluray, the animation and movement is very fluid and very, very good. \\n\\n\r\nSound: JoJo again, surprise us with his incredible use of sounds in stand effects, and his unique OST.\\n\\n\r\nObviously im not a expert at reviewing ost, but i could say, i enjoyed this ost a lot, The best theme is Kira Yoshikage theme.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe characters has improved quite lot compared to the Stardust Crusaders (or Polnareff, Joseph and Jotaro with other ppl Adventure), the characters feel a lot more like humans and are well builded. I would say the best character is that has the most character development is Koichi Hirose. This is proved in the last episode of DIU, in the speech of Jotaro. BUT STILL, Rohan Kishibe and Josuke Higashikata are my favorite characters in this part.\\n\\n\r\nYoshikage Kira is probably one of the best villians in Anime in general, the psycopath personality is well used and is well balanced not to the point of edgyness. He recieves my Respect.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this part like any other JoJo part, it was a nice ride, fun and emotional in some parts, (Not at the level of SC in emotional). The best episodes were the final ones with Kosaku Kawajiri and Kira Yoshikage.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, i enjoyed Diamond is Unbreakable a lot. The characters and the setting is well used and his worldbuilding is done correctly, also the whole Kira Yoshikage Arc was probably the highest point on this part.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE: 8.",

All of JoJo series use the same art style and they are pretty consistent with the manga .\r\nThe creativity aspect of the special abilityis what i liked the most as to how given a character with a certain ability how he apply it to use in various scenarios i worth watching\\n",

            "content": "This is anime is for mature eyes only. The Jojo series is a real treat to anyone who watches anime. It is however violent and this season is no exception. Blood lingers throughout the season and the main characters are fickle but admirable. It's really colorful yet realistic. For example there is Rohan who I suspect is a surrogate character for the author to display a large portion of his personality. I could be wrong but he seems to have an eye for the world in the same way that the mangaka would. Jojo and his classmates fight menaces to the town along with Joutaro.It's been really fun watching both the sub and dub of this series. I'll be angry if it doesn't end as great as it started. But again be warned the villans are well thought out and I hope I'm not taking a stab at the showrunners by saying it's startling how well thought out they are and how the good guys are not quite photo-esq heroes. But maturity aside it's great. I'm a little past halfway through. the soundtrack is the best too. It rekindled my love for oldies.",

            "content": "The Diamond JoJo arc was the most entertaining arc for me. Now I guess I will have to explain what kind of person I am. I never watched any anime that keeps its focus on fighting scenes all the way to the end. I never watched any anime that failed to make its characters interesting, no less the plot. I liked anime that had a greater theme; for example in Prisma Illya (yes, I know it's not popular), the relationship between the yuri girls moved me a lot. Maybe a better example is Higurashi, which I liked a lot. Diamond was able to keep aguy like me engrossed. \\n\\n\r\nAraki, the author of the manga series, said that his favorite character among the Jojo series was Josuke, the guy in this arc, because Josuke was the only character among all the ones he created portrayed as a 'friend.' Maybe because the protagonist was portrayed as a friend, the whole arc felt like it was maintaining a relationship with me. Diamond was like watching a friend making jokes, and it made you, the viewer, one of the characters in the show - maybe as a fellow person living in Morioh, which is the town that this arc focuses on.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I never liked about the JoJo series exists and it happens to be that it still applies to Diamond. It's the kind of story progression where you introduce one villain in one episode and a new villain in the other, just to show how the protagonist beats each of them up. That kind of progression always felt clunky. But this element that I disliked felt less clunky in Diamand than it did in series such as Stardust. Regardless of how the story progresses though, each episode of every JoJo series is still a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to David Production for making such a fantastic anime with amazing art and music. I enjoyed it very much. Maybe some day when I have money, I will owe my debt.",

            "content": "Jojo's bizzare adventure diamond is unbreakable is the 4th part of jojo and currently the last one adapted into an anime (Not including the Rohan OVAs) and follows the story of Higashikate Josuke, Part 2's jojo, Joseph Joestar, illegitamte son in his bizzare town of Morioh.\r\nLets get the main thing out of the way: Josuke is (IMO) the best Jojo in the (anime) series due to the simple fact that he doesnt have 1 defining characteristic. Jonathan was a noble and honorable man, Joseph was the witty and underhanded tactics guy and Jotaro was just the biggest badass to exist. Josuke just doesnt have thatand thats what makes him gureto. Hes just a kid going on weird adventures with his friends in his small town while having fun.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nWhile the shift between part 3 and 4 were pretty drastic, they fit Araki's ever evolving drawing style, managing to capture the feel of the part 4 manga\\n\r\none highlight i would like to make is Jotaro, going from looking like every single male in part 3 with hard lines on his face and a strong chin, to being a more relaxed and nicer on the eyes, which also reflect Jotaro's growth in part 4, but we'll talk about that in characters\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nPart 4 is the first part to make the cast feel like actual people and not just be \"Jojo's friends\" aside from pre established characters such as Joseph in part 3\\n\r\nevery character has their own story, motivations, personality, relationships and emotions, while still feeling like actual, real people.\\n\r\nJotaro is no longer the edgy, black wearing angry punk he was in part 3 and is not taking on a mentor role for Josuke and a friend for Koichi, although old habits die hard as he still cant stand screaming girls.\\n\\n\r\nKoichi is a friend of Josuke dragged into the world of STANDS by the mysterious \"Stand arrow\" which grants him his stand \"ECHOES\" which gets strobger and more powerful as Koichi grows as a person and is pushed to his maximum mental capablities.\\n\\n\r\nOkuyasu is the brother of Keicho Nijimura, the owner of the stand arrow and evantual plot device for Okusayu's character development. After growing up in an abusive household with his father turning into an ugly creature due to him selling his soul to DIO and being implanted with a flesh bud, which after DIO's death destroy his human cells. now Keicho was the one wearing the pants in teh family and was very harsh with Okusayu, leading him into a life of anger and aggresivness, with an overpowered stand, THE HAND, not being used properly due to his narrow mindedness.\\n\\n\r\neverything i wrote above is terribly watered down for the sake of not writing for literal hours, but once you watch the show, you'll understand.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now is where we step into *SPOILER TERITTORY* due to the nature of the show and the antagonist\\n\\n\r\nso last warning SPOILERS AHEAD\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nSTORY:\\n\r\nThe story is all about the Morioh Warriors, Josuke, Koichi, Okuyasu, Jotaro and Rohan trying to stop the secret serial killer of the town, Yoshikage Kira.\\n\r\nKira is a villian we havent seen before in Jojo's since the reason for him being the antagonist isnt him being a threat to humanity, On paper the entirety of part 4 could not happen and Kira could still be alive and it'd have little to no impact on the story of Jojos as a whole. HE WANTS TO LIVE A QUIET LIFE. Which is what makes the fact that he has been killing for 15 years without being caught all the more terrefying. But he doesnt kill for the sake of killing, he kills for the sake of taking the women he kill's hands for his own pleasure, often treating them as his \"girlfriend\". after Koichi achives Echoes act 3, he encounters Kira and gets destroyed by his stand \"KILLER QUEEN\" after defeating KILLER QUEEN's 2nd ability \"SHEER HEART ATTACK\" and this is where we are shown one of Kira's defening traits: his determantion. through out the entire series we dont see Kira give up and leave Morioh even once and doesnt even consider it. \\n\r\nThis is most obvious in the climax of the first half of the season, where Kira is cornered and is then able to switch his face and blend in back into the crowd. but the man he turned into, Kosaku Kawajiri, had a son, Hayato, which ended up being his demise. but then against all odds, Kira gets stabbed by the Stand arrow again to receive his 3rd and final bomb: BITES THE DUST\\n\r\na tiny KILLER QUEEN will be placed on a stand-less person and protect them from any harm, BUT should that person talk to anyone about Kira's true identety, KILLER QUEEN will appear in the second persons eye and detonate them. after the detonation, time will reset 1 hour back and whatever happaned last time will be fate unless BITES THE DUST is turned off by Kira. the thing is, the person BITES THE DUST was placed on was hayato who had found out Kira's new identedy, and ended up being murdered by kira the night he gained the ability. this leads into a time loop of Hayato thinking of new ways to defeat Kira with the 4th attemp being succecfull and ended with the best characetr the series has to offer: AMBULANCE-SAN\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr PART 4 IS THE BEST PART IN EVERY ASPECT\\n\\n",

            "content": "I could picture Araki Hirohiko at the end of the third part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure hurdled up in a chair and thinking about his other random ideas buzzing into his head, as if they were telling him that the Joestar family isn't done showing off yet. But what else could he tell about this story? The climax has been already reached in Stardust Crusaders, with DIO being finally defeated and the survivors getting back home. Dead end.\r\nI could actually picture him walking through his town, asking himself \"what if...?\". What if we replace the standard shounen antagonist with someone we simply see in thecrowd. No special charisma, no flashy clothing, nothing that could ever drag your attention to him. What if, instead of the world ending threat that has been present in JoJo up to this point, you get to see a silent city with deep scars taking its revenge on the crimes that a certain nobody has committed? What if, instead of those friendships that form between people in need, we see just a group of friends that get through some hardships, but really enjoy themselves and want to spend time with each other, be it chasing a serial killer or hanging in a cafe.\\n\\n\r\nYou get a hell of a series.\\n\\n\r\n\"Diamond is Unbreakable\" is, in my opinion, the best part of JoJo up to this point. It was successful where the other parts failed, and it is so satisfying to see Araki grow as both a better drawing artist and story crafter. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this part happens to be inferior to the other three parts, but it makes up for it by using an eyecandy of a color palette. Seriously, the colors were so bright and beautiful in this series that I didn't care about how weird Jotaro looked. I could understand why David Production had a hard time animating this part of the manga, because it was a crucial point for Araki too. Was he ready to give up way too massive for their age boys for the ones that had a realistic body that wasn't 90% up of muscles? He tried. And he was successful, because from this part onward, JoJos look fucking human, not just like a walking mountain with (arguably) personality.\\n\\n\r\nBut god, in terms of storytelling, it is far superior. One thing that I loved about DiU is that it doesn't feel like it's Josuke's story. Or Koichi's. Or Okuyasu's. Or Rohan's. It's Morioh's story. Over the course of thee 39 episodes, I enjoyed seeing a group of friends having fun, chasing a villain, encountering an alien, things like that. Yet, I have never felt that the focus was on Josuke especially, even though he is the JoJo of this part. He got to shine as a crazy diamond, and those moments are blissful. But Josuke was designed to be a teenager, and so he is. He doesn't have the care of a primordial being destroying the world or an immortal vampire that is after his family. Seeing a JoJo acting like a teenager is somehow relieving.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast of this part is well rounded as well. It's not like every character is just a tool or a motivation for the protagonist to pursue the villain and defeat it. Heck, the villain doesn't even show himself during the first half of the series, letting us get immersed in this town's life before introducing the villain.  I really loved every character, especially Josuke, Rohan and Yoshikage Kira, and generally felt more attached to this cast than the one of Stardust Crusaders or Battle Tendencies or Phantom Blood. The fights got even better, because a considerable part of them weren't just show offs of physical power, but battle of wits. You could expect anything from this battles, and it every fight is memorable and interesting.\\n\\n\r\nOne theme that is recurrent in this part is fate and fighting against it. During the second half of the story, it all becomes a fight against fate. Kira Yoshikage has been constantly carrying a fight against his fate as a serial killer. All that time, he just wanted to blend into the background and fade away, living a peaceful life while killing women for their beautiful hands. And when fate finally catches up on him, he is struggling to escape it, and he is not the only one. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the fourth part of this masterpiece definitely deserves a shot, as it is well rounded, interesting and engaging. It presents us with a large cast of magnificent characters, that are sure to give the audience a good time.",

The story was excellent, sprinkled with short arcs to make the anime a bit more realistic, unlike shows that sprinkle in filler just for filler reasons and lengthening the series for more revenue. *cough* *cough* DBS *cough* *cough* Each episode plays into the eventual conclusion of the show, and the pacing and development is EXCELLENT!!!!! I liked the concept of stands, all of them were unique and fleshed out, unlike a lot of other anime. *cough* *cough* Dragon Ball Super *cough* *cough*. The music was great, Crazy NoisyBizarre Town being one of my all time favorite openings. The characters were excellently designed and were mostly likeable. *Cough* *Cough* Vegeta *Cough*Cough*. Overall, the entire concept of JoJo's is the best of its time, and the modern adaptions augment the already masterful writing.\\n\r\nStory: 9, realistic and easy to relate to, excellent\\n\r\nArt: 10, unique and colorful, Outsanding\\n\r\nSound: 10, the music is great, and the animation in the OP furthers the excellence of the OPs\\n\r\nCharacters: 9, colorful and unique, all well fleshed out and likeable\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10, ARE YOU F*****ING KIDDING ME?! IT'S AWESOME!!!!\\n\r\nOverall: 8, had some downsides, but still a masterpiece nonetheless.\\n\r\n(P.S. Reading this review a few months later and this review is absolute cringe)",

            "content": "I really loved this season, better then crusaders in some way, both are good, but the characters are more relatable.   I'm really glad I watched this, and look forward to hopefully another season soon.\r\nStory:   A simpler story then the last, a town where people are getting powers, are they friends, or foes.   And it works, many creative stands this time around, and thing are far more grey, then the black and white they were in the last season.\r\nArt:   I like the art style, but might be midly offputting to some as it's not as heavily realistic asthe last one, more stylized, best way I can think to describe it is, it almost makes me think of shows like rugrats.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:   This is where the show really is strong, villians and friends are multi dimensional and not everything is clear cut, the stands are more diverse and unique also.  requiring not always just flat out combat to defeat.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall:   I really liked it, it was well done and sets so many things up wonderfully I feel.",

            "content": "Diamond is Unbreakable is a dramatic departure from the Jojo series.  Instead of a world hopping adventure, it's focused in the small town of Morioh.  Instead of gigantic muscular warriors, it's high school kids.  Instead of having the fate of the world on the line, the cast is trying to stop a serial killer.  It's completely different in almost every way, and while some of it is good, some of it is not so good. \r\nThe not-so-good aspect has to be the change in animation.  The new style, while more modern, loses the vintage 80's feel of the character designfrom earlier series, which I liked and really made Jojo stand out.  Now, if you're going to change it, at least let it be dynamic, but it was really kind of mediocre.  And man, did Jojo's hat blending into his hair look bad.  I guess it's drawn that way in the manga?  But, it looked so cheap and distracting.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story also didn't feel as grand or as crazy as Stardust Crusaders.  It felt small.  This is because it stayed in just one small town instead of traversing all over Europe or the Middle East.  That really hurt it, as well.  Really, this felt more like a \"Regular\" anime, than the kind of unique experience you get from JBA.  I felt like they tried to keep that unique feel, but in doing so, the attempt was somewhat sloppy.  For example: The space alien.  Why? Why was he actually there? What was his purpose? It felt like it was just thrown in because it was \"bizarre\".  But, it didn't make much sense.  Several things were like that.  Things just happening because it was weird.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, what offset this somewhat diminished return of Diamond was the cast.  Once again, Jojo delivers another likable Jojo in Josuke.  (It's kind of incredible how Akira manages to make four great protagonists, when most mangaka struggle with making one.).  Josuke is more like Joesph mixed with Johnathan.  He's mischievous and clever, but also honorable.  But, this cast was stronger than normal, as usually only one guy stands out next to a Joestar, like Speedwagon with Jonathan, or Polnareff with Jotaro and Joseph.  But, this time, the supporting cast was more likeable and memorable over all, with Okuyasu, Koichi and Rohan all being solid characters.  They weren't as great as someone like Jean Pierre Polnareff, but they weren't as forgettable as Kakyouin, either.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side of that, the villains weren't very impressive.  It really seemed like they were running out of ideas for weird villain powers, so we ended up with people who played Rock, Paper, Scissors as a power, and the Transmission tower guy.  People who, for no reason whatsoever, decided they would stand against Josuke and crew.  That's one of the big logic flaws of this anime:  (SPOILER AHEAD)  There was no logical reason for all these people to be fighting for Kira's dad.  With Dio, his followers made sense, because he was using flesh buds to control them and he was so insanely powerful, they were afraid to oppose him.  But, for what reason did these citizens decide they would side with a serial killer's dad?  The arrow gave them stands, it didn't control their minds.  There was no reason for them to fight to protect the identity of Kira or try to kill Jotaro and crew.  They were just doing it to do it, outside of Angelo.  \\n\\n\r\nAt the very least, however, Kira was a good villain.  In fact, the ONLY good villain.  So, fortunately, he was the main antagonist.  He reminded me a good deal of Hiro from Inuyashiki, but more bizarre.  A careful and compulsive killer, some of his moments were the most suspenseful in the anime. The anime really picked up once the Heroes caught wind of him and started to try and track him down.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this is a pretty good anime.  But, that's it, just \"good\", not \"classic\" like the other installments.  And that makes it somewhat of a disappointment.  If this was some other franchise, I would be satisfied with it being good.  But, with this being Jojo, I expect excellence.  As I jump into Golden Wind, hopefully it will get back up to the standards put out by the previous installments.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\r\nArt: 5\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n",
