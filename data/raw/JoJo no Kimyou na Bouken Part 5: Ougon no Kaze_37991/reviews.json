Edition is the greatest thing that has happened to anime since the 4th part. In this 5th Jojo -- called Vento whatever in Italian or Golden whatever in English -- we see something that is not expected of anime these days: content that doesn't suck ass.\r\nVento Aureo is told to be the most controversial part of the Jojo franchise thus far. One either loves it or hates it. I am in the lover team because thestory is so simple, yet masterfully crafted. It only focuses around few things, values small details and shows how it is better to be master of one than master of none. Do much with little is a thing I like to repeat and Jojo 5 is a perfect example of how much can be done with the given little. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is perhaps the most colorful seen in Jojo so far. I am personally against all sort of moral compasses and obligatory justice for all bs because the only thing those do is limit the story and characterization, and while Jojo introduces some concepts relevant to these such as the Robin Hood ideology, I am not finding these to be any sort of reflections of moral codes like they so often appear in all sorts of narratives, but simply part of characteristics in this case. Jojo's cast doesn't simply support 'anything' just because \"it is the right thing to do\", but because prioritizing loyalto to personal philosophies is put above all else. It's damn manly thing to do and that's why I am finding the cast to be so fun to follow. The banter seen in forms of dialog and interactions is also pretty bro, not as bro as in the 3rd part, but it's still damn brotherly. \\n\\n\r\nThe art has surprised me once again. It's impressive how different yet familiar David Production manages to make new Jojo series look like. The colors, animation style and unique ideas as well as the character design all are there to make Jojo's 5th season its very own thing and I am finding it very hard to not praise every part of it in today's industry. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is outstanding. The opening song is acquired taste, really. At first I was like \"it's not exactly Walk Like an Egyptian, is it\" but now I am like FIKHTIN GOLDOOO every time I do anything.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, this is the reason why I still have hope for the animated medium.",

As for now, 7 episodes in, i can most definitely say that this is the best anime adaptation i've ever seen.\r\nDavid Production- they just know what they're doing. Up until this point all they were lacking was the budget. And with money from monhun and tsubasa, they could finally deliver anime that not only does the honor to the manga, but also brings it to the whole new level. \r\nEverything in the anime, as for now, is just perfect.Sound design, the art (call if blasphemy, but sometimes it looks even better than Araki's work), animation, voice acting, even pacing. You can literally feel the heart and passion(e) that David put in this one- there are dozens of scenes that would be either skipped, or ignored by other studios. Just from the seventh- the legendary and mythical, the dance scene. It was what? 6 panels in the manga? One page. They made a music clip out of it! All the colors, the moves. the song in this scene... just wow. And just couple of minutes later- 2 of Six Bullets are high fiving one another, for 10 seconds. Any other studio would just drop it, or make it 5-6 frames. But not david- because they want to deliver the most enterteining and fun experience you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nEvery now and then David would throw in some \"anime original\"- extension of the situations we already know from the manga. First 5 minutes of ep1 are the \"filler\" that introduce you to this world better, show Giorno's personality etc. Then you have Abbachio meeting Bruno- that didn't have to be in there, but David wanted to deepen the characters even more.\\n\\n\r\nPart 5 anime is doing something more than \"panel by panel\" adaptation. What i love in almost every piece of media- doesn't matter if it's a game, film or anime- is the dedication in the production staff. I can only care as much, as they did. \\n\\n\r\nAnd David cares. Not only about the money, but also about their fans, and the franchise they are working on. Purely glorious.\\n\\n\r\nThe saddest part of this anime is that after each episode, i have to wait another week. I have never been this excited about JoJo, as am i now. And i didn't even like part 5 manga this much! 10/10 boyz.",

            "content": "A masterpiece that can not be put into words\r\n As a long time JJBA fan (read the manga way before season 1 aired), I had my hopes of a faithful adaptation, but I understood it is very hard, considering JJBA is very hard. Nonetheless, DavidPro did an amazing job!\r\nStory 10/10\r\nSet in Italy in 2001, we meet Giorno. Your average thug at first sight, he does not mind ripping people off. If its money, it is hardly a problem. He does not associate with gangsters tho, because he does not do contract killings and is especially anti drugs, seeing that Italy and its kidsare ravaged by addiction. So this young man, who just happens to be son of Dio Brando himself, goes on a path leading to the death of the most prolific gang in Italy and its boss. He joins the gang itself in an attempt to overthrow the boss and clear the streets of Italy, with the help of Bruno, Narancia, Mista, Trish, Abbachio and Fugo, his own team, led by Bruno himself. His travels take him all over Italy, showing beautiful scenery, having amazing Stand fights, objectively, the best Stand fights in the entire JJBA franchise. DP added its own touch to the story which makes this a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\n I would say DP doesn't disappoint, but that's taking it easy. The art is absolutely AMAZING! 1:1 adaptation to manga, this is the truest we've ever seen to Araki's art. The animation is fluid and has weight to it. YOU FEEL THOSE PUNCHES. Color changes mid scene, flashes, special effects, it is ART. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\n DP back at it again with its sound effects, amazing opening sang by Coda (Bloody Storm, JJBA Battle Tendency) and an ending by Jodeci (Freekn' you). The sound effects make Stands stand out more than ever before in the series, I myself was caught off guard by sheer perfection of sound effects they used compared to other parts which were good on their own. \\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 If DP didn't add subtle touches, I would put it a 9/10, but they made Giorno into an actual character (in the manga he was lacking expression most of the time, being too stoic). Giorno feels very much real and I have no doubt that the rest of the crew is going to shine. This is the only time I can say that anime studio did not make a mistake by changing some things from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is JoJo. The title alone says it all. Over the top fights, amazing music, cool characters and designs, it has it all. It is absolutely amazing and eye catching, every frame along the way. I enjoy this part way more than the others, and the others were nothing short of a perfect score. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\n This is a passion work of DavidPro. Other parts were an adaptation, this is a passion work. Vento Aureo is what happens when perfect music, meets perfect setting, meets perfect characters, meets perfect studio. \\n",

            "content": "17th century fop\u2019s could only dream of achieving the flamboyance of the modern day Jojo character.  The ostentatious wardrobes, combined with the innovative powers of the various characters, unequivocally demonstrates that the show is quite bizarre.  Ubiquitous action sequences is the name of the game, and to hell with the detractors affirming the plot is razor thin.  In fact, Jojo runs the gamut of neglecting pivotal facets of storytelling (i.e. a well-developed plot, meaningful character growth and an overarching message) to present testosterone-filled mayhem and comically inane dialogue.  Certainly, if Jojo were compared to say your typical Shonen anime (Dragon ball,Naruto, or Bleach), then the superiority in quality and amusement would certainly reside in the Jojo camp.  Yet, this achievement represents very little, as the bar was never set high by its contemporaries in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, this will not be your typical review, as it will only pertain to the two aspects the show focused on to provide an engaging experience.\\n\\n\r\n1) Testosterone-Filled Mayhem\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences feel devoid of necessary tension, that is to say, the tension never feels life-threatening, even though the show pretends otherwise.  Literally an entire episode was spent attempting to keep a flame lit to pass a loyalty test.  Sure.  A Stand maintained a watchful eye to derail any possible deception, which served as the central conflict, but it felt tame, to say the least.  The yacht hijacking to gain Intel on the Polpo fortune was much anticipated, as was the downfall of the perpetrators involved.  New abilities are being introduced at a break-neck pace, but the mayhem has felt rather mundane, generating a paucity in excitement.\\n\\n\r\n2) Comically Inane Dialogue\\n\\n\r\nNothing thus far has resonated or produced genuine laughter.  The comedic gags feel half-baked, and none of the characters exhibit a personality that would invoke hilarity.  While the other seasons had their list of drawbacks, there was always a comedic undertone that shined through, yielding reasonable amounts of joviality.  Golden Wind has yet to find its stride, as the jokes thus far (like the bullet Stands eating salami) have felt exceptionally child-like in nature.  For a show that exudes manliness, this is a tremendous failing.\\n\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s 5th iteration fails to meet its own \u201cbizarre\u201d expectations.  This, of course, says nothing about the tedious, formulaic plot with recycled themes from other works of the same ilk.  The present goal of Giorno to assume the role of the mafia boss is uninspired, with little-to-no novelty.  And while the list of Stands continues to grow, their implementation leaves much to be desired.  It feels as though the writers are more concerned with character quantity, rather than the quality.  It\u2019s excess at its worst, reminding the viewer that too much of a good thing, is a bad thing.  The title of show may suggest a \u201cbizarre\u201d adventure, but it feels more humdrum to this point.",

However, my stance still holds\r\nEdit 2: I just finished part 1-3 of JOJO. They are glorious.\r\nI might be the minorities here, but this is actually the first Jojo I've actually watched. To be honest I wasn't a great fan of this series when I first heard of it, nor do I understand the massive fanbase behind an anime that has an out-dated 90s art style. However after watching the first 3 episodeit got me hooked in. This is my first anime review and I will make it spoiler free.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is complicated and yet simple. Why does that mean? It has a very simple goal but with a lot of plot twist. The story is unique in a way that it attract my attention and yet not being overly complicated. The plot twists are very interesting and the settings are relatively easy to understand. Even having not watched any other jojo before I can follow the story pretty well, which honestly I'm surprised given it is already the fifth adaptation of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are exceptional. Every characters are unique in their own way and there are no \"filler\" characters. Even with just 7 episodes in I can already see a lot of character developments. I also appreciate the efford to tell the \"backstories\" of some of the important characters which not only they are interesting to watch but they are also important to understand the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, to be honest, in unique, but not my favorite. The art style is really have a strong 90s tone which might not be appealing to everyone. However, don't let that be the reason to turn this series down.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is the best of the season, personally speaking. Really enjoyed it. The ending is alright, but the opening is so much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my first Jojo experience is surprisingly pleasant. I think this series has a very unique place in anime that I cannot find any other similar anime. I am very looking forward to this series",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nI like stories with a goal. Simple it might be, but knowing where we're headed already gives a story a fair deal of structure. In our particular case, he, Giorno Giovanna, has a dream that he knows is just. He wants to become a Gang-Star. For that, he teamed up with Buccellati a member of the mafia gang Passione to move up the ranks. Fairly simple goal, which however comes along a path that promises to be full of mischief and ridiculous danger.\r\nCharacter 9/10\r\nMy favourite thing about Jojo is the characters hands down. So unique, so fantastic chemistry, so smart in battle (most ofthe time), it's a pure joy following their bizarre adventures. Since we're just a few episodes into the story, I won't give a ten for the characters yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nColourful, expressive and incredibly authentic, just as you know of Jojo. All the shots from Naples make you feel as though you were actually walking through the narrow streets and alleys. Only downside was the slightly off-looking sea surface and the somewhat laggy animations of the dancing sequence in ep. 7. Good single-frame animation sometimes goes at the cost of fluidity, and while I know that not every anime can be like Evergarden in that regard, I do think it is worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFucking Jojo sound, amazing as always, one of the most solid franchises when it comes to OSTs and OP/EDs. A little minus for the awkward Engrish in the OP and the fact that we haven't seen how the OST fully unfolds through the entire season yet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I eagerly await the next episode, I know that I'm enjoying the hell out of a series. Quirky and unique Stand abilities also contribute to that. Araki seems to have a never-ending well of ideas when it comes to Stands.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJojo, even after over hundred episodes still manages to feel fresh and thrilling. Each detail seems to brim with creativity, dialogues are witty, the narrator blends in well without holding back plot progression, fights always demand the actors to use their damn brains, and as always, it doesn't shy away from anything. Such an unconventionally bizarre franchise. I love it.",

It also continues to bring some of animes most fun, psychological and over the top fight scenes. Not only are the characters explored through their brief uncomplicated backstories but in every single decision and movement they do. Part five isn't just a faithful adaption of a great manga,I would say David productions have lifted its source material from its paged and made an even better adaption then they did with any other part. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\r\nThe story isn't anything special but manages to have a better flow than part three. The goal is to get places and guard people to climb the ranks of the Passione gang, the ranking system in Passione does make everything more fun and seeing our boys climb the ranks is satisfying. We also see different groups inside Passione for example the hitman group having taken the spotlight as our main villains over the few first episodes we have seen.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\\n\r\nWow! David productions has been seen cutting corners on anime like JoJo's Bizarre adventure part four but part five seems to have combined everything good from all the other parts into a big bowl of Flamboyant Masculinity with a dash of finesse. The facial details of part three and the slicker character designs of part four are featured here. Some shots look fantastic with us seeing every little detail on the characters faces as they make a small speech on how they will become a Gang Star! The use of colour in fight scenes is still nicely done and overall character movement is well animated. -1Point because of ugly ass CGI car. \\n\\n\r\nSound:10 \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is again outstanding blending Jazz into the main JoJo theme seamlessly. Sound effects are great as well, all the hits feel like busses colliding and the big explosions of bass as someone drinks a cup of piss or reveals something about the plot help sell the overdramatic tone JoJo's has. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nHirohiko araki has a great way to write his characters, it might seem simple when all the characters get their own backstory episode, but what is the point of a backstory when characters don't act upon them. A character in the show has a backstory telling us that he has anger issues and guess what, in every movement the character makes and every piece of dialogue he has you find a hidden undertone of irritation and anger which he damages his friends with!  Even his Powers reflects his personality with being very powerful and angry but at the same time being overly impulsive and can damage his loved ones. All the characters have flaws big and small, but it effects their choices which seems to be very hard for most shows to pull off. I'm sorry this is quite hard to tell you so I would much rather have it so that you watch the show to see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nPart five isn't just dumb fun, yes JoJo memes are great and all and yes part five is very over the top and that\u2019s part of its style but under all the style there is still a bunch of substance and a bunch of great fights and characters. In a way part five is a better part three, it has better animation better characters and a tighter power system. This is just my opinion though if u hate JoJo's don\u2019t hate me!  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9  \\n\r\nYour next line is...(Why didn\u2019t you give it a 10!) Well it's not perfect but hey no show is, the plot is just a tad too thin in my opinion and follows the traditional JoJo formula. But really everything else is great go watch this show now! Its hard to explain why you should watch it in this little review but hey I tried.",

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5: Vento Aureo is a good adaptation, David Productions outdid themselves and went beyond what they were given to create the perfect recreation of what the manga has been praised for. My only problem with this adaptation is that it is not on the same level as the previous four parts of JoJo, and beyond its flashy presentation and adrenaline-filled battles is an obscuration of the unremarkable potential of the part's plot and characters.\r\nPlot:\r\nGiorno Giovanna, the son of DIO and Jonathan, is receding in a crime-infested Italy. He wants to be a gangstar to get drugs off the street. He meetswith Bruno, who sympathies with Giorno's desires and eventually has him join his mafia gang called Passione, where we meets the rest of the supporting cast. The mob boss wants them to protect his daughter from the Squadra Esecuzione, a rouge mafia team that wants to dethrone the mob boss. The show then becomes your usual fight of the week format with each member of Passione going against one member of Squadra Esecuzione as they travel around Italy while also escorting the mob boss' daughter.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem of the plot's structure is that its kinda badly put together. What I mean by that is that there's absolutely no breathing room between the fights and it's feels that the battles are simply inconsequential from one another, eventually becoming a blur of whatever fight comes next. At least in \"Diamond is Unbreakable\", Josuke spends his times screwing around in Morioh, whether that be committing fraud with lottery tickets or burning down houses, at least the show reminds you that even with all the tension that has been building up, the plot doesn't have to follow that sentiment with more fights.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the way that the plot is structured, there is no room for breaks, but that doesn't excuse David Productions from not changing some of the arc's structure to remedy the pacing like they did with Part 4 (in the episode, July 15th, notably). The anime does change some things around, but the changes were either insignificant or detrimental to the show itself; the changes included switching the placement of the backstories of the supporting cast and the Squadra Esecuzione amidst the middle of their respective fights. This decision bogs down the flow of the fights when its shoved in the middle when it still would've been fine without it. This appears evident in the Narancia's and Little Feet's fight, which by the way does not have to be three-and-a-half episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI don't have a problem with the members of Passione (besides that I find half of them boring, but I also think the half of the Stardust Crusaders are also boring, so who am I to say so) and the Squadra Esecuzione. In fact, I do like that they delve into the Squadra Esecuzione a bit deeper than what Araki did in the manga. However, I do have a problem with our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna. Giorno doesn't have a personality besides for being stoic and dedicated to whatever he wants to pursue. The show doesn't really give me a good reason to care for Giorno or his cause and he's surely one of the least interesting protagonist the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has to offer. He doesn't have the charisma or charm as Joseph or Josuke nor does he have the heroic maturity as Jonathan or Jotaro. And with the fact that Giorno is supposed to be DIO's son, it's so disappointing that Giorno doesn't carry over any qualities the makes DIO so iconic and cool. His stand, Gold Experience, is unspectacular with its weak power that gains and loses its abilities like the wind. Araki wrote a dud with this one, and David Production unfortunately couldn't save it.\\n\\n\r\nI think the bigger problem with Part 5 is that this doesn't feel like a JoJo part. It feels like it was made by somebody trying to imitate JoJo without knowing the nuances of what made JoJo unique. The protagonist is static and boring, the fights are too long, and the cast of characters are underdeveloped, even with their backstories shown during their respective fights. This part overall doesn't hold a candle to the previous 4 parts and it feels like a black sheep in the JoJo canon. Still, I did like what David Production have done so far, despite me thinking that they didn't do enough. They took the time in crafting how the fights are presented and how the characters interact with each other; their attention-to-detail is impressive to admire and to sit through. David Productions didn't fix any of the problems that came with the manga, but they tried their hardest in making one of the most aesthetically distinct anime airing this year.\\n\\n\r\nSo in all honesty, if you love the past seasons of JoJo, you'll probably end up enjoying this one too.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nHaving read the manga, the story isn't an original plot that's super groundbreaking or anything. Despite being a more serious part with more focus on the \"Adventure\" than the \"Bizarre\", it keeps the usual Jojo flair, and the \"fight of the week\" acts to progress the story. Being Jojo, it's definitely full of plot holes but personally, I don't think it detracts from the story. \r\nHowever, I rate this one higher than I would any other Jojo because the fights don't seem as predictable as some others are. Using the manga (as the anime hasn't completed yet) as a reference, I can name atleast 5 fights where I was totally certain one of our beloved gangsters was going to lose, before they make their heroic comeback. As the story mainly revolves around these fights, having fresh and exciting stand battles makes watching it so much more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nGoing more anime-specific, you can see just how much love Davidpro puts into the adaptation. I'll touch more on the animation side in a bit, but it's greatly appreciated that they put Fugo's backstory (absent from the manga and only told in a light novel) in before his fight, and moved Abbacchio's backstory flashback in a place that makes much more sense. These small changes do wonders for characterization, and I think people who might not have liked part 5's cast before might want to watch the anime and give them a second chance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow speaking of the characters, Part 5's cast is one of my favorite Jojo casts ever. Many don't particularly like that they aren't as comedic as the other Jojos, however they all have their own quirks that make watching them so much fun. While I certainly have favorites, every member of Bucciarati's gang (+Trish) is unique and every single one is lovable. The villains are likable too and despite them having the \"show up for a fight then die\" fate that many Jojo villains face, their individual appearances tell a larger story of betrayal and family that makes you almost feel sorry for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all unique and fun as well, and DPro only amplifies this with slight tweaks to colors that give them life. (though I wish they kept silver hair/pink suit Fugo T__T)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhether you love or hate the Jojo artstyle, you can see that Dpro loves their job. The attention to detail they put into adapting the manga is near perfect - one place where I think this really shines is towards the end of the first Narancia fight - and the use of color is absolutely amazing. The animation quality, which was merely okay in previous parts, has risen tremendously and stayed relatively good all throughout so far. Again mentioning the Narancia fight, certain frames in episode 11 were breathtaking and I found myself coming back and rewatching them again and again. \\n\r\nMost reviewers have mentioned the torture dance scene. It goes without saying that Dpro's whole heart was put into that, with them extending a scene that was only 4 panels in the manga into a full 1 minute routine with some of the cleanest animation I've seen in a while. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 1000/10\\n\\n\r\nI LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE the cast they'd picked for part 5. Every character sounds exactly how I thought they'd sound, and the range in their voices is heard. They're perfect! \\n\\n\r\nAnd the SOUNDTRACK.... oh boy I don't know where to start. The OST of this anime is literal perfection, and I won't go into detail because then I'll never be able to stop. But just know I listen to the OST more than I do anything else. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just fun! It always makes me sad when I can't spare time on a Jojo Friday to watch the new episode as it comes out, because it's just a breath of fresh air. The friends I watch it with in Rabbit can attest to how much time I spend excitedly cheering on the characters and freaking out over it. Jojo is always a good time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPart 5 was the first I've read, and the first Jojo anime I've watched as it was coming out, and I hold it very dear to my heart. You can tell DPro does too with how much love was put into the animation and stylization of it all. I definitely recommend Vento Aureo to anyone looking to get into Jojo and implore every person who may not have liked it when they read it to give it another chance.",

            "content": "EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES, WAKING UP WANTING MORE JOJO\r\nWelcome to the fifth iteration of the amazing, bizarre adventure of JoJo's. With the long awaited adaptation Vento Aureo being a third of the way through and personally being one of my favorite parts of the series I feel obliged to put my two cents forward on this wild ride. With out further adieu, here's my review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind (Vento Aureo)\r\nStarting off with the story we are introduced with Koichi trying to find our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna, the bastard son of Dio. Giorno has mostly led a troubled life with abusiveparents until one day he helps out a gangster which in turn more or less 180's his life. With this sudden change for Giorno, he takes it upon himself to give back to others who have been down on their luck. He then one day runs into Bruno Bucciarati, which after discovering Bucciarati has a stand himself and then fights him comes to lean on him for help since he finds out quickly that Bucciarati is out to clean the streets himself. After going through initiation with Polpo, Giorno is introduced the rest of Bucciarati posse and thusly they go out and do orders for the Passione's boss meanwhile finding a way to get to him. The story of Vento Aureo as a whole, is by no means revolutionary, but it's still highly entertaining and action packed. Action packed JoJo is JoJo at its best if you ask me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, the art of JoJo is pristine and fits the vibe of the series to a T. It's a hybrid of the Stardust Crusaders rough, gritty tone and Diamond is Unbreakable's flashy, contemporary design. The animation is very crisp and all  the battle scenes are as fluid as you could ask. David Pro nailed it yet again and it's a treat to watch every week. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is nothing short of fitting with part 5, we get a top notch OP to start off with Fighting Gold, bringing back Coda is great. The synth work in itself is fantastic and the song as a whole gives off a James Bond vibe. The character theme's are great and fit with the characters personalities. My god, the Prince remix for the Torture Dance was downright perfect. We didn't deserve how hard David Pro for us, but thank the anime gods they did. I was personally a bit skeptical on the ED at first, but after finishing the manga for pt5, it honestly fits in a strange way. Go figure, it's JoJo after all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Jo bro's this time around are some of the best we've got yet. While I don't love them AS much as SC's bro's, all of them on part 5 have something good to offer and to make the experience entertaining. As I stated earlier, minus their backstories, the motivations between Giorno and Bucciarati are similar in more ways then one so I'll lump the two together. Both have a strong sense of justice, meanwhile Giorno HAS A DREAM, they want what's best for the community as a whole, especially the children. I'm not really going to touch up on Giorno's stand as it is a very multi layered stand, that quite frankly does a lot of shenanigans, especially later on down the line. Bucciarati's stand, Sticky Fingers, is a stand which opens up inanimate objects, people, areas, amongst other things to various things like placing objects or making a quick escape. Next up we have Mista, a quirky young man who has a phobia over the number four. Mista somewhat falls into comic relief sometimes along with Narancia since it seems like those two attract trouble the most. Both of them are basically just big ol' goobers. Mista has a rather gray area stand. It more or less boils down to a long range stand that he has a symbiotic relationship with. My goodness Sex Pistols is an adorable stand though, truly the best boys. Narancia, the youngest outside of Giorno, is an ill-tempered kinda dope-ish kid who was betrayed by his older brother figure which lead him to a life of poverty and nearly dying himself until Fugo introduced him to Bucciarati. His stand, Aerosmith, is a remote controlled type cropduster airplane which can shoot a machine gun and missiles at his target. Along with his stand he can track them down with a radar system. Fugo is an intellectual whom had trouble expressing his emotions until he just cracked on a professor who was trying to sexually assault him. It's clear to say he's the brains of the group and was on a path to success until he boiled over, even though he was absolutely in the right to defend himself. His stand, Purple Haze is a true pinpoint reflection of his mental state. A mutli-faceted being that has insane amounts of power that he has trouble concealing and has a quirky neat freak tucked away inside. Lastly of the bro's we have Abbacchio. Abbacchio can come off as a huge ass, but this is mainly due to the mistakes he made in the past, so he has a hard time letting others in and trusting them. I can be hard on him as a character, but I /get/ why he does what he does to the characters he knows little about, like Giorno. To round the group up we have Trish. There's not much I can say about her, due to the anime being up to only up to episode 15 and I'm absolutely not going to spoil it for the anime only fans. Basically all that's been said is that she's the boss's daughter and Giorno and the Jo bro's have been tasked to protect her up until a certain point in time. I tried my damndest to not spoil things about these character since I truly love each of them in their own ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros- \\n\r\nExciting and action packed story \\n\r\nGreat art/animation\\n\r\nGreat characters\\n\r\nOn point OST\\n\r\nFantastic fan service David Pro added in (i.e the expanded Torture Dance)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons-\\n\r\nGotta wait a week for every episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating, due to personal bias is a 10. I love JoJo and especially part 5. Hope you guys enjoy the rest of the ride.",

After 12 episodes of Golden Wind, I'm convinced that I'm just never going to get back the feel I had with the original series.  It really feels like everything that was joked about and satirized with the original series is being taken way too seriously in these last two series.  They're really long and heavily episodic, with a good half of each episode being dedicated to a narrator explaining the characters' backstories.  The Stands were old by the end of Stardust Crusaders, the fact that they're still trying toride them is just depressing.  I really want to like this because it's JoJo and the art is really well done in this series, but the characters are annoying and lackluster.  They pretty much exist as vehicles for their Stands now.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, gonna stop holding my breath and waiting for another decent series out of this franchise.",

This show has some of the most exciting action and most heart pounding stuff that I've ever seen. \r\nWhen it comes down to it, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is, as its name suggests, pretty bizarre. However, the quality of the show doesn't decrease because of it. The genius of Araki Hirohiko has made the show and series as a whole into a near masterpiece with very few mistakes in the later parts ofthe story. Golden Wind had an interesting manga to say the least making for one of the most separated communities in the Jojo fandom as all of them are confused as to whether it's good or not. However, from the new addition of the anime, it fixes most of the problems with boring fights or simply just uninteresting plot devices and makes for a fun show that makes you excited as heck when the biggest plot points hit you. I tend to see lots of mediocre stories, especially in the shounen category. There are some shows that don't really use the full potential of the idea and it brings the entire series down into shit. However, Jojo uses masterful pacing with an interesting story to accompany it without forgetting to have good characters and nice aesthetics that fit the show. In terms of anime, this is one of my favorites and I hope to see more interesting stuff from Araki as he prepares to end Part 8 and thinks of ideas for Part 9.",

I forgot too mention thestand powers which are very creative at this part .... I know that everyone expected new kinda powers to appear ... but still the stands are great and creative .... \\n\r\nmoving to the art ... I won't talk about the art in the whole JOJO series ... because i think it is too obvious why it deserves 10/10 \\n\r\nthis also applies for the sounds ... \\n\\n\r\nFor the characters .... I think JOJO may be the best anime to present a lot of different characters in the same anime .. it is an anime that does not only focus on the main character like other animes but it gives everyone screen time to know their past and to see them fight ... \\n\\n\r\nthe whole anime deserves 10/10 and deserves your watching .",

            "content": "After I read the part 5 manga I was left with mixed feelings. It has a rushed ending, a protagonist that suddenly loses relevance, characters lacking development and fights that were near impossible to comprehend (mind you, I read the b&w version until half of the story). On the plus side, it introduced amazing new reinventions on the concept of a stand, had memorable battles and some members that stood out from the rest. \r\nNow, after a long hiatus of an year and ten months, the adaptation of this part finally came to be, and it took me by surprise. As of the moment ofthis review (episode 13 was released 2 weeks ago and 14 is coming this week) most of the problems I had with GW were fixed and improved. There was a good chunk of filler added to the story which while slowing the pace of the story, it also adds more weight and developement to the characters. Characters like Fugo now have a backstory, the excecution team now feels like a team, a nemesis or counter to passione (which I did not see when reading the manga, I saw them as random gangsters that went individually to pursue their goal of overtaking the mafia instead of being an actual team), etc. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of the fixed issues I and many people had with part 5 comes the soundtrack and animation. On behalf of the animation, it is possibly the best out of all the parts. The style feels like a fusion of the part 3 style with the more slender designs of the manga, which blend perfectly in the animation. Not only that, but the movement and fights have gotten much more fluid and dynamic. And the soundtrack I find also to be the best so far, with a memorable main theme and its variations being each time stronger and better than the former.\\n\\n\r\nRounding up, after being a fan of Jojo for 4 years I could not ask for a better adaptation, and will hold Golden Wind as my favourite part of the series. I highly recommend to watch it, especially to those who like to hate on it because they are bitter over people not enjoying Stone Ocean as much",

            "content": "Golden Wind, Ougon no Kaze, or Vento Aureo, whichever you prefer, is my favourite Part of my favourite anime of all time. David Production's adaptation of this amazing Manga goes far beyond what I expected, adding scenes and improving on scenes that were already in the Manga.\r\nStory 10\r\nThe story, while confusing to an outsider's perspective, makes complete sense in context. Our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna's, main goal is to get rid of the drug trafficking towards children in Italy, and all of his other goals revolve around killing the Boss of Passione, the biggest gang in Italy. It's filled with bad ass fights, with lots ofstrategy coming from either side, every character having unique powers that must be countered with the others thinking. The comedy is over the top and hilarious, as JoJo's always is, and contains my so far favourite scene in anime, the minute long Torture Dance scene which was only a few panels in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\\n\r\nDP has always made amazing art for the anime and translated Araki's art style the best possible to anime, but GW is by far the best. The animation is greatly improved, the detail from Parts 1-3 is there, with an improved artstyle, and everyone looks sexy as hell (while a show doesn't need to be sexy, and sometimes is hindered by it, in JoJo's it adds to the enjoyment.) The choice of colours is amazing, and there's always something nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP Fighting Gold quickly became my favourite song of all time. The rest of the soundtrack is amazing and hype as well, especially Giorno's theme, Il Vento D'oro. The sounds of the Stand summons are incredibly satisfying to hear, along with their punches and abilities. The character's voice actors are perfect and what I imagined, if not better, when I read the Manga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nEach character is unique and interesting. Each of the main gang members grows due to Giorno's involvement in the gang, weather it's through loving him or hating him. You can also see how they all look up to Buccearati, and that's why he's best mom. Mista is a lovable optimistic badass, with a soft side shown with him fathering his Stand, the Sex Pistols. Giorno is a leader, and inspirational to both the viewers, and his teammates. Giorno and Mista are my favourite characters of all time, and if DP makes them canonically gay, which is heavily hinted at in the manga but never confirmed, probably since it was written in 1990s Shounen Jump, I will love DP forever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? The serious moments are badass, the entire thing is beautiful, the comedic moments are hilarious, it's inspirational, and so much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\\n\r\nI love this show so much, and it's currently on my favourite arc (White Album). My favourite scene in all of fiction is at the end of the arc (with Giorno's speech about resolve) and I am hyped to see that in the anime.",

            "content": "It's been a year since I finished part 5's manga so i decided maybe a review of it's anime would be helpful. I'm not gonna include any \"jojokes\" as the kids call them, but instead I'll be looking at it from a critical perspective instead of a fan's perspective. \r\nFirst off, the story is ripped directly from the manga but includes extra scenes for fan service, specifically all the scene's involving La Squadra. I'm writing this directly after watching episode 27, so there has been 2 scenes dedicated to fleshing out the side gang of La Squadra, a particularly popular cast of characters in thejojo fandom. Some specific parts of the manga have been taken out or reworked to help the pacing of the show, which is understandable and not really horrible from my perspective. The big two I can remember both involve taking out scenes of Bruno, which don't develop his character. \\n\r\nSecond, the art. As much as I enjoy Jojo's, I will never fully enjoy the animation that has been adapted from the manga. Some parts are extremely stiff and make it hard to compare each episode to the next. Ever since the character stills were reveled I never really liked how they looked, in comparison to the rest of the parts. I wish that part 5 had an art style comparable to season 1 or part 4, but instead it took the part 3 route of making every character slightly bland with the color choices and look the same with its art style. I do not think that any of the color changes made to the main cast look bad, I particularly like Giorno's pink suit- it is mainly the minor character's colors that hold the anime down from its manga counterpart. \\n\r\nThe sound of jojo's part 5 is good. I can't really say much about it because that isn't what I am an expert on, but I can appreciate good sound design and I think that Jojo's excels in this department. \\n\r\nNow onto character. In my opinion writing good characters without them having much personality or anything to do or them being the worst is something Araki does best, but the anime just drags it down. There is not many interesting characters outside of the main cast.  Sure every minor character has their quirks, and you can find a large fanbase for said minor characters online, but most of them are one off villains with unique stand that are only written so that Giorno and the gang can't get from place to place super quickly. Part 5 is like a monster of the week show in this way, but with some interesting episodes here and there. For example. the stand battles that have the most unique abilities are more likely to be interesting then two strong dudes fighting against each other. These minor characters don't really drag down the show, though, and simply provide weekly entertainment. \\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy Jojo's bizarre adventure golden wind a lot. Despite having a lot of criticism for the show its one of the only anime I consistently keep up with and being a fan of the series, I'd give it a 10 overall. But being a critic, I'll have to give it an 8. If you're interested in Jojo- go watch it. I'm not gonna preach a \"part skipping is evil\" mindset but if you need some good fights to watch or just something to put on in the background, I'd highly recommend. Jojo fans will enjoy it and so will newcomers and the show deserves all the hype it gets. So thats an 8/10 and adios.",

            "content": "After 4 seasons of mindless battles, finally enough is enough. As someone that really liked the first season, it pains me to say that I'm finally putting this series down for awhile. While David Production has given this series great treatment, sadly nothing can save it at this point.\r\nStory:\r\nGenerally the Jojo series start out with some goal, and then endless battles lead up to it. That's the same here for this season, as our protagonist wants to change his hometown and ends up battling countless foes to get there, mostly meaningless battles. Aside from that Jojo doesn't really have much of a story. If actionentertains you enough however, you will enjoy it if you don't mind the inconsistencies and turn your brain off. I'm one that generally needs more intense fights or story focus to enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI judge art by thinking \"Would I want every series to look like this?\" Otherwise you can't tell good apart from unique. While the art is well done and decent quality, I cannot say it would be enjoyable if it wasn't just for the fact that I haven't seen it much before.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound quality is decent. The ending theme doesn't really fit and some characters have very annoying voices but the rest is good overall. The battle sounds are probably what matter most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nJojo takes time to develop briefly each of its characters, though not as deep as many series as it focuses more on battles than development. There's nothing particularly special about the characters either. So this is a solid average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLiterally one of the lowest possible by this point, I just can't enjoy meaningless battles but it seems a lot of people do. If you like action and different characters showing up all the time then this is for you maybe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis series started with a lot of promise but ended up as nothing more than pathetic.",

This is quite prevalent in part 5, but I still think it yields some of thegreatest stands in the series. \\n\\n\r\nVento Aureo is one of Araki's greatest works, and the anime has added scenes to round it better, which I appreciate since sometimes the manga (asides from part 7, praise be Steel Ball Run) can have some discrepancies. All in all it's a great show, with stellar art (each panel is enjoyable, despite the occasional still-frame it's gorgeous), lovable characters, and a great music direction, it's gonna be going down as a favorite as JoJo will be in general.",

Edition is the greatest thing that has happened to anime since the 4th part. In this 5th Jojo -- called Vento whatever in Italian or Golden whatever in English -- we see something that is not expected of anime these days: content that doesn't suck ass.\r\nVento Aureo is told to be the most controversial part of the Jojo franchise thus far. One either loves it or hates it. I am in the lover team because thestory is so simple, yet masterfully crafted. It only focuses around few things, values small details and shows how it is better to be master of one than master of none. Do much with little is a thing I like to repeat and Jojo 5 is a perfect example of how much can be done with the given little. \\n\\n\r\nThe cast is perhaps the most colorful seen in Jojo so far. I am personally against all sort of moral compasses and obligatory justice for all bs because the only thing those do is limit the story and characterization, and while Jojo introduces some concepts relevant to these such as the Robin Hood ideology, I am not finding these to be any sort of reflections of moral codes like they so often appear in all sorts of narratives, but simply part of characteristics in this case. Jojo's cast doesn't simply support 'anything' just because \"it is the right thing to do\", but because prioritizing loyalto to personal philosophies is put above all else. It's damn manly thing to do and that's why I am finding the cast to be so fun to follow. The banter seen in forms of dialog and interactions is also pretty bro, not as bro as in the 3rd part, but it's still damn brotherly. \\n\\n\r\nThe art has surprised me once again. It's impressive how different yet familiar David Production manages to make new Jojo series look like. The colors, animation style and unique ideas as well as the character design all are there to make Jojo's 5th season its very own thing and I am finding it very hard to not praise every part of it in today's industry. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is outstanding. The opening song is acquired taste, really. At first I was like \"it's not exactly Walk Like an Egyptian, is it\" but now I am like FIKHTIN GOLDOOO every time I do anything.\\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to enjoyment, this is the reason why I still have hope for the animated medium.",

As for now, 7 episodes in, i can most definitely say that this is the best anime adaptation i've ever seen.\r\nDavid Production- they just know what they're doing. Up until this point all they were lacking was the budget. And with money from monhun and tsubasa, they could finally deliver anime that not only does the honor to the manga, but also brings it to the whole new level. \r\nEverything in the anime, as for now, is just perfect.Sound design, the art (call if blasphemy, but sometimes it looks even better than Araki's work), animation, voice acting, even pacing. You can literally feel the heart and passion(e) that David put in this one- there are dozens of scenes that would be either skipped, or ignored by other studios. Just from the seventh- the legendary and mythical, the dance scene. It was what? 6 panels in the manga? One page. They made a music clip out of it! All the colors, the moves. the song in this scene... just wow. And just couple of minutes later- 2 of Six Bullets are high fiving one another, for 10 seconds. Any other studio would just drop it, or make it 5-6 frames. But not david- because they want to deliver the most enterteining and fun experience you can imagine.\\n\\n\r\nEvery now and then David would throw in some \"anime original\"- extension of the situations we already know from the manga. First 5 minutes of ep1 are the \"filler\" that introduce you to this world better, show Giorno's personality etc. Then you have Abbachio meeting Bruno- that didn't have to be in there, but David wanted to deepen the characters even more.\\n\\n\r\nPart 5 anime is doing something more than \"panel by panel\" adaptation. What i love in almost every piece of media- doesn't matter if it's a game, film or anime- is the dedication in the production staff. I can only care as much, as they did. \\n\\n\r\nAnd David cares. Not only about the money, but also about their fans, and the franchise they are working on. Purely glorious.\\n\\n\r\nThe saddest part of this anime is that after each episode, i have to wait another week. I have never been this excited about JoJo, as am i now. And i didn't even like part 5 manga this much! 10/10 boyz.",

            "content": "A masterpiece that can not be put into words\r\n As a long time JJBA fan (read the manga way before season 1 aired), I had my hopes of a faithful adaptation, but I understood it is very hard, considering JJBA is very hard. Nonetheless, DavidPro did an amazing job!\r\nStory 10/10\r\nSet in Italy in 2001, we meet Giorno. Your average thug at first sight, he does not mind ripping people off. If its money, it is hardly a problem. He does not associate with gangsters tho, because he does not do contract killings and is especially anti drugs, seeing that Italy and its kidsare ravaged by addiction. So this young man, who just happens to be son of Dio Brando himself, goes on a path leading to the death of the most prolific gang in Italy and its boss. He joins the gang itself in an attempt to overthrow the boss and clear the streets of Italy, with the help of Bruno, Narancia, Mista, Trish, Abbachio and Fugo, his own team, led by Bruno himself. His travels take him all over Italy, showing beautiful scenery, having amazing Stand fights, objectively, the best Stand fights in the entire JJBA franchise. DP added its own touch to the story which makes this a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\\n\r\n I would say DP doesn't disappoint, but that's taking it easy. The art is absolutely AMAZING! 1:1 adaptation to manga, this is the truest we've ever seen to Araki's art. The animation is fluid and has weight to it. YOU FEEL THOSE PUNCHES. Color changes mid scene, flashes, special effects, it is ART. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\n DP back at it again with its sound effects, amazing opening sang by Coda (Bloody Storm, JJBA Battle Tendency) and an ending by Jodeci (Freekn' you). The sound effects make Stands stand out more than ever before in the series, I myself was caught off guard by sheer perfection of sound effects they used compared to other parts which were good on their own. \\n\r\nCharacter 10/10 If DP didn't add subtle touches, I would put it a 9/10, but they made Giorno into an actual character (in the manga he was lacking expression most of the time, being too stoic). Giorno feels very much real and I have no doubt that the rest of the crew is going to shine. This is the only time I can say that anime studio did not make a mistake by changing some things from the manga. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nThis is JoJo. The title alone says it all. Over the top fights, amazing music, cool characters and designs, it has it all. It is absolutely amazing and eye catching, every frame along the way. I enjoy this part way more than the others, and the others were nothing short of a perfect score. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\n This is a passion work of DavidPro. Other parts were an adaptation, this is a passion work. Vento Aureo is what happens when perfect music, meets perfect setting, meets perfect characters, meets perfect studio. \\n",

            "content": "17th century fop\u2019s could only dream of achieving the flamboyance of the modern day Jojo character.  The ostentatious wardrobes, combined with the innovative powers of the various characters, unequivocally demonstrates that the show is quite bizarre.  Ubiquitous action sequences is the name of the game, and to hell with the detractors affirming the plot is razor thin.  In fact, Jojo runs the gamut of neglecting pivotal facets of storytelling (i.e. a well-developed plot, meaningful character growth and an overarching message) to present testosterone-filled mayhem and comically inane dialogue.  Certainly, if Jojo were compared to say your typical Shonen anime (Dragon ball,Naruto, or Bleach), then the superiority in quality and amusement would certainly reside in the Jojo camp.  Yet, this achievement represents very little, as the bar was never set high by its contemporaries in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nThat all being said, this will not be your typical review, as it will only pertain to the two aspects the show focused on to provide an engaging experience.\\n\\n\r\n1) Testosterone-Filled Mayhem\\n\\n\r\nThe action sequences feel devoid of necessary tension, that is to say, the tension never feels life-threatening, even though the show pretends otherwise.  Literally an entire episode was spent attempting to keep a flame lit to pass a loyalty test.  Sure.  A Stand maintained a watchful eye to derail any possible deception, which served as the central conflict, but it felt tame, to say the least.  The yacht hijacking to gain Intel on the Polpo fortune was much anticipated, as was the downfall of the perpetrators involved.  New abilities are being introduced at a break-neck pace, but the mayhem has felt rather mundane, generating a paucity in excitement.\\n\\n\r\n2) Comically Inane Dialogue\\n\\n\r\nNothing thus far has resonated or produced genuine laughter.  The comedic gags feel half-baked, and none of the characters exhibit a personality that would invoke hilarity.  While the other seasons had their list of drawbacks, there was always a comedic undertone that shined through, yielding reasonable amounts of joviality.  Golden Wind has yet to find its stride, as the jokes thus far (like the bullet Stands eating salami) have felt exceptionally child-like in nature.  For a show that exudes manliness, this is a tremendous failing.\\n\\n\r\nJojo\u2019s 5th iteration fails to meet its own \u201cbizarre\u201d expectations.  This, of course, says nothing about the tedious, formulaic plot with recycled themes from other works of the same ilk.  The present goal of Giorno to assume the role of the mafia boss is uninspired, with little-to-no novelty.  And while the list of Stands continues to grow, their implementation leaves much to be desired.  It feels as though the writers are more concerned with character quantity, rather than the quality.  It\u2019s excess at its worst, reminding the viewer that too much of a good thing, is a bad thing.  The title of show may suggest a \u201cbizarre\u201d adventure, but it feels more humdrum to this point.",

However, my stance still holds\r\nEdit 2: I just finished part 1-3 of JOJO. They are glorious.\r\nI might be the minorities here, but this is actually the first Jojo I've actually watched. To be honest I wasn't a great fan of this series when I first heard of it, nor do I understand the massive fanbase behind an anime that has an out-dated 90s art style. However after watching the first 3 episodeit got me hooked in. This is my first anime review and I will make it spoiler free.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is complicated and yet simple. Why does that mean? It has a very simple goal but with a lot of plot twist. The story is unique in a way that it attract my attention and yet not being overly complicated. The plot twists are very interesting and the settings are relatively easy to understand. Even having not watched any other jojo before I can follow the story pretty well, which honestly I'm surprised given it is already the fifth adaptation of the manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are exceptional. Every characters are unique in their own way and there are no \"filler\" characters. Even with just 7 episodes in I can already see a lot of character developments. I also appreciate the efford to tell the \"backstories\" of some of the important characters which not only they are interesting to watch but they are also important to understand the characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe art, to be honest, in unique, but not my favorite. The art style is really have a strong 90s tone which might not be appealing to everyone. However, don't let that be the reason to turn this series down.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is the best of the season, personally speaking. Really enjoyed it. The ending is alright, but the opening is so much better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, my first Jojo experience is surprisingly pleasant. I think this series has a very unique place in anime that I cannot find any other similar anime. I am very looking forward to this series",

            "content": "Story 9/10\r\nI like stories with a goal. Simple it might be, but knowing where we're headed already gives a story a fair deal of structure. In our particular case, he, Giorno Giovanna, has a dream that he knows is just. He wants to become a Gang-Star. For that, he teamed up with Buccellati a member of the mafia gang Passione to move up the ranks. Fairly simple goal, which however comes along a path that promises to be full of mischief and ridiculous danger.\r\nCharacter 9/10\r\nMy favourite thing about Jojo is the characters hands down. So unique, so fantastic chemistry, so smart in battle (most ofthe time), it's a pure joy following their bizarre adventures. Since we're just a few episodes into the story, I won't give a ten for the characters yet.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nColourful, expressive and incredibly authentic, just as you know of Jojo. All the shots from Naples make you feel as though you were actually walking through the narrow streets and alleys. Only downside was the slightly off-looking sea surface and the somewhat laggy animations of the dancing sequence in ep. 7. Good single-frame animation sometimes goes at the cost of fluidity, and while I know that not every anime can be like Evergarden in that regard, I do think it is worth pointing out.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nFucking Jojo sound, amazing as always, one of the most solid franchises when it comes to OSTs and OP/EDs. A little minus for the awkward Engrish in the OP and the fact that we haven't seen how the OST fully unfolds through the entire season yet.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I eagerly await the next episode, I know that I'm enjoying the hell out of a series. Quirky and unique Stand abilities also contribute to that. Araki seems to have a never-ending well of ideas when it comes to Stands.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nJojo, even after over hundred episodes still manages to feel fresh and thrilling. Each detail seems to brim with creativity, dialogues are witty, the narrator blends in well without holding back plot progression, fights always demand the actors to use their damn brains, and as always, it doesn't shy away from anything. Such an unconventionally bizarre franchise. I love it.",

            "content": "JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Ougon no Kaze review- I am a Manga reader but this review won't spoil anything \r\n JoJo's bizarre adventure part 5 is a stylistic masterpiece where the writer seems to understand what it takes to make characters feel real and grounded in their everyday habits in a rather bizarre depiction of Italy. It also continues to bring some of animes most fun, psychological and over the top fight scenes. Not only are the characters explored through their brief uncomplicated backstories but in every single decision and movement they do. Part five isn't just a faithful adaption of a great manga,I would say David productions have lifted its source material from its paged and made an even better adaption then they did with any other part. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7 \\n\r\nThe story isn't anything special but manages to have a better flow than part three. The goal is to get places and guard people to climb the ranks of the Passione gang, the ranking system in Passione does make everything more fun and seeing our boys climb the ranks is satisfying. We also see different groups inside Passione for example the hitman group having taken the spotlight as our main villains over the few first episodes we have seen.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9 \\n\\n\r\nWow! David productions has been seen cutting corners on anime like JoJo's Bizarre adventure part four but part five seems to have combined everything good from all the other parts into a big bowl of Flamboyant Masculinity with a dash of finesse. The facial details of part three and the slicker character designs of part four are featured here. Some shots look fantastic with us seeing every little detail on the characters faces as they make a small speech on how they will become a Gang Star! The use of colour in fight scenes is still nicely done and overall character movement is well animated. -1Point because of ugly ass CGI car. \\n\\n\r\nSound:10 \\n\r\nThe soundtrack is again outstanding blending Jazz into the main JoJo theme seamlessly. Sound effects are great as well, all the hits feel like busses colliding and the big explosions of bass as someone drinks a cup of piss or reveals something about the plot help sell the overdramatic tone JoJo's has. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nHirohiko araki has a great way to write his characters, it might seem simple when all the characters get their own backstory episode, but what is the point of a backstory when characters don't act upon them. A character in the show has a backstory telling us that he has anger issues and guess what, in every movement the character makes and every piece of dialogue he has you find a hidden undertone of irritation and anger which he damages his friends with!  Even his Powers reflects his personality with being very powerful and angry but at the same time being overly impulsive and can damage his loved ones. All the characters have flaws big and small, but it effects their choices which seems to be very hard for most shows to pull off. I'm sorry this is quite hard to tell you so I would much rather have it so that you watch the show to see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\n Enjoyment: 10 \\n\r\nPart five isn't just dumb fun, yes JoJo memes are great and all and yes part five is very over the top and that\u2019s part of its style but under all the style there is still a bunch of substance and a bunch of great fights and characters. In a way part five is a better part three, it has better animation better characters and a tighter power system. This is just my opinion though if u hate JoJo's don\u2019t hate me!  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9  \\n\r\nYour next line is...(Why didn\u2019t you give it a 10!) Well it's not perfect but hey no show is, the plot is just a tad too thin in my opinion and follows the traditional JoJo formula. But really everything else is great go watch this show now!

            "content": "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5: Vento Aureo is a good adaptation, David Productions outdid themselves and went beyond what they were given to create the perfect recreation of what the manga has been praised for. My only problem with this adaptation is that it is not on the same level as the previous four parts of JoJo, and beyond its flashy presentation and adrenaline-filled battles is an obscuration of the unremarkable potential of the part's plot and characters.\r\nPlot:\r\nGiorno Giovanna, the son of DIO and Jonathan, is receding in a crime-infested Italy. He wants to be a gangstar to get drugs off the street. He meetswith Bruno, who sympathies with Giorno's desires and eventually has him join his mafia gang called Passione, where we meets the rest of the supporting cast. The mob boss wants them to protect his daughter from the Squadra Esecuzione, a rouge mafia team that wants to dethrone the mob boss. The show then becomes your usual fight of the week format with each member of Passione going against one member of Squadra Esecuzione as they travel around Italy while also escorting the mob boss' daughter.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem of the plot's structure is that its kinda badly put together. What I mean by that is that there's absolutely no breathing room between the fights and it's feels that the battles are simply inconsequential from one another, eventually becoming a blur of whatever fight comes next. At least in \"Diamond is Unbreakable\", Josuke spends his times screwing around in Morioh, whether that be committing fraud with lottery tickets or burning down houses, at least the show reminds you that even with all the tension that has been building up, the plot doesn't have to follow that sentiment with more fights.\\n\\n\r\nI know that the way that the plot is structured, there is no room for breaks, but that doesn't excuse David Productions from not changing some of the arc's structure to remedy the pacing like they did with Part 4 (in the episode, July 15th, notably). The anime does change some things around, but the changes were either insignificant or detrimental to the show itself; the changes included switching the placement of the backstories of the supporting cast and the Squadra Esecuzione amidst the middle of their respective fights. This decision bogs down the flow of the fights when its shoved in the middle when it still would've been fine without it. This appears evident in the Narancia's and Little Feet's fight, which by the way does not have to be three-and-a-half episodes long.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nI don't have a problem with the members of Passione (besides that I find half of them boring, but I also think the half of the Stardust Crusaders are also boring, so who am I to say so) and the Squadra Esecuzione. In fact, I do like that they delve into the Squadra Esecuzione a bit deeper than what Araki did in the manga. However, I do have a problem with our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna. Giorno doesn't have a personality besides for being stoic and dedicated to whatever he wants to pursue. The show doesn't really give me a good reason to care for Giorno or his cause and he's surely one of the least interesting protagonist the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure has to offer. He doesn't have the charisma or charm as Joseph or Josuke nor does he have the heroic maturity as Jonathan or Jotaro. And with the fact that Giorno is supposed to be DIO's son, it's so disappointing that Giorno doesn't carry over any qualities the makes DIO so iconic and cool. His stand, Gold Experience, is unspectacular with its weak power that gains and loses its abilities like the wind. Araki wrote a dud with this one, and David Production unfortunately couldn't save it.\\n\\n\r\nI think the bigger problem with Part 5 is that this doesn't feel like a JoJo part. It feels like it was made by somebody trying to imitate JoJo without knowing the nuances of what made JoJo unique. The protagonist is static and boring, the fights are too long, and the cast of characters are underdeveloped, even with their backstories shown during their respective fights. This part overall doesn't hold a candle to the previous 4 parts and it feels like a black sheep in the JoJo canon. Still, I did like what David Production have done so far, despite me thinking that they didn't do enough. They took the time in crafting how the fights are presented and how the characters interact with each other; their attention-to-detail is impressive to admire and to sit through. David Productions didn't fix any of the problems that came with the manga, but they tried their hardest in making one of the most aesthetically distinct anime airing this year.\\n\\n\r\nSo in all honesty, if you love the past seasons of JoJo, you'll probably end up enjoying this one too.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Story: 8/10\r\nHaving read the manga, the story isn't an original plot that's super groundbreaking or anything. Despite being a more serious part with more focus on the \"Adventure\" than the \"Bizarre\", it keeps the usual Jojo flair, and the \"fight of the week\" acts to progress the story. Being Jojo, it's definitely full of plot holes but personally, I don't think it detracts from the story. \r\nHowever, I rate this one higher than I would any other Jojo because the fights don't seem as predictable as some others are. Using the manga (as the anime hasn't completed yet) as a reference, I can name atleast 5 fights where I was totally certain one of our beloved gangsters was going to lose, before they make their heroic comeback. As the story mainly revolves around these fights, having fresh and exciting stand battles makes watching it so much more enjoyable. \\n\\n\r\nGoing more anime-specific, you can see just how much love Davidpro puts into the adaptation. I'll touch more on the animation side in a bit, but it's greatly appreciated that they put Fugo's backstory (absent from the manga and only told in a light novel) in before his fight, and moved Abbacchio's backstory flashback in a place that makes much more sense. These small changes do wonders for characterization, and I think people who might not have liked part 5's cast before might want to watch the anime and give them a second chance. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNow speaking of the characters, Part 5's cast is one of my favorite Jojo casts ever. Many don't particularly like that they aren't as comedic as the other Jojos, however they all have their own quirks that make watching them so much fun. While I certainly have favorites, every member of Bucciarati's gang (+Trish) is unique and every single one is lovable. The villains are likable too and despite them having the \"show up for a fight then die\" fate that many Jojo villains face, their individual appearances tell a larger story of betrayal and family that makes you almost feel sorry for them.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are all unique and fun as well, and DPro only amplifies this with slight tweaks to colors that give them life. (though I wish they kept silver hair/pink suit Fugo T__T)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhether you love or hate the Jojo artstyle, you can see that Dpro loves their job. The attention to detail they put into adapting the manga is near perfect - one place where I think this really shines is towards the end of the first Narancia fight - and the use of color is absolutely amazing. The animation quality, which was merely okay in previous parts, has risen tremendously and stayed relatively good all throughout so far. Again mentioning the Narancia fight, certain frames in episode 11 were breathtaking and I found myself coming back and rewatching them again and again. \\n\r\nMost reviewers have mentioned the torture dance scene. It goes without saying that Dpro's whole heart was put into that, with them extending a scene that was only 4 panels in the manga into a full 1 minute routine with some of the cleanest animation I've seen in a while. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 1000/10\\n\\n\r\nI LOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE the cast they'd picked for part 5. Every character sounds exactly how I thought they'd sound, and the range in their voices is heard. They're perfect! \\n\\n\r\nAnd the SOUNDTRACK.... oh boy I don't know where to start. The OST of this anime is literal perfection, and I won't go into detail because then I'll never be able to stop. But just know I listen to the OST more than I do anything else. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is just fun! It always makes me sad when I can't spare time on a Jojo Friday to watch the new episode as it comes out, because it's just a breath of fresh air. The friends I watch it with in Rabbit can attest to how much time I spend excitedly cheering on the characters and freaking out over it. Jojo is always a good time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nPart 5 was the first I've read, and the first Jojo anime I've watched as it was coming out, and I hold it very dear to my heart. You can tell DPro does too with how much love was put into the animation and stylization of it all. I definitely recommend Vento Aureo to anyone looking to get into Jojo and implore every person who may not have liked it when they read it to give it another chance.",

            "content": "EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES, WAKING UP WANTING MORE JOJO\r\nWelcome to the fifth iteration of the amazing, bizarre adventure of JoJo's. With the long awaited adaptation Vento Aureo being a third of the way through and personally being one of my favorite parts of the series I feel obliged to put my two cents forward on this wild ride. With out further adieu, here's my review of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind (Vento Aureo)\r\nStarting off with the story we are introduced with Koichi trying to find our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna, the bastard son of Dio. Giorno has mostly led a troubled life with abusiveparents until one day he helps out a gangster which in turn more or less 180's his life. With this sudden change for Giorno, he takes it upon himself to give back to others who have been down on their luck. He then one day runs into Bruno Bucciarati, which after discovering Bucciarati has a stand himself and then fights him comes to lean on him for help since he finds out quickly that Bucciarati is out to clean the streets himself. After going through initiation with Polpo, Giorno is introduced the rest of Bucciarati posse and thusly they go out and do orders for the Passione's boss meanwhile finding a way to get to him. The story of Vento Aureo as a whole, is by no means revolutionary, but it's still highly entertaining and action packed. Action packed JoJo is JoJo at its best if you ask me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAs always, the art of JoJo is pristine and fits the vibe of the series to a T. It's a hybrid of the Stardust Crusaders rough, gritty tone and Diamond is Unbreakable's flashy, contemporary design. The animation is very crisp and all  the battle scenes are as fluid as you could ask. David Pro nailed it yet again and it's a treat to watch every week. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe OST is nothing short of fitting with part 5, we get a top notch OP to start off with Fighting Gold, bringing back Coda is great. The synth work in itself is fantastic and the song as a whole gives off a James Bond vibe. The character theme's are great and fit with the characters personalities. My god, the Prince remix for the Torture Dance was downright perfect. We didn't deserve how hard David Pro for us, but thank the anime gods they did. I was personally a bit skeptical on the ED at first, but after finishing the manga for pt5, it honestly fits in a strange way. Go figure, it's JoJo after all.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Jo bro's this time around are some of the best we've got yet. While I don't love them AS much as SC's bro's, all of them on part 5 have something good to offer and to make the experience entertaining. As I stated earlier, minus their backstories, the motivations between Giorno and Bucciarati are similar in more ways then one so I'll lump the two together. Both have a strong sense of justice, meanwhile Giorno HAS A DREAM, they want what's best for the community as a whole, especially the children. I'm not really going to touch up on Giorno's stand as it is a very multi layered stand, that quite frankly does a lot of shenanigans, especially later on down the line. Bucciarati's stand, Sticky Fingers, is a stand which opens up inanimate objects, people, areas, amongst other things to various things like placing objects or making a quick escape. Next up we have Mista, a quirky young man who has a phobia over the number four. Mista somewhat falls into comic relief sometimes along with Narancia since it seems like those two attract trouble the most. Both of them are basically just big ol' goobers. Mista has a rather gray area stand. It more or less boils down to a long range stand that he has a symbiotic relationship with. My goodness Sex Pistols is an adorable stand though, truly the best boys. Narancia, the youngest outside of Giorno, is an ill-tempered kinda dope-ish kid who was betrayed by his older brother figure which lead him to a life of poverty and nearly dying himself until Fugo introduced him to Bucciarati. His stand, Aerosmith, is a remote controlled type cropduster airplane which can shoot a machine gun and missiles at his target. Along with his stand he can track them down with a radar system. Fugo is an intellectual whom had trouble expressing his emotions until he just cracked on a professor who was trying to sexually assault him. It's clear to say he's the brains of the group and was on a path to success until he boiled over, even though he was absolutely in the right to defend himself. His stand, Purple Haze is a true pinpoint reflection of his mental state. A mutli-faceted being that has insane amounts of power that he has trouble concealing and has a quirky neat freak tucked away inside. Lastly of the bro's we have Abbacchio. Abbacchio can come off as a huge ass, but this is mainly due to the mistakes he made in the past, so he has a hard time letting others in and trusting them. I can be hard on him as a character, but I /get/ why he does what he does to the characters he knows little about, like Giorno. To round the group up we have Trish. There's not much I can say about her, due to the anime being up to only up to episode 15 and I'm absolutely not going to spoil it for the anime only fans. Basically all that's been said is that she's the boss's daughter and Giorno and the Jo bro's have been tasked to protect her up until a certain point in time. I tried my damndest to not spoil things about these character since I truly love each of them in their own ways.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros- \\n\r\nExciting and action packed story \\n\r\nGreat art/animation\\n\r\nGreat characters\\n\r\nOn point OST\\n\r\nFantastic fan service David Pro added in (i.e the expanded Torture Dance)\\n\\n\\n\r\nCons-\\n\r\nGotta wait a week for every episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMy final rating, due to personal bias is a 10. I love JoJo and especially part 5. Hope you guys enjoy the rest of the ride.",

After 12 episodes of Golden Wind, I'm convinced that I'm just never going to get back the feel I had with the original series.  It really feels like everything that was joked about and satirized with the original series is being taken way too seriously in these last two series.  They're really long and heavily episodic, with a good half of each episode being dedicated to a narrator explaining the characters' backstories.  The Stands were old by the end of Stardust Crusaders, the fact that they're still trying toride them is just depressing.  I really want to like this because it's JoJo and the art is really well done in this series, but the characters are annoying and lackluster.  They pretty much exist as vehicles for their Stands now.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, gonna stop holding my breath and waiting for another decent series out of this franchise.",

This show has some of the most exciting action and most heart pounding stuff that I've ever seen. \r\nWhen it comes down to it, Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is, as its name suggests, pretty bizarre. However, the quality of the show doesn't decrease because of it. The genius of Araki Hirohiko has made the show and series as a whole into a near masterpiece with very few mistakes in the later parts ofthe story. Golden Wind had an interesting manga to say the least making for one of the most separated communities in the Jojo fandom as all of them are confused as to whether it's good or not. However, from the new addition of the anime, it fixes most of the problems with boring fights or simply just uninteresting plot devices and makes for a fun show that makes you excited as heck when the biggest plot points hit you. I tend to see lots of mediocre stories, especially in the shounen category. There are some shows that don't really use the full potential of the idea and it brings the entire series down into shit. However, Jojo uses masterful pacing with an interesting story to accompany it without forgetting to have good characters and nice aesthetics that fit the show. In terms of anime, this is one of my favorites and I hope to see more interesting stuff from Araki as he prepares to end Part 8 and thinks of ideas for Part 9.",

            "content": "After I read the part 5 manga I was left with mixed feelings. It has a rushed ending, a protagonist that suddenly loses relevance, characters lacking development and fights that were near impossible to comprehend (mind you, I read the b&w version until half of the story). On the plus side, it introduced amazing new reinventions on the concept of a stand, had memorable battles and some members that stood out from the rest. \r\nNow, after a long hiatus of an year and ten months, the adaptation of this part finally came to be, and it took me by surprise. As of the moment ofthis review (episode 13 was released 2 weeks ago and 14 is coming this week) most of the problems I had with GW were fixed and improved. There was a good chunk of filler added to the story which while slowing the pace of the story, it also adds more weight and developement to the characters. Characters like Fugo now have a backstory, the excecution team now feels like a team, a nemesis or counter to passione (which I did not see when reading the manga, I saw them as random gangsters that went individually to pursue their goal of overtaking the mafia instead of being an actual team), etc. \\n\\n\r\nOn top of the fixed issues I and many people had with part 5 comes the soundtrack and animation. On behalf of the animation, it is possibly the best out of all the parts. The style feels like a fusion of the part 3 style with the more slender designs of the manga, which blend perfectly in the animation. Not only that, but the movement and fights have gotten much more fluid and dynamic. And the soundtrack I find also to be the best so far, with a memorable main theme and its variations being each time stronger and better than the former.\\n\\n\r\nRounding up, after being a fan of Jojo for 4 years I could not ask for a better adaptation, and will hold Golden Wind as my favourite part of the series. I highly recommend to watch it, especially to those who like to hate on it because they are bitter over people not enjoying Stone Ocean as much",

            "content": "Golden Wind, Ougon no Kaze, or Vento Aureo, whichever you prefer, is my favourite Part of my favourite anime of all time. David Production's adaptation of this amazing Manga goes far beyond what I expected, adding scenes and improving on scenes that were already in the Manga.\r\nStory 10\r\nThe story, while confusing to an outsider's perspective, makes complete sense in context. Our protagonist, Giorno Giovanna's, main goal is to get rid of the drug trafficking towards children in Italy, and all of his other goals revolve around killing the Boss of Passione, the biggest gang in Italy. It's filled with bad ass fights, with lots ofstrategy coming from either side, every character having unique powers that must be countered with the others thinking. The comedy is over the top and hilarious, as JoJo's always is, and contains my so far favourite scene in anime, the minute long Torture Dance scene which was only a few panels in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nArt 10\\n\\n\r\nDP has always made amazing art for the anime and translated Araki's art style the best possible to anime, but GW is by far the best. The animation is greatly improved, the detail from Parts 1-3 is there, with an improved artstyle, and everyone looks sexy as hell (while a show doesn't need to be sexy, and sometimes is hindered by it, in JoJo's it adds to the enjoyment.) The choice of colours is amazing, and there's always something nice to look at.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP Fighting Gold quickly became my favourite song of all time. The rest of the soundtrack is amazing and hype as well, especially Giorno's theme, Il Vento D'oro. The sounds of the Stand summons are incredibly satisfying to hear, along with their punches and abilities. The character's voice actors are perfect and what I imagined, if not better, when I read the Manga.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10\\n\\n\r\nEach character is unique and interesting. Each of the main gang members grows due to Giorno's involvement in the gang, weather it's through loving him or hating him. You can also see how they all look up to Buccearati, and that's why he's best mom. Mista is a lovable optimistic badass, with a soft side shown with him fathering his Stand, the Sex Pistols. Giorno is a leader, and inspirational to both the viewers, and his teammates. Giorno and Mista are my favourite characters of all time, and if DP makes them canonically gay, which is heavily hinted at in the manga but never confirmed, probably since it was written in 1990s Shounen Jump, I will love DP forever.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say? The serious moments are badass, the entire thing is beautiful, the comedic moments are hilarious, it's inspirational, and so much more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10\\n\\n\r\nI love this show so much, and it's currently on my favourite arc (White Album). My favourite scene in all of fiction is at the end of the arc (with Giorno's speech about resolve) and I am hyped to see that in the anime.",

Well, you've come to the right place, boy!\r\nGet invested in the series and become a Jojo reference yourself (I'm sorry for lying here.)\r\nWant a brief history? Here you go:\r\nPart One: Fighting your adoptive brother who's a vampire with the power of the sun.\r\nPart Two: Fighting gods of physical exercise with both poses that expand your life with memes, Nazi soldiers that are extremely pridefulin their science, constant mind games, and the power of the Sun!\\n\r\nPart Three: A 50-day trip to know your friends before the feels trip strikes at the end to fight your grandfather's grandfather's adoptive brother who's come back with your grandfather's grandfather's stunningly hot bod. Battle him with constant poses, mind games, and manifestations that kinda are related to life energy.\\n\r\nPart Four: Enter a town with a boy who smacks everyone that talks shit about his hair as there are multiple incidents in the town that end up making him chase down a killer with a kink for hands. He ends up crossing paths with the dolphin man who comes from Part Three.\\n\r\nPart Five (current one): Enter a mafia to change it from the inside. With constant memes about both sounds and what happens to the characters. Later, end up helping the boss of the mafia by assisting his daughter in her escape from a hitman team that wants to seek out the boss' identity. End up with the best team you know: a man who unzips everything (including your fly), tsundere rewind, the man who was born in 12/3 and fears four, orange boi, and anger boy.\\n\\n\r\nI am not going to say my points for this, but I'm going to say that it's great and fantastic. You'll probably meme alongside your friends and end up joining the community. It was worth my time watching this series as I had an orgasm for this being announced as an anime.\\n\r\nThe story so far is good. We got a concept where we actually are interested in what happens to Giorno and his group.\\n\r\nThe art style is always, as you know, good due to it being David Production and their constant change of coloring several scenes to keep you interested.\\n\r\nThe music... You gotta love it when it's Jojo.\\n\r\nThe characters - what more can you love than a tsundere poking the chest of another man?\\n\r\nThe enjoyment - it's good.\\n\r\nRecommended and suggested to watchers of Jojo and to those who haven't watched it. Although, if you want to watch this series, better to start on watching the whole entire saga/journey.",

            "content": "It's been a year since I finished part 5's manga so i decided maybe a review of it's anime would be helpful. I'm not gonna include any \"jojokes\" as the kids call them, but instead I'll be looking at it from a critical perspective instead of a fan's perspective. \r\nFirst off, the story is ripped directly from the manga but includes extra scenes for fan service, specifically all the scene's involving La Squadra. I'm writing this directly after watching episode 27, so there has been 2 scenes dedicated to fleshing out the side gang of La Squadra, a particularly popular cast of characters in thejojo fandom. Some specific parts of the manga have been taken out or reworked to help the pacing of the show, which is understandable and not really horrible from my perspective. The big two I can remember both involve taking out scenes of Bruno, which don't develop his character. \\n\r\nSecond, the art. As much as I enjoy Jojo's, I will never fully enjoy the animation that has been adapted from the manga. Some parts are extremely stiff and make it hard to compare each episode to the next. Ever since the character stills were reveled I never really liked how they looked, in comparison to the rest of the parts. I wish that part 5 had an art style comparable to season 1 or part 4, but instead it took the part 3 route of making every character slightly bland with the color choices and look the same with its art style. I do not think that any of the color changes made to the main cast look bad, I particularly like Giorno's pink suit- it is mainly the minor character's colors that hold the anime down from its manga counterpart. \\n\r\nThe sound of jojo's part 5 is good. I can't really say much about it because that isn't what I am an expert on, but I can appreciate good sound design and I think that Jojo's excels in this department. \\n\r\nNow onto character. In my opinion writing good characters without them having much personality or anything to do or them being the worst is something Araki does best, but the anime just drags it down. There is not many interesting characters outside of the main cast.  Sure every minor character has their quirks, and you can find a large fanbase for said minor characters online, but most of them are one off villains with unique stand that are only written so that Giorno and the gang can't get from place to place super quickly. Part 5 is like a monster of the week show in this way, but with some interesting episodes here and there. For example. the stand battles that have the most unique abilities are more likely to be interesting then two strong dudes fighting against each other. These minor characters don't really drag down the show, though, and simply provide weekly entertainment. \\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy Jojo's bizarre adventure golden wind a lot. Despite having a lot of criticism for the show its one of the only anime I consistently keep up with and being a fan of the series, I'd give it a 10 overall. But being a critic, I'll have to give it an 8. If you're interested in Jojo- go watch it. I'm not gonna preach a \"part skipping is evil\" mindset but if you need some good fights to watch or just something to put on in the background, I'd highly recommend. Jojo fans will enjoy it and so will newcomers and the show deserves all the hype it gets. So thats an 8/10 and adios.",

            "content": "After 4 seasons of mindless battles, finally enough is enough. As someone that really liked the first season, it pains me to say that I'm finally putting this series down for awhile. While David Production has given this series great treatment, sadly nothing can save it at this point.\r\nStory:\r\nGenerally the Jojo series start out with some goal, and then endless battles lead up to it. That's the same here for this season, as our protagonist wants to change his hometown and ends up battling countless foes to get there, mostly meaningless battles. Aside from that Jojo doesn't really have much of a story. If actionentertains you enough however, you will enjoy it if you don't mind the inconsistencies and turn your brain off. I'm one that generally needs more intense fights or story focus to enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI judge art by thinking \"Would I want every series to look like this?\" Otherwise you can't tell good apart from unique. While the art is well done and decent quality, I cannot say it would be enjoyable if it wasn't just for the fact that I haven't seen it much before.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe sound quality is decent. The ending theme doesn't really fit and some characters have very annoying voices but the rest is good overall. The battle sounds are probably what matter most.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nJojo takes time to develop briefly each of its characters, though not as deep as many series as it focuses more on battles than development. There's nothing particularly special about the characters either. So this is a solid average.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nLiterally one of the lowest possible by this point, I just can't enjoy meaningless battles but it seems a lot of people do. If you like action and different characters showing up all the time then this is for you maybe.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThis series started with a lot of promise but ended up as nothing more than pathetic.",

This is quite prevalent in part 5, but I still think it yields some of thegreatest stands in the series. \\n\\n\r\nVento Aureo is one of Araki's greatest works, and the anime has added scenes to round it better, which I appreciate since sometimes the manga (asides from part 7, praise be Steel Ball Run) can have some discrepancies. All in all it's a great show, with stellar art (each panel is enjoyable, despite the occasional still-frame it's gorgeous), lovable characters, and a great music direction, it's gonna be going down as a favorite as JoJo will be in general.",

            "content": "Edit: this review is trash\r\nBefore I start this review, keep note that I have NOT read the manga and that the anime has not ended yet. I am also very tired writing this.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe genre that Vento Aureo inhabits is a mob drama, and is by FAR the most brutal of any part (so far). The reason why I consider the story to be a 10/10 is nearly completely because of the battle formula and power system. The power system in Jojo's is stands which are ghost-like beings that are representations of individual's souls that ALL have different abilities, and no two stands have thesame ability (except for two in Stardust Crusaders which is never explained, but I digress). Because no two stands are the same (with one exception), every fight is different from the last. What really makes stands one of the greatest power systems in all of shounen, though, is how no one stand is inherently the best or worst so every stand can be defeated, and because stand battles are basically mind games where the smartest, most creative, and most clever will win, so the characters have to earn their win. The formula is tinkered with in Vento Aureo, but I will explain that in the character review.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style in Vento Aureo is very unique and memorable, but most importantly, consistent. As a Naruto fan, I know more than anyone how immersion breaking it is when you're watching one of the best animated episodes you have ever seen, and then, in the next episode, you can count how many lines there are in each individual frame, on your hand. In short, the art and animation is great, and stays great throughout.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound and music are great and never goes below that, but that's about it. The sound and music always fit, and will suit the scene, but there is nothing especially memorable, at least so far.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nJojo's Bizarre Adventure is arguably the greatest battle series of all time, and this can largely be contributed to the formula from Stardust Crusaders (Part 3) and onward. The reason why this is important to note is because, while past parts focus mainly on the battles themselves (and do that quite well, might I add, but that's neither here nor there), Vento Aureo focuses a lot on the progression of the main characters. Whether strengthening their resolve or their comradery, many fights serve to develop the main cast, yet no victory ever feels undeserved when a character just \"takes the pain\", for lack of better terminology, because they will have to grow as an individual or as a group. The mains have, by far, the lengthiest backstories of any part (so far), and while I don't think that lengthy backstories are inherently good or bad in writing characters, they are used well in Vento Aureo because of how they affect the characters actions and add to each characters memorability. Each main character has their own goals, wants, and fears, which affects each mains decisions and gives those decisions much more weight and gravity. I consider Giorno Giovanna to be the best Jojo, and my personal favorite, so far, mostly because of what I have discussed so far, but also because he is the only Jojo whose goal is his own and that was not pushed on him. The main villain of the part is being built up at this point of the story so I can't say how good he is, but I will say that I definitely have high hopes for him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMost of the enjoyment comes from the stand battles and watching the characters progress, but saying anything else would just be me repeating my points.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the masterful fights and genius use of characters makes it nothing but a masterpiece in my eyes, and is why Vento Aureo is my favorite part, and possibly my favorite anime of all time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nI just finished writing this and my god I am tired. I woke up yesterday at 5:50 AM, and it is now 2:40 AM. I am so tired. I need to sleep.",
