            "content": "Drifters is the type of show that you\u2019ll quickly realize what it is from the start. Anyone familiar with Kouta Hirano (known for his work \u201cHellsing\u201d) will get a familiar vibe with the style of the series. If you fancy a fantasy story about extraordinary individuals coming together, then Drifters will be quite a treat. \r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, Drifters initially will leave the impression of a dark fantasy tale. The first few episodes easily establishes its premise as we meet the Drifters, the main protagonists of the show. They are based on historical figures who are based from their timeline.Still, throughout the series, you\u2019ll probably designate them more as anti-heroes by their actions. The primary cast composes of Shimazu Toyohisa, Oda Nobunaga, and Nasu Suketaka Yoichi. Thanks to a mysterious man named Murasaki, they are bought together to stand against evil. Against them are the Ends, characters who ironically weren\u2019t evil during their timeline. At the same time, Drifters are aided by a mysterious group of magicians known as the Octobrists. Get the idea now? Drifters is essentially a dark fantasy war that brings together history\u2019s most infamous figures into one big oddball package.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, the show will test a viewer\u2019s patience. This is because even though the show has a dark and grim atmosphere, it also tries to sell its comedy and humor. That\u2019s right, the show adapts humor to spice up the entertainment. This can be seen as a throwback as people may not take the show seriously. However, if you can get with the momentum, then Drifters will be a pleasant surprise. Understanding the show\u2019s lore will also enhance your enjoyment of this show. To be honest, what really can draw an audience\u2019s interest is about the characters. Each of them possesses a rather intriguing personality and their roles in the story often spark curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nShimazu is the main protagonist and also leader of the Drifters. Shimazu is pretty much a natural leader as he is courageous with no fear. His charisma is also a characteristic that inspires others (such as elves) to follow up during the war. We can easily see that he is driven by determination by putting himself above others. The elves and dwarves respects him not just as a Drifter but also a friend. On the other hand, we have Oda Nobunaga. As a strategist, it\u2019s no surprise that he has a brilliant mind. However, he is also a character to be wary of even by his own allies. His sarcastic personality becomes a big joke throughout the show as he brings in the most comedy. As part of the group, Yoichi can be mistaken for a trap because of his feminine appearance. However, he is a guy to be feared when facing against his bow. Later on, we also meet others that joins in their quest as the war turns into a chaotic pandemonium.\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonists are the End. Perhaps the most mysterious and also recognizable would be the Black King. His ultimate goal is to destroy humanity and replace it with a new race in his vision. As leader of the Ends, we don\u2019t find out too much about him. This is perhaps where characterization in the show suffers a bit. We get this all mighty character that operates from the shadows yet not much is known about him, even his past. Luckily, the other Ends brings in more interest such as Easy, a young woman with odds against Murasaki. Anastasia Romanov and Joan of Arc are also ironically the villains in this show, as people may recognize them as heroines from other lores. The one noticeable trait that separates the Ends and the Drifters though is power. Ends seems to possess supernatural abilities, something that the Drifters lack. While Drifters rely on their own natural talent, weapons, and technology, Ends can perform superhuman feats. For instance, Anastasia is able to freeze others while Gilles de Rais can use inhuman strength and durability. As you may guess, the show pits them in battles between the Drifters and Ends like fate. The war itself has a purpose although everyone has their own reasons for fighting. However, it\u2019s up to the audience to decide if those are meaningful or not.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the show has a lot of comedy. Whether these may be character interactions or historical in-jokes, it\u2019s always there. One thing that does hold the storytelling back at times is the pacing. It seems at times, the show emphasizes a bit too much on the humor at the expense of other elements. While Oda Nobuanga is a big example of this, others such as Count Saint-Germi from the Orte Empire adds more. The buildup of the story between some episodes can also feel lacking depending on preferences. And because the series is created by Kouta Hirano, you can expect some Nazi references to be introduced as well. That\u2019s right, if you\u2019re thinking Hitler then you\u2019re correct. The show even has a bit of fantasy racism! On the other hand, do take in for granted when the action picks up. This show is no joke when it comes to making a spectacle of battles. When the pacing picks up, it\u2019s where the series really shines and will make you feel that all the buildup worth the wait. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Hoods Entertainment, the show is pretty accurate with its manga art style. This is what impresses me a lot when I first watched this series as it\u2019s on spot, almost frame by frame for the character designs. Not to mention, both the Drifters and Ends are characterized with their badass look ranging from Shimazu\u2019s weapons to Yoichi\u2019s sharp eyes. Speaking of that, the show has a distinctive style of adapting its character features. This is especially recognized by the intimidating looks of Ends as they look convincingly menacing. The setting of the battles is also decorated with a dark fantasy look with ruins, ancient castles, etc. Add ultraviolence and minimal censorship and you get Drifters at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also pretty noticeable throughout the show ranging from especially the theme songs. It\u2019s stylistic and filled with creativity. While some people may call it silly, I see it more as a expressing the show\u2019s humor and almost feels satirical. The OST and soundtrack has a hardcore instrumental tone during the battle scenes that is highly entertaining. Character voice mannerism throughout show is also noticeable even at times when the dialogues gets overly silly. Perhaps the most noticeable are those of Oda Nobunaga mainly for his commanding voice. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished watching Drifters, I was not only impressed by the overall content but also for its ability to entertain. If you have a sense of humor, then this will definitely be worth every minute of time. If you take it too seriously though, then Drifters will probably feel more like a chore to watch. I would definitely recommend Drifters even if you\u2019re not a fan of the author\u2019s works. I can\u2019t say this enough but Hirano\u2019s ability to express his ideas are just too damn entertaining to evade.\\n",

            "content": "Before starting my review, I would like to note that almost every character of Drifters is a historical figure, so I would highly recommend you to use Google from time to time. Drifters uses American historical figures, Japanese historical figures, French historical figures, Russian historical figures, and others. Anyways, let us start.\r\n Drifters: Battle in a Brand-new World War, Drifters, or\u30c9\u30ea\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba, is a fantasy, alternate history Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano. The manga started serialization in Shounen Gahosha magazine, Young King Ours, on April 30, 2009. It received an anime adaptation, which was announced in May, 2015 and aired between October 7,2016 and December 23, 2016. A second season has also been announced. \\n\\n\r\n Toyohisa of the Shimazu clan is in the heat of the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, which signaled the start of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan; the only thing he thinks about is how to behead the enemy commander and he is ready to achieve this goal by all means. Having fatally injured the enemy commander, Toyohisa is also about to die. Suddenly he finds himself in a white corridor, facing a man in strange clothes sitting at a desk in a white corridor. A moment later he is sent to a new land, where some unknown historical figures treat his wounds. Shortly after that he finds out that he, as well as his new companions, are Drifters. Why were Drifters sent to this world? Find out the answer now! \\n\\n\r\n The story-line of Drifters is worthy. There are still; however, some things that should be explained, but I would not call it a problem, since a second season was announced a day, or two ago. Drifters is violent; all history anime should be like Drifters. However, I have one major complaint and I am sure that you will not like it either: humor. Being a fan of Hellsing, I was expecting a portion of Hellsingish humor, but Drifters clearly overused it: it is not funny and outdated. I mean, come on, boob jokes? Really? Why not spend more time on characters and story-line? Is it that difficult? Anyways, it is not a big problem and you will still enjoy Drifters. To be precise, that is the only problem of Drifters. \\n\\n\r\n The art and music are very similar to Hellsing, so if you have already seen Hellsing Ultimate, you will recognize it immediately and will not have any problems with it. If you have not seen Hellsing Ultimate yet, it will not be a problem, either. The art style is amazing, every single detail of all characters is just beautiful. And, yes, that Japanese themed Alucard is just badass. The music, however, did not leave a huge impression on me. Of course, the voice actors did one hell of a job, but I was hoping to see something close to what was in Hellsing Ultimate. Anyway, the music used in Drifters is a mix of traditional Japanese music, jazzy beats, and rock. \\n\\n\r\n  The characters are very entertaining. As I have already mentioned, some of them did not receive enough development, but they will surely receive enough development in the new season. With that being said, we spend a lot time with the Japanese warriors: Shimazu Toyohisa, Oda Nobunaga, and Nasu Yoichi Suketaka. Their trio is very interesting, because they all are different. Shimazu is a warrior that only wants to behead his enemy; however, at the same time, he is also a true warrior, who will never harm a woman. Nasu is a young archer, who does not have any leader qualities; yet, he is also a fearless warrior. Oda is the most dangerous person in this group, because he is a true leader, he does not care where he is, because he is a true genius that will capture any town even with a bunch of amateurs. \\n\\n\r\n Anyways, the characters are very interesting to follow. As the story-line progresses, Drifters shows us more about its characters\u2019 background. And while some of Drifters do have regrets, they are still ready to go on and it is very exciting. However, there is also one problem I would like to mention, the comedy part. Jesus Christ, it is simply awful. I do agree that the comedy part is needed even in some gruesome anime, but it should not be overused. The problem is that you are watching a serious episode and you are trying to understand the problem; however, Drifters shows you these comedy moments disturbing you. It is simply impossible to concentrate and it is very annoying. \\n\\n\r\n As for enjoyment, this anime is very enjoyable and if you are a fan of Hellsing Ultimate, you will not have any problems with it. If you have not seen Hellsing Ultimate yet, I would highly recommend you to watch it first, but it is up to you, of course. It is not a must do. \\n\\n\r\n All in all, Drifters is not flawless, the comedy part ruined this masterpiece, in my opinion. Yes, it is very annoying, but you should not ignore this anime because of it, please do not do it, it is still awesome. On top of that, the most important thing is that it will receive a continuation, so you will not have to wait years predicting if it will, or will not receive a new season. Drifters is an anime I would highly recommend to every single anime fan; however, if you are a big hater of Hellsing Ultimate, I would highly recommend you to think twice before watching Drifters.",

            "content": "\"FATALITY!\" -Every Mortal Kombat game since 1992.\r\n*SPOILERS FOR DRIFTERS*\r\nWar is hell. We know this to be true by now. This also applies to the fact about there being a lot of \"sent to another world\" anime adaptations. You really need to do something really unique to stand out if you're one of these shows, and while I'd like to say that SAO and Re:Zero conditioned me to think otherwise, its obvious that their additions to the concept alone (bloodthirsty video game world and reset after death respectively) were what made them stand out, even if the actual concept, for most part does the exact opposite.With this show, they decided to make it have a full-fledged war, with loads of carnage peppered throughout. The concept is very interesting, especially since the war consists of famous people from many different eras of different countries. It's sort of like the Fate/ series, except that this time, all of the combatants were based on real people instead of sprinkling mythological people into the mix. So, was this a true breath of fresh air for the genre? Did it manage to do that while being a genuinely great war story? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSo, there is some kind of conflict between Easy and Murasaki (which doesn't get explained or fleshed out) that caused them to start sending people to this unidentified new world in which there are two main factions at war: Drifters (deceased war heroes), and Ends (once noble beings who have gone bad for their own reasons tying into their demise, but not all of them have their backstory shown to us). There are also humans who enslave two kinds of demi-humans: elves, and dwarves. Drifters are fighting to bring down the human governments of this world via conquest, and destroy the Ends, while the Ends are fighting to destroy the world and all inhabitants (despite the fact that their leader just wants the demi-humans to be the main inhabitants). So, what the hell happened here?\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the first few episodes were rough. Not only were there some minor plot holes, but there is one gigantic issue that really damages this series: the tone shifts. You can have a moment in which villagers all horrifyingly stab a man to death in brutal fashion, and then seconds later, they show cracks a random joke. They do this so often, and sometimes, in the most inopportune of times, ruining some of the darker and heavier moments of the show. Sure, this means that, inevitably, a few of these end up being funny, but, for most part, they end up harming more than helping. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does pick up, but a few new issues really hamper this show. Every time one of the Ends is about to die or be defeated, we suddenly get their backstory in order to make the story sad, and that just doesn't work. In order for that to work, we need the characters to be more than just one-dimensional baddies before-hand, and they pull this stunt three times! Also, the finale just...ends, without any major resolution. Just, a battle ends, and here is one image of where each Drifter is at the moment, in an obvious, and quite frankly, rushed sequel-hook, particularly because some of the characters, like Scipio and Butch Cassidy, have been left by the wayside, especially Scipio with the fact that he has been left in the jungle but suddenly he's in a navy ship with a character that has only been seen for one brief moment. Hell, there are other moments that required some time to explain, like how the Drifters suddenly got human armor when their last battle (which was two episodes prior) didn't have nearly as many people killed to remotely equal the amount of armor and weapons present. Shame too, since if this concept was explored more and the story were tightened up, this would've definitely been a good first season to what looks to be an otherworldly war epic.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to tolerate these \"Drifters\" early on. I mean, they were all a bunch of quarreling assholes without anything interesting about their character, and by the end of it, some of the more minor additions (like Hannibal and Scipio) were still like that. Luckily, our main trio grew. Toyo is a crazed warrior who loves decapitating enemy warriors, as long as they are male. His culture and all Japanese war cultures at the time do not like the thought of women engaged in combat. He ends up also being a bot more chivalrous towards females and children than his cohorts while understanding people more than he probably should (reminding me a lot of Ragna the Bloodedge, from the Blazblue game series) and I'll touch on that in a bit. Nobunaga is a much more brutal tactician as well as being a hardier individual than his allies. His violent streak, as a result of his culture and his multiple times being betrayed, makes for some of the best usages of military tactics I've seen in a war anime in quite some time. Yoichi ends up being more in between when it comes to his companions' traits, but with more of a tragic war past, which is shallowly explored via his commander, who ends up chatting with him once, and that's it. He's probably the least interesting of the trio, but at least, he ends up being the crux of some of the better comedy moments of the first 3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nButch Cassidy and the other Drifters are infinitely less interesting, but he is easily the most tolerable of them (along with The Sundance Kid for how little he shows up), with him actually doing some cool stuff. Sure, Naoshi takes down some dragons in a WWII plane, but he's just there to provide some refreshing amounts of swearing, which ends up becoming excessive. There is also Count Saint-Germi (the son of Hitler) with his coup d'etat scheme, and his annoying posse (Alester and Flemi), but they are mostly there to be annoying and provide bad comedy until the count himself starts that plan with the Drifters to overthrow the human government.\\n\\n\r\nThe Octobrists are overall very uninteresting, except for Olmine, who is constantly made fun of for her voluptuous breasts, but has some genuinely great interactions with Toyo, as he shows her some good chivalry and allows her to use her spells to great effect in the latter half of the series. She is literally the only remotely interesting Octobrist. As for the Ends, with exception of The Black King, all of them are as plain as they come (with the slight exception of Anastasia, who is barely in this show). Then, they (except for Anestasia and Rasputin) get their backstories to explain why they are so evil and a bit about how that ties in with their powers (Only Joan of Arc does. Gilles de Rais and Hijikata doesn't get anything relating to his powers, and nobody gets their power origins outright explained) in a poor attempt at making these lame characters come off as tragic, which is really horrible given their real-life counterparts. \\n\\n\r\nThe Black King is an interesting figure, wanting better civilization for the demi-humans, and being able to create food as well as grow cells (to regenerate, but also to harm, as shown with the Bronze Dragon in episode 10), but even with his somewhat interesting motivations and enigmatic figure, he can't really make up for how bland his subordinates are. Easy is the one who sends the bad guys in, is moody, and that's about it aside from having a cutesy and girly room to herself. Murasaki is even more bland, though. Overall, despite a few characters that grew to be legitimately interesting and compelling, the cast is stupidly bland at best, and irritating at worst.\\n\\n\r\nHoods Drifters Studio (not to get confused with Hoods Entertainment, though they may or may not be affiliated) is brand new to this game, and they did a really good job with their first series, which is, of course, this. As if to make up for the writing quality, the action is refreshingly brutal, with loads of decapitation and blood, and no censorship anywhere. It's pretty fun seeing how much of a chaotic gore-fest the action scenes are, and they detail some of the bullet moments and impacts very well. The character models, while looking similar to Kouta Hirano's most popular work, Hellsing Ultimate, they also feel realistic and sorta unique. The only problem I have isn't with the art-stye change during most of the comedy moments, but rather with the usage of CGI for the dragons and some of the soldiers. They try to cover it up and make it work with everything, but it doesn't really help much, as it looks awkward. Luckily, that problem is barely present in the second half. Some moments in the earlier episodes are a bit off though. Still, I really hope to see this studio grow since they did such an impressive job with their first project.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have such high praises for the music, sadly. Gospel of the Throttle (by Minutes 'Til Midnight), the OP of the series, doesn't fit the show as well as I wish. On its own, it's a slick piece, but I don't feel it works here. Luckily, the ED, Vermillion (by Maon Kurosaki) is a very good song, with a more epic and buildup heavy feel to it that really fits with how gruesome and heavy the show can be. The rest of the OST isn't memorable or worthwhile at all, save for one ok piece. The dub is pretty alright. No major hiccups here, but nothing spectacular in terms of performances. It's a relatively solid dub so far. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, despite how cool and refreshing the action scenes were, this show kinda left me feeling bored and annoyed every now and then, especially in the first half. I admit, the action is fun, and some moments were definitely bleak, the horrible tone-shifts really leave me dazed and confused, and completely taken out of the experience, which is horrible given that one of these moments take place immediately after the darkest moment of the show! If not for the cool action, this wouldn't have engaged me at all, especially since the first 3 episodes left me with the feeling of darkness-induced apathy. I nearly dropped it during those first 3 episodes and even then, outside of fight scenes, this show is still very boring at times. Plus, not a lot of the gags make me laugh, but at least some of them do.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while this is a very gruesome action show and some of the gags get a laugh here and there, this show is a tonal mess that's hard to care about on any level that isn't related to primal, epic bloodbaths. At the very least, I hope that this series ends up bringing some notoriety for Hoods Drifters Studio. Still, this show is a bit of a disappointment. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",

The hype is REAL. \r\nNow to start off, I am a fan of the manga, and I can tell that a lot of love has been put into the development of this anime. It didn't miss a single important event, and you can feel the love of the creators every week while watching it. \r\nStory\r\nIt is a magnificent story, although I can't be certain that it is a unique one. What makes this experience incredible, is that the characters in it, are historical figures, from different eras, dating back to1500's and earlier. Every character is done with insane attention to detail, and once you start watching it, if you are not familiar with these characters, you are inclined to google them and get to know their stories, because they are so incredible to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art can be described as STUNNING. I don't know what the budget is, but if every anime can have that quality it will be a godsend. Buildings, backgrounds, character designs, everything is marvelous. I can't really find nothing bad about the quality. Also you get ZERO censorship, which makes the experience even more enjoyable, as you lose track of time, while getting engulfed in the story, which has incredible pacing. There is no rushing in this adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nVery good, great OP and ED. There are some instrumentals during the episodes which fit perfectly in the premise of the story. Everything through the sound of the sword to the shots of the gun is how it should be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI have already a bit for the characters, but nevertheless here are some of the figures that are in it: Toyohisa Shimazu, Oda Nobunaga, Nasu Yoichi, Saint Germi, Abe no Seimei, Rasputin, Dark King (you will find out who he is), Hijikata Toshizou, Joan of Arc, Guilles de Raimes, Anastasia Romanov, Hannibal, Scipio, Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid ... just to name a few. It is an incredible watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\\n\r\nI have looked forward to this every week. It is truly a worthwhile anime that is for everyone who enjoys incredible visuals, historical figures, great fighting, strategies of war and most of all a satisfying story. Watch this, because you will be sorry if you don't.",

            "content": "Yo waddup waddup i'm here to bring you some reality checks about this overhyped messy disappointment. This'll probably be a pretty short review focusing mostly on the negatives, but that's only because i don't have much to say about this anime. It's pretty forgettable.\r\nSo obviously all the hype comes from the fact that this is from the author of Hellsing, which instantly got thousands of edgy teens to get a hard-on. We expected insane badassery, gruesome fights and a level of cool that would make all the panties drop. Too bad we got none of that, but instead just a faint shadow of the author'sprevious work.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story, ey? So the story starts with (just read the synopsis, you idiots). What really made the story so boring is that you never feel any threat surrounding our main characters. There's a lot of build-up going on, but almost no actual conflict. The guys are mostly just fighting small fry all the time or talking about war strategy or how fascinated they are with the different technologies that were brought into this world. And god damn do they talk a lot! We get it! Y'all come from different times, y'all got different ideologies and ideas about war, just get over with it and go fight some baddies! I think there's only 2 instances where they fight some actually strong villains, but even then there's no tension because you know they're gonna win for sure and i don't really care enough about the characters to give a damn about those fights.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, here comes my favorite part: the motherloving characters (i'm not allowed to swear, but you get the point)! What makes the characters so bland and forgettable is that their range of emotions can be summed up into 3 states: grinning, grinning and more grinning. Holy smoking Jesus on a bagel do these guys grin a lot! They grin in the face of danger, they grin when they're talking, when they're sleeping, when they're pooping, like they don't give a damn about anything. And while it's cool and all to not be afraid of anything, it also becomes really stale really fast. Also, this combined with the fact that they all come from different time periods makes them completely unrelatable to the average viewer. You might find some enjoyment if you're a japanese history nerd, but since i'm not a filthy weeb like y'all, i ain't really familiar with it. Turns out Oda Nobunaga wasn't such a big deal, considering how weak and one-dimensional his character is.\\n\\n\r\nProbably an unpopular opinion, but the visuals are also mediocre. At points the show is unbarable for the eyes, and that's for a few reasons: 1. Too much dark! I think every single fight takes place at night, which not only is monotonous as hell, but also hurts my eyes. And it's not like the collor pallet is dark, it feels like the image is forcefully made to look dark with some blak clouds constantly hoveing in front of the image and blurring it. Reality check bastards: Just cause a show is forcefully made to look dark, doesn't mean it's dark. Actually, this is one of the most light-hearted shows i've seen in a while. 2. Bad direction. Lots of weird close-ups to the character's faces, and fights are often uncomprehensible. 3. Sometimes the character's faces look like they're moving independently from their bodies (pretty small detail but still bugs me). The show uses that technique of thick outlines that makes it look like a Madhouse show, but pretty much fails at bringing out the beauty of that style. Hellsing Ultimate looks 10x better even though it was made in the late 2000s.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty damn good if i do say so myself. We've got some pretty epic and stylish BGM that goes well with the tone of the show. Not to mention that opening is insane! In fact, the OP is so good that i would watch it 10 times in a row rather than watch an entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one final thing that really breaks the experience: the overusage of slapstick comedy. The show would oftenly go full chibi making you feel like you're watching something completely different, and while Hellsing had a bareable ammount of this, Drifters just has to go into full cringe mode every 3 minutes.\\n\r\n-Hey, how should we animate this part?\\n\r\n-Do a chibi comedy scene.\\n\r\n-But we had one 2 minutes ago and this scene isn't particularly fun-\\n\r\n-I SAID DO A CHIBI COMEDY SCENE!!!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, nothing really makes this show stand out from its contemporaries. Not saying it's bad or anything, there is some quality and enjoyment to be had, but considering what has been done in the past, this show is far from being up there with the big guys.",

            "content": "Drifters combines various well-known tropes, bringing famous historical figures into a fantasy world, and pitting them against eachother in all-out war. If you don't like war or watching heads roll, you're probably in the wrong place.\r\nThe animation is amazing, the soundtrack fits perfectly, the main characters (feudal Japanese warriors) have very well developed personalities, while still staying impressively faithful to how they actually were in history, and the plot illustrates an unabridged version of early-modern Japanese warfare.\r\nOverally, the anime is unbelievably excellent (for its genre, and in production quality); I'm not too keen on the details, but the studio, \"Hoods Drifters Studio\" appears to havebeen put together specifically for the production of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf anything would quickly turn you away from this anime, it would probably be the art style. You'll might recognize it from Hellsing; Hirano Kouta just loves silhouettes with one glowing eye and comical polygon forms, among other things, including the characters' facial designs. Aside from that, this anime gets as bloody and gorey as you'd expect to see in war, and doesn't try to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt can get quite chaotic, but it fits the frequent, chaotic battles, and it feels like no effort was spared in bringing these scenes to life; definitely a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI can't express in words how I feel about this anime using a band that can ACTUALLY SPEAK ENGLISH for the OP, but it's an insanely good feeling. (Also love Kurosaki Maon) The opening and ending were just amazing, and perfectly fit this anime's romantic depiction of undisguised, hellish war.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting... Was mostly good, but it sometimes got too into a character's particular speech pattern and sounded stale (assuming you're watching the sub, and that you pay attention to speech patterns).\\n\\n\r\nOutside of that, certain soundtracks might have been slightly overused, but it's not too noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThough some might be disappointed in which historical figures were used, and how influential/amazing they were, remember that it's Japanese anime, and that the creator is Japanese. I think it was the right choice to focus on the Japanese that are within the writer's realm of knowledge/expertise. It's clear that the historic figures used were meant to be faithful to the originals, and the anime includes very accurate references to their knowledge, tactics, and experiences.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it's quite nice to see an anime that doesn't bullshit away from actual history (when using historical figures), or bullshit some sort of power that comes from their character (Okay, Drifters does bullshit some powers, but at least they're less bullshit and make decent sense).\\n\\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have is a lack of characterization for side characters, who are oversimplified, and the ones that aren't historical figures, who barely get any attention at all. (A bit wasteful towards the fantasy setting, I think)\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nThe anime starts off a bit slow as it introduces the characters, and the \"humor\" moments can be painful to watch, but it quickly picks up after the 2nd episode. Some people might be bored by the logistics aspect in the anime, but that IS a part of warfare, and personally, I'm glad they don't leave that out. (It's like watching someone place their trap card, instead of the trap card appearing out of nowhere)\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is quite good\u2014it doesn't try to fill/waste time or contrive stupid cliffhangers or deus ex machinas\u2014because there's they're confident that they have enough legitimate, real plot content to keep the audience interested. There's actually a logical flow to the plot (so far, this season).\\n\\n\r\nYou actually need quite a bit of knowledge of Japanese history, military history, history in general, and Japanese culture to fully understand, notice and appreciate... Tons of things in things, from the characters' behavior, tactics, foreshadowing, to the flow of the plot itself. So yeah, keep that in mind and maybe have google ready.",

            "content": "Drifters - \"Battle in a brand new world war.\"\r\nThat could be all I need to write since, as far as I've seen, the show has lived up to that thesis grandly.\u00a0\r\nBut lets talk about it a little more just for giggles.\r\nThis show was a bit of a wildcard for me personally, given that I haven't read the manga or seen either of the directors crowning achievements (Hellsing and the latest iteration of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure), but after the synopsis piqued my interest, and the Promotional Video's came out, I was sold. Further Drifters was produced by a studio that has not been responsible for any...respectable, none the less epic or badass shows that I am aware of. While avoiding either spoiling anything important or going over things you should already know (from reading the MAL synopsis), I will share my thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nFor Animation -\u00a0\\n\r\nDrifters does not disappoint in most areas, and definitely not its main animation style and fight scenes. For the most part it has managed to keep CG at a minimum, avoiding the usage of hideous clones or terrible blends of hand-drawn and computer-assisted animation in favor of a uniquely beautiful style that you must see to appreciate (and yes, you do get used to it after the first few seconds). The only blow against this otherwise stellar track record is its usage of \"Chibi\" or an almost cutesy style during purely comedic moments. I believe that this contrasts rather sharply with the extremely epic and, for the most part, serious feel of the show, however; like the overall animation style, you do get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound -\u00a0\\n\r\nThis is one area are where the overwhelmingly positive influence of Hellsing (so I hear, no pun intended) comes in very clearly. In a word, it rocks. After the first episode finished, and I heard the opening for the first time, in addition to several other background tunes that were especially good, I had no doubt that I was in good hands with regard to the sound department.\\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that it was only a week later that I learned that the song I had heard was not the opening - it was the ending, and I had been fooled by how epic it was into thinking it was the opening. I later found out the opening was done by an American band from Detroit; it's only gotten better from there.\\n\\n\r\nFor story -\u00a0\\n\r\nThe story of this show is fairly straight forward; a vast array of differing people from all across history and the world (but mostly Japan), are summoned into a parallel universe at the moment of their deaths. Here they must fight likewise summoned enemies to save the world from destruction. This simplicity may bother you, but at the same time the show really doesn't try to sell itself as anything more, intellectually, than a truly epic \"battle in a brand new world war\". Almost like a weirder Lord of the Rings. If you're looking for intellectual stimulation, you may be disappointed (so far.)\\n\\n\r\nFor Characters -\u00a0\\n\r\nMost of the characters that have been introduced so far are interesting in their own ways, even if they are a bit flat at first, but they do not fail to intrigue and amuse, particularly as personalities from wildly different eras and cultures clash. I hope that as the series progresses we will get more character depth, but know that with the size of the cast they are juggling and the type of show this is (read epic badass gore-fest with a side of comedy and awesome), this area may be somewhat limited.  One solid negative for the show is the excessively and unnecessarily gay Count St. Gemi\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict -\u00a0\\n\r\nI love the show so far, and eagerly await the second season.  Even if only as a adrenaline-spiked thunderously epic bloodbath, Drifters was immensely entertaining and extremely funny, mostly through how seriously its characters take themselves, even when they're in ridiculous situations - such as fighting medieval nazis with the help of dwarves and elves to overthrow an empire created by drifter Adolf Hitler - cause yes that's how they roll.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to hate this show however it would be for one of three reasons:\\n\r\nOn the one hand, it could be dragged down by an accumulation of weirdness (see Hitler and his EXTREMELY gay nobles), along with the slapstick Chibi scenes, but I don't think that's terribly likely.\\n\\n\r\nOr the lack of in-depth plot and character development might bother you.\\n\\n\r\nThe final danger however I cannot speak of directly, since I promised not to spoil anything, but I will say simply that it pertains to the true identity of \"the Black King\", and may end up trashing everything if my suspicion is true and they try to give it any more than passing significance. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now; enjoy the slaughter!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Despite others saying that Drifters is overrated and is given to much praise, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that it easily caught a lot of attention, deriving popularity, and put off a show that greatly satisfies the audience. To be honest, I find the show to be quite a long shot from being a masterpiece but it sure was entertaining in a higher level, and that alone could prove that it deserves what it has now.\r\nLet\u2019s start with the story. One of the strength of this anime is its interesting background which, aside from using historical facts, combines a very dark theme with conceptsof fantasy that stirs up the viewers\u2019 interest. Simply put, the plot is intriguing enough to make someone stick throughout the entire series without a thought of dropping it or even finding it to be boring. On the other hand, I have to point out that despite the eye candy story it is, it actually lacks depth. The show doesn\u2019t really provide too much thought provoking ideas and concepts \u2013 it is just entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, well, are not something to invest on, not yet. Yes, some of the characters have qualities that well suit the whole concept but somehow, almost all of them are flat characters \u2013 lacking depth and not entirely close to real. Their personalities and characteristics are greatly limited to their role \u2013 which is to fight. There isn\u2019t much development that happened between the characters throughout the show and there isn\u2019t much background either. Adding to that, the characters were only supporting objects to move the story.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point you may have already thought that Drifters was really that bad and only led to a letdown, but that\u2019s not the case at all. Art. Drifter\u2019s art style is equally the strongest point of this show with its entertainment/enjoyment factor. Even a single glimpse of the show is more than enough to lure you into it. If the story itself is already dark, then it\u2019s not even half of art\u2019s portrayal from the slightest shade of a shadow to the curvature of every evil grin. Of all other anime, the Drifters may have the most accurate embodiment of the story with its visual \u2013 if not too much. In terms of the music, I couldn\u2019t say less that it improves the vibe of the show and very well complements with the other elements.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the enjoyment. This is by the most redeeming quality of the show that made it stand out \u2013 of course, with the support of the previous elements discussed. Action, action, and more action, that\u2019s basically the surface of this anime but it\u2019s more to it than that. The events of the show is made brilliantly as it does not only give the audience something to decide whether they like it or not but something they will eventually like. That being said, most of the action sequence were made to address a person\u2019s best kept personality or behavior and the anime recognizes them very well. What does that supposed to mean? Well you may notice that a variety of immorality is shown, namely violence, lust, greed and others \u2013 but that\u2019s only one way to look at it. The action sequence is also recognizably exemplar with the way everything moves from the inanimate objects to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWith everything at hand, I have concluded that this anime is not overrated at all and despite its flaws, it still has something to offer and is definitely worthwhile watching. Regardless, more is expected of the show in its upcoming sequel and hopefully this time, it will carefully divert its attention to working on the characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, yes, I'm definitely in the minority here, but I REALLY didn't enjoy this anime. I should've seen the signs when it looked like a serious show, but had a 'comedy'-tag - a combination that almost never works \u2013 but here we are. \r\nFor now, I'll start with the things I liked about this anime... if only because getting through those is a LOT quicker, lol.\r\nFirst off, I have to admit, Drifters occasionally had some pretty decent and interesting strategies & tactics in its battles. For example in one instance towards the middle, Nobunaga ordered the elves that they were trying to save to dumpthe corpses they had from the fight before into their well and then run before the incoming troops of their enemy arrived. In case you don't know much about war-tactics: Throwing corpses into a well poisons the water inside, obviously making it undrinkable. This means that troops who want to use the village to refill their supplies and occupy the place can't do so, as the sole source of water is completely unusable. It's a standard tactic, aye, but I was still impressed to see it in use, as it showed that whoever made the manga this is based on had at least a basic understanding of war-tactics.\\n\r\nAdditionally, I think that the action-scenes themselves were pretty well handled. They weren't as flashy and clever as JoJo's nor were they as exciting as Rakudai Kishi's, but they were definitely better than the action-scenes in the majority of action anime I've seen. There was just something about the MC slicing up multiple bad guys that was actually somewhat fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of 'fun to watch', another thing I actually liked about this show was that it featured an actual Gatling Gun. Yes, I know, that's a weird thing to be excited about, but Mini-guns (and their ancestors, the Gatling Guns) are amongst the very few guns I actually like and they are almost never get featured in anything, so not only seeing the original GG, but also having it presented rather historically accurate was quite something for me. A very personal point, yes, but I think it still counts.\\n\r\nThe last thing I actually liked about this show was its Opening. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this show had one of the coolest openings of the last year. I actually went out of my way to search for the opening on YT to listen to it occasionally, because it's really that good.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's where the pleasantries end. If you think that this sounds like a pretty interesting anime based on what you've read so far, don't worry, that's gonna change in just a minute.\\n\r\nLet's start with the thing I hated the most about this anime: Its absolutely godawful attempts at Comedy. I'm fking serious. I don't think I've ever seen an anime where literally every single joke bombed completely. Every single time this anime felt like it was getting too decent, it decided to go into a completely terrible alternative art-style and make some of the characters perform the most tedious boke/tsukkommi routines I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Not to mention that even IF the jokes had been successful, they STILL would've been out of place, as there's very few ways to NOT make jokes seem OOP within a serious war setting. I honestly have NO idea why Drifters didn't just stay serious the entire time, as those were the times where this anime was actually bearable... most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I want to talk about is the Art-style of this show. And I know, I've already said how horrible the 'joke-art-style' looked, but the one for the serious parts was actually also not something I enjoyed. Yes, it was unique and probably took a lot of effort, but that still doesn't change the fact that I thought that it looked... sub-par. Maybe it's because I'm a spoiled KyoAni fanboy, but I really could not get myself to accept the art in this anime. I've HEARD that it looks a lot like Hellsing Ultimate (which I can neither confirm nor debunk, as I haven't watched HU), so I suppose if you've liked the art in Hellsing, then you can completely ignore what I just said, lol.\\n\r\nNext up is the character development in this anime... or rather the lack there of. Seriously, the only one with any personality in that bunch seemed to be Nobunaga himself and Saint-Germi. The rest of them seemed to either be one-dimensional warmongers (like the MC himself) or completely lacked any personality or presence whatsoever (like Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, who was part of the main cast... and completely and utterly personality-less.) Probably the most vexing example of a lack of character development was with what might possibly be the main villain: 'The Black King.' (one of those titles right out of the 'generic villain name'-book). He was shown multiple times over the course of season one, yet I have no fking idea what he's supposed to be like.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us straight into the next point of criticism: the fact that the villain of the series was never characterized whatsoever. It is no secret that it's tough to hate a villain that you've never even seen do anything bad and of whom you've only seen a couple glimpses, which is why the most interesting villains are the ones that have a lot of presence like Yoshikage Kira (JoJo) or Handsome Jack (Borderlands 2). Hence it was rather confusing to see that the main villain of this series (who I THINK is the Black King... he's the only one who even came close to being one at least) was content with just sitting off-screen for the majority of the show, quietly minding his own business and who only did anything at the very end of season one... and even then, he didn't show up himself , but instead he sent an army of foot soldiers to deal with the army of the protagonists. IMO, that guy was one of the biggest failures of an antagonist I've ever seen, rivaling even the teacher from Boku dake ga inai machi.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of character development COULD'VE been fixed, had they just not thrown in some characters for one, maybe two episodes before never bringing them up again. Seriously, just take a look at the 'characters' page of this anime for yourself. It should be obvious that with such a huge cast, it's impossible to characterize each and every one of them to a satisfying extend, so why did they insist on introducing such a pile of them. For some of them, I don't even know what their role was supposed to be, because they were introduced as if they were gonna be important, literally did one thing and then fked off into nothingness. Prime example: Zero-pilot Kanno Naoshi. He SEEMED like he could've been a really interesting addition to the party, not only because he came from a much more modern era than the rest of the cast but also because he was one of the few people that actually had a character. Which is why his share of screentime still baffles me: he appeared, shot down a dragon, crashed with his plane... and literally the only time he appeared after that was a couple episodes later where he was shown having started living inside of the crashed plane. That was it. I'm still not sure whether he was supposed to be a more important character who just got cut or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing on the chopping block is the cliffhanger ending that this anime had. Because of my attempt to keep things spoiler-free, I'm not gonna go too in-depth, but here's what I will say: the first season of this anime basically ended with the protagonists and their army getting ready to defeat the Black King, but before literally anything of the sorts actually happened. I hate cliffhanger endings just as much as the next guy, so I am obviously pissed when an anime uses its main antagonist as the sequel-hook. However, seeing as how a 2nd season got confirmed right as the first one ended, I am willing to not see that point as harsh as I would normally.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, we've got the point where I almost dropped the anime outright. In episode 4, the protagonist's group, supported by the male elves they freed, march towards the castle in which the local bad guy had... basically kidnapped the female population of the elven village. They find out that the women had been locked into the castle's tower, and upon arriving there, they see that the guards of the castle had been repeatedly raping the elven women. Pretty much the ONLY reason why I didn't just drop the entire anime at that point (as my very personal opinion is that rape is the one thing that should never be happening) was because I was hoping that the guards would all be killed in the most visceral ways possible in the next episode (which only sorta happened). And before anyone jumps at me to say that 'it was obvious' and that 'it was a means of making you hate the bad guys', I would like to point towards an anime that handled a very similar situation (man kidnaps the female population of a settlement and locks them into the giant place he lives in) very differently and a lot 'better': Hitsugi no Chaika. In that show, it basically played out like this: the antagonist of that arc was a man whose 'hobby' was to slice up women and he was using the women he kidnapped as his 'test subjects'. It was a set-up that was still really effective at making you hate that guy, but it completely avoided making me hate the anime itself. So there you go, there was definitely an alternative way to handle the situation.\\n\\n\r\nLast up, there are two things I want to talk about about the archery in this anime. I am aware that these are, once again, points that might be completely irrelevant to you, but I still consider them important enough to include.\\n\r\nFirstly: Fire arrows. Jesus fking Christ, when are people finally going to stop using fire arrows in their works if they have NO idea how they work?? If I got 5 cents every time somebody used them completely unrealistically, I could run my own 'Say NO to fire arrows' ad-campaign. In Drifters in particular, the fact that they were used this weirdly is even more interesting, as this anime tried to be realistic in its usage of weaponry.\\n\r\nThe first time fire arrows showed up in this anime, I was actually somewhat impressed to see that they were used in one of the only two situations where people DID actually use them in the middle ages: during a siege. Sure, the effectiveness of those arrows was still ridiculous (real fire arrows had a chance of ~2% to set something aflame, here it seemed more like 98%), but it was something at least. However, the second time they were used it was back to good ol' 'this is NOT how they work. This is not how ANYTHING works'. For some stupid reason, the makers of this thought that it was a reasonable idea to have people use fire arrows... during a horse chase. Which would've worked, were it not for two simple things... a) No and b) NO!... but seriously, that part was fking stupid. There was no way for the horse-riders to set their arrows on fire, which means that there was no way to even HAVE fire arrows in that situation... and using them while riding a horse also seems like the best way to get yourself killed, so yeah. Stupid on every single level, which, sadly, seems to be the norm for fire arrows in anything from anime to movies to games. (for further knowledge about fire arrows, watch this 'ere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTd_0FRAwOQ )\\n\\n\r\nAnd secondly... Why in the name of god did the professional archer in this anime hold his bow sideways on multiple occasions?? Doing so is pretty much the most sure-fire way to show your enemy that you have NO idea what the fk you're doing, as you pretty much sacrifice a large portion of your range and power for nothing. Every time the archer-guy held his bow that way, I started to think whether I should laugh or cry about that... and settled for being pissed off.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all: this anime was, all things considered, pretty fking bad in my opinion. My advice would be to just watch the Opening ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYJxbkEItQ ) until you're sick of it (which might take a while, as it's really good) and just give the anime itself a miss. You'll do yourself a favor.",

I am one of those, or was.\r\nI got to say, Drifters was one of the moderatly anticipated shows of this season. But it could only go so far to prove those expectations true.\r\n--Plot--\r\nThe background plot is a clich\u00e9ed \"person from our world in someone else's one\". The difference being, all those guys are famous bigwigs over here, all of them got their name in history, and they come from different historical times. So it could be a Western-samurai-WWII with lasers genre(okay, without lasers, for the time being). It is pretty chaotic by itself, and lots of fun, but could be more well developed. But, as it seems they are going to produce a new season, there is still hope. 6\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nIt sucks. I can only imagine that they did this on purpose to be this bad. But purposely or not, it still sucks. Looks like some 5 year-old's drawing (okay, good enough for a fiver). The battles get a bit better, but not that much to save this from a 5.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were captivating, I found myself singing the OP when I was unaware of it. The characters had amazing voice actors, which were emotional when they needed to (which means, almost all the time). Honorable mention to a new language created. It is a shame that the art could not hold a candle to these actors. 8\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThey are emotional. Very. Most of the time this show is a screaming hell of people trying to be understood by the loudest-is-best rule. That aside, I found myself really liking the characters, be it good or bad guys. They express emotions, are a tad bit crazy and love to pick a fight. Whatelse could we expect from a crazy show? 8\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoymeny--\\n\r\nThis could be a much better show, if not for the shallow plot (which can get better) and the crappy animation (which won't get better). I found myself expecting the show every week, hoping for it to start. Seeing the art got me a bit sad but, even so, this is yet a good show. 7\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nIt gets a new season. As my expectations for the show were a bit high, and failed, this review may get a little biased towards my initial opinion of the show. But it is a good anime for all that matters. If you can deny the animation, this will be lots of fun. If you, like me, cannot, it is still fun.",

In the end, its an acceptable action-oriented anime that treats its plot as superfluous.\r\nStory: \r\nWho cares? It's some angry Shimazu man paired with Oda Nobunaga and a Japanese folk hero who desire to kick ass. They go around \"restructuring\" the medieval empire of a certain Second World War Axis leader with a mustache. They later meet another presumably famous Japanese folk hero who tells them that bad people from history are trying to destroy theworld. Also, there are elves, dwarves, and dragons.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nThe style used in Drifters is incredibly unique, and it's well used, especially in action scenes.

All of the characters are caricatures of their real life selves, as you might expect, and everything they do is exaggerated in the extreme. This is a no thinking required show, there are no complex relationships here. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDrifters thrives on its violence, and dies on its story. The ultimate success or failure of the series rests on whether or not they try to thrust a convoluted plot onto what needs to be a straightforward, violent, affair.

            "content": "Drifters is a fantasy, alternate history series adapted from a manga of the same name, written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano, who\u2019s the original creator of the Hellsing series. It is directed by Suzuki Kenichi, who\u2019s directed such anime as Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. One can tell that the series would involve nothing short of brutal, stylized action and Drifters meets this expectation. However, it offers a lot more than that.\r\n[A different take on the \u2018Isekai\u2019 sub-genre]\r\nThe Japanese word \u2018isekai\u2019 can be translated directly to mean \u2018different world\u2019 and is a sub-genre of fantasy series that involves one or many characters transported to another world, oftenthrough magical means. The plot of such series revolves around the characters\u2019 struggles as they try to leave the world which is unfamiliar to them; a typical human reaction. From the first few scenes, Drifters is immediately identified as a fantasy show of the \u2018Isekai\u2019 sub-genre as the main characters is sent into a stock fantasy world, replete with demi-humans like elves. But the similarities end there.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few stark differences between the nature of the \u2018passengers\u2019, the ones being transported, in Drifters and the ones in regular \u2018Isekai\u2019 shows. One of the easiest differences to spot is that the Drifters are historical characters unlike the more modern protagonists in regular \u2018Isekai\u2019. Another key difference are the ages and statuses of the Drifters. Where most Isekai shows involve young adults, usually high-schoolers, lacking in essential more survival experience, the Drifters are full-fledged adults and warriors who\u2019ve survived many battles. This attribute of the Drifters (and the Ends who\u2019re the series antagonists), leads to the most profound difference between the series and a regular \u2018Isekai\u2019: the characters do not seek to escape the different world. They seek to conquer it.\\n\\n\r\nAs early as the first episode, the primary Drifters, composed of Oda Nobunaga, Shimazu Toyohisa and Nasu Yoichi, begin working on plans to challenge the human Empire of Orte, the current government. On the other end, the Ends advance their army against the same Empire for the purpose of liberating all monsters in the alternate world. There is little talk of escape; instead, the Drifters utilize their knowledge and experience to transform the alternate world. Not only do they shake up the government, but they introduce warfare as they\u2019ve experienced it. This change is made possible due to the strength of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n[Stock action characters with the rare exceptions]\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the Drifters  (and Ends) as the stock, one-dimensional characters often found in action shows; the characters fill out archetypal roles and march towards their respective goals with a trail of epic battles in their wake. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it often makes for exciting shows and Drifters is no exception. Drifters does try to make its characters more interesting by giving them additional attributes with weak relations to their main skills. Toyohisa is the mindless warrior who only seeks to remove his enemy\u2019s head at any cost but will uphold the warrior code of his time. Yoichi is the quintessential archer who\u2019s courageous enough to fight in the open if need be. Nobunaga is the brilliant mastermind who fawns over future technology. The supporting characters and the Ends simply play out their roles with the exception of Olminu who begins as a wide-eyed junior magician from the Octobrists but grows into a brilliant support for the Drifters.\\n\\n\r\nOne major issue with the characters in Drifters is the screen time given some of the supporting cast and the Ends. The Ends are only seen during seen during their encounters with the Drifters and in a few brief moments. An improvement would have been to have some development of the Ends during the moments when the Drifters prepare for battle and in lieu of the comedy (which I\u2019ll get to later). The mysterious characters of Murasaki and Easy who\u2019re responsible for transporting the Drifters and Ends to the world are virtually invisible in the show. It\u2019s understandable that the overall runtime for the show makes it difficult to develop most of the characters equally.\\n\\n\r\n[Gritty, stylized art]\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first scene, we\u2019re introduced to the gritty art that fuels Drifters take on Isekai. The characters and background are done in dark, desaturated colours that are in sharp contrast to the usual colourful scenes of fantasy shows; the blood has a dark red sheen and has fluid animation. The characters look grim and constantly wear a serious look even when they\u2019re smiling. The show doesn\u2019t hold back on its style.\\n\\n\r\nA remarkable aspect to the art of Drifters is the character design, both for the historical characters and the indigenes of the world. Their representations were accurate for the most part with a few additions. I especially liked Nobunaga\u2019s design because of the eyepatch which made him stand out. The indigenes are designed as would characters in a medieval fantasy setting with the exception of the Octobrists, who have unique attires.\\n\\n\r\nA major gripe I had with the character art is that they had similar faces and expressions. This was especially noticed in the males; they all seemed to have the same soulless eyes and menacing smile.\\n\\n\r\n[Forgettable soundtrack]\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Drifters was a major miss for me as there weren\u2019t any memorable soundtracks despite the numerous battle scenes. And whatever soundtracks played were often drowned out by the screaming characters. On the other hand, I enjoyed the opening theme a lot and often sang along. The ending theme wasn\u2019t as inspirational.\\n\\n\r\n[Dreadful comedy]\\n\r\nDrifters is a thoroughly enjoyable show and was one of my favourites for the fall season of 2016. My bias towards the fantasy genre made it a must-watch but it exceeded my expectations with its  interesting characters and their lofty ambition to rule their world instead of escape it. The use of historical characters had me returning to Wikipedia with each introduction, helping me pick up a bit of Japanese history (mostly). The art was a refreshing change from the cute, fluffy and colourful art of the various \u2018otome\u2019 shows during the season. These great aspects of the show helped offset the forgettable music and the awful comedy. The comedy in Drifters starts out as horrible and often interrupted the better moments of the show. The change in art style coupled with the dry jokes were huge misses. But I soon got used to it and sometimes welcomed it as it showed another side to the characters. Perhaps it was because most of the comedy concerned Nobunaga, who was my favourite character. It was a part of the show I can\u2019t say I completely enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of fantasy shows, I would recommend Drifters, if only for the interesting plot and art style.",

If the plot was changed especially in regards to the amount of drifters and who the drifters were it could easily have been a great show if not a masterpiece. \r\nThe plots real weakness lies in the lack of Drifters, the problem in and of itself or rather the potential being wasted is most likely due to the author of Drifters being far too centered on Japan and Japanese history while being less knowledgeable about non-Japanese history whichis why characters outside of Japan are lacking to say the least. I would list tons of generals, commanders, kings and so on that I think would have been amazing additions to make Drifters an exciting anime, but the list would simply be too long. Even if we skip all the lesser known generals there are an abundance of famous ones that are simply left out which in my opinion is a complete and utter waste. \\n\\n\r\nShort lift of possible additions; Timur, Genghis Khan, Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, Attila the hun, Qin Shi Huang, Charlemagne, Saladin, Suleiman the magnificent, Wu Qi and Napoleon\\n\\n\r\nJust by seeing these names most people will know the amount of potential wasted by simply leaving them out of the story. Naoshi Kanno was also used, but if you were to use a ww2 pilot that died during ww2 one of the optimal choices would be Otto Kittel which scored a total of 267 aerial victories meaning he's one of the most successful fighter pilots in history compared to Kannos 25. If you absolutely wanted a Japanese fighter pilot that died during ww2 your obvious choice would be Hiromichi Shinohara which sat Japanese records having shot down 11 planes in a single day, author please. \\n\\n\r\nOnto a minor issue is regarding to the portrayal of certain characters and Rasputin is by far the most obvious. If you saw a picture of Rasputin in drifters and you were asked which historical figure it is there's no fucking way anyone would ever guess Rasputin apart from getting it on a wild guess. Surely the Japanese can't hate beards so much to the extent that they're unwilling to create fully bearded characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe last matter would be the personality of the characters themselves. Digging deeper into history and figure out what kind of people they truly were and how they acted would have been better in addition to something that would have made it possible for all of them to communicate with each other efficiently. Some lines in foreign languages wouldn't have been a bad thing either if they managed to get the voice actors to actually pronounce foreign languages properly. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story in and of itself is an isekai I also believe it would have been much better without magic. Seeing a contest of raw skill and strategy between famed generals throughout history would have been a much better option. Although the combat still would have been in the realms of fantasy it would have been much better this way. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end the story ends up at a wasted potential/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were both fine, although you can clearly see the similarity to Hellsing as the author is the same, but I don't think the art fits as well with Drifters as it did with Hellsing.\\n\\n\r\nMassively wasted potential/10",

            "content": "Drifters is a science fiction, fantasy action, adventure manga written by Hirano Kouta. You may know him as the writer of Hellsing. At the tail end of 2016, an anime adaptation of Drifters aired. It was brought to us by Hoods Entertainment. A studio that I've never reviewed an anime by before. So, is Drifters a series that's worth looking into? \r\nStory:\r\nAfter the battle of Sekigahara, Shimazu Toyohisa finds himself in a strange, light corridor filled with doors. A spectacled man gestures and he gets pulled into one of them and directly into another world. He finds himself meeting Oda Nobunaga and Nasu Yoichi, twomen who were recorded as having died before his time. It turns out that in this world of elves, dwarves, halflings and men, certain people from our world are being sent just before their deaths by the spectacled fellow in an effort to preserve the world from beings called \u201cEnds,\u201d who are also comprised of famous figures from our world, and their Black King. Shimazu and his new found companions, unaware of the ends and their threat, decide to lead a rebellion to save the elves from their forced servitude by a large, human nation. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with the series goes back to our old friend, tone. This is one of those series that, in one vein, has really over the top violence and humour and, in an entirely different vein, tries to tackle some serious subject matter. Notably rape. Consequently, its handling these serious subjects for all of five minutes before going back to the absurdity and never mentioning them again comes across as more than a little tasteless. Although, in all fairness, there are only a few scenes like that. The ending is also pretty unsatisfying. It's all setting up for the next series and, while it does have a degree of closure for one of the major plot threads, it doesn't even bother giving you a climactic battle with any finality. For that matter, there's very little aftermath. Certainly not enough to give us as the viewers a sense of what came from the whole thing beyond the very obvious.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, I do like the concept of two opposing entities each scouring our history for  figures they can use against one another. The series also does quite well when it's staying in its comfort zone of over the top violence mixed with humour. It also does do a good job at keeping your interest since it has a lot of interwoven plot threads. \\n\\n\r\nLet's discuss a very mixed element with the series. The fluctuating complexity. We see our protagonists face the Orte Empire, a very uncomplex fascist nation. Right down to being founded by one of history's most brutal monsters. They also face the Ends, who are heavily indicated to have more going for them than the initial impression indicates. We also  have the Count of Saint Germain. Initially, he appears to be the gay stereotype that seems to pop up in anime because \u201che's gay it's funny.\u201d However, there are several ways in which he goes beyond that and becomes a surprisingly complex character. And the anime is full of elements that seem shallow but get built on into something more and others that are just shallow\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, at this juncture, are more potentially complex than they are actually complex. There are some, our main trio of heroes and the Count, who move beyond their archetypes in some ways. There are other Drifters and several characters among the Ends with potential, usually due to some connection with our heroes, but without anything tangible yet. The characters who are neither are just universally bland. Including the Count's subordinates who are just the gay stereotypes. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bit mixed mainly because there are two art styles in the series. There's the \u201ccomedic\u201d art style, which looks lazily rushed and like the artists just didn't care. Then there's the art style they use the rest of the time and it actually does look pretty great. The action sequences are fluid and intense. The character designs are detailed, although it should be noted that, in a bout of uncreative nonsense, the elves all look very similar as do the members of certain other fantasy races. The backgrounds are very nicely detailed under the normal style and basically non-existent with the comedic. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is similar to the art in that it has two modes. There's the over the top comedic mode where everyone sounds like seven year olds shouting the lines of their school play and there's the regular mode which sounds pretty good. Nakamura Yuuichi, Uchida Naoya & Saiga Mitsuki all do very well at those points. The music was composed by Ishii Yasushi and Matsuo Hayato. Matsuo also worked on music for the first series of JoJo and Magic Knight Rayearth. All in all, it's all right. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nAside from Germain and his companions, there's a unit of muscular gay guys. Several men express attraction to Yoichi and there's one line that may hint that Anastasia has a thing for Jeanne. It's ambiguous. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSo, how does Drifters hold up when you factor in its good ideas with what it executes well, its tonal problems, its vast gaps in quality for both the art and voice acting, its inconsistent complexity and all of that? Well, I would say it's all right. Honestly, it had the potential to be really good. For that matter, it could pretty easily become something really good, but as is, the first series has quite a few issues that hold it back. If you like the concept, you can handle the dip in quality for the big comedic bits and you can forgive the occasional tonal awkwardness, you might enjoy it. For myself, I'll give it a 6/10. Next week I'll look at Karas.",

            "content": "Drifters is a seinen title based on the manga by Kouta Hirano. The story is set in a medieval fantasy world where both humans and demi humans (such as elves and dwarves) live. This world is soon greeted by two sets of foreigners from the real world - \u201cDrifters\u201d and \u201cEnds\u201d. Both groups are comprised of historical figures tied to war or a fight of their time. They are taken before their death by one of two mysterious people. A man named Murasaki chooses fighters for his Drifters, while a girl named Easy picks candidates for her Ends. What sets them apart are their givenroles in this story. The Ends seek out the destruction of humankind and the Drifters are assigned to stop the Ends from their slaughter.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name implies, the show\u2019s perspective is from the eyes of the Drifters. Though there is a fair amount of fighters with this title, the anime focuses on three in particular. Toyohisa Shimazu is the appointed leader of the group and is a classic warrior type, whose battle-minded ways make him great in the fights but a bit barbaric outside of them. Nobunaga Oda is a crafty middle-aged man, dubbed the \u201cDevil King of the Sixth Heaven\u201d who doesn\u2019t fight as much as come up with strategy to make the Drifters team a fighting threat. Finally, there\u2019s Yoichi Nasu, a bishonen archer whose aim is as good as his looks. The anime follows these three as they work their way up to be a formidable foe, from freeing demi humans from their serfdom and slavery to coming up with cunning plans in the midst of a fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Drifters isn\u2019t too far removed from one of Hirano\u2019s previous works, Hellsing. Hellsing mainly attracted an audience by blending its dark supernatural characters with hyper violence, occasionally sprinkling in historical references. Drifters changes this mixture \u2013 it still has the violence and supernatural elements, but it grounds itself more so in the history. Despite being a fantasy world, it feels more down-to-earth than other shows with this title. The Octobrists are a magician organization that wishes for the Drifters support to defeat the Ends. Though they are magicians, they are only seen using basic spells called \u201ccharms\u201d. Their communication, though much more advanced than the setting, relies on a magic sphere on two users\u2019 ends, acting more like a phone than anything magical. Though what we see is limited, it shines due to how it\u2019s used. Toyohisa and the gang use the Octobrists\u2019 magic in interesting ways to serve their needs, showing how easily they adapt to foreign concepts. Spells the Octobrists thought of only for defense are used offensively to surprise and crush the enemy. Even the communication orb was used primarily as a \u201crecording diary\u201d before the Drifters came along! I prefer this creative use of magic over the typical mage/wizard roles seen in fantasy shows.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say this show is free from absurd magic. The Ends are characters that have \u201cgiven up their humanity\u201d for strong magical power. This is seen in Jeanne D\u2019 Arc, who has incredible fire magic, and Toshizou, who uses ghost warriors to assist him in battle. Most interesting is the dreaded Black King, who has power over cellular replication that can heal/hurt single targets almost instantly. What makes these powers exciting is how they\u2019ve been given to the villains, not the heroes. Wits dominate fights against the Ends and seeing how the Drifters turn the tide in battle is a lot of fun to watch. Fans of JoJo Part 2: Battle Tendency will adore these fights, as Toyohisa parallels Joseph Joestar. There\u2019s nothing in Drifters that will make you rethink battles, but there are a few surprises that kept me wanting to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nDrifters has an interesting lot of characters, which is its strength and one of its problems. I find there are too many of them for this short first season and they didn\u2019t need to be here this early on. Characters like Butch Cassidy and Naoshi Kanno really had no reason being here. They may have turned the tide in the battle they were present in, minor as it was, but they\u2019re never really seen beyond this. I\u2019m sure all the Drifters will meet up eventually to take down the Black King\u2019s army, but they didn\u2019t need to be present at this time. This time could\u2019ve been use for more focus on the main trio, in particular Yoichi. Despite being labeled as a main character, Yoichi doesn\u2019t get a whole lot of time or emphasis compared to Oda or Toyohisa. I saw Toyohisa\u2019s warrior life in action in and outside of fights and I saw the humor mixed with dark cunning of Oda. Save for a brief moment talking to his old leader, Yoshitsune, Yoichi felt more like a strong supporting character. I hope that more insight will be given to him.\\n\\n\r\nHumor is another thing Hirano and I generally disagree on. In Hellsing, ugly chibi-looking characters would break the ice at the wrong time and would be a lot cruder than what I like. This returns in Drifters, but I find it\u2019s been toned down a bit. The toilet humor seems less prevalent in these scenes. Though one of Hannibal\u2019s first \u201cjokes\u201d is that he can\u2019t control his bladder, it\u2019s a bit more understandable as he\u2019s very old (though I still could\u2019ve done without it). The humor mainly focuses on references to Japanese war history. This isn\u2019t my strong suit, so moments like the Drifters\u2019 first meetup in Episode 1 went over my head. That said, they normally are quick off-hand jokes, so they don\u2019t fill up the show as much as they give a wink to a history loving audience.\\n\\n\r\nDrifters\u2019 art is what you\u2019d expect from Hirano. Characters have large ringed irises for eyes, thick jagged lines make their outlines, and shadows that cover their face (save for a single eye) are all present. It\u2019s a style that\u2019s distinctly his and works great for his action series. Of course, the series also includes Hirano\u2019s \u201cugly faces\u201d he uses for comedy but it\u2019s not as bad here. Maybe because there\u2019s less poop drawings or perhaps I\u2019ve grown accustomed to it. The animation team at Hoods Drifters Studio did a fair job. They use CG models at times (such as the soldiers) and it\u2019s not the most fluid, but it\u2019s not bad by any means. Sometimes it\u2019s even in their favor - I like the \u201crough sketch\u201d animatic look in the opening, more so than the cheap animation tweens that accompany it. The music of the series is upbeat rock and fits the action well. One track I like in particular starts as a flute track played through an old radio before becoming a strange Middle Eastern sounding piece. I didn\u2019t care for the \u201clazy cool\u201d vocals (with the \u201caw yeahs\u201d in the verses) and sound of the opening and I do not like Kurosaki\u2019s vocals for the ED (the acoustic guitar in the final episode was a welcome change). The seiyuus all did a fine job, though none here stood out in particular for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Drifters a 6.5/10. I didn\u2019t care too much for Hellsing, so I was surprised as to how much I liked Drifters. If you liked Hellsing, or perhaps Hirano\u2019s style in general, this is a must-watch. Those looking for a fun action series akin to JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure will also appreciate this show. Drifters is a bit fantastic in concept and occasionally campy, but it was a fun watch and I certainly wouldn\u2019t mind viewing a second season.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day!",

            "content": "Much like a beautifully wrapped Christmas present with a swarm of angry bees inside, Drifters looks fantastic but starts to get a little problematic the second you start trying to unpack it. I will elaborate as to why below, but if you are looking for a straightforward recommendation than in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and it is at the very least an entertaining viewing experience. If you liked Hellsing or other such gory, mindless, high octane romps, you will probably enjoy this too. But if you're watching it at all critically, you might find some problems.\r\nStory: Is really pretty fun and engaging.Famous figures from history are taken at the moment before their deaths and thrust into a Tolkien-esque high fantasy world inhabited with elves, dwarves, dragons, and other fantasy staples. And also by humans who, with the exception of one group of fairly annoying individuals who seem thus-far to be a semi-monastic community of stage magicians, are apparently universally racist assholes. The \"good\" ones among them are called Drifters, the \"bad\" are called Ends, and they fight each other with a blend of dumb-fun magic and militarily tactics that is very reminiscent of playing Dynasty Warriors. And in case you were wondering, Adolph Hitler is still just as much of a dickhead in any universe in which he finds himself. And there is also a portrait of him that is TERRIFYING!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Speaking of evocative visual imagery, this show has it in spades. The art design and execution is unequivocally the strongest aspect of the show. Everything is very dark and murky, and it is either washed out and lifeless or vibrant and arresting to suit the mood. The action is great and the character designs all look pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Thank God they all look great, because they are way more of a mixed bag when it comes to their characterization. The main character, Toyohisa, is a cool intense badass samurai, but he is sort of boring in the way that Superman is boring because he is pretty much invulnerable. Of the other two mains Nobunaga is actually pretty great and my favorite character on the show; he is a great blend of funny critique of Nobunaga Oda as historical figure and wacky anime guy in crazy anime world. He is clearly having a great time, which makes him fun to watch. Yoichi, the other (semi)prominent lead, is kind of just an archer who kills things with archery. Cool but vanilla.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the villains are also pretty interesting in the context of the historical figures they represented. At one point I was like \"yeah I guess Joan of Arc might be a little pissed about getting lit on fire.\" That was an entertaining tangent. The identity of the main villain will probably piss some people off a whole bunch, but I though it was a pretty neat examination of a controversial historical figure. Most I can say without unnecessary spoilers. \\n\r\nA lot of the side-characters are pretty annoying and problematic, particularly Tits Magee the world's lamest magician friend who is there to get molested and degraded and the swishy camp gay Count who is a backstabbing, manipulative, rapy, shitdumpster of a person which we know because he is gay.\\n\r\nThis character in particular was the perfect example of the biggest problem about the show for me: many of the almost constant jokes fell way flat. This one also managed to fall flat and be remarkably offensive. If he had been funny I would have probably though he was fucking fabulous. He wasn't. Instead we are just left with almost direct quote that because something is inherently wrong with homosexuals as people, it makes them A.) Want to fuck each other, and B.) be awful, awful people. Not as part of a joke. Just as a statement. That was pretty icky to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAll in all, this show feels OLD. The jokes feel old, the story is about olden times, the main cast is markedly older than the majority of anime casts, and the target audience appears to be people who like Tolkien but also really enjoy reading world history textbooks in their spare time (which is, I guess, kinda me). If you catch all the references to history, you might think its pretty funny at times. Otherwise you'll just think it looks good and has cool action. It does. Watch it if that's all you care about. I enjoyed it despite it pissing me off, albeit infrequently.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of  Kouta Hirano\u00b4s earlier work Hellsing, I was really excited to dig my teeth into his new work Drifters. I didn\u00b4t how ever have my hopes to high, due to that Hellsing Ultimate is one of my favorite shows so far, and it would be really hard to do something equally amazing. Hence it will be a lot of comparison between the two in my review. But how did \"Drifters\" delivered in my opinion? I will get down to that now.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nUnlike \"Hellsing\" the story of \"Drifters\" takes place in a fantasy world full of elf's, dwarfs, magicians, goblins andso on. The drifters are moved to this world from our own through a world-less corridor on the verge of death by a quite weird looking guy in glasses. They are all real famous historical personas (such as Oda Nobunaga, Shimazu Toyohisa, Hannibal and so on). The \"evil\" versions of the drifters is called \"ends\" and are also historical famous personas such as Jeanne d\u00c1rc, Rasputin and so on. Elf\u00b4s and dwarfs has been forced to live in slavery and oppression by the humans, and with the help of the drifters (the warroir Toyohisa, the tactician Nobunaga and sneaky Yoichi) they make their move for liberation. But the \"Ends\" and their leader The Black King has their own plan for this world and a three way war is instigated. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the layout of the story - I quite like it. It\u00b4s not the most original out there, but it\u00b4s interesting enough to keep me watching and actually care of the plot. This is just the first season so many questions will still be there in the end of this season. Like who is the Black King? What made Jeanne d\u00c1rc so evil? What Easy\u00b4s and Murasaki\u00b4s beef all about? This is questions that will not be answered in this first part. There is a heavy focus on war strategy and a lot of talk of it the show. If that stuff bores you.. well, this could be a heavy watch. I found it quite interesting due to the psychological point of view. How much of war that depends on how we play on each others emotions - it made the war scenes more realistic. And as expected of a work from  Kouta Hirano it\u00b4s a lot of violence, blood and gore. I will for shore dig into the manga now to see how this develops from here. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs of expected of an 2016 anime, the art is very good. Drifters actually got it\u00b4s own studio just to produce it - that\u00b4s say something. You can clearly see the similarities between the art in Drifters and Hellsing - especially the characters designs. I am actually quite a fan of that particular style, I was glad to see it on screen again. It\u00b4s very colorful with distinct blackened lines. The eyes and hairs of the characters are what could called a hallmark for Kouta Hirano. Some scenes can feel a bit blurry to all that is going on but hey.. War is a mayham so that didn\u00b4t bother me to much. And of course their is a couple of great action scenes. The scenery is often well drawn and the characters fits nicely in to the background.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI absolutely love the opening. I actually listen to it daily now. It\u00b4s adrenaline, funky rock song that suites the show and it\u00b4s characters very well. The ending is quite nice as well if note less original. The overall soundtrack is well suited and often manages to highlight the mood of the scene or coolness of the character in the spotlight. All music wasn\u00b4t my coop of tea, but I can see how it fits the show. I watch the dubbed and I think the VA\u00b4s mostly did a great job. I love Robert McCollum and he voices Oda Nobunaga and does it greatly. Mostly the VA\u00b4s manages to catch the essence of their character and bringing life to them. Had a slightly problem with Omis VA - she had a very squicky voice that could be hard to listen to sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s a lot of characters in Drifters, many of them appears interesting and most of them don\u00b4t get the screen time they deserve (many of the ends mostly). For the three mains they differ a bit in quality but are for shore vivid. For a 12 episode anime it\u00b4s hard for the characters to really develop, so the development is very limited. As in Hellsing most of the characters are adults, not teenagers with hormonal problems. They know what and who they are and just go from there. Toyohisa actually remained me of Eren from Attack on Titan - as he may be in he\u00b4s 30\u00b4s. Both his looks and passionate speeches was something that remained med of him (without the anger issues). Nobunaga is a coldblooded war tactician and a conqueror of land and men - it\u00b4s what he does best and advances his position with. Yoichi hasn\u00b4t had much of a background exploration and are mostly there to look very cute and blast arrows into people. Hope he\u00b4s evolves more in season two. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the side\u00b4s, its a broad variation of interesting and bland characters. I find the Ends as very interesting but as said before, very little screen time to really making them into great antagonists/villains. I slight minus for me was the lack of badass female characters (Jeane d\u00c1rc and Anastasia a aside), which Helling had loads of. Come on it\u00b4s a three way war - it is certainly room for at least one ore two. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nIt wasn\u00b4t Helling but I really enjoyed watching this piece anyway. Crazy characters, violence, liberation movements and revenge is always a winning concept for me. I watch it all in just a couple of days time and enjoyed most of it. Some of the comedy felt misplaced and some was nailed - as i most anime. For not to mention the awesome opening, It\u00b4s worth to watch by it lonesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIt was a good anime experience for shore. It didn\u00b4t bring anything new or very original to the plate, but managed to be entertaining anyway. If you like seinens/actions like Hellsing you most likely will dig this piece. I will for shore take a look where this is going. I liked the preemies and the show has potential to grow a lot and become something more.",

Sure, sometimes the jokes can be really funny, but other times, it ruins the mood.

            "content": "Drifters is the type of show that you\u2019ll quickly realize what it is from the start. Anyone familiar with Kouta Hirano (known for his work \u201cHellsing\u201d) will get a familiar vibe with the style of the series. If you fancy a fantasy story about extraordinary individuals coming together, then Drifters will be quite a treat. \r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, Drifters initially will leave the impression of a dark fantasy tale. The first few episodes easily establishes its premise as we meet the Drifters, the main protagonists of the show. They are based on historical figures who are based from their timeline.Still, throughout the series, you\u2019ll probably designate them more as anti-heroes by their actions. The primary cast composes of Shimazu Toyohisa, Oda Nobunaga, and Nasu Suketaka Yoichi. Thanks to a mysterious man named Murasaki, they are bought together to stand against evil. Against them are the Ends, characters who ironically weren\u2019t evil during their timeline. At the same time, Drifters are aided by a mysterious group of magicians known as the Octobrists. Get the idea now? Drifters is essentially a dark fantasy war that brings together history\u2019s most infamous figures into one big oddball package.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first few episodes, the show will test a viewer\u2019s patience. This is because even though the show has a dark and grim atmosphere, it also tries to sell its comedy and humor. That\u2019s right, the show adapts humor to spice up the entertainment. This can be seen as a throwback as people may not take the show seriously. However, if you can get with the momentum, then Drifters will be a pleasant surprise. Understanding the show\u2019s lore will also enhance your enjoyment of this show. To be honest, what really can draw an audience\u2019s interest is about the characters. Each of them possesses a rather intriguing personality and their roles in the story often spark curiosity. \\n\\n\r\nShimazu is the main protagonist and also leader of the Drifters. Shimazu is pretty much a natural leader as he is courageous with no fear. His charisma is also a characteristic that inspires others (such as elves) to follow up during the war. We can easily see that he is driven by determination by putting himself above others. The elves and dwarves respects him not just as a Drifter but also a friend. On the other hand, we have Oda Nobunaga. As a strategist, it\u2019s no surprise that he has a brilliant mind. However, he is also a character to be wary of even by his own allies. His sarcastic personality becomes a big joke throughout the show as he brings in the most comedy. As part of the group, Yoichi can be mistaken for a trap because of his feminine appearance. However, he is a guy to be feared when facing against his bow. Later on, we also meet others that joins in their quest as the war turns into a chaotic pandemonium.\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonists are the End. Perhaps the most mysterious and also recognizable would be the Black King. His ultimate goal is to destroy humanity and replace it with a new race in his vision. As leader of the Ends, we don\u2019t find out too much about him. This is perhaps where characterization in the show suffers a bit. We get this all mighty character that operates from the shadows yet not much is known about him, even his past. Luckily, the other Ends brings in more interest such as Easy, a young woman with odds against Murasaki. Anastasia Romanov and Joan of Arc are also ironically the villains in this show, as people may recognize them as heroines from other lores. The one noticeable trait that separates the Ends and the Drifters though is power. Ends seems to possess supernatural abilities, something that the Drifters lack. While Drifters rely on their own natural talent, weapons, and technology, Ends can perform superhuman feats. For instance, Anastasia is able to freeze others while Gilles de Rais can use inhuman strength and durability. As you may guess, the show pits them in battles between the Drifters and Ends like fate. The war itself has a purpose although everyone has their own reasons for fighting. However, it\u2019s up to the audience to decide if those are meaningful or not.\\n\\n\r\nAs I mentioned before, the show has a lot of comedy. Whether these may be character interactions or historical in-jokes, it\u2019s always there. One thing that does hold the storytelling back at times is the pacing. It seems at times, the show emphasizes a bit too much on the humor at the expense of other elements. While Oda Nobuanga is a big example of this, others such as Count Saint-Germi from the Orte Empire adds more. The buildup of the story between some episodes can also feel lacking depending on preferences. And because the series is created by Kouta Hirano, you can expect some Nazi references to be introduced as well. That\u2019s right, if you\u2019re thinking Hitler then you\u2019re correct. The show even has a bit of fantasy racism! On the other hand, do take in for granted when the action picks up. This show is no joke when it comes to making a spectacle of battles. When the pacing picks up, it\u2019s where the series really shines and will make you feel that all the buildup worth the wait. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by Hoods Entertainment, the show is pretty accurate with its manga art style. This is what impresses me a lot when I first watched this series as it\u2019s on spot, almost frame by frame for the character designs. Not to mention, both the Drifters and Ends are characterized with their badass look ranging from Shimazu\u2019s weapons to Yoichi\u2019s sharp eyes. Speaking of that, the show has a distinctive style of adapting its character features. This is especially recognized by the intimidating looks of Ends as they look convincingly menacing. The setting of the battles is also decorated with a dark fantasy look with ruins, ancient castles, etc. Add ultraviolence and minimal censorship and you get Drifters at its finest. \\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is also pretty noticeable throughout the show ranging from especially the theme songs. It\u2019s stylistic and filled with creativity. While some people may call it silly, I see it more as a expressing the show\u2019s humor and almost feels satirical. The OST and soundtrack has a hardcore instrumental tone during the battle scenes that is highly entertaining. Character voice mannerism throughout show is also noticeable even at times when the dialogues gets overly silly. Perhaps the most noticeable are those of Oda Nobunaga mainly for his commanding voice. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished watching Drifters, I was not only impressed by the overall content but also for its ability to entertain. If you have a sense of humor, then this will definitely be worth every minute of time. If you take it too seriously though, then Drifters will probably feel more like a chore to watch. I would definitely recommend Drifters even if you\u2019re not a fan of the author\u2019s works. I can\u2019t say this enough but Hirano\u2019s ability to express his ideas are just too damn entertaining to evade.\\n",

            "content": "Before starting my review, I would like to note that almost every character of Drifters is a historical figure, so I would highly recommend you to use Google from time to time. Drifters uses American historical figures, Japanese historical figures, French historical figures, Russian historical figures, and others. Anyways, let us start.\r\n Drifters: Battle in a Brand-new World War, Drifters, or\u30c9\u30ea\u30d5\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba, is a fantasy, alternate history Japanese manga written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano. The manga started serialization in Shounen Gahosha magazine, Young King Ours, on April 30, 2009. It received an anime adaptation, which was announced in May, 2015 and aired between October 7,2016 and December 23, 2016. A second season has also been announced. \\n\\n\r\n Toyohisa of the Shimazu clan is in the heat of the battle of Sekigahara in 1600, which signaled the start of the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan; the only thing he thinks about is how to behead the enemy commander and he is ready to achieve this goal by all means. Having fatally injured the enemy commander, Toyohisa is also about to die. Suddenly he finds himself in a white corridor, facing a man in strange clothes sitting at a desk in a white corridor. A moment later he is sent to a new land, where some unknown historical figures treat his wounds. Shortly after that he finds out that he, as well as his new companions, are Drifters. Why were Drifters sent to this world? Find out the answer now! \\n\\n\r\n The story-line of Drifters is worthy. There are still; however, some things that should be explained, but I would not call it a problem, since a second season was announced a day, or two ago. Drifters is violent; all history anime should be like Drifters. However, I have one major complaint and I am sure that you will not like it either: humor. Being a fan of Hellsing, I was expecting a portion of Hellsingish humor, but Drifters clearly overused it: it is not funny and outdated. I mean, come on, boob jokes? Really? Why not spend more time on characters and story-line? Is it that difficult? Anyways, it is not a big problem and you will still enjoy Drifters. To be precise, that is the only problem of Drifters. \\n\\n\r\n The art and music are very similar to Hellsing, so if you have already seen Hellsing Ultimate, you will recognize it immediately and will not have any problems with it. If you have not seen Hellsing Ultimate yet, it will not be a problem, either. The art style is amazing, every single detail of all characters is just beautiful. And, yes, that Japanese themed Alucard is just badass. The music, however, did not leave a huge impression on me. Of course, the voice actors did one hell of a job, but I was hoping to see something close to what was in Hellsing Ultimate. Anyway, the music used in Drifters is a mix of traditional Japanese music, jazzy beats, and rock. \\n\\n\r\n  The characters are very entertaining. As I have already mentioned, some of them did not receive enough development, but they will surely receive enough development in the new season. With that being said, we spend a lot time with the Japanese warriors: Shimazu Toyohisa, Oda Nobunaga, and Nasu Yoichi Suketaka. Their trio is very interesting, because they all are different. Shimazu is a warrior that only wants to behead his enemy; however, at the same time, he is also a true warrior, who will never harm a woman. Nasu is a young archer, who does not have any leader qualities; yet, he is also a fearless warrior. Oda is the most dangerous person in this group, because he is a true leader, he does not care where he is, because he is a true genius that will capture any town even with a bunch of amateurs. \\n\\n\r\n Anyways, the characters are very interesting to follow. As the story-line progresses, Drifters shows us more about its characters\u2019 background. And while some of Drifters do have regrets, they are still ready to go on and it is very exciting. However, there is also one problem I would like to mention, the comedy part. Jesus Christ, it is simply awful. I do agree that the comedy part is needed even in some gruesome anime, but it should not be overused. The problem is that you are watching a serious episode and you are trying to understand the problem; however, Drifters shows you these comedy moments disturbing you. It is simply impossible to concentrate and it is very annoying. \\n\\n\r\n As for enjoyment, this anime is very enjoyable and if you are a fan of Hellsing Ultimate, you will not have any problems with it. If you have not seen Hellsing Ultimate yet, I would highly recommend you to watch it first, but it is up to you, of course. It is not a must do. \\n\\n\r\n All in all, Drifters is not flawless, the comedy part ruined this masterpiece, in my opinion. Yes, it is very annoying, but you should not ignore this anime because of it, please do not do it, it is still awesome. On top of that, the most important thing is that it will receive a continuation, so you will not have to wait years predicting if it will, or will not receive a new season. Drifters is an anime I would highly recommend to every single anime fan; however, if you are a big hater of Hellsing Ultimate, I would highly recommend you to think twice before watching Drifters.",

            "content": "\"FATALITY!\" -Every Mortal Kombat game since 1992.\r\n*SPOILERS FOR DRIFTERS*\r\nWar is hell. We know this to be true by now. This also applies to the fact about there being a lot of \"sent to another world\" anime adaptations. You really need to do something really unique to stand out if you're one of these shows, and while I'd like to say that SAO and Re:Zero conditioned me to think otherwise, its obvious that their additions to the concept alone (bloodthirsty video game world and reset after death respectively) were what made them stand out, even if the actual concept, for most part does the exact opposite.With this show, they decided to make it have a full-fledged war, with loads of carnage peppered throughout. The concept is very interesting, especially since the war consists of famous people from many different eras of different countries. It's sort of like the Fate/ series, except that this time, all of the combatants were based on real people instead of sprinkling mythological people into the mix. So, was this a true breath of fresh air for the genre? Did it manage to do that while being a genuinely great war story? Well, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nSo, there is some kind of conflict between Easy and Murasaki (which doesn't get explained or fleshed out) that caused them to start sending people to this unidentified new world in which there are two main factions at war: Drifters (deceased war heroes), and Ends (once noble beings who have gone bad for their own reasons tying into their demise, but not all of them have their backstory shown to us). There are also humans who enslave two kinds of demi-humans: elves, and dwarves. Drifters are fighting to bring down the human governments of this world via conquest, and destroy the Ends, while the Ends are fighting to destroy the world and all inhabitants (despite the fact that their leader just wants the demi-humans to be the main inhabitants). So, what the hell happened here?\\n\\n\r\nUltimately, the first few episodes were rough. Not only were there some minor plot holes, but there is one gigantic issue that really damages this series: the tone shifts. You can have a moment in which villagers all horrifyingly stab a man to death in brutal fashion, and then seconds later, they show cracks a random joke. They do this so often, and sometimes, in the most inopportune of times, ruining some of the darker and heavier moments of the show. Sure, this means that, inevitably, a few of these end up being funny, but, for most part, they end up harming more than helping. \\n\\n\r\nThe series does pick up, but a few new issues really hamper this show. Every time one of the Ends is about to die or be defeated, we suddenly get their backstory in order to make the story sad, and that just doesn't work. In order for that to work, we need the characters to be more than just one-dimensional baddies before-hand, and they pull this stunt three times! Also, the finale just...ends, without any major resolution. Just, a battle ends, and here is one image of where each Drifter is at the moment, in an obvious, and quite frankly, rushed sequel-hook, particularly because some of the characters, like Scipio and Butch Cassidy, have been left by the wayside, especially Scipio with the fact that he has been left in the jungle but suddenly he's in a navy ship with a character that has only been seen for one brief moment. Hell, there are other moments that required some time to explain, like how the Drifters suddenly got human armor when their last battle (which was two episodes prior) didn't have nearly as many people killed to remotely equal the amount of armor and weapons present. Shame too, since if this concept was explored more and the story were tightened up, this would've definitely been a good first season to what looks to be an otherworldly war epic.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really hard to tolerate these \"Drifters\" early on. I mean, they were all a bunch of quarreling assholes without anything interesting about their character, and by the end of it, some of the more minor additions (like Hannibal and Scipio) were still like that. Luckily, our main trio grew. Toyo is a crazed warrior who loves decapitating enemy warriors, as long as they are male. His culture and all Japanese war cultures at the time do not like the thought of women engaged in combat. He ends up also being a bot more chivalrous towards females and children than his cohorts while understanding people more than he probably should (reminding me a lot of Ragna the Bloodedge, from the Blazblue game series) and I'll touch on that in a bit. Nobunaga is a much more brutal tactician as well as being a hardier individual than his allies. His violent streak, as a result of his culture and his multiple times being betrayed, makes for some of the best usages of military tactics I've seen in a war anime in quite some time. Yoichi ends up being more in between when it comes to his companions' traits, but with more of a tragic war past, which is shallowly explored via his commander, who ends up chatting with him once, and that's it. He's probably the least interesting of the trio, but at least, he ends up being the crux of some of the better comedy moments of the first 3 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nButch Cassidy and the other Drifters are infinitely less interesting, but he is easily the most tolerable of them (along with The Sundance Kid for how little he shows up), with him actually doing some cool stuff. Sure, Naoshi takes down some dragons in a WWII plane, but he's just there to provide some refreshing amounts of swearing, which ends up becoming excessive. There is also Count Saint-Germi (the son of Hitler) with his coup d'etat scheme, and his annoying posse (Alester and Flemi), but they are mostly there to be annoying and provide bad comedy until the count himself starts that plan with the Drifters to overthrow the human government.\\n\\n\r\nThe Octobrists are overall very uninteresting, except for Olmine, who is constantly made fun of for her voluptuous breasts, but has some genuinely great interactions with Toyo, as he shows her some good chivalry and allows her to use her spells to great effect in the latter half of the series. She is literally the only remotely interesting Octobrist. As for the Ends, with exception of The Black King, all of them are as plain as they come (with the slight exception of Anastasia, who is barely in this show). Then, they (except for Anestasia and Rasputin) get their backstories to explain why they are so evil and a bit about how that ties in with their powers (Only Joan of Arc does. Gilles de Rais and Hijikata doesn't get anything relating to his powers, and nobody gets their power origins outright explained) in a poor attempt at making these lame characters come off as tragic, which is really horrible given their real-life counterparts. \\n\\n\r\nThe Black King is an interesting figure, wanting better civilization for the demi-humans, and being able to create food as well as grow cells (to regenerate, but also to harm, as shown with the Bronze Dragon in episode 10), but even with his somewhat interesting motivations and enigmatic figure, he can't really make up for how bland his subordinates are. Easy is the one who sends the bad guys in, is moody, and that's about it aside from having a cutesy and girly room to herself. Murasaki is even more bland, though. Overall, despite a few characters that grew to be legitimately interesting and compelling, the cast is stupidly bland at best, and irritating at worst.\\n\\n\r\nHoods Drifters Studio (not to get confused with Hoods Entertainment, though they may or may not be affiliated) is brand new to this game, and they did a really good job with their first series, which is, of course, this. As if to make up for the writing quality, the action is refreshingly brutal, with loads of decapitation and blood, and no censorship anywhere. It's pretty fun seeing how much of a chaotic gore-fest the action scenes are, and they detail some of the bullet moments and impacts very well. The character models, while looking similar to Kouta Hirano's most popular work, Hellsing Ultimate, they also feel realistic and sorta unique. The only problem I have isn't with the art-stye change during most of the comedy moments, but rather with the usage of CGI for the dragons and some of the soldiers. They try to cover it up and make it work with everything, but it doesn't really help much, as it looks awkward. Luckily, that problem is barely present in the second half. Some moments in the earlier episodes are a bit off though. Still, I really hope to see this studio grow since they did such an impressive job with their first project.\\n\\n\r\nI don't have such high praises for the music, sadly. Gospel of the Throttle (by Minutes 'Til Midnight), the OP of the series, doesn't fit the show as well as I wish. On its own, it's a slick piece, but I don't feel it works here. Luckily, the ED, Vermillion (by Maon Kurosaki) is a very good song, with a more epic and buildup heavy feel to it that really fits with how gruesome and heavy the show can be. The rest of the OST isn't memorable or worthwhile at all, save for one ok piece. The dub is pretty alright. No major hiccups here, but nothing spectacular in terms of performances. It's a relatively solid dub so far. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, despite how cool and refreshing the action scenes were, this show kinda left me feeling bored and annoyed every now and then, especially in the first half. I admit, the action is fun, and some moments were definitely bleak, the horrible tone-shifts really leave me dazed and confused, and completely taken out of the experience, which is horrible given that one of these moments take place immediately after the darkest moment of the show! If not for the cool action, this wouldn't have engaged me at all, especially since the first 3 episodes left me with the feeling of darkness-induced apathy. I nearly dropped it during those first 3 episodes and even then, outside of fight scenes, this show is still very boring at times. Plus, not a lot of the gags make me laugh, but at least some of them do.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while this is a very gruesome action show and some of the gags get a laugh here and there, this show is a tonal mess that's hard to care about on any level that isn't related to primal, epic bloodbaths. At the very least, I hope that this series ends up bringing some notoriety for Hoods Drifters Studio. Still, this show is a bit of a disappointment. With all that said, I bid you adieu.",

The hype is REAL. \r\nNow to start off, I am a fan of the manga, and I can tell that a lot of love has been put into the development of this anime. It didn't miss a single important event, and you can feel the love of the creators every week while watching it. \r\nStory\r\nIt is a magnificent story, although I can't be certain that it is a unique one. What makes this experience incredible, is that the characters in it, are historical figures, from different eras, dating back to1500's and earlier. Every character is done with insane attention to detail, and once you start watching it, if you are not familiar with these characters, you are inclined to google them and get to know their stories, because they are so incredible to watch. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art can be described as STUNNING. I don't know what the budget is, but if every anime can have that quality it will be a godsend. Buildings, backgrounds, character designs, everything is marvelous. I can't really find nothing bad about the quality. Also you get ZERO censorship, which makes the experience even more enjoyable, as you lose track of time, while getting engulfed in the story, which has incredible pacing. There is no rushing in this adaptation. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nVery good, great OP and ED. There are some instrumentals during the episodes which fit perfectly in the premise of the story. Everything through the sound of the sword to the shots of the gun is how it should be. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\\n\r\nI have already a bit for the characters, but nevertheless here are some of the figures that are in it: Toyohisa Shimazu, Oda Nobunaga, Nasu Yoichi, Saint Germi, Abe no Seimei, Rasputin, Dark King (you will find out who he is), Hijikata Toshizou, Joan of Arc, Guilles de Raimes, Anastasia Romanov, Hannibal, Scipio, Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid ... just to name a few. It is an incredible watch.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and Overall\\n\\n\r\nI have looked forward to this every week. It is truly a worthwhile anime that is for everyone who enjoys incredible visuals, historical figures, great fighting, strategies of war and most of all a satisfying story. Watch this, because you will be sorry if you don't.",

            "content": "Yo waddup waddup i'm here to bring you some reality checks about this overhyped messy disappointment. This'll probably be a pretty short review focusing mostly on the negatives, but that's only because i don't have much to say about this anime. It's pretty forgettable.\r\nSo obviously all the hype comes from the fact that this is from the author of Hellsing, which instantly got thousands of edgy teens to get a hard-on. We expected insane badassery, gruesome fights and a level of cool that would make all the panties drop. Too bad we got none of that, but instead just a faint shadow of the author'sprevious work.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with the story, ey? So the story starts with (just read the synopsis, you idiots). What really made the story so boring is that you never feel any threat surrounding our main characters. There's a lot of build-up going on, but almost no actual conflict. The guys are mostly just fighting small fry all the time or talking about war strategy or how fascinated they are with the different technologies that were brought into this world. And god damn do they talk a lot! We get it! Y'all come from different times, y'all got different ideologies and ideas about war, just get over with it and go fight some baddies! I think there's only 2 instances where they fight some actually strong villains, but even then there's no tension because you know they're gonna win for sure and i don't really care enough about the characters to give a damn about those fights.\\n\\n\r\nOh boy, here comes my favorite part: the motherloving characters (i'm not allowed to swear, but you get the point)! What makes the characters so bland and forgettable is that their range of emotions can be summed up into 3 states: grinning, grinning and more grinning. Holy smoking Jesus on a bagel do these guys grin a lot! They grin in the face of danger, they grin when they're talking, when they're sleeping, when they're pooping, like they don't give a damn about anything. And while it's cool and all to not be afraid of anything, it also becomes really stale really fast. Also, this combined with the fact that they all come from different time periods makes them completely unrelatable to the average viewer. You might find some enjoyment if you're a japanese history nerd, but since i'm not a filthy weeb like y'all, i ain't really familiar with it. Turns out Oda Nobunaga wasn't such a big deal, considering how weak and one-dimensional his character is.\\n\\n\r\nProbably an unpopular opinion, but the visuals are also mediocre. At points the show is unbarable for the eyes, and that's for a few reasons: 1. Too much dark! I think every single fight takes place at night, which not only is monotonous as hell, but also hurts my eyes. And it's not like the collor pallet is dark, it feels like the image is forcefully made to look dark with some blak clouds constantly hoveing in front of the image and blurring it. Reality check bastards: Just cause a show is forcefully made to look dark, doesn't mean it's dark. Actually, this is one of the most light-hearted shows i've seen in a while. 2. Bad direction. Lots of weird close-ups to the character's faces, and fights are often uncomprehensible. 3. Sometimes the character's faces look like they're moving independently from their bodies (pretty small detail but still bugs me). The show uses that technique of thick outlines that makes it look like a Madhouse show, but pretty much fails at bringing out the beauty of that style. Hellsing Ultimate looks 10x better even though it was made in the late 2000s.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is pretty damn good if i do say so myself. We've got some pretty epic and stylish BGM that goes well with the tone of the show. Not to mention that opening is insane! In fact, the OP is so good that i would watch it 10 times in a row rather than watch an entire episode.\\n\\n\r\nAnd one final thing that really breaks the experience: the overusage of slapstick comedy. The show would oftenly go full chibi making you feel like you're watching something completely different, and while Hellsing had a bareable ammount of this, Drifters just has to go into full cringe mode every 3 minutes.\\n\r\n-Hey, how should we animate this part?\\n\r\n-Do a chibi comedy scene.\\n\r\n-But we had one 2 minutes ago and this scene isn't particularly fun-\\n\r\n-I SAID DO A CHIBI COMEDY SCENE!!!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, nothing really makes this show stand out from its contemporaries. Not saying it's bad or anything, there is some quality and enjoyment to be had, but considering what has been done in the past, this show is far from being up there with the big guys.",

            "content": "Drifters combines various well-known tropes, bringing famous historical figures into a fantasy world, and pitting them against eachother in all-out war. If you don't like war or watching heads roll, you're probably in the wrong place.\r\nThe animation is amazing, the soundtrack fits perfectly, the main characters (feudal Japanese warriors) have very well developed personalities, while still staying impressively faithful to how they actually were in history, and the plot illustrates an unabridged version of early-modern Japanese warfare.\r\nOverally, the anime is unbelievably excellent (for its genre, and in production quality); I'm not too keen on the details, but the studio, \"Hoods Drifters Studio\" appears to havebeen put together specifically for the production of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf anything would quickly turn you away from this anime, it would probably be the art style. You'll might recognize it from Hellsing; Hirano Kouta just loves silhouettes with one glowing eye and comical polygon forms, among other things, including the characters' facial designs. Aside from that, this anime gets as bloody and gorey as you'd expect to see in war, and doesn't try to hide it.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nIt can get quite chaotic, but it fits the frequent, chaotic battles, and it feels like no effort was spared in bringing these scenes to life; definitely a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI can't express in words how I feel about this anime using a band that can ACTUALLY SPEAK ENGLISH for the OP, but it's an insanely good feeling. (Also love Kurosaki Maon) The opening and ending were just amazing, and perfectly fit this anime's romantic depiction of undisguised, hellish war.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting... Was mostly good, but it sometimes got too into a character's particular speech pattern and sounded stale (assuming you're watching the sub, and that you pay attention to speech patterns).\\n\\n\r\nOutside of that, certain soundtracks might have been slightly overused, but it's not too noticeable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nThough some might be disappointed in which historical figures were used, and how influential/amazing they were, remember that it's Japanese anime, and that the creator is Japanese. I think it was the right choice to focus on the Japanese that are within the writer's realm of knowledge/expertise. It's clear that the historic figures used were meant to be faithful to the originals, and the anime includes very accurate references to their knowledge, tactics, and experiences.\\n\\n\r\nYeah, it's quite nice to see an anime that doesn't bullshit away from actual history (when using historical figures), or bullshit some sort of power that comes from their character (Okay, Drifters does bullshit some powers, but at least they're less bullshit and make decent sense).\\n\\n\r\nThe only real criticism I have is a lack of characterization for side characters, who are oversimplified, and the ones that aren't historical figures, who barely get any attention at all. (A bit wasteful towards the fantasy setting, I think)\\n\\n\r\nPlot:\\n\r\nThe anime starts off a bit slow as it introduces the characters, and the \"humor\" moments can be painful to watch, but it quickly picks up after the 2nd episode. Some people might be bored by the logistics aspect in the anime, but that IS a part of warfare, and personally, I'm glad they don't leave that out. (It's like watching someone place their trap card, instead of the trap card appearing out of nowhere)\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing is quite good\u2014it doesn't try to fill/waste time or contrive stupid cliffhangers or deus ex machinas\u2014because there's they're confident that they have enough legitimate, real plot content to keep the audience interested. There's actually a logical flow to the plot (so far, this season).\\n\\n\r\nYou actually need quite a bit of knowledge of Japanese history, military history, history in general, and Japanese culture to fully understand, notice and appreciate... Tons of things in things, from the characters' behavior, tactics, foreshadowing, to the flow of the plot itself. So yeah, keep that in mind and maybe have google ready.",

            "content": "Drifters - \"Battle in a brand new world war.\"\r\nThat could be all I need to write since, as far as I've seen, the show has lived up to that thesis grandly.\u00a0\r\nBut lets talk about it a little more just for giggles.\r\nThis show was a bit of a wildcard for me personally, given that I haven't read the manga or seen either of the directors crowning achievements (Hellsing and the latest iteration of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure), but after the synopsis piqued my interest, and the Promotional Video's came out, I was sold. Further Drifters was produced by a studio that has not been responsible for any...respectable, none the less epic or badass shows that I am aware of. While avoiding either spoiling anything important or going over things you should already know (from reading the MAL synopsis), I will share my thoughts.\\n\\n\r\nFor Animation -\u00a0\\n\r\nDrifters does not disappoint in most areas, and definitely not its main animation style and fight scenes. For the most part it has managed to keep CG at a minimum, avoiding the usage of hideous clones or terrible blends of hand-drawn and computer-assisted animation in favor of a uniquely beautiful style that you must see to appreciate (and yes, you do get used to it after the first few seconds). The only blow against this otherwise stellar track record is its usage of \"Chibi\" or an almost cutesy style during purely comedic moments. I believe that this contrasts rather sharply with the extremely epic and, for the most part, serious feel of the show, however; like the overall animation style, you do get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nFor sound -\u00a0\\n\r\nThis is one area are where the overwhelmingly positive influence of Hellsing (so I hear, no pun intended) comes in very clearly. In a word, it rocks. After the first episode finished, and I heard the opening for the first time, in addition to several other background tunes that were especially good, I had no doubt that I was in good hands with regard to the sound department.\\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that it was only a week later that I learned that the song I had heard was not the opening - it was the ending, and I had been fooled by how epic it was into thinking it was the opening. I later found out the opening was done by an American band from Detroit; it's only gotten better from there.\\n\\n\r\nFor story -\u00a0\\n\r\nThe story of this show is fairly straight forward; a vast array of differing people from all across history and the world (but mostly Japan), are summoned into a parallel universe at the moment of their deaths. Here they must fight likewise summoned enemies to save the world from destruction. This simplicity may bother you, but at the same time the show really doesn't try to sell itself as anything more, intellectually, than a truly epic \"battle in a brand new world war\". Almost like a weirder Lord of the Rings. If you're looking for intellectual stimulation, you may be disappointed (so far.)\\n\\n\r\nFor Characters -\u00a0\\n\r\nMost of the characters that have been introduced so far are interesting in their own ways, even if they are a bit flat at first, but they do not fail to intrigue and amuse, particularly as personalities from wildly different eras and cultures clash. I hope that as the series progresses we will get more character depth, but know that with the size of the cast they are juggling and the type of show this is (read epic badass gore-fest with a side of comedy and awesome), this area may be somewhat limited.  One solid negative for the show is the excessively and unnecessarily gay Count St. Gemi\\n\\n\r\nFinal verdict -\u00a0\\n\r\nI love the show so far, and eagerly await the second season.  Even if only as a adrenaline-spiked thunderously epic bloodbath, Drifters was immensely entertaining and extremely funny, mostly through how seriously its characters take themselves, even when they're in ridiculous situations - such as fighting medieval nazis with the help of dwarves and elves to overthrow an empire created by drifter Adolf Hitler - cause yes that's how they roll.\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to hate this show however it would be for one of three reasons:\\n\r\nOn the one hand, it could be dragged down by an accumulation of weirdness (see Hitler and his EXTREMELY gay nobles), along with the slapstick Chibi scenes, but I don't think that's terribly likely.\\n\\n\r\nOr the lack of in-depth plot and character development might bother you.\\n\\n\r\nThe final danger however I cannot speak of directly, since I promised not to spoil anything, but I will say simply that it pertains to the true identity of \"the Black King\", and may end up trashing everything if my suspicion is true and they try to give it any more than passing significance. \\n\\n\r\nThat's all for now; enjoy the slaughter!\\n\\n",

            "content": "Despite others saying that Drifters is overrated and is given to much praise, it still doesn\u2019t change the fact that it easily caught a lot of attention, deriving popularity, and put off a show that greatly satisfies the audience. To be honest, I find the show to be quite a long shot from being a masterpiece but it sure was entertaining in a higher level, and that alone could prove that it deserves what it has now.\r\nLet\u2019s start with the story. One of the strength of this anime is its interesting background which, aside from using historical facts, combines a very dark theme with conceptsof fantasy that stirs up the viewers\u2019 interest. Simply put, the plot is intriguing enough to make someone stick throughout the entire series without a thought of dropping it or even finding it to be boring. On the other hand, I have to point out that despite the eye candy story it is, it actually lacks depth. The show doesn\u2019t really provide too much thought provoking ideas and concepts \u2013 it is just entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, well, are not something to invest on, not yet. Yes, some of the characters have qualities that well suit the whole concept but somehow, almost all of them are flat characters \u2013 lacking depth and not entirely close to real. Their personalities and characteristics are greatly limited to their role \u2013 which is to fight. There isn\u2019t much development that happened between the characters throughout the show and there isn\u2019t much background either. Adding to that, the characters were only supporting objects to move the story.\\n\\n\r\nBy this point you may have already thought that Drifters was really that bad and only led to a letdown, but that\u2019s not the case at all. Art. Drifter\u2019s art style is equally the strongest point of this show with its entertainment/enjoyment factor. Even a single glimpse of the show is more than enough to lure you into it. If the story itself is already dark, then it\u2019s not even half of art\u2019s portrayal from the slightest shade of a shadow to the curvature of every evil grin. Of all other anime, the Drifters may have the most accurate embodiment of the story with its visual \u2013 if not too much. In terms of the music, I couldn\u2019t say less that it improves the vibe of the show and very well complements with the other elements.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the enjoyment. This is by the most redeeming quality of the show that made it stand out \u2013 of course, with the support of the previous elements discussed. Action, action, and more action, that\u2019s basically the surface of this anime but it\u2019s more to it than that. The events of the show is made brilliantly as it does not only give the audience something to decide whether they like it or not but something they will eventually like. That being said, most of the action sequence were made to address a person\u2019s best kept personality or behavior and the anime recognizes them very well. What does that supposed to mean? Well you may notice that a variety of immorality is shown, namely violence, lust, greed and others \u2013 but that\u2019s only one way to look at it. The action sequence is also recognizably exemplar with the way everything moves from the inanimate objects to the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWith everything at hand, I have concluded that this anime is not overrated at all and despite its flaws, it still has something to offer and is definitely worthwhile watching. Regardless, more is expected of the show in its upcoming sequel and hopefully this time, it will carefully divert its attention to working on the characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Ok, yes, I'm definitely in the minority here, but I REALLY didn't enjoy this anime. I should've seen the signs when it looked like a serious show, but had a 'comedy'-tag - a combination that almost never works \u2013 but here we are. \r\nFor now, I'll start with the things I liked about this anime... if only because getting through those is a LOT quicker, lol.\r\nFirst off, I have to admit, Drifters occasionally had some pretty decent and interesting strategies & tactics in its battles. For example in one instance towards the middle, Nobunaga ordered the elves that they were trying to save to dumpthe corpses they had from the fight before into their well and then run before the incoming troops of their enemy arrived. In case you don't know much about war-tactics: Throwing corpses into a well poisons the water inside, obviously making it undrinkable. This means that troops who want to use the village to refill their supplies and occupy the place can't do so, as the sole source of water is completely unusable. It's a standard tactic, aye, but I was still impressed to see it in use, as it showed that whoever made the manga this is based on had at least a basic understanding of war-tactics.\\n\r\nAdditionally, I think that the action-scenes themselves were pretty well handled. They weren't as flashy and clever as JoJo's nor were they as exciting as Rakudai Kishi's, but they were definitely better than the action-scenes in the majority of action anime I've seen. There was just something about the MC slicing up multiple bad guys that was actually somewhat fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of 'fun to watch', another thing I actually liked about this show was that it featured an actual Gatling Gun. Yes, I know, that's a weird thing to be excited about, but Mini-guns (and their ancestors, the Gatling Guns) are amongst the very few guns I actually like and they are almost never get featured in anything, so not only seeing the original GG, but also having it presented rather historically accurate was quite something for me. A very personal point, yes, but I think it still counts.\\n\r\nThe last thing I actually liked about this show was its Opening. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this show had one of the coolest openings of the last year. I actually went out of my way to search for the opening on YT to listen to it occasionally, because it's really that good.\\n\\n\r\nBut that's where the pleasantries end. If you think that this sounds like a pretty interesting anime based on what you've read so far, don't worry, that's gonna change in just a minute.\\n\r\nLet's start with the thing I hated the most about this anime: Its absolutely godawful attempts at Comedy. I'm fking serious. I don't think I've ever seen an anime where literally every single joke bombed completely. Every single time this anime felt like it was getting too decent, it decided to go into a completely terrible alternative art-style and make some of the characters perform the most tedious boke/tsukkommi routines I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing. Not to mention that even IF the jokes had been successful, they STILL would've been out of place, as there's very few ways to NOT make jokes seem OOP within a serious war setting. I honestly have NO idea why Drifters didn't just stay serious the entire time, as those were the times where this anime was actually bearable... most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing I want to talk about is the Art-style of this show. And I know, I've already said how horrible the 'joke-art-style' looked, but the one for the serious parts was actually also not something I enjoyed. Yes, it was unique and probably took a lot of effort, but that still doesn't change the fact that I thought that it looked... sub-par. Maybe it's because I'm a spoiled KyoAni fanboy, but I really could not get myself to accept the art in this anime. I've HEARD that it looks a lot like Hellsing Ultimate (which I can neither confirm nor debunk, as I haven't watched HU), so I suppose if you've liked the art in Hellsing, then you can completely ignore what I just said, lol.\\n\r\nNext up is the character development in this anime... or rather the lack there of. Seriously, the only one with any personality in that bunch seemed to be Nobunaga himself and Saint-Germi. The rest of them seemed to either be one-dimensional warmongers (like the MC himself) or completely lacked any personality or presence whatsoever (like Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, who was part of the main cast... and completely and utterly personality-less.) Probably the most vexing example of a lack of character development was with what might possibly be the main villain: 'The Black King.' (one of those titles right out of the 'generic villain name'-book). He was shown multiple times over the course of season one, yet I have no fking idea what he's supposed to be like.\\n\\n\r\nWhich leads us straight into the next point of criticism: the fact that the villain of the series was never characterized whatsoever. It is no secret that it's tough to hate a villain that you've never even seen do anything bad and of whom you've only seen a couple glimpses, which is why the most interesting villains are the ones that have a lot of presence like Yoshikage Kira (JoJo) or Handsome Jack (Borderlands 2). Hence it was rather confusing to see that the main villain of this series (who I THINK is the Black King... he's the only one who even came close to being one at least) was content with just sitting off-screen for the majority of the show, quietly minding his own business and who only did anything at the very end of season one... and even then, he didn't show up himself , but instead he sent an army of foot soldiers to deal with the army of the protagonists. IMO, that guy was one of the biggest failures of an antagonist I've ever seen, rivaling even the teacher from Boku dake ga inai machi.\\n\\n\r\nThis lack of character development COULD'VE been fixed, had they just not thrown in some characters for one, maybe two episodes before never bringing them up again. Seriously, just take a look at the 'characters' page of this anime for yourself. It should be obvious that with such a huge cast, it's impossible to characterize each and every one of them to a satisfying extend, so why did they insist on introducing such a pile of them. For some of them, I don't even know what their role was supposed to be, because they were introduced as if they were gonna be important, literally did one thing and then fked off into nothingness. Prime example: Zero-pilot Kanno Naoshi. He SEEMED like he could've been a really interesting addition to the party, not only because he came from a much more modern era than the rest of the cast but also because he was one of the few people that actually had a character. Which is why his share of screentime still baffles me: he appeared, shot down a dragon, crashed with his plane... and literally the only time he appeared after that was a couple episodes later where he was shown having started living inside of the crashed plane. That was it. I'm still not sure whether he was supposed to be a more important character who just got cut or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe next thing on the chopping block is the cliffhanger ending that this anime had. Because of my attempt to keep things spoiler-free, I'm not gonna go too in-depth, but here's what I will say: the first season of this anime basically ended with the protagonists and their army getting ready to defeat the Black King, but before literally anything of the sorts actually happened. I hate cliffhanger endings just as much as the next guy, so I am obviously pissed when an anime uses its main antagonist as the sequel-hook. However, seeing as how a 2nd season got confirmed right as the first one ended, I am willing to not see that point as harsh as I would normally.\\n\\n\r\nNext up, we've got the point where I almost dropped the anime outright. In episode 4, the protagonist's group, supported by the male elves they freed, march towards the castle in which the local bad guy had... basically kidnapped the female population of the elven village. They find out that the women had been locked into the castle's tower, and upon arriving there, they see that the guards of the castle had been repeatedly raping the elven women. Pretty much the ONLY reason why I didn't just drop the entire anime at that point (as my very personal opinion is that rape is the one thing that should never be happening) was because I was hoping that the guards would all be killed in the most visceral ways possible in the next episode (which only sorta happened). And before anyone jumps at me to say that 'it was obvious' and that 'it was a means of making you hate the bad guys', I would like to point towards an anime that handled a very similar situation (man kidnaps the female population of a settlement and locks them into the giant place he lives in) very differently and a lot 'better': Hitsugi no Chaika. In that show, it basically played out like this: the antagonist of that arc was a man whose 'hobby' was to slice up women and he was using the women he kidnapped as his 'test subjects'. It was a set-up that was still really effective at making you hate that guy, but it completely avoided making me hate the anime itself. So there you go, there was definitely an alternative way to handle the situation.\\n\\n\r\nLast up, there are two things I want to talk about about the archery in this anime. I am aware that these are, once again, points that might be completely irrelevant to you, but I still consider them important enough to include.\\n\r\nFirstly: Fire arrows. Jesus fking Christ, when are people finally going to stop using fire arrows in their works if they have NO idea how they work?? If I got 5 cents every time somebody used them completely unrealistically, I could run my own 'Say NO to fire arrows' ad-campaign. In Drifters in particular, the fact that they were used this weirdly is even more interesting, as this anime tried to be realistic in its usage of weaponry.\\n\r\nThe first time fire arrows showed up in this anime, I was actually somewhat impressed to see that they were used in one of the only two situations where people DID actually use them in the middle ages: during a siege. Sure, the effectiveness of those arrows was still ridiculous (real fire arrows had a chance of ~2% to set something aflame, here it seemed more like 98%), but it was something at least. However, the second time they were used it was back to good ol' 'this is NOT how they work. This is not how ANYTHING works'. For some stupid reason, the makers of this thought that it was a reasonable idea to have people use fire arrows... during a horse chase. Which would've worked, were it not for two simple things... a) No and b) NO!... but seriously, that part was fking stupid. There was no way for the horse-riders to set their arrows on fire, which means that there was no way to even HAVE fire arrows in that situation... and using them while riding a horse also seems like the best way to get yourself killed, so yeah. Stupid on every single level, which, sadly, seems to be the norm for fire arrows in anything from anime to movies to games. (for further knowledge about fire arrows, watch this 'ere: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTd_0FRAwOQ )\\n\\n\r\nAnd secondly... Why in the name of god did the professional archer in this anime hold his bow sideways on multiple occasions?? Doing so is pretty much the most sure-fire way to show your enemy that you have NO idea what the fk you're doing, as you pretty much sacrifice a large portion of your range and power for nothing. Every time the archer-guy held his bow that way, I started to think whether I should laugh or cry about that... and settled for being pissed off.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all: this anime was, all things considered, pretty fking bad in my opinion. My advice would be to just watch the Opening ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYJxbkEItQ ) until you're sick of it (which might take a while, as it's really good) and just give the anime itself a miss. You'll do yourself a favor.",

But it could only go so far to prove those expectations true.\r\n--Plot--\r\nThe background plot is a clich\u00e9ed \"person from our world in someone else's one\". The difference being, all those guys are famous bigwigs over here, all of them got their name in history, and they come from different historical times. So it could be a Western-samurai-WWII with lasers genre(okay, without lasers, for the time being). It is pretty chaotic by itself, and lots of fun, but could be more well developed. But, as it seems they are going to produce a new season, there is still hope. 6\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nIt sucks. I can only imagine that they did this on purpose to be this bad.

The battles get a bit better, but not that much to save this from a 5.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nThe OP and ED were captivating, I found myself singing the OP when I was unaware of it. The characters had amazing voice actors, which were emotional when they needed to (which means, almost all the time). Honorable mention to a new language created. It is a shame that the art could not hold a candle to these actors. 8\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nThey are emotional. Very. Most of the time this show is a screaming hell of people trying to be understood by the loudest-is-best rule. That aside, I found myself really liking the characters, be it good or bad guys. They express emotions, are a tad bit crazy and love to pick a fight. Whatelse could we expect from a crazy show? 8\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoymeny--\\n\r\nThis could be a much better show, if not for the shallow plot (which can get better) and the crappy animation (which won't get better). I found myself expecting the show every week, hoping for it to start. Seeing the art got me a bit sad but, even so, this is yet a good show. 7\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nIt gets a new season. As my expectations for the show were a bit high, and failed, this review may get a little biased towards my initial opinion of the show. But it is a good anime for all that matters. If you can deny the animation, this will be lots of fun. If you, like me, cannot, it is still fun.",

In the end, its an acceptable action-oriented anime that treats its plot as superfluous.\r\nStory: \r\nWho cares? It's some angry Shimazu man paired with Oda Nobunaga and a Japanese folk hero who desire to kick ass. They go around \"restructuring\" the medieval empire of a certain Second World War Axis leader with a mustache. They later meet another presumably famous Japanese folk hero who tells them that bad people from history are trying to destroy theworld.

This is a no thinking required show, there are no complex relationships here. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDrifters thrives on its violence, and dies on its story.

            "content": "Drifters is a fantasy, alternate history series adapted from a manga of the same name, written and illustrated by Kouta Hirano, who\u2019s the original creator of the Hellsing series. It is directed by Suzuki Kenichi, who\u2019s directed such anime as Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure. One can tell that the series would involve nothing short of brutal, stylized action and Drifters meets this expectation. However, it offers a lot more than that.\r\n[A different take on the \u2018Isekai\u2019 sub-genre]\r\nThe Japanese word \u2018isekai\u2019 can be translated directly to mean \u2018different world\u2019 and is a sub-genre of fantasy series that involves one or many characters transported to another world, oftenthrough magical means. The plot of such series revolves around the characters\u2019 struggles as they try to leave the world which is unfamiliar to them; a typical human reaction. From the first few scenes, Drifters is immediately identified as a fantasy show of the \u2018Isekai\u2019 sub-genre as the main characters is sent into a stock fantasy world, replete with demi-humans like elves. But the similarities end there.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few stark differences between the nature of the \u2018passengers\u2019, the ones being transported, in Drifters and the ones in regular \u2018Isekai\u2019 shows. One of the easiest differences to spot is that the Drifters are historical characters unlike the more modern protagonists in regular \u2018Isekai\u2019. Another key difference are the ages and statuses of the Drifters. Where most Isekai shows involve young adults, usually high-schoolers, lacking in essential more survival experience, the Drifters are full-fledged adults and warriors who\u2019ve survived many battles. This attribute of the Drifters (and the Ends who\u2019re the series antagonists), leads to the most profound difference between the series and a regular \u2018Isekai\u2019: the characters do not seek to escape the different world. They seek to conquer it.\\n\\n\r\nAs early as the first episode, the primary Drifters, composed of Oda Nobunaga, Shimazu Toyohisa and Nasu Yoichi, begin working on plans to challenge the human Empire of Orte, the current government. On the other end, the Ends advance their army against the same Empire for the purpose of liberating all monsters in the alternate world. There is little talk of escape; instead, the Drifters utilize their knowledge and experience to transform the alternate world. Not only do they shake up the government, but they introduce warfare as they\u2019ve experienced it. This change is made possible due to the strength of the characters.\\n\\n\r\n[Stock action characters with the rare exceptions]\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s easy to dismiss the Drifters  (and Ends) as the stock, one-dimensional characters often found in action shows; the characters fill out archetypal roles and march towards their respective goals with a trail of epic battles in their wake. This is not necessarily a bad thing as it often makes for exciting shows and Drifters is no exception. Drifters does try to make its characters more interesting by giving them additional attributes with weak relations to their main skills. Toyohisa is the mindless warrior who only seeks to remove his enemy\u2019s head at any cost but will uphold the warrior code of his time. Yoichi is the quintessential archer who\u2019s courageous enough to fight in the open if need be. Nobunaga is the brilliant mastermind who fawns over future technology. The supporting characters and the Ends simply play out their roles with the exception of Olminu who begins as a wide-eyed junior magician from the Octobrists but grows into a brilliant support for the Drifters.\\n\\n\r\nOne major issue with the characters in Drifters is the screen time given some of the supporting cast and the Ends. The Ends are only seen during seen during their encounters with the Drifters and in a few brief moments. An improvement would have been to have some development of the Ends during the moments when the Drifters prepare for battle and in lieu of the comedy (which I\u2019ll get to later). The mysterious characters of Murasaki and Easy who\u2019re responsible for transporting the Drifters and Ends to the world are virtually invisible in the show. It\u2019s understandable that the overall runtime for the show makes it difficult to develop most of the characters equally.\\n\\n\r\n[Gritty, stylized art]\\n\\n\r\nFrom the first scene, we\u2019re introduced to the gritty art that fuels Drifters take on Isekai. The characters and background are done in dark, desaturated colours that are in sharp contrast to the usual colourful scenes of fantasy shows; the blood has a dark red sheen and has fluid animation. The characters look grim and constantly wear a serious look even when they\u2019re smiling. The show doesn\u2019t hold back on its style.\\n\\n\r\nA remarkable aspect to the art of Drifters is the character design, both for the historical characters and the indigenes of the world. Their representations were accurate for the most part with a few additions. I especially liked Nobunaga\u2019s design because of the eyepatch which made him stand out. The indigenes are designed as would characters in a medieval fantasy setting with the exception of the Octobrists, who have unique attires.\\n\\n\r\nA major gripe I had with the character art is that they had similar faces and expressions. This was especially noticed in the males; they all seemed to have the same soulless eyes and menacing smile.\\n\\n\r\n[Forgettable soundtrack]\\n\\n\r\nThe music of Drifters was a major miss for me as there weren\u2019t any memorable soundtracks despite the numerous battle scenes. And whatever soundtracks played were often drowned out by the screaming characters. On the other hand, I enjoyed the opening theme a lot and often sang along. The ending theme wasn\u2019t as inspirational.\\n\\n\r\n[Dreadful comedy]\\n\r\nDrifters is a thoroughly enjoyable show and was one of my favourites for the fall season of 2016. My bias towards the fantasy genre made it a must-watch but it exceeded my expectations with its  interesting characters and their lofty ambition to rule their world instead of escape it. The use of historical characters had me returning to Wikipedia with each introduction, helping me pick up a bit of Japanese history (mostly). The art was a refreshing change from the cute, fluffy and colourful art of the various \u2018otome\u2019 shows during the season. These great aspects of the show helped offset the forgettable music and the awful comedy. The comedy in Drifters starts out as horrible and often interrupted the better moments of the show. The change in art style coupled with the dry jokes were huge misses. But I soon got used to it and sometimes welcomed it as it showed another side to the characters. Perhaps it was because most of the comedy concerned Nobunaga, who was my favourite character. It was a part of the show I can\u2019t say I completely enjoyed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of fantasy shows, I would recommend Drifters, if only for the interesting plot and art style.",

            "content": "The concept of Drifters showed a lot of promising potential, but yet again the potential is ruined by it being too centered around Japan and the Japanese. If the plot was changed especially in regards to the amount of drifters and who the drifters were it could easily have been a great show if not a masterpiece. \r\nThe plots real weakness lies in the lack of Drifters, the problem in and of itself or rather the potential being wasted is most likely due to the author of Drifters being far too centered on Japan and Japanese history while being less knowledgeable about non-Japanese history whichis why characters outside of Japan are lacking to say the least. I would list tons of generals, commanders, kings and so on that I think would have been amazing additions to make Drifters an exciting anime, but the list would simply be too long. Even if we skip all the lesser known generals there are an abundance of famous ones that are simply left out which in my opinion is a complete and utter waste. \\n\\n\r\nShort lift of possible additions; Timur, Genghis Khan, Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, Attila the hun, Qin Shi Huang, Charlemagne, Saladin, Suleiman the magnificent, Wu Qi and Napoleon\\n\\n\r\nJust by seeing these names most people will know the amount of potential wasted by simply leaving them out of the story. Naoshi Kanno was also used, but if you were to use a ww2 pilot that died during ww2 one of the optimal choices would be Otto Kittel which scored a total of 267 aerial victories meaning he's one of the most successful fighter pilots in history compared to Kannos 25. If you absolutely wanted a Japanese fighter pilot that died during ww2 your obvious choice would be Hiromichi Shinohara which sat Japanese records having shot down 11 planes in a single day, author please. \\n\\n\r\nOnto a minor issue is regarding to the portrayal of certain characters and Rasputin is by far the most obvious. If you saw a picture of Rasputin in drifters and you were asked which historical figure it is there's no fucking way anyone would ever guess Rasputin apart from getting it on a wild guess. Surely the Japanese can't hate beards so much to the extent that they're unwilling to create fully bearded characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe last matter would be the personality of the characters themselves. Digging deeper into history and figure out what kind of people they truly were and how they acted would have been better in addition to something that would have made it possible for all of them to communicate with each other efficiently. Some lines in foreign languages wouldn't have been a bad thing either if they managed to get the voice actors to actually pronounce foreign languages properly. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story in and of itself is an isekai I also believe it would have been much better without magic. Seeing a contest of raw skill and strategy between famed generals throughout history would have been a much better option. Although the combat still would have been in the realms of fantasy it would have been much better this way. \\n\\n\r\nSo in the end the story ends up at a wasted potential/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound were both fine, although you can clearly see the similarity to Hellsing as the author is the same, but I don't think the art fits as well with Drifters as it did with Hellsing.\\n\\n\r\nMassively wasted potential/10",

            "content": "Drifters is a science fiction, fantasy action, adventure manga written by Hirano Kouta. You may know him as the writer of Hellsing. At the tail end of 2016, an anime adaptation of Drifters aired. It was brought to us by Hoods Entertainment. A studio that I've never reviewed an anime by before. So, is Drifters a series that's worth looking into? \r\nStory:\r\nAfter the battle of Sekigahara, Shimazu Toyohisa finds himself in a strange, light corridor filled with doors. A spectacled man gestures and he gets pulled into one of them and directly into another world. He finds himself meeting Oda Nobunaga and Nasu Yoichi, twomen who were recorded as having died before his time. It turns out that in this world of elves, dwarves, halflings and men, certain people from our world are being sent just before their deaths by the spectacled fellow in an effort to preserve the world from beings called \u201cEnds,\u201d who are also comprised of famous figures from our world, and their Black King. Shimazu and his new found companions, unaware of the ends and their threat, decide to lead a rebellion to save the elves from their forced servitude by a large, human nation. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw with the series goes back to our old friend, tone. This is one of those series that, in one vein, has really over the top violence and humour and, in an entirely different vein, tries to tackle some serious subject matter. Notably rape. Consequently, its handling these serious subjects for all of five minutes before going back to the absurdity and never mentioning them again comes across as more than a little tasteless. Although, in all fairness, there are only a few scenes like that. The ending is also pretty unsatisfying. It's all setting up for the next series and, while it does have a degree of closure for one of the major plot threads, it doesn't even bother giving you a climactic battle with any finality. For that matter, there's very little aftermath. Certainly not enough to give us as the viewers a sense of what came from the whole thing beyond the very obvious.\\n\\n\r\nOn the positive side, I do like the concept of two opposing entities each scouring our history for  figures they can use against one another. The series also does quite well when it's staying in its comfort zone of over the top violence mixed with humour. It also does do a good job at keeping your interest since it has a lot of interwoven plot threads. \\n\\n\r\nLet's discuss a very mixed element with the series. The fluctuating complexity. We see our protagonists face the Orte Empire, a very uncomplex fascist nation. Right down to being founded by one of history's most brutal monsters. They also face the Ends, who are heavily indicated to have more going for them than the initial impression indicates. We also  have the Count of Saint Germain. Initially, he appears to be the gay stereotype that seems to pop up in anime because \u201che's gay it's funny.\u201d However, there are several ways in which he goes beyond that and becomes a surprisingly complex character. And the anime is full of elements that seem shallow but get built on into something more and others that are just shallow\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters, at this juncture, are more potentially complex than they are actually complex. There are some, our main trio of heroes and the Count, who move beyond their archetypes in some ways. There are other Drifters and several characters among the Ends with potential, usually due to some connection with our heroes, but without anything tangible yet. The characters who are neither are just universally bland. Including the Count's subordinates who are just the gay stereotypes. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThis is a bit mixed mainly because there are two art styles in the series. There's the \u201ccomedic\u201d art style, which looks lazily rushed and like the artists just didn't care. Then there's the art style they use the rest of the time and it actually does look pretty great. The action sequences are fluid and intense. The character designs are detailed, although it should be noted that, in a bout of uncreative nonsense, the elves all look very similar as do the members of certain other fantasy races. The backgrounds are very nicely detailed under the normal style and basically non-existent with the comedic. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe acting is similar to the art in that it has two modes. There's the over the top comedic mode where everyone sounds like seven year olds shouting the lines of their school play and there's the regular mode which sounds pretty good. Nakamura Yuuichi, Uchida Naoya & Saiga Mitsuki all do very well at those points. The music was composed by Ishii Yasushi and Matsuo Hayato. Matsuo also worked on music for the first series of JoJo and Magic Knight Rayearth. All in all, it's all right. \\n\\n\r\nHo-yay:\\n\\n\r\nAside from Germain and his companions, there's a unit of muscular gay guys. Several men express attraction to Yoichi and there's one line that may hint that Anastasia has a thing for Jeanne. It's ambiguous. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\n\r\nSo, how does Drifters hold up when you factor in its good ideas with what it executes well, its tonal problems, its vast gaps in quality for both the art and voice acting, its inconsistent complexity and all of that? Well, I would say it's all right. Honestly, it had the potential to be really good. For that matter, it could pretty easily become something really good, but as is, the first series has quite a few issues that hold it back. If you like the concept, you can handle the dip in quality for the big comedic bits and you can forgive the occasional tonal awkwardness, you might enjoy it. For myself, I'll give it a 6/10. Next week I'll look at Karas.",

            "content": "Drifters is a seinen title based on the manga by Kouta Hirano. The story is set in a medieval fantasy world where both humans and demi humans (such as elves and dwarves) live. This world is soon greeted by two sets of foreigners from the real world - \u201cDrifters\u201d and \u201cEnds\u201d. Both groups are comprised of historical figures tied to war or a fight of their time. They are taken before their death by one of two mysterious people. A man named Murasaki chooses fighters for his Drifters, while a girl named Easy picks candidates for her Ends. What sets them apart are their givenroles in this story. The Ends seek out the destruction of humankind and the Drifters are assigned to stop the Ends from their slaughter.\\n\\n\r\nAs the name implies, the show\u2019s perspective is from the eyes of the Drifters. Though there is a fair amount of fighters with this title, the anime focuses on three in particular. Toyohisa Shimazu is the appointed leader of the group and is a classic warrior type, whose battle-minded ways make him great in the fights but a bit barbaric outside of them. Nobunaga Oda is a crafty middle-aged man, dubbed the \u201cDevil King of the Sixth Heaven\u201d who doesn\u2019t fight as much as come up with strategy to make the Drifters team a fighting threat. Finally, there\u2019s Yoichi Nasu, a bishonen archer whose aim is as good as his looks. The anime follows these three as they work their way up to be a formidable foe, from freeing demi humans from their serfdom and slavery to coming up with cunning plans in the midst of a fight.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept of Drifters isn\u2019t too far removed from one of Hirano\u2019s previous works, Hellsing. Hellsing mainly attracted an audience by blending its dark supernatural characters with hyper violence, occasionally sprinkling in historical references. Drifters changes this mixture \u2013 it still has the violence and supernatural elements, but it grounds itself more so in the history. Despite being a fantasy world, it feels more down-to-earth than other shows with this title. The Octobrists are a magician organization that wishes for the Drifters support to defeat the Ends. Though they are magicians, they are only seen using basic spells called \u201ccharms\u201d. Their communication, though much more advanced than the setting, relies on a magic sphere on two users\u2019 ends, acting more like a phone than anything magical. Though what we see is limited, it shines due to how it\u2019s used. Toyohisa and the gang use the Octobrists\u2019 magic in interesting ways to serve their needs, showing how easily they adapt to foreign concepts. Spells the Octobrists thought of only for defense are used offensively to surprise and crush the enemy. Even the communication orb was used primarily as a \u201crecording diary\u201d before the Drifters came along! I prefer this creative use of magic over the typical mage/wizard roles seen in fantasy shows.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say this show is free from absurd magic. The Ends are characters that have \u201cgiven up their humanity\u201d for strong magical power. This is seen in Jeanne D\u2019 Arc, who has incredible fire magic, and Toshizou, who uses ghost warriors to assist him in battle. Most interesting is the dreaded Black King, who has power over cellular replication that can heal/hurt single targets almost instantly. What makes these powers exciting is how they\u2019ve been given to the villains, not the heroes. Wits dominate fights against the Ends and seeing how the Drifters turn the tide in battle is a lot of fun to watch. Fans of JoJo Part 2: Battle Tendency will adore these fights, as Toyohisa parallels Joseph Joestar. There\u2019s nothing in Drifters that will make you rethink battles, but there are a few surprises that kept me wanting to watch the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nDrifters has an interesting lot of characters, which is its strength and one of its problems. I find there are too many of them for this short first season and they didn\u2019t need to be here this early on. Characters like Butch Cassidy and Naoshi Kanno really had no reason being here. They may have turned the tide in the battle they were present in, minor as it was, but they\u2019re never really seen beyond this. I\u2019m sure all the Drifters will meet up eventually to take down the Black King\u2019s army, but they didn\u2019t need to be present at this time. This time could\u2019ve been use for more focus on the main trio, in particular Yoichi. Despite being labeled as a main character, Yoichi doesn\u2019t get a whole lot of time or emphasis compared to Oda or Toyohisa. I saw Toyohisa\u2019s warrior life in action in and outside of fights and I saw the humor mixed with dark cunning of Oda. Save for a brief moment talking to his old leader, Yoshitsune, Yoichi felt more like a strong supporting character. I hope that more insight will be given to him.\\n\\n\r\nHumor is another thing Hirano and I generally disagree on. In Hellsing, ugly chibi-looking characters would break the ice at the wrong time and would be a lot cruder than what I like. This returns in Drifters, but I find it\u2019s been toned down a bit. The toilet humor seems less prevalent in these scenes. Though one of Hannibal\u2019s first \u201cjokes\u201d is that he can\u2019t control his bladder, it\u2019s a bit more understandable as he\u2019s very old (though I still could\u2019ve done without it). The humor mainly focuses on references to Japanese war history. This isn\u2019t my strong suit, so moments like the Drifters\u2019 first meetup in Episode 1 went over my head. That said, they normally are quick off-hand jokes, so they don\u2019t fill up the show as much as they give a wink to a history loving audience.\\n\\n\r\nDrifters\u2019 art is what you\u2019d expect from Hirano. Characters have large ringed irises for eyes, thick jagged lines make their outlines, and shadows that cover their face (save for a single eye) are all present. It\u2019s a style that\u2019s distinctly his and works great for his action series. Of course, the series also includes Hirano\u2019s \u201cugly faces\u201d he uses for comedy but it\u2019s not as bad here. Maybe because there\u2019s less poop drawings or perhaps I\u2019ve grown accustomed to it. The animation team at Hoods Drifters Studio did a fair job. They use CG models at times (such as the soldiers) and it\u2019s not the most fluid, but it\u2019s not bad by any means. Sometimes it\u2019s even in their favor - I like the \u201crough sketch\u201d animatic look in the opening, more so than the cheap animation tweens that accompany it. The music of the series is upbeat rock and fits the action well. One track I like in particular starts as a flute track played through an old radio before becoming a strange Middle Eastern sounding piece. I didn\u2019t care for the \u201clazy cool\u201d vocals (with the \u201caw yeahs\u201d in the verses) and sound of the opening and I do not like Kurosaki\u2019s vocals for the ED (the acoustic guitar in the final episode was a welcome change). The seiyuus all did a fine job, though none here stood out in particular for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Drifters a 6.5/10. I didn\u2019t care too much for Hellsing, so I was surprised as to how much I liked Drifters. If you liked Hellsing, or perhaps Hirano\u2019s style in general, this is a must-watch. Those looking for a fun action series akin to JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure will also appreciate this show. Drifters is a bit fantastic in concept and occasionally campy, but it was a fun watch and I certainly wouldn\u2019t mind viewing a second season.\\n\\n\r\nDo you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day!",

            "content": "Much like a beautifully wrapped Christmas present with a swarm of angry bees inside, Drifters looks fantastic but starts to get a little problematic the second you start trying to unpack it. I will elaborate as to why below, but if you are looking for a straightforward recommendation than in my opinion the good outweighs the bad and it is at the very least an entertaining viewing experience. If you liked Hellsing or other such gory, mindless, high octane romps, you will probably enjoy this too. But if you're watching it at all critically, you might find some problems.\r\nStory: Is really pretty fun and engaging.Famous figures from history are taken at the moment before their deaths and thrust into a Tolkien-esque high fantasy world inhabited with elves, dwarves, dragons, and other fantasy staples. And also by humans who, with the exception of one group of fairly annoying individuals who seem thus-far to be a semi-monastic community of stage magicians, are apparently universally racist assholes. The \"good\" ones among them are called Drifters, the \"bad\" are called Ends, and they fight each other with a blend of dumb-fun magic and militarily tactics that is very reminiscent of playing Dynasty Warriors. And in case you were wondering, Adolph Hitler is still just as much of a dickhead in any universe in which he finds himself. And there is also a portrait of him that is TERRIFYING!\\n\\n\r\nArt: Speaking of evocative visual imagery, this show has it in spades. The art design and execution is unequivocally the strongest aspect of the show. Everything is very dark and murky, and it is either washed out and lifeless or vibrant and arresting to suit the mood. The action is great and the character designs all look pretty great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Thank God they all look great, because they are way more of a mixed bag when it comes to their characterization. The main character, Toyohisa, is a cool intense badass samurai, but he is sort of boring in the way that Superman is boring because he is pretty much invulnerable. Of the other two mains Nobunaga is actually pretty great and my favorite character on the show; he is a great blend of funny critique of Nobunaga Oda as historical figure and wacky anime guy in crazy anime world. He is clearly having a great time, which makes him fun to watch. Yoichi, the other (semi)prominent lead, is kind of just an archer who kills things with archery. Cool but vanilla.\\n\\n\r\nSome of the villains are also pretty interesting in the context of the historical figures they represented. At one point I was like \"yeah I guess Joan of Arc might be a little pissed about getting lit on fire.\" That was an entertaining tangent. The identity of the main villain will probably piss some people off a whole bunch, but I though it was a pretty neat examination of a controversial historical figure. Most I can say without unnecessary spoilers. \\n\r\nA lot of the side-characters are pretty annoying and problematic, particularly Tits Magee the world's lamest magician friend who is there to get molested and degraded and the swishy camp gay Count who is a backstabbing, manipulative, rapy, shitdumpster of a person which we know because he is gay.\\n\r\nThis character in particular was the perfect example of the biggest problem about the show for me: many of the almost constant jokes fell way flat. This one also managed to fall flat and be remarkably offensive. If he had been funny I would have probably though he was fucking fabulous. He wasn't. Instead we are just left with almost direct quote that because something is inherently wrong with homosexuals as people, it makes them A.) Want to fuck each other, and B.) be awful, awful people. Not as part of a joke. Just as a statement. That was pretty icky to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nAll in all, this show feels OLD. The jokes feel old, the story is about olden times, the main cast is markedly older than the majority of anime casts, and the target audience appears to be people who like Tolkien but also really enjoy reading world history textbooks in their spare time (which is, I guess, kinda me). If you catch all the references to history, you might think its pretty funny at times. Otherwise you'll just think it looks good and has cool action. It does. Watch it if that's all you care about. I enjoyed it despite it pissing me off, albeit infrequently.",

            "content": "As a huge fan of  Kouta Hirano\u00b4s earlier work Hellsing, I was really excited to dig my teeth into his new work Drifters. I didn\u00b4t how ever have my hopes to high, due to that Hellsing Ultimate is one of my favorite shows so far, and it would be really hard to do something equally amazing. Hence it will be a lot of comparison between the two in my review. But how did \"Drifters\" delivered in my opinion? I will get down to that now.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nUnlike \"Hellsing\" the story of \"Drifters\" takes place in a fantasy world full of elf's, dwarfs, magicians, goblins andso on. The drifters are moved to this world from our own through a world-less corridor on the verge of death by a quite weird looking guy in glasses. They are all real famous historical personas (such as Oda Nobunaga, Shimazu Toyohisa, Hannibal and so on). The \"evil\" versions of the drifters is called \"ends\" and are also historical famous personas such as Jeanne d\u00c1rc, Rasputin and so on. Elf\u00b4s and dwarfs has been forced to live in slavery and oppression by the humans, and with the help of the drifters (the warroir Toyohisa, the tactician Nobunaga and sneaky Yoichi) they make their move for liberation. But the \"Ends\" and their leader The Black King has their own plan for this world and a three way war is instigated. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the layout of the story - I quite like it. It\u00b4s not the most original out there, but it\u00b4s interesting enough to keep me watching and actually care of the plot. This is just the first season so many questions will still be there in the end of this season. Like who is the Black King? What made Jeanne d\u00c1rc so evil? What Easy\u00b4s and Murasaki\u00b4s beef all about? This is questions that will not be answered in this first part. There is a heavy focus on war strategy and a lot of talk of it the show. If that stuff bores you.. well, this could be a heavy watch. I found it quite interesting due to the psychological point of view. How much of war that depends on how we play on each others emotions - it made the war scenes more realistic. And as expected of a work from  Kouta Hirano it\u00b4s a lot of violence, blood and gore. I will for shore dig into the manga now to see how this develops from here. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nAs of expected of an 2016 anime, the art is very good. Drifters actually got it\u00b4s own studio just to produce it - that\u00b4s say something. You can clearly see the similarities between the art in Drifters and Hellsing - especially the characters designs. I am actually quite a fan of that particular style, I was glad to see it on screen again. It\u00b4s very colorful with distinct blackened lines. The eyes and hairs of the characters are what could called a hallmark for Kouta Hirano. Some scenes can feel a bit blurry to all that is going on but hey.. War is a mayham so that didn\u00b4t bother me to much. And of course their is a couple of great action scenes. The scenery is often well drawn and the characters fits nicely in to the background.  \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\nI absolutely love the opening. I actually listen to it daily now. It\u00b4s adrenaline, funky rock song that suites the show and it\u00b4s characters very well. The ending is quite nice as well if note less original. The overall soundtrack is well suited and often manages to highlight the mood of the scene or coolness of the character in the spotlight. All music wasn\u00b4t my coop of tea, but I can see how it fits the show. I watch the dubbed and I think the VA\u00b4s mostly did a great job. I love Robert McCollum and he voices Oda Nobunaga and does it greatly. Mostly the VA\u00b4s manages to catch the essence of their character and bringing life to them. Had a slightly problem with Omis VA - she had a very squicky voice that could be hard to listen to sometimes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10\\n\r\nIt\u00b4s a lot of characters in Drifters, many of them appears interesting and most of them don\u00b4t get the screen time they deserve (many of the ends mostly). For the three mains they differ a bit in quality but are for shore vivid. For a 12 episode anime it\u00b4s hard for the characters to really develop, so the development is very limited. As in Hellsing most of the characters are adults, not teenagers with hormonal problems. They know what and who they are and just go from there. Toyohisa actually remained me of Eren from Attack on Titan - as he may be in he\u00b4s 30\u00b4s. Both his looks and passionate speeches was something that remained med of him (without the anger issues). Nobunaga is a coldblooded war tactician and a conqueror of land and men - it\u00b4s what he does best and advances his position with. Yoichi hasn\u00b4t had much of a background exploration and are mostly there to look very cute and blast arrows into people. Hope he\u00b4s evolves more in season two. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the side\u00b4s, its a broad variation of interesting and bland characters. I find the Ends as very interesting but as said before, very little screen time to really making them into great antagonists/villains. I slight minus for me was the lack of badass female characters (Jeane d\u00c1rc and Anastasia a aside), which Helling had loads of. Come on it\u00b4s a three way war - it is certainly room for at least one ore two. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nIt wasn\u00b4t Helling but I really enjoyed watching this piece anyway. Crazy characters, violence, liberation movements and revenge is always a winning concept for me. I watch it all in just a couple of days time and enjoyed most of it. Some of the comedy felt misplaced and some was nailed - as i most anime. For not to mention the awesome opening, It\u00b4s worth to watch by it lonesome.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIt was a good anime experience for shore. It didn\u00b4t bring anything new or very original to the plate, but managed to be entertaining anyway. If you like seinens/actions like Hellsing you most likely will dig this piece. I will for shore take a look where this is going. I liked the preemies and the show has potential to grow a lot and become something more.",

            "content": "Our whole society is made by war. Something that has been in the human blood for thousands of years. That is how we solve our problems and differences. Drifters is based on war. Just as a warning to all those who don't like violence & profanity, you might not want to watch this anime.\r\nStory: 8/10.\r\nThe story is based on the greatest warriors that have ever lived. When they died fighting, insted of dying like normal people they were sent to another world by a man named Murasaki. In the other world different mythical races exist, like elves, dwarfs, dragons and others. The drifters as theyare called by the people in the other world, were sent to fight someone called the Ends. The Ends is someone who wants to destroy this world, however Murasaki is trying to stop this from happening by sending drifters. The story escalates from here and the drifters try to assemble a army to defeat the Ends. \\n\\n\r\nI think this story is fascinating. We get to see important historical figures placed in the same timeline and fight as a team. There is also questions to be asked. Who is Murasaki and the Ends? And if there is other worlds in all the other doors. (you will know what I mean when you watch the show)\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10.\\n\r\nThe art has two sides to it. One side where everyone is serious and bodyparts is going everywhere. And there is the times where the series gets a comedic vibe. Their faces go from serious to goofy. And I think that makes the anime a lot more enjoyable to watch. instead of watching fights and stuff all the time, we get to have a break with a little comedy sketch. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10.\\n\r\nMusic great!\\n\r\nVoiceactors great!\\n\r\nSound great!\\n\r\nEverything feels like they belong. The background music in the anime has a nice and historical sound to it and it gives the viewers the right vibe. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9/10.\\n\r\nToyohisa Shimazu: a warrior from the 1600. He is a incredible samurai and loves to chop off peoples heads with one swing. Truly art.\\n\r\nNobunaga Oda: a warlord who conquered most of Japan around 20 years before Toyohisa in 1580. He is a great military leader and have lead armies with over 200.000 people in it.\\n\r\nYoichi Suketaka Nasu: the guy who everyone thinks is a girl untill we are halfway through the anime. He is a cool character tho, with great archery skills. He is btw from a time 400 years before the others.\\n\r\nAll really likeable characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10.\\n\r\nThis is a anime that you really can enjoy to the fullest. We get to see war and killing and tactics and elves and dwarfs and much action. Can't really go wrong with that. The story is incomplete, but when you finish the first season you want to watch more. That is how I felt. I wanted to start on the second season as fast as possible. So to me this was a anime that I really enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10.\\n\r\nSome may think that 9/10 is too high for this anime. But I don't agree. I though that this anime deserves a lot more recognition. Although it might just seem too violent sometimes, it is how it's supposed to be. I recommend this anime to anyone who loves history, samurai, war/action and some fantasy.",

            "content": "I\u2019m throwing this out here, the Japanese sure are obsessed with Isekai related works. The concept of being transferred to a fantasy world where the use of swords and magic is commonplace is noticeable in Drifters. Many light novels and manga are based around this setting, due to the fact there are more constraints associated with the regular world. How does Drifters differentiate itself from other series that use the Isekai format? \r\nThe answer is it doesn\u2019t, the plot is relatively straightforward with it being a large-scale war fought by two opposing sides. The Drifters along with the support of the Octobrist organisation are pittedagainst the Ends led by the notorious Black King. The Black King whose identity is shrouded in mystery, vows to destroy the world completely by erasing all types of civilisations to form his new empire. Complete destruction for a new foundation isn\u2019t unheard of but this goal of his doesn\u2019t come off as being unique.\\n\\n\r\nThe main characters are the Drifters in question opposed to the End\u2019s planned conquest of the world. The drifters in this show are highly regarded historical figures who seemingly on the brink of death, find themselves in the inconvenient situation of participating in this deadly conflict. The series focuses on Japanese figureheads with the likes of Oda Nobunaga sticking out like a sore thumb. The drifters before entering the new world are randomly transported into a white corridor, with Murasaki a generic salaryman waiting for them. \\n\\n\r\nThis man who radiates ambiguity is known to be playing a game with some childish lady named Easy, who is in control of the Ends. The whole plot is based on Murasaki with his drifters duking it out with the Ends whose strings are being pulled by that of Easy\u2019s.  The whole process of entering the white corridor is unexplained making it a genuine concern of mine and hopefully it is cleared up eventually.\\n\\n\r\nDrifters is an action-fest with many episodes falling under two categories \u2013 battle preparation and plan execution. The Drifters who are foreign entities have been given death warrants by the Ends and are known to be a taboo among the common populace which includes elves and dwarves. You\u2019ll see many episodes of pure uncensored fighting that involves the drifters but to me has no substance until they get the information regarding the current situation. \\n\\n\r\nOnce the drifters realise who their true enemies are, the plot rapidly advances with the most intriguing aspects coming in the pre-battles. There was an occasion where the drifters ran out of guns for the excess gunpowder the group made. The clever Oda Nobunaga devised a plan in which he would make replica guns through the expertise blacksmithing provided by the Dwarves, it\u2019s a generic stereotype that had me smiling due to its practical nature. It\u2019s aspects like these that make this show a compelling series to watch instead of it being branded as being mindless action-fest.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is character-driven with not much screen time going to actual worldbuilding. The lack of exposition regarding the world bothers me considering there are so many topics to discuss about. The Ocktobrist organisation are known to be siding with the drifters and its members are the deployed with the task of protecting said drifters. The Japanese figureheads Shimazu and co are accompanied by Olminu who is a specialist in defensive wall magic. The reasoning behind the existence of Ocktobrist is unclear, all we know is they are allies of the drifters which may have been instigated by Murasaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe drifters entering the fantasy world will have dramatic effects on the land they occupy. The Orte empire is well informed of this fact and will persecute anyone who are convicted of helping the drifters. The Elves helping Shimazu to safety resulted in their village being razed to the ground. The slaughter that ensued between the drifters and Orte soldiers sets up later events. The drifters take command of the remaining Elves to retaliate against the empire who essentially regard most demi-human species as trash. A lot of this show manages to involve conflicts not related to the Ends making it feel insignificant in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that needs to be stressed is the selection process needed to become a drifter or end which depends on the person\u2019s allegiance. The people who end up in this world are so random which suggests they are hand chosen by the game players Murasaki and Easy. The drifters can range from a glorified Punic military commander to an average Japanese WWII kamikaze pilot. Murasaki picking just Japanese and American historical figures is surely disadvantageous. \\n\\n\r\nWhy limit yourself when you can choose stronger fighters in Sparta and Genghis Khan? At least Easy has some variation in choosing people like Jeanne D\u2019Arc. \\n\r\nGoing on to the technical aspects of the show, it is animated by Hoods Drifters Studio who are newly formed. The animation is superb and has exceeded my initial expectations considering there are few instances of poor animation. The fact that it is does not use 3D modelling or the like was a concern of mine with military shows. I wish Berserk (2016) got animated by these guys\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe art style needs to be addressed, as the show incorporates a lot of supposed \u2018comedy\u2019 which I don\u2019t find to be funny as it\u2019s usually a miss on most occasions. The use of chibi versions of characters to save on production costs kind of backfired for my enjoyment. The comedy could have been limited but then again, the show would just be action-packed throughout so is understandable but still crap in my opinion. The colour palette is very dim and murky with it being lightless on many occasions. The blackish appearance is repetitively used with no colour variations being applied.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound for an action focused series must be of high quality to contribute to my immersion which is key to my enjoyment. The soundtrack delivered in my opinion with it encompassing a lot of heavy hitting rock music that just oozes passion, combined with the stellar action sequences just makes for an entertaining experience. Some of the music pieces such as \u201cChakra Destiny\u201d are capable being listened to by themselves and are just brilliant as insert music for the show.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve come to the opinion that I do find the Drifters anime to be an unfinished project. There are so many unanswered questions waiting to be resolved which can\u2019t be done in a single cour time frame. The technical aspects of the show are solid to say the least but the plot is evidently weaker in many departments but still makes for a fun show. Hopefully the second season can answer my questions, as right now the show is leaving me in the dark for the most part.\\n",

            "content": "Drifters is a really great anime with an a special but attractive atmosphere.\r\nThere is a gripping story and i didn't see time pass when following it. We can learn more and more about the world at each episode and the different points of view of each character issued from differents times in history allow us to reflect on a lot of aspects of our culture and history. Personnaly I tried to understand the story with my own eyes and my culture and then with what each character could feel (by seeing a gun for the first time for exemple) and i warmly recommend to trywatching it 2 times. All the story is great, why are poeple going to another world? Who are the poeple who pull the strings? All of this make me want more... A lot more. The comic relief is also important and there is never too much of it but it keep the story well ballanced and I had some good laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is amazing and the sounds are incredibles, the artistic side of drifters is without a doubt one of the strongest points that you can find immediatly. The openning is one of my favorites of all times, the fighting music coupled with the animations and sounds effects, that made me think of a manga (paper version), are really good. You can hear that theses are good music but there are never too much of it and you can fully enjoy the animations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are great, we can appreciate the main characters & their a little bit forced personnality on some points but in never goes to the too clich\u00e9 that i have seen in a lot of anime. But the greatest characters are, in my opinion, the antagonists, I see most of them as heroes of ourr history that had a awfull end and that why they've become bad guys and I want to know a lot more about them and their feelings.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end i had an amazing moment watching drifters in only one day and i reccomend it to everybody.",

            "content": "This show starts off strong and slowly goes down as the plot gets explained.\r\nSorry if the review is too long, I took notes as I went. \r\nThe story is about if great warriors, generals, and general famous people throughout time, instead of dying, were transported to a fantasy land. These people are called Drifters. The Drifters are brought to this world to save it from the Ends. Ends are just evil Drifters basically. There is kind of a re:creators gimmick here where someone could be historically good in the real world and be on the evil side in the fantasy world and vice versa. Thereseems to be a time when Ends and Drifters worked together? It is kinda unclear. Also, Drifters are taken from all eras of time.... at the same time. However, none of the later-in-time Drifters or Ends seem to know about any of the Drifters that would have come before them in history. No one knows Nobunaga, really? No one knows Hannibal, really? \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is an interesting choice. Everyone's eyes are weird but you get used to them. The action is bloody and, while not fully animated in most scenes, gets the point across. All of the character designs are great. One huge thing is that it does not seem like the studio knows how to draw women's faces. The only real women main character, while well endowed, has pretty much the same face as the guy elves or any other non rugged man characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are where the show shines. After all, the creators get to play around with historical figures. We follow mostly a merry band of Drifters, made up of historical Japanese figures, as they tear through everyone. They are of course the strongest even though, for some reason, the Ends all have super powers while the Drifters are just super charismatic and good fighters. There are also too many characters for the show to handle. But that does not stop the show from introducing characters up until the last episode. There is a WWII Japanese pilot Drifter who is good for a couple jokes, but is forgotten by the story outside of a shot in the OP. There are also a couple of cowboy Drifters that only show up a couple times. \\n\\n\r\nThe story feels half finished and is definitely setting up for a second season. That being said it was a very easy and fast paced watch. If you are looking for a big dumb action anime, this is a good junk food show to snack on, but will be forgotten in history as dinner rolls around.",

            "content": "(NOTE: Some spoilers, mostly minor.)\r\nAnybody who has seen Kouta Hirano's other famous work, Hellsing, will not be very surprised nor disappointed going into his next one, Drifters: Lots of action, badass shots of the characters, and not a ton of plot.\r\nThe story begins when Shimazu Toyohisa, a fighter in the great Battle of Sekigahara, is taken from his death in the battle at the last moments by a mysterious desk clerk in a world of infinite hallways, sending him to a mysterious world and averting his death. In this unnamed world he meets two other famous Japanese historical figures, Oda Nobunaga and Nasu no Yoichi,and begin to carve out a name for themselves in this world populated by fantasy races and humans alike by saving a nearby elven village and going from there.\\n\\n\r\nAlong the way, the main plot comes into focus of people like Toyohisa, sent from Earth at their moment of death into the world, as \"Drifters\", who must fight the \"Ends\", figures similiarly ripped away but often from worse circumstances and working towards the end of the world for humans under, naturally, Jesus Christ.\\n\\n\r\nThe main three characters are all good enough, Oda in particular is great and while Yoichi can be boring just being the snarky one of the group works out well and Toyohisa is over the top bloodthirsty in a great way. The problem more comes from the side characters, which largely range on the annoying end of the scale. \\n\\n\r\nOlminu particularly gets a lot of issues for this, as her spot on the show is essentially two things: boob jokes and being the one surprised by whatever the main characters do. I don't mind some boob jokes, but they often are used simply to break the pace and have little variety, which works into another issue of the show I will get to. Hannibal particularly irks me, I'm a bit of a historical fan of Hannibal, and seperating him from Scipio so early ultimately ends up making him feel superflous and their little stuff irrelevant.\\n\\n\r\nCount Saint Germi is probably the most annoying, as most of his screentime is dedicated to fairly poorly done gags about being a drag queen, and to have a way to resolve season 1's plot easy. Not only do the jokes fall flat, it has a very serious issue in that it denies us any true cool villain to work with the Orte Empire (basically the early villains) and leaves us basically with nameless grunts, which is a pretty big disappointment. \\n\\n\r\nHellsing already had plenty of oddly placed comedies, but the worst thing about Drifters assuredly is its comedic elements, or rather, its comedic TIMING: Many small gags are thrown into tense situations and mostly serve to annoyingly break tension when it should not be broken, and often times annoyed me, not to mention the jokes falling flat as much as they hit.\\n\\n\r\nThe battles in this are cool, but a lot of it is more tense army battle/strategy than cool, showy fights: It lacks some of the flash of Hellsing, which makes me prefer Hellsing more in that regard, although it has a better story foundation than Hellsing. Two things that must be praised are the art, which is pretty high quality, and the very nice music and sound, with the musical talents from Hellsing coming over for some quite nice pieces.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want a standard action series, then Drifters isn't bad in that regard, and it is overall enjoyable, but it doesn't rise much outside of this and has some rather notable flaws. Season two will be interesting to see how it improves.",

These men will wage war against the dark forces of that world, fighting alongside goblins, elfs, witches and humans in order to savethe pople of that world.\\n\r\nThe story does have plot holes and flaws but I will not go into details since I am too lazy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nThe characters are a bit generic but they have interesting personalities, unfotunately they do not get any development.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe animation is fluid with nice art and character design. There are some flaws but you will only notice them if you search for them.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nDrifters has a great opening theme and a decent ending theme but not very good\u00a0 background music which is absolutely necessary in a show of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nFor some reason I loved watching Drifters.

            "content": "From the very first episode it showed greatness and at least for me it delivered.\r\nWith a wide range of different and interesting characters, great visuals and a pretty solid plot, it was one of the best anime in 2016.\r\nThe cast are all historical figures and asides the main plot of \"kill all the bad guys\" they have a deeper one which wasn't revealed that well in the first season. It plays along like a typical shonen anime with fights and progressing the story but it feels so much more alive, especially with the exagerrated characters. Now the one downside for some people is the comedyaspect of the anime and that there is too much of it, breaking the enjoyement, but it didn't annoy me at all.\\n\\n\r\nAn outstanding part that just left me in awe was the strategy behind the battles. And I'm not talking about deep military strategy but more of the intense fights where, in a normal anime, you'd expect swords to clash until someone wins but here they use different methods, anything at all to win. My first surprise was when the guy threw his sword in a fight just to knee another guy in the face, it was pure bliss and at that moment I knew I was in it for the long run.\\n\\n\r\nYou can check out my video review about it here, all love appreciated:\\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS1GHuNa-ko",

            "content": "When I started to watch drifters I didnt have so many expectations because I had seen a review on the internet and there had said that it was a good anime but that wasnt a big deal, but when I started watching it I noticed that this review was totally wrong, drifters is a big deal, even with a not very good art the anime is very good, the studio that produced drifters is small and didnt have much money to invest, and with the low budget they had managed to produce a better anime than several anime made by big companies, but we willanalyze in parts starting with the story\\n\\n\r\nStory: Our protagonist is Shimazu Toyohisa, during the war of sekigahara he is seriously injured and when walking is in a place with several doors and is dragged to one of them and so begins the story, to be honest the story is not so complex and developed, The anime makes clear that the goal is to show brutal fights with a lot of blood and is something that anime does very well. Well, to explain better the objective of the anime without spoiler, it is the following toyohisa was brought to this world and there met several people who went through the same process these people are called drifters and they face the ends people that just as they were brought From another world but looking only for death and destruction, the job of the drifters is to prevent the ends from destroying the world, see? The story is very simple and is nothing complex, in this world there are several races, such as elves, dwarves and so on. The story of drifters shows the constant struggle between drifters and ends with lots of blood and fucking fights, which for me leaves the anime very good.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Now for anime art, well that part of the anime is very weak, but for me it is something that can be explained by the low budget of the studio, was more focused on the development of history and the struggles than having a perfect visual and an undeveloped anime, For me the anime just isnt note 10 because of the art, so I think, imagine if the anime was produced by the madhouse or another big company? It was going to be one of the best anime of the year easily, the visual isnt so good and often some characters seem a bit harsh and not so organic, but even with these defects fights are pleasurable to be seen and art no longer compromises both the Anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound:The soundtracks are good and refers to samurai songs, and the opening music is very fucking, in the fights not much background music, but this in no way compromises the satisfaction of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The best of anime, all the characters are many charismatics and there are many famous figures portrayed there, obviously most are famous figures of japan, but there are many that you will recognize, I can not say some examples because it is spoiler ... Good talking about Toyohisa is for me the most fucking anime in terms of battle, he is very strong, he has a high sense of justice and only does what he thinks right besides he follows many ideas that he himself imposed or That his father taught, in the fights he turns into a madman, leaving many times over a hundred enemies, when it comes to battles he is a genius, the other is an archer called Yoichi, to be honest the first time I saw him, I thought he was a woman, but he's actually a man. Yoichi is also very strong and very talented with a bow in hand, he also carries a story that tries to overcome, of the 3 he is the one that appears least and that stands out, even though it is very charismatic. The last one is Oda Nobunaga, who is super intelligent and is a God when it comes to strategies, he is very spiteful and is a very remarkable character, not a good guy, he plans to destroy the enemy even if he makes the enemy suffer , Does not care for methods to annihilate enemies, is also has a very corrupt personality, he plans to make toyohisa a king, because he sees that toyohisa is totally different from him, with no interests in money or power. There are several other characters who take part in the plot, but if it were to quote everyone it would take a lot of time and give spoilers, but there is another character worth mentioning, Olmine, is a woman who always supports oda, she is a beautiful character and is a mage, also helped the toyohisa in their struggles as well as helped the yoichi, as well as the other 3 that I mentioned, she is very charismatic too.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I liked the anime a lot, and watched it all in about 10 hours, it's been a while since I've watched an anime all over again, it captivates the person to watch more, I hope for the second season, because there are still many things to be explored, these 12 Episodes could be about 30% of the story, would give a couple more seasons quietly, if you watch Drifters and have no scene that makes you like him you're crazy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: The 8 that I gave was solely because the graphic isnt so good and the story also isnt so well made and explained, but if it improved the art would be a 10 easily, Drifters is an anime that I highly recommend for those who like the genre war and Strategies well elaborated, as well as those who like a lot of blood, you who complains of animes with little blood and many censors, watch drifters, I guarantee you will like.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

The characters have the same macho vibe as that of Hellsing's, only far less impressive. That is not to say they were boring or terrible, but were miles away from the intimidating, intriguing and polished characters that populated Hellsing Ultimate.\r\nThe setting is good with a lot of different high-fantasy races and kingdoms. Having legendary heroes from different times in the real world fight in this fantasy world is a nice inventive touch. But the plot suffers from lack of novelty or finesse. Hellsing Ultimate didn't have much for plotbut it was show-cased gracefully. Whereas Drifters finds itself lost from having too many players and too little complexity. Nonetheless it has its fair share of interesting moments that keeps you engaged.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion the show could do well to slash down the main/supporting characters by two thirds , for they feel like fillers. Also, it seems the show tries hard to emulate Hellsing that it feels kind of lame at times. Spends way too much time on trumpeting and awing over each of the characters than necessary. I find myself growing tired of all the boasting and posing and evil grins over every tiny little thing by the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll the glaring negative aside, I did enjoy this show because of its brisk pace and a premise with great potential. The antagonists seem powerful enough to keep you looking for more showdowns. The art and animation for the most part are very much similar to Hellsing Ultimate. Comedy is kinda hit and miss. \\n\\n\r\nWhat I expect more from future episodes: Less talk , Way fewer people, More action. Depending on how it goes I might be inclined to change my rating",

I've been excited for this.\r\nAs a lot of people have mentioned, it has a real Hellsing feel, especially Ultimate, some people may love that about it and some may not. Personally, since Ultimate is one of my all time favourites, I love it. \r\nThe art is dark and sharp, which fits the feel of the anime perfectly.\r\nToyohisa Shizamu is fighting for his clan when he is fatally wounded and from then on he's consistently confused. He appears in a place with a man that sends him through a door, on the brink of death he's found by a pair of villagers who carryhim to where they think he may belong. \\n\r\nHe wakes up to meet Nobunaga Oda and Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, both of which upon learning their names he remembers, but one died 18 years ago and the other over 400 years ago, so instead of his questions being answered he's left more confused than before.\\n\\n\r\nIt's not all death, blood and guts. They make the effort to have comedic parts where they fit perfectly and give you nice little laughs.\\n\r\nThe feel of uprising and war is great, you find yourself anxious, anticipating what the Drifters and other parties will do. What will be the next move? What is the point of all this and why are they here? \\n\\n\r\nIf you don't enjoy gore, more so excessive blood, you probably won't enjoy this. But if you love a good blood splatter then you'll definitely enjoy it. \\n\\n\r\nI was really impressed and I'm glad it lived up to my expectations. The characters are great, you feel the eras they came from in how they act and speak, yet they mesh together nicely and even though they may clash, they respect each other. The hilarity of their minor conflicts is mixed in perfectly and made me love each of them even more.\\n\r\nThe action carries all the way through, building up to the ending which leaves you satisfied yet excited for the second season. The war has just begun, and it will be incredible.",

But what exactly are they fighting and who is the strange man in the middle standing behind a desk?\r\nDisclaimer: If you wish upon a short summery, read the last paragraph.\r\nStory----8/10----\r\nThe story is introduced by following Toyohisa Shimazu-chan as he is effortlessly beheading his enemies. The tides turned on him and his clan, leading to a tactical retreat. However, Toyohisa say fuck it, and decides to take the head of the general from the opposingclan. He is somewhat successful but to the price of lethal wounds. Walking toward his death because open wounds and blood loss, suddenly he is taken to another world and thrown into a world of unknown and asked to save it. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I love this story idea, it's something I have been dying to see and now it is here. We are introduced to a number of different famous generals, leaders, fighters that have walked this earth. The one that come to this world are called Drifters. An unknown antagonist is also introduced with mysterious followers that hold the same or even greater power than the Drifters but are strangely alike.\\n\\n\r\nOne may think that the story develops a bit slow, and there is just this huge atmosphere of \"I don\u2019t know what's going on but it\u2019s epic\" for a couple of episodes but then it turns to a \"This is hella epic I just want to see Toyohisa all the time.\"\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the pacing can be seen as slow for some people, however I wanna deny that and say the pacing is almost perfect, almost.\\n\\n\r\nArt----10/10----\\n\r\nI love the art and the animation is really good in my opinion. The art style is perfect for the show and somehow it\u2019s really pleasing for the eye to watch. It also correspond with the manga art-style so the anime really feels like an actual adaptation instead of something else. From my POV, the animations were all good, I didn\u2019t notice any major failures, but from experience there is probably a few scenes lacking in the sense of good animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound----9/10----\\n\r\nI didn't really pay that much attention to the sound like I'd do to other animes, but it was good, the voice actors did a great job, Nakamura Yuuichi did an awesome job with Toyohisa as well as Uchida Naoya for Nobunaga to state an example.\\n\\n\r\nOST and OP were good, especially the opening. I had the feeling of loss every time they skipped the opening and the background music to the fight that happened were all fitting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter----9/10----\\n\r\nI won't say much here, I enjoyed all the 3 protagonists and they were showcased with their own set of problems from before they became Drifters. The voice actors did a great job, but instead of \"the voice made the character\" it became more like the voice actors enhanced the character and improving them and giving them more depth.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment----10/10----\\n\r\nFor me this was one of the top contenders for Best Anime Fall 2016, in the aspect of enjoyment and how appealing the story, plot and art is, as well as, the outstanding job by the voice actors.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall----9/10----\\n\r\nMy overall objective score will be 8,5/10, rounded to 9/10. To summarize; Outstanding art, appealing story and good plot development, exciting voice acting as well as epic fights and enjoyable comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve come this far, I apologize for grammar mistakes and such. Thank you for reading. :D",

Its premise is that a bunch of famous war figures get transported to another world at the time of their death. A world where they will fight in a BRAND-NEW WORLD WAR, wich seems to be the subtitle of theanime, but nobody really cares about that. \\n\r\n-Yes, it fits in one of the much popular \"transported to another world\" anime tropes, but that doesn\u00b4t stop you from enjoying it.\\n\r\n-After the aforementioned transportation to another world, the show evolves into a bit of a medieval war story, with warfare and all that juicy action.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\n-Let me just say that the art is one of this anime\u00b4s strongest points.\\n\r\n-If you know Kouta Hirano, he\u00b4s the creator of Hellsing, and also the creator of Drifters, so, as expected, this animes has very similar art and character designs to Hellsing, although less refined I would say.\\n\\n\r\nSound:8\\n\r\n-I will only say one thing: SICK OPENING!\\n\r\n-Can\u00b4t even believe they actually used a rock song for the op, it works so well that I just like to hear the music in repeat!\\n\r\n\"Gospel Of Full Throttle\"!!!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7\\n\r\n-I mean, the characters are basically copies of what they were when alive in this world. \\n\r\n-All but  a couple of them. I would say Nobunaga was the one that received more character development and actually went beyond what he was in this world.\\n\r\n-I really wnjoyed the bit of character understanding we got of some of them, including the villains (called Ends), like Joan Of Arc.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:7\\n\r\n-Mindless action fun sometimes, but highly boring at other times.\\n\r\n-The comedy was a little off-putting, and overall unnecessary.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:7\\n\r\n-I\u00b4d say that if you like your action shows, your transported to another world shows, and your historical shows, then Drifters is right up your alley.\\n\r\n-But there are a lot of other better ones in each of these genres.\\n\r\n-Watchable.\\n\r\n7 out of 10",

They do not even try to hide their inspirations, but they clearly use them at their best and often comes up with slightly different takes on the archetypes.\r\nFrom the opening to the recognizable character designs and overall style, and flashy animation, the show dares enough to be interesting and rarely fails. The art and ambiance of an Hellsing cast upon The Lord of the Rings, a mix of classical, nothing really brandnew, but slight touches of well-thought originality here and there, and rather good dialogues.\\n\\n\r\nIt's very drinkable.\\n\\n\r\nAt least for now. There will be many ways to spoil it afterwards, or to give it even more toughness and dares. As good as the story is after the first 12-run, it's only at it's beginning. That's a flaw, somehow.",

The show has got lots of violence, one of thecharacters has massive boobs which they play for comedic effect, and the action scenes and tactics deployed are pretty cool. \\n\\n\r\nThere are two categories of which these historical figures can fall, as a Drifter who has the free will do what they please, and the Ends who died in despair often being betrayed by humanity and want to wipe every human and demi-human off the map. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not bad by any means, but It does not stand out to me either.  It would be nice to see them expand out more on the hero pool they are drawing from in future seasons, as it cool to expand to some other cultures hero's in coming season, specifically for me some native American, African, Chinese, and Korean, but they did pull some more minor picks which were cool to see.\\n\\n\r\nI watched it dubbed and saw no reason to switch so; I would recommend watching it dubbed as they do a fantastic job.\\n",

            "content": "DRIFTERS ANIME REVIEW\r\nWARNING: SPOILER ALERT\r\nOVERALL: 8.8\r\nPLOT: 9/10\r\nIt is a common thing to make a certain hero a protagonist in a story. Someone known or popular which we can relate into. Though that is the norm, that is what we typically saw in a movie, a book or in an anime, this one takes not only one hero but a lot of it. Once they're on a verge of dying, that someone will put them in a certain world where they will become Drifters. Basically, they will become something who drift through time. You will come to see Oda Nobunaga, Hijikata, Shimazu and any other talkingat the same time, breathing the same air. It is an interesting plot for me. Though I don't really know most of the drifters, I am amazed at this series. What more when I've knew all of them? \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAll of them have different kind of craziness in themselves. They view life, death, war differently. They have their own principle which cannot be broken. They have their own strength which they fully excel. Everyone of them have a role only they can fullfill and that is what makes them important. That is what the series make thrilling. The funny side of them is also cute as it is too rare for a story which revolves around bloodshed and war.\\n\r\nANIMATION AND SOUND: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this one is too rough for me. The emotion showing on every character is too powerful and it really is a unique one. At first, I am not sure if I will really like it since I'm not fond on the animation. But I guess, it is the one which attract the one who sees it. It is magnitizing and the action was also also well done. In line with the sound, well, I am really curious on the elven language. It's cute and classy. The voices of the characters is fine with me, the tone and stress of it is exactly how it is supposed to be. About the opening and the ending, I did not really like it but I think it is okay. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\r\nI really did not think that I will enjoy it. The way that the protagonists mind work is too irresistible that you will ask for more. I also love the action on it where the forces who they  subjugate will turn into two once they slice them in half. It's sooo cool. It is also too amazing too see how a great leader and tactician overcome the numbers by using the mind. So yeah, I did enjoy watching this one. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: 8/10\\n\r\nThe ending is too cliffhanger. I want a next season. I want more of it. But what would I expect in a good series? It is always the ending is just a beginning. They've only take one step forward and they have so much more to encounter and they have so much time to grow. \\n",

If your answer to this question is \"that sounds like the most amazing anime ever made\" you will probably like this show. Ifyour answer is \"that sounds stupid and ridiculous\" you will probably not like this show. In this show you will see the likes of Oda Nobunaga, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Joan of Arc, and Hannibal of Carthage fight what is essential an army of medieval Nazis. This is a show that does not take itself seriously and is filled with solid action and animation and has a nice cast of likable and bad ass characters that work off each other really well. This series is also from the creator of Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate. If you want some bloody, fun, and ridiculous action and a show that is pure entertainment, I think Drifters will give you what you want.",

The other main characters are all people from traditional folklore, it's very funnyto see people you know, if you're into history (Not just japanese history.) it will get bonus points. But if you hate history, they're just characters, so it's a win-win.\\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed this anime, I finished it in a single day. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I give it a nine, I usually rate lower than the average, but this show really deserves it. Though I might just be predjudiced because of some historic figure appearing in it... If you want to know who it is, you should go watch it!",

            "content": "Drifters\r\nFor my rating system I did not use the 1-10 scale. I used the 1-5 \"The Little Man\" Scale. For more information check out my profile.\r\nStory: (2)\r\nSo starting off with the weakest part of the whole thing, which is namely the story. For the structure we have a basic plot-driven adventure story. It is told through around 3-4 different arcs. The storytelling itself is rather straightforward explaining a lot of stuff through exposition. It also uses a technique of an increasing scale for the fights. Starting off with a small village and going bigger with each fight. The pacing of the story did not feelrushed however I would say it was certainly fast paced.\\n\r\nEverything up until now sounds rather basic so why the bad rating ?\\n\r\nThe biggest flaw that this show has is it's world-building. It fails on a basic level to make the world around the characters look interesting and at the same time it feels completely uninspired. I mean the author uses the 2001st iteration of Dwarven blacksmiths/fighters and Elven archers. Then we have again goblins dragons and wyverns(cool) and humans. Oh and we have this one good organisation, which is shallow, has no background other that they fight the bad guys and has no reason to be in the story at all, up until this point.\\n\r\nThe second big problem this show has is that it has so much stuff that is either not explained properly or is straight up a plot-hole. Like all the people that come into the Drifters world are at death's door, like Toyohisa was losing a lot of blood and needed instant medical treatment when he came to the new world. So do some Drifters just die when they come to the New World because they were fatally wounded/poisoned in the old world ?\\n\r\nOr why do the \"deities\" pick Drifters/Ends where they don't even know, if they fight for their cause ?\\n\r\nMaybe the story will improve in the second Season, but the problem I already see is that the problems are already in the build-up and so it will be rough to fix some of the stuff.\\n\r\nThere were still 2 things I liked about the story. The first one was the \"between\" world. It was most of the time at the end of episode, so it did not interfere with the flow of the main story, because of that if felt more like an overarching sidestory.\\n\r\nThe other thing was that the battles were rather fought with tactics than with deus-ex Machina writing.(I think this is more credited for the characters however).\\n\r\nThis 2 points still couldn't outweigh the negatives of the story and that is why my rating is negative here.\\n\\n\r\nArt: (5)\\n\\n\r\nLet's start off with the elephant in the room.\\n\r\nThe mangaka for this show is Kouta Hirano. He is the same guy that wrote the Hellsing manga so the artstyles for Drifters and Hellsing are nearly the same. However, other than Hellsing I don't know other anime that use a similar style so it's hard to compare it in that aspect.\\n\r\nHirano  not only uses a similar artstyle then in Hellsing he also uses the same stylistic tools. For example the eyes. They often made the character model or the face black, only leaving out the eyes, which were shining(red-Ends and blue-good guys)\\n\r\nThe battle Animations were fluid, although not highly dynamic since the battles were mostly tactical.\\n\r\nWhat also was noticeable was that there were a lot of closeups of the characters.\\n\r\nFor important scenes they also decided to slow down or stop the motion of the characters to give the scene a bigger impact.\\n\r\nFor the character models of the main cast I think most of them looked fine(besides Yoichi he looked a bit to much like a girl.\\n\r\nFor the backgrounds I think they were slightly above standard, but not great.\\n\r\nThe last point I have is that they switched into a cartoonish sketch for the comedy segment, which was rather funny and an elegant way to save some money for animation.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (4)\\n\\n\r\nThe opening for this show is a really well made electronic Rock&Roll Piece in English by the band Minutes til Midnight.\\n\r\nOn the other side of the each episode, there was a more typical J-Rock ending song.\\n\r\nFor the overall OST of the show I think it was rather good. It was unique, but nothing too spectacular. It was composed by Yasushi Ishii, who did the jazz-rock hybrid parts and Hayato Matsuo, who was responsible for the orchestral parts.\\n\r\nThe voice actors did also a good job in my eyes, stand-outs for me were the ones of Yoichi and Nobunaga.\\n\r\nSo in the end, I can say nothing negative about the soundtrack. I fit the show and gave it a cool feeling.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:(3) for the first season only\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem so far is the lack of a second season where we get more character development. That's why a big portion of the cast feels not fully developed yet.\\n\r\nIn this section there are still a lot more positives than for the story.\\n\r\nI especially liked, for example the pacing of the revelation what the black king's overall goal is.\\n\r\nIt gave him a additional layer as the antagonist, because of that he felt not too generic.\\n\r\nThe good characters also felt well-balanced in terms of strengths and flaws, for example on one hand Toyohisa is really strong, but on the other hand, he has a tendancy to rush in and his warriors honor is not always helpful.\\n\r\nA bit of a problem was the lack of backstory for some characters, since all the Drifters are historic figures it would have been nice to see more about their origins.\\n\r\nFavorite character so far is Nobunaga, because his strategic mindset, his opportunistic personality and his emotional connection to his own past. All those thing make him a well rounded and by far the best character.\\n\r\nOn the other hand, my least favorite character so far would be Haruakira Abe No. For the amount of screentime he has, he is definitely too bland, his motivation is clear, but besides some small details we know little about him.\\n\r\nFor the rest of the cast I think Toyohisa worked well as a leader, he acts smart when it comes to fighting and not just overpowers his enemies. However he lacked emotional depth.\\n\r\nYoichis struggle with his past was also depicted quite nice in a subtle way.\\n\r\nSince half of the Ends had no real impact on the story so far its hard to write about them. However, from the 4 that already had some screentime two definitely need more development and the other two where writen nicely.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: (3)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime tries not just to be cool, but \"really cool\" and badass. However it still can't hide some of its weaknesses, even with its coolness.\\n\r\nWhat I definitely enjoyed the most about this show was the Soundtrack. It felt on point and at the same time unique to stand above the masses. Some tracks you can even listen to outside of the anime like \"Chakra Destiny\". Also the OP \"Gospel of the Throttel\" was quite good. The art was also unique with only Hellsing to compare it directly.\\n\r\nStill the show had some major flaws in the story which leave a sour taste. The characters were also hit and miss. Some were great, some others were pointless and bland.\\n\r\nI hope for the second season that they bring more character development and try to fix some issues with the plot although they cannot fix everything at this point.\\n\r\nHowever, I will still watch the second season when it comes out.",

He's unique in that he has no qualms giving up his own life as long as he can take his enemies' head in the end.  He'll die with a smile on his face and his foe's blood on his sword.  \r\nStory: 7/10\r\nIn the midst of battle, Toyo is mortally wounded and suddenly finds himself in a completely foreign world occupied by elves, dwarves, and monsters. He discovers that he is a Drifter, and other notable warriors, gunslingers,generals, and fighters like him from different eras have been brought to this place to fight in a war against the Ends- other famous historical figures brought to this world with the intent of destroying it.  \\n\\n\r\nThis isn't the most original story, but it's executed well. This show keeps up a quick, exciting pace with great action, and humor and drama is sprinkled in here and there. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nDrifters has a gorgeous, gritty art style. The characters all look absolutely amazing and the fights are really cool to watch. No complaints here. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is especially good. It fits the theme really well and it's just catchy as hell. The soundtrack is good, but nothing extra special. It fits the story perfectly, but I wouldn't bother to listen to it outside of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nPretty much every character in this show is interesting. There are quite a few characters, but all of them are well-designed and not one of them is boring.  The protagonist Toyo and his two main companions, Nobunaga and Yoichi, are really fun to watch and they balance each other very well.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI couldn't wait for a new episode to come out every week. This show gave me exactly what I wanted: thrilling fights, lots of blood, and a story I haven't heard before.",

Only a few factions have been introduced so far, though.\r\nStory seems a bit strange so far - a group of warriors from random times and places are thrust into a world by a mysterious being to fight a different group of warriors from random times and places who werethrust into the same world by a different mysterious being - except the latter group want to destroy humanity.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nEach time I noticed the soundtrack it felt out of place, which was surprisingly often.

I'm not very good at reviews but I have been watching anime for over 22 years now and I can honestly state that drifters has been my favorite anime of the past few years. \r\nThe story follows a samurai named Toyohisa Shimazu, who is killed during the Battle of Sekigahara. After his death he then finds himself in a hallway, standing in front of a man who is sitting behind a desk (who in some odd wayreminded me of J. Jonah Jameson from the old Spiderman cartoon) before being pulled into a doorway. He is then found badly injured by elves, who become terrified upon realizing he is what they refer to as a \"drifter\" but instead of running away they bring him to the other \"drifters\" that are hiding in the forest. We quickly find out they are warriors from our world and from different time periods based on real life historical figures. As events unfold over the course of the series you start to see their real purpose for being there is to help combat the \"ends\".\\n\\n\r\nThe story is by Kouta Hirano and definitely has the same feel to it as Hellsing Ultimate with the art and violence (with a more interesting story in my opinion). So if that's not your cup of tea, then I highly doubt you would enjoy this. \\n\\n",

I don\u2019t really like tat they hoped aboard the Iseki (Is that how you spell it?) bandwagon. While the show is still pretty good with great animation and badass characters, it was dragged down because of the overdone genre that doesn\u2019t even fit with thewriting style. Also can we not focus so much on elf rape please like, one episode got it its bad but, come on like the whole season.   \\n",

Unlike most anime with similar premises, Drifters will aknowledge the different languages (including fictiofictional ones) and give this problem a smart yet simple resolution.\r\n It is BRUTAL! this anime depicts war as it is, with all the rape and blood and betraying and strategy.\r\nIt has a great pacing! Seriously, I just couldn't stop watching, from the poin I began I went straight trhough the end, and I even had a test due the next day haha\r\nThe charactersare all in a moral gray-area! The main protagonists go from idealists to plain evil crazy motherfuckers, and the same can be said about the antagonists.\\n\r\nA lot of history, mostly well done! Okay, there's a lot I don't know, since I havent got a great study over Japan history, and some characters depiction will be distorted (rasputin without a beard!what?). But, putting some of the fantasy they throw aside, they mostly get it quite right (pay attention to the villains, as your first impression of them will be most likely wrong.\\n\r\nThe art Style is similar to Hellsing, I found it quite suiting.\\n\\n\r\nAnd for last:\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\r\nSPOILERS\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe main antagonist is most likely MOTHERF*CKING JESUS (not confirmed) \\n\r\nHow cool is that, right?",

Now for my review\r\nStory: \r\nThe story line was outstanding and brilliant taking actual historical people and transporting them to another world was absolute genius, as for me it was a first and based upon that fact i scored it a 10/10.\r\nArt:\r\nThe character artwork as well as the artwork overall is something that stood out for me as it is very similar to Hellsing but in away also very unique to this series scoring it a 10/10. \r\nSound:\r\nThe sound is very crisp and clear and when thecharacters speak one can clearly hear what they are saying. The battle music in scenes is also done brilliantly and does not overshadow when the characters are talking so there is a good balance scoring it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nEvery Character in the series was brilliantly fleshed out. The Main Characters has very strong unique personalities making them who they are scoring a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis Anime is a joy to watch from start to end, in every episode there is something that keeps the viewer interested the whole way through scoring a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nI scored this series a 10/10 based on the fact that the series makes use of historical figures is great, the fight scenes is done brilliantly and from time to time there are some funny moments as well. In my personal opinion i would recommend this series to everyone but i think fans of Hellsing would really enjoy this series as it has everything in it. So i am scoring it a 10/10.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully a second season gets released as soon as possible",

            "content": "I feel like this show has a lot of misconceptions surrounding it. There's this idea that this is some sort of Fate/Zero, death game-esque show, but if you think that then you will be SEVERELY disappointed.  \r\nThe whole focus on the show is to show how war is and has always been waged and the what people will die for.  There will be very very little character development in the show, but that is because the characters have all lived and \"died\" for their values and beliefs already.\r\nThey won't change because they died, they will continue doing what they believe is right, evenif it means making the same mistakes again.  When it comes to the personalities and beliefs of the characters, while you will learn much by watching what each person does in various situations, you are supposed to already know them based on real life history. Most of the characters would be more known to Japanese citizens but there's a few anyone would know(Hannibal of Carthage, Rasputin, and Joan of Arc).  \\n\r\nWhen it comes to the action don't expect too many 1vs1 fights.  The show is all about the basics of warfare and the strategies that comes with the technology that is available.  There's ugliness, and quite a bit of dark comedy, just like anyone used to war would think about.  When it comes to most of the comedy it is fairly Japanese, with most characters poking fun at the absurdity or irony of a given scene.  I thought the comedy moments, while unnecessary, fit well with the absurdity of all these characters meeting.  Mostly characters from the past ask about the future and end up being shocked how little or much they really did and how unknown or surprisingly infamous they were.\\n\r\nThe music is very Hellsing inspired with equal parts rock vocals and guitars, and subtle atmospheric bgm that fits the show so well you likely won't even notice it. Which is great since you need to hear the voices and sounds of warfare more than anything in order to give the proper intensity to all of the battles.\\n\r\nThe story is very minimal, the characters need to make an army. However, the method to how they achieve their goal is what matters and each step is shown carefully and not too fast as to show that gaining a proper military force is far from easy and really only possible when you have capable leaders and motivation.  The villains of this series, The Ends, are by far the least important thing in the show but also the best thing. They are very similar to our \"heroes\" and are just as much villains as in any other war. They just happen to be on the opposite side of our \"heroes\" and nothing more.  This season was all about getting rid of a minor opponent in the story while creating an army beginning from only one village.\\n\r\nThere is much potential in this season and as obvious as the outcome of the whole series may seem, the theme of it all is truly about the past and inevitable future of all wars when humans are involved.",

            "content": "DISCLAIMER:\r\nSome spoilers possible\r\nWoo boy what is this? A bloody anime with loads of badass animation? AND it's by makers of Hellsing? Sign me up sarge!\r\nThankfully I was never that much into Hellsing, I liked it that's for sure but I've never been blinded enough to ignore any flaws made in it or in any further works of it's makers, so this review won't be too biased. I am however fond of art style presented here so buckle up Jimmy and let's slobber over some moving pictures.\r\nAs I was saying it's an art style I really like. I do like JJBA(JoJo's Bizarre Adventure) style that containsbunch of color changing and tension showing facial expressions but this one is somethin' I get to see more often. It's that thick,strong outline and damn detailed movement of muscles. It gives every strike a feeling of force and every evasive maneuver feeling of elegance and swiftness yet it makes them look like a lot of effort was put into their execution. Every move just leaves you in awe, especially when fight is between even opponents.\\n\r\n,,What about non fighting part gov'nor?'', I hear you asketh.\\n\r\nThey vary from decent to poo bucket they still keep a strong outline going but from time to time they dabble in what I've come to call FMAB(Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood) visual comedy. FMAB visual comedy relies on a really cooky, undetailed, almost caricaturesque art. Of course there are actual jokes mixed in but they aren't/are barely funny on their own. It's the wonky animation,and jokey delivery of lines, that makes 'em funny.\\n\r\nThis isn't executed too well and is pretty hit and miss, mostly miss, except when jokes are about shows own weird dialogue lines or obsession about poo.\\n\r\nNo seriously there's at least three strategies that involve covering enemies in feces and dialogue gets so repetitive at times you'd be forgiven to think you accidentally pushed rewind.\\n\r\nWell that got stretched so let's keep sound and story short.\\n\r\nSound is good, OP is bloody awesome and the rest of the soundtrack compliments the atmosphere currently present in a scene.\\n\r\nStory is The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets The Lord Of The Rings. It's set in the world that you'd expect to see in Tolkien's works. Dwarves,elves, hobbits etc they are all here. In this basic fantasy setting historical characters duke it out,some on the side of evil some on the side of doing fuck all. To be fair non evil oldies eventually start an uprising and go against Orte,an empire that's oppressing minorities so think pre social movements 'Murica. \\n\r\nBut what are those evil historical figures doing? Surprisingly there's a third faction which is led by Jesus, yes they call him Black King but it's obviously JC. Who wages war against humans and can apparently cause rapid cancer. What I gotta mention, but isn't touched too much upon, is that these historical figures are sent to this world by one of two entities and as much as I'd wish to talk about them I can't cause most we see of them is devoid of any info.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are not too engaging methinks. They are certainly not bland but are also far from human.They are surely diverse in...well...characteristics and few are given to every character. I do love good characters so it's a bit of a shit in my cereals that these aren't touchin' my quiver bone. \\n\\n\r\nAh but the glorious bloody combat is more than you can ask for. There is some super natural diddling but it's still done in an a-ok way.\\n\r\nMostly because the anime ends up being power against strategy. It would be expected that a flaming bitch would kill a guy whose only armor is bravado but trough some tactics and cooperation with a big breasted mage he can screw her the heck up.\\n\r\n Gore isn't too gruesome and it's almost at the perfect point,a bit less dissection classes with Mr Katana and ketchup splurts would be appreciated.Nobunaga, more of a tactician than a fighter, always thinks of strategies to screw up the enemy armies who are always  greater in numbers. Orte is full of idiots tho. There are couple of tactics that rely on Orte's troops having a brain of a dead sparrow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Drifters is quite enjoyable and executes it's ideas quite well.It's art and lack of laser beams greatly please me. There are weak points in it and worst parts are definitely dialogue and some chops that will strain your suspension of disbelief.I'd say it's worth watching for spectacle alone but I'm unsure whether the plot will be to your liking captain Wankypants.",

            "content": "Fantasy Warfare with famous figures throughout history and it's BRUTAL about it...\r\nThough at the same time not, as it mood-whiplashes several times for \"comedic relief\" though it makes sense to contrast the more brutalized moments with slapstick...though LA is still stretching this statement.\r\nDrifters is essentially a global game of Western famous figures vs. the Japanese famous figures, using brutalized warfare and no-holds bar main characters they'll use any tactics they can do utterly decimate, decapitate and \"rule\" their new fantasy world they have inhabited. Who are the Drifters?, Oda Nobunaga voiced by Naoya Uchida, Shimazu Toyohisa voiced by Yuuichi Nakamura and Yoichi voiced by MitsukiSaiga are our central \"Drifters\", though they to get several other Drifter allies in the form of the Octobrits and some mercenaries and even later on Elves and Dwarves in the process but nonetheless Oda, Shimazu and Yoichi are our central fighters throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nLA will start this off by at least counting it's flaws by starting off with saying that the plot pacing is consistent although at the same time, it's pacing is always pretty slow even in it's brutalized battles and the aftermath of them. It's more tactical planning and comedic jokes in between in getting the other races from their new world (Elves and Dwarves) to join the Drifters side and the latter on is easy enough to persuade due to the \"Ends\" (Western famous figures who are loyal to the Black King) essentially turning them into slaves. The comedic jokes, LA can see as 50/50 on how you look at it, either it's mood whiplashing from all the brutalized moments or to contrast between it and some of the jokes do kinda get kinda stale at times, such as Oda's ignorance towards some of the more \"colorful\" characters and the more annoying \"Booblieu\" nicknaming to Olmine voiced by Shiho Kokido, one of the Octobrits that initially help the Drifters, though some can be chalked up to how these famous figures don't have the \"tack\" due to the feudal ages they were born in, but nonetheless some of the comedic running gags gets old. The minor characters except the Black King and his subordinates however do get minimal screentime to develop some of the characters, sometimes other Drifters come and help the centralized Drifters, but then they either have no impact on the plot besides their help that they caused, or we don't really know them besides \"their famous\", the only exception goes to Count-Saint Germani voiced by Tomokazu Sugita. LA guesses the final flaw LA kinda saw was during the finale but that a bit later. \\n\\n\r\nDrifters does have it's strengths however, that coming from the tactical warfare it is given by our central Drifters and some ingenious ones at that. From a person who really likes this kind of schema of tactical warfare, it's a huge bonus to it...just the only nitpick is that...it just soo brutal their battle philosophy especially from Shimazu, as he just wants absolute victory and LOTS AND LOTS of decapitation to go along with it for his \"honor\", as much as LA gets it, his brutalized methods along with Oda's battle philosophy can quite easily desensitize LA to Drifter's own anime violence as to how much violence is presented, which could be seen as a flaw, but LA kinda saw it as a strength to Drifters. As much as Drifters doesn't do much on it's characters besides their tactical minds and beliefs, Drifters is a more \"world building\" focused anime, than a character focused one, though it does focus on some characters for backstory (mainly Yoichi and Shimazu at times). The Drifters world due to the nature of it being a global battle against two \"meta-characters\" Murasaki voiced by Mitsuru Miyamoto and Easy voiced by Kanae Ito at odds with one another using the fantasy world that the Drifters and the Ends are pitied to one another does bring in world building to these two characters, though it's extremely vague as to WHY they are at odds with one another. Nonetheless the world building in Drifters is pretty decent, from it's racial tension, cultural (Elves and Dwarves) differences to the Drifters and the Black King's influence to towards the other races and his own beliefs.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters...well LA already said but if anything Oda and Yoichi has character development in the form of their own historical backgrounds especially from Oda which harkens back something he'd been through but on the opposite lens of the events, Yoichi gets some in the form of some brotherly rivalry but other than that he's essentially a war machine like Shimazu is. Shimazu's characterization is best summed up by his brutalized philosophy of war and sorta combines both Oda's historical backgrounding and rivalry but seriously it just feels like Shimazu is an unstoppable war machine and essentially the \"Ace\" of the entire series. The Black King, the major villain of this entire anime does at best have his reasonings and beliefs about the fantasy world and he rules with an iron fist with his subordinates but nonetheless the Black King is even less developed than Shimazu is!. On the \"Ends\" side, Joan of Arc, Rasputin, Gilles de Rais and Jeanne d'Arc all get the historical backgrounding under differing circumstances treatment and worst yet is that these Ends have more backstory than the Black King does!. So if you didn't notice but character developing is lacking in this department but as LA said, Drifters is a more world-building-focused anime than a character focused on.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Hoods Drifters Studio, the animation has completely uncensored violence up the wazoo, but where praise needs to be said, the animation throughout the board is very decent and even the moodwhiplashing comedic moments, the chibi moments does bring the atmosphere back to \"less intense\". The character designs are very bold and detailed and LA will say this for both character designs and backgrounding, they both essentially have the \"grunge\" aesthetics to them complimenting the rather depressing, dystopic, dirty world that Drifters is laid upon itself, but just because it's like this doesn't mean it has horrible animation as it compliments it more than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, there weren't much LA could say about the cast....LA actually really liked Oda's voice actor Naoya Uchida, ohh and the fact that the Elves and other fantasy races given in Drifters does have their own languages, but seriously, the voice acting isn't much to talk about, ohh the voice acting is decent but not enough to talk about.\\n\\n\r\nFor LA, if Drifters wasn't as slow paced as it was to the point that even though the Drifters themselves HAD made progress throughout the anime yet it felt like almost nothing has happened in the 12 episode screentime, then you might have had the same thought LA did about this anime. Sure a second season can definitely help and with the hint at the final episode is anything to go by, it'll definitely help, what this doesn't help is THIS FIRST SEASON, if anything it felt like a prologue than anything else, LA isn't annoyed by the moodwhiplashing comedic tones it takes as that really does makes sense to have and even the lacking character development in compensation for better world-building and underdog warfare, but if Drifters has a biggest cross in his head for a flaw, is the slow pacing it has just for that the ending to say \"wait til second season\", just isn't helping it. If Izetta the Last Witch was close into being LA's biggest disappointment for Fall 2016, then really it felt like Drifters firmly gotten this position by the end of Fall 2016 for LA. But just because it's a disappointment, LA isn't gonna say it's LA's worst anime of Fall 2016 ohhhh that anime is still going! (but THAT one next season people), Drifters was just disappointing to LA...LA kinda wanted more than just brutalized bloodbath of violence and moodwhiplashing comedic moments in this very detailed supernatural \"Ends vs. Drifters\" world that had ALOT more potential to it but was hacked down by it's turtleneck pacing. Drifter's second season might bring that potential sure, but this first season just didn't.",

            "content": "story- the story is pretty much like any other story in the isekai genre. this time the twist is that there are many people being transported to this world who also happen to be famous historical figures. these include figures such as Oda Nobunaga, ra ra Rasputin, joan of arc, Scipio, Hannibal, and many more. the figures are split into two groups the DRIFTERS and the ENDERS and both will fight each other for the claim over their new world. also both sides are being supervised by these maybe god like beings since whomever group claims the world means that god has claim over thatworld. that's pretty much the thick of it when it comes to the premise. \\n\r\nwhile that is the overarcing plot the main plot for these 12 episodes is the recruitment of fantasy world soldiers into the drifter or ender groups. you see in this world the human race has conquered a lot of the world and has placed other human like species into serfdom or slavery. both sides use this by liberating the groups and placing them into their rank and file. with the drifters it consists of more human like species like dwarfs and elves while for the enders it consist of more beast like species like orcs and goblins and both used them to fight while at the same time conquering the human empire. the majority of the show is the drifters liberating the species since the enders already have their army ready. it never shows how big the liberation are since it mostly shows just own town or village being captured and than to fill in the blanks that other followed suit and that makes it feel that the world is very lackluster which affects its world building. \\n\r\nthe pacing is pretty decent but the majority of the story is just fighting and gore so there is not much reason for the pacing anyway. however the comedy is a major problem with the show. it's not funny whatsoever and just ruins a lot of the show for me. 5/10\\n\\n\r\ncharacters- the characters are pretty much decent. a majority of the cast that take up the screen are historical figures meaning their is no reason to create a backstory since it's already established and they just work with the characters they got. there are all decent characters with nothing complex about them and none of them go through much development through the show, but that is to be expected. some of the enders also get some screen time but it's pretty much the same way of describing the drifters. almost all the other fantasy people get little screen time with exception of a white mage girl who help out the drifters, but the elves and dwarfs are just rank and file. 5/10\\n\\n\r\nsound- the voice acting is good can;t find anything wrong with it. the sound track was pretty much forgettable, but did bring some mood to the fight seance and that's about it 6/10\\n\\n\r\nanimation- the animation was pretty meh with the only thing likable was the art style and some of the character designs. the background did have some variety to it from the woods, elf village, and cities but not much else also contributing to the lack of world building. i did not like the change of animation and art style when it went to comedic mode because of course i did not like the comedy. 4/10\\n\\n\r\nenjoyment- the story and characters were mostly a bore with the only good thing being the gore and violence which kept me going 5/10\\n\\n\r\noverall- meh story, ok characters, ok sound, and meh animation, with very little to enjoy out of 5/10",

Even though many people were in awe by this anime when this first aired, it seems the hype died down later on.\r\nThe premise was quite interesting but also confusing at the same time. I did get the gist later on. I do have problems with its pacing, but it was bearable cuz of the visuals. The gritty, dark and edgy animation turned off me at first, but I was able to adjust and liked it later on. It fits well with the theme and story of the anime. The anime is full of action, adventure, gore and evencomedy. Everything blend and complement each other really well.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also shined because of its awesome characters. As you can see, the characters consists of known and important historical figures of that shaped our world today. Seeing them fighting and working with each other was amazing to look at. Because the characters were already established, theirs not much character development needed. All we need now is to wait for the story to continue on the next season.\\n\\n\r\nFans of Hellsing ultimate anime would definitely enjoy this. With the similar art and same level of gore, heck, even seinen fans would enjoy this.",

For unknown reasons an organization goes out of their way using magic and modern-ish technology to try and change the events unfolding in this dimension, for no real reason. They do so by specifically dragging people or indiscriminately sized 'objects' out of their home dimension near or right before their time of death/destruction, and just haphazardly dropping them around the world.\r\nSamurai swords also cutanything and everything, because Japan. I thought we were past this meme by like 2005...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory 4/10 - Very dull, unexplained, and vacuous.

Non-Human character designs are actually very good, and everything is well detailed and animated.\\n\r\nSound 3/10: Extremely lackluster, if not just bad at times.

The sound-design during the show seems to have the budget of around $10 plus a snickers bar... for the entire 12 episodes.\\n\r\nCharacters 5/10: Main cast with the most screentime were the most boring in the show, with more gimmicks and nonsensical superhuman status than a fanfiction.

            "content": "Story:\r\nThere's no denying it; Drifters is glorified fan fiction.\r\nHowever, it's *good* fanfiction.\r\nWhile the character development is subpar, the characterization is done very well. Oftentimes, Kohta Hirano would adapt a \"show, not tell\" storytelling style, demonstrating to audience what kind of person a character is through his or her bombastic actions rather than explaining it to them. Thanks to its larger-than-life cast of characters and fantastical setting, if nothing else, Drifters is extremely fun and interesting to watch. Its premise of portraying historical figures in a fantasy setting is simple and straightforward but also immensely satisfying. There is something inherently intriguing about seeing people from acrossthe ages cross the boundaries of space and time to interact and fight with or against one another, and Kohta Hirano, the original author of Drifters, understands this completely. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, another thing I like about Drifters is that it's not afraid to portray wanton violence that befits its characters and setting. Toyohisa is a samurai from the Sengoku period, and it makes sense that he has no qualms about slaughtering hordes of enemy soldiers. The same goes for Nobunaga the ruthless tactician, who cares as much for human life as he cares for the shit that he smears onto his booby traps, and Yoichi, an assassin bowman who picks off stragglers like a seagull picking off baby turtles crawling out to sea. Watching these historical figures wreak havoc on screen, you can really tell that the writer did his homework, that he is really having a lot of fun writing about these people, and that he's inviting the audience to step into his weird world to have fun with him too.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: interesting setting, compelling characters, subpar character development, competent pacing, and overall just a blast to watch\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nVery stylish and vibrant. The art manages to perfectly capture Kohta Hirano's signature cool, dark and edgy drawing style, staying true to its source material in both character designs and art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe OP, Gospel of the Throttle, may appear unremarkable at first, but it gradually grows on you with the help of the accompanying OP visuals. The sound effects during really really highlight the weight of each sword swing, bullet fired, each disembodied limb that gets ripped from each enemy soldier. 8/10 for sound\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\n9/10 would see Hannibal piss his pants again\\n",

            "content": "I really wanted to like Drifters. \r\nI don't like to compare pieces by the same author, so I will leave the Hellsing comparisons out of this, but suffice it to say that Kouta Hirano's trademark everything is here. \r\nThe show has a really interesting concept; war heroes from across time are brought back in the afterlife in a war where each other's society come to clash. The OP is excellent at drawing you in, with an amazing song and beautiful visuals to match, and for the first few episodes I was hooked. But as the show went on the small flaws became larger and moreprominent and it became harder to watch all the time.\\n\\n\r\nAs expected of Kouta Hirano, the show looks visually great. Character models can look stiff at times, but they animate well and have a great level of fidelity that lets every character have unique silhouettes and expressions that make it clear who is who, whether from a distance or in extreme close-ups. I won't touch on how none of the characters look like their real life counterparts since I can't exactly imagine many of the show's psychotic warriors tying their hair back or trimming their facial hair. Sound effects all sound wonderful and really set the mood, especially during massive battles.\\n\\n\r\nEverything else is much harder to praise. It's clear the author spent a lot of time researching the history of the characters by how often they spew history at each other, whether or not it makes sense at the time and my father and mother's father had the same career. I know that seemed out of touch and irrelevant but I'm just following an example the show set for me. Toyohisa is a likeable protagonist, with Nobunagi falling behind slightly but still getting a few decent scenes. Most other characters, however, are either disposable or forgettable, and the rest that don't fall into one specific category fall into both hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe character of Count Saint-Germi is particularly terrible. Despite how I said I wouldn't touch on the real life inspirations, I have to ask why he's a flamboyant homosexual cross-dresser when, as far as I'm aware, there's nothing in recorded history to suggest he was a walking stereotype that I'm fairly sure was outdated even before he died in 1779. Then again, I could be just confusing him since Count Saint-Germi only yields results for Count Saint-Germain and it's possible that it was a character forged in the part of Hirano's brain that thinks it's a good idea to make poopy arrows a prominent story hook to keep audiences invested. Maybe his character could work if s/he appeared less often on screen and also had died before his first appearance but if you have a character that I have to resort to comparing with poopy arrows then you may have done something wrong.\\n\\n\r\nYes I know that coating weapons with which to impale your enemies in fecal matter has been a prominent strategy throughout history but it gets mentioned so many times it's impossible to take seriously, like meeting someone you respect for the first time for them to only tell you he ran over your cat and then ate it just so you wouldn't be upset.\\n\\n\r\nThere is one other issue I want to point to that at first I had somehow convinced myself wasn't that much of a problem before it became increasingly more common and increasingly more pathetic. Those scenes in which the characters all go into that surreal mode where they over-or under-express emotions with simplistic drawing styles in order to add some moments of levity. There's probably a technical name for this but I don't frankly want to care so I'm calling it 'fucking awful comedy'. Don't get me wrong, moments like these have worked in other shows when characters need to release some tension in the audience, but the problem with Drifters is that not a single instance of the 'fucking awful comedy' either feels earned or funny in any way. Moments like these are meant to calm stress, but here they only heightened it, as characters overreact and shout over the things that neither have bearing on the story or that matter in any way. Plus, since they're being redrawn in simpler styles, you will often find yourself having to retract and pause in the middle of the yelling to orientate yourself with who is saying what since, as it turns out, everyone loses their individuality when you draw them all the same. It's like watching a performance of Romeo and Juliet, except halfway through the actors are replaced with sock puppets that scream at each other because Romeo threw a pebble at her window and Juliet is worried that he will break the glass. And they appear in, as far as I'm aware, every single episode, sometimes more than once. I would go back and check if they actually were in every episode to give my review some credibility but A) I don't want anyone to get the impression that I care despite using enough hyperbole to suggest I do, and B) I don't want to sit through those episodes again. \\n\\n\r\nWhat began as a fun story that I enjoyed watching gradually turned less and less interesting as more and more uninteresting and unimpactful characters and stories are added. What's worse is that I actually found myself rooting for the antagonist by the end. The protagonists go to war because that's their thing, and the antagonists' main goal is to literally create a society and civilisation in the afterlife that had no structure or way for the common folk to survive without agriculture, language or economy.  Maybe the point is that the protagonists are evil, after all with Count Saint-Germi declaring Hitler to be a nice guy that would make for a neat twist in the second season. And I'm going to assume there will be a second season or else the endless unresolved plot threads that are sequel-baited at the final episode will look absolutely pathetic in a few years time. Or rather, even more pathetic since I don't remember there being any unresolved arc I had any prior investment in. \\n\\n\r\nDrifters had a unique selling point, with what promised to be a good time with really good visuals and a few interesting episodes to kick things off. But everything falls flat very shortly after and I can only leave you with the following recommendation; watch Hellsing instead. If you've already seen it, then I don't know, watch something else. Or have a more productive time  with an book on war heroes throughout the ages with which to slam your head against.",

If you are bored and you want a good historical, action, supernatural and adventure anime, I can't think of any other good examples right now. In fact the uniqueness of the concept amazes me, because it found a way to bring war heroes and strong historical icons to another world where humans, demi humans and monsters are at war and forced them to either fight each other or work together. I loved it. \r\nThe kind of art drifters has fit it's uniqueness very well. The art was dark themed,  tallying with the somewhat dark theme the animeportrays, drawing out every scene to almost perfection. The blood, the fight, the comedy, the scenery everything was done really well. \\n\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the soundtrack ....actually I hated it it failed to bring the scenes to life. I've always taught a good soundtrack makes a good anime, so in my own opinion I'll say the soundtrack was pretty average compared to the not so average art and story. Well it's just my opinion, I might be wrong. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting I wouldn't say they were lovable and I can't say they were plain.... They were just in between. Since they were different war heroes from different time and place, they were some who just plain evil that just wanted to destroy mankind, some who wanted to conquer territory, some who wanted to go back and have a hot bath. They all had their selfish interests in mind as they do what they do, that's what made it interesting. \\n\\n\r\nBottom line, drifters is not the type of anime you want to keep on your plan to watch category for too long.",

Drifters goes a little bit too extensive into Japanese history, compared to other cultures, but it is an anime\u2014so it is to be expected sadly.

One of the best dubs I've ever seen (I watch both sub and dub regularly).  \r\nWhat this show does right, is the constant action and story development.  The action is continuous, so in a spotI might get bored at in another anime, drifters keeps the pace and plot moving.  I will be honest in saying I am rather disappointed with the length of the anime, but I am sure another season will come out due to the quality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe negative review(s) I have seen don't do the show justice, and compare it to other works.  Hellsing was meh, in my opinion.  Was it bad?  No, of course not, but I could take it or leave it.  The two shows have NOTHING in common other than violence.... One is a violent maelstrom of history satire, while the other is an adaptation based on\u2014to some degree\u2014the novel.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: the characters are prominent, strong, humorous, and entertaining throughout the show, and the plot and action keep you entertained\u2014if not enthralled.",

            "content": "Drifters is a good choice for you if you think you'd enjoy historical figures set in a fantasy world where they fight for turf and to assert their political views and cultural upbringings, resulting in a world filled with action, wars and chaos. It becomes a bad choice if you're easily bothered when a series tries to be comedic and doesn't really land the punchlines and it's also a poor choice if it's important for you to have out of the ordinary archetypes, as the personality of most characters can be boiled down as safe for the audience.\r\nThe story of Drifters pretty much boils downto chaos and war. While Drifters claims there are specifically two sides, one side is unified by the fact that they want to destroy the entire world around them and the other is not unified in any shape or form, with characters pretty much following their wims and being thrown in the world just to stir up constant chaos. The best way to describe it is that a few characters try to overtake a fictional fantasy world and create chaos within it as a result of this. It doesn't really get much more complex than this.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, they're pretty much safe archetypes for the public of Japan. The main character is a wild samurai who fights for the sake of fighting and is brave and lives by the code of honor of the people in his times. In addition to this, he is assisted by Oda Nobunaga, in what it's probably his 354th time he's been presented as an anime character, so he is most certainly a trope himself, but I'm personally not familiar with him. Any other characters are either characters that had some quirks of theirs raised to be over the top (like: being old, having big tits, being a queer etc) or they are bloodthirsty historical figures. As far as other races other than humans are concerned, since they are represented here as well, they're the stereotypical summed up representation of what you already might know about fantasy races: Elves live long, are agile, are proud people. Dwarves are tiny muscular drunks who drink and are great blacksmiths. They're pretty much safe generic representations, that everyone is accustomed to.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, while this is something that does bring down Drifters for me, as it makes me care far less about who fights due to every personality and representation being overlyfamiliar and safe, it makes me look for the side it does excel in, the \"how they fight\" part. In its action, Drifters doesn't present mindless fights led by sheer numbers, but rather it does present fear tactics, how to raid a castle, how to cut off your enemies from their supplies of water, and so on. In other words, it employs actual real war tactics in it, coupled with warmongers getting ahold of technology from the future and their insight into these, making use of their quick wit to employ an advantage over the other side in war. This part was truly interesting in Drifters and I thoroughly enjoyed it for it. It made the actual fights after the preparation actually satisfying to watch. The only criticism I can give the series of that so far is that the main characters didn't really lose any fight in any sort of ground and endured any sort of loss, with most wars feeling overwhelmingly one sided in nature. But regardless of this, I can only praise the action for how well structured it is in general.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the wit and thought put behind the action of Drifters impressed me, the lack of wit and thought behind the humor of the series somewhat disturbed me. So there's a character with big tits. Let me sum up the exact humor that goes around her. EYYYY YOU GOT BIG TITS OPPAINU BIG TITS OY HOOOOOOOTEEERS YO YO YO IMMA RUB YO TITTIES BECAUSE YOU HELPED AND BEEN GOOD HAHAHAHA BIG TITS GIRL DID I MENTION YOU HAVE BIG FUCKING TITS? I mean, I think it's okay to poke fun at any sort of physical characteristic for the sake of comedy, but don't just have the characters blatantly mouth off the exagerated physical characteristic and expect everyone to lose their shit. It doesn't work with the senile old man that just rambles and wants to eat raisins or whatever. It doesn't work with the queers that want to touch little boys and are stereotypically gay. And the reason it doesn't work that comedy has to surprise in some sort of fashion to make you laugh. If you build a character just for a certain type of gag, the gag won't even fly because it's something already to be expected. Coupled with the generic shift in artstyle that anime does in comedy, that gives it away that the series is attempting to be funny right now, and it completely misses its purpose. However, as comedy is subjective, the series might be able to make you laugh, but you will always see it coming.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, Drifters is a series that excels in the presentation of war, the action of war and preparation of war, but everything in between is either mediocre, generic or a poor attempt. It could be an interesting watch for an action series and be enjoyable based on how much you're looking for the things I said, like the implementation of actual war tactics. It is coupled with well animated fights that feature torn limbs and a lot of blood, just like its big brother, Hellsing. And just like Hellsing, the reason I suggest it for is how well the action in the series is done. However, if you're not looking for an action series, there's no reason to attempt watching Drifters. The humor will most likely annoy you alongside the fact that the world is built in a way for everyone to be familiar to its tropes and representations. In other words, Drifters is just a show that features good action. If that's the driving force behind your choice, I would safely recommend Drifters, specifically when what I've talked about just doesn't bother you.",
