            "content": "S.P.O.I.L.E.R.S. - Stupid Pissed Off Idiot Likes Emphatically Raging at Shit\r\nThis review is honest, but purposefully exaggerated so that it may be entertaining to some people, much like the anime itself except I believe myself to be halfway amusing.  It also contains bad words like \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cdick\u201d and \u201ckittens\u201d, so to all children who can\u2019t handle a few motherfucking swears, avert your goddamn eyes!!\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the concept of Masamune-kun for a moment, and why I was immediately nervous about where the anime would go.\r\nThe plot has a clear ending that it is working toward:  Makabe Masamune will get revenge on AdagakiAki in a most grandiose and satisfying way.  But you can\u2019t just have a good ending; otherwise the audience would just skip to the last episode to see how it plays out.  You need to somehow make the ending satisfying, but also balance the rest of the story so that the build-up is worth it as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s where those spoilers really kick in.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun has neither a good build-up, nor the ending it promises.  In fact, it has no ending at all.  The final episode is a fucking karaoke party.  Why the fuck did they even make this?  I feel like a complete idiot for subjugating myself to watching every minute of this mumbo jumbo, which was admittedly okay and non-offensive for several episodes, but after a while it feels like even the writer didn\u2019t know how the revenge was gonna work, so they started making excuses for some weeks or years or however long you\u2019ve been experiencing this series.  Oh god, could you imagine a second season of this?  This is not any sort of narrative that requires more than twelve episodes to develop.  It initially appears as a typical romcom, but with a twist ending and nothing more.  The presence of a sequel would immediately imply that the ending is prolonged longer than necessary, like a really awkward handshake.  Not like Hand Shakers tho.  That anime was flawless in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nYes, yes \u201cit\u2019s about the journey\u201d whatever, except the actual journey towards the non-existent climax is about as fruitful as an average expedition in The Oregon Trail.  Masamune, being a charming young lad, simply oozes with swagger and sex appeal.  Yes, this little piggy got /fit/, and now every teenage girl within a five-mile radius wants to bang him.  But instead, Masamune would rather reject these fine 2D women and chase after the dumb ugly bitch so he can end up rejecting her too.  You know, even though chasing after one girl for your entire high school life is probably the worst thing you can do as a high schooler, I can respect Masamune for being so determined to work towards his goal.  You know, IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while you sit back and watch Masamune make irritating decisions, Masamune-kun will do its damndest to make you laugh.  If you love WITTY ANIME HUMOR then this is about as much WITTY ANIME HUMOR as you could possibly need.  Characters overreact because their actual personalities can\u2019t carry the scene, people often compare scenarios to those seen in anime and manga, and the main character comments on so many things in his head that the Fine Bros would\u2019ve sued Silver Link a year ago.  No, I\u2019m not saying you should feel bad for finding these things funny.  I\u2019m just saying that I didn\u2019t.  Masamune-kun doesn\u2019t have any strong nor original jokes, and the only thing I can say about its general style of comedy is that it\u2019s \u201cvery anime\u201d.  The ONE joke I actually laughed at is Masamune\u2019s mom looking like a five-year-old girl, because it's so weird and illogical and out there that I just kinda like it.  Doctors HATE her!\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s really what I could say about Masamune-kun in general, it\u2019s \u201cvery anime\u201d:  A decent but not particularly unhealthy dose of \u201cunderage\u201d partial nudity, the leading female as a high-and-mighty bitch quee--I mean tsundere, an oblivious main character, and a high school containing all the silliness.  Masamune-kun never sets out to break the mold or add anything new, although a twist ending would\u2019ve been nice.  Maybe at the end of the series, Masamune could\u2019ve said \u201cha, PRANK\u2019D\u201d and dunked Adagaki Aki into a shark tank as his way of getting revenge.  You know.  Just a suggestion.  Any sort of revenge plot would\u2019ve been nice to see.  But anyway, Masamune-kun just wants to be a plain high school rom-com.  And you know what?  I\u2019m okay with that.  For most of the season, Masamune-kun failed to evoke a single reaction from me.  Nope, not one.  I watched episode after episode week after week and didn\u2019t crack a smile, didn\u2019t have any particular thoughts, didn\u2019t twitch an eyebrow, didn\u2019t slit my wrists, nothing.  It was a perfectly acceptable five out of ten, and if it sounds negative, it's actually something that I am 100% okay with.\\n\\n\r\nBut then something happened later.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the lack of delivery on Masamune-kun\u2019s part is bad enough.  Since I keep mentioning it, I really don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t bring about the ending it promises.  But before that cuckening even ignites, we get this abysmal \u201cfinal\u201d arc where an actual antagonist is brought in.  No, the antagonist is not Adagaki Aki, it\u2019s just a random kid who looks like Masamune when he was fat, and he\u2019s to take Adagaki Aki\u2019s hand in marriage as some sort of business arrangement or something.  So, this kid is an obstacle for Masamune to tackle so he can not get his revenge.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that I\u2019m expected to believe this is a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care about Masamune.  He\u2019s not an interesting character.  I like the fact that he was a fat kid who ended up getting buff, and uhhhhhhhhhh, yep that\u2019s pretty much it.  Beyond this, he\u2019s just a high school protagonist who gets a small harem that\u2019s still big enough to include a trap, because that\u2019s WITTY ANIME HUMOR.  I don\u2019t care about his revenge plot either.  Yeah, I would kinda like to see it, but I also see it as something worth giving up.  Masamune has almost nothing to lose by not getting his revenge; all that happens as a result is that he\u2019ll feel a little bested by that one prick from his childhood--who the hell cares, anyway?  Just leave that shit in the past--if you want, you can aggressively bang one of the eighteen billion other girls in school and think of Badagaki the whole time.  I\u2019d watch that hentai. Or anime. Or cartoon. Or attack helicopter. Whatever the community is arguing about.  Hey, isn\u2019t that what that shitstorm Scum\u2019s Wish is doing, anyway?\\n\\n\r\nYet, despite these things, Masamune-kun thinks I do actually care about Masamune\u2019s endgame, \u2018cuz he\u2019s the main character and all.  So this lookalike dude is apparently a bad thing. And to that, I say\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFuck you.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun actually made me angry at this point of the story, because this abominable terrorist is a nice kid who just wants to do the right thing.  He\u2019s sucked into the marriage just like Whaki is, but his intentions are angelically good.  He even approaches Adagaki\u2019s friends in private to clear up any misconceptions they have, because he truly respects his to-be bride.  What\u2019s the problem? Yeah, Adagaki Aki is an obnoxious bitch who deserves to trip and fall into a vat of rotten donkey milk.  But you know what they say:  bitches ain\u2019t shit.  Why do we gotta worry about them so much?  Just let them go.  She might\u2019ve embarrassed a few people in brutal ways (even though they were all basically fedora tippers so they got what they deserved), but it\u2019s not like she throws rocks at kittens and steps on fennec foxes in her free time.  She\u2019s not so horrible that she NEEDS a taste of her own shit.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just baffled at how completely pointless Masamune-kun\u2019s Revenge is.  Really, all it needed to do was set up this grand revenge, but instead it insisted on taking this weird detour so that it could evolve the romance.  Give me a break.  I didn\u2019t want to see that in the first place.  Not just because I\u2019m expecting a revenge plot, but also because I don\u2019t like these two characters, and seeing them form a relationship isn\u2019t satisfying.  In fact, Adagaki Aki is meant to be unlikable, so why would I want the main character to date her?  She\u2019s supposed to be the villain, but then at the last minute they throw in this secret side of her that actually found fat Masamune to be attractive??  What????  All of the sudden the revenge plot is gone, so now she needs to be presented as likable.  Ten episodes is a bit too late to change my mind on someone\u2019s personality.  It\u2019s also too late to rewrite the entire show. Man, I thought I avoided the new Rewrite this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing about Adagaki Aki that strikes me as odd is how she\u2019s supposed to be the most beautiful and magnificent creature in the entire world; that world being the high school.  They demonstrate this by showing people I don\u2019t care about saying that she\u2019s beautiful. Adagaki Aki in the flesh has a fairly tall and slender figure with a sharp face and uh\u2026 oh yeah, NOTHING.  Remember, this is the most beautiful girl in the entire school, according to literally everybody in the school.  So the anime then dumps all of the jiggle physics and panty shots onto Aki\u2019s sidekick, a maid girl with short hair and big tits voiced by Inori Minase.  Now that's some good casting.   Good job, Silver Link. \\n\\n\r\nIf this were a live-action series with actual human beings and all of their many physical flaws, these comments wouldn\u2019t exist as Adagaki Aki could look like an actually attractive person with as few flaws as possible.  But when you have an anime (or manga) where every character is painstakingly drawn to be beautiful and perfect and eye-catching to the audience, I have no idea how I\u2019m supposed to believe that any single one of them are considered attractive in comparison to the others.  I guess if you have a domination fetish, yeah, Aki\u2019s your girl, but if you\u2019re one of\u2026  *ahem*  THOSE people\u2026  then you might prefer Mr. Boipussy~ over there with the weird yellow pluses in his or her eyes.  Why is that a thing. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, my point is the character designs all suck and that NotRem is the better girl because her tits are bigger. Masamune doesn\u2019t even look muscular despite that being his entire character, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nYou might think that the lack of strong character designs could imply more movement, but if you believe that then you probably thought that Masamune would get his revenge, didn\u2019t you.  No, there\u2019s not any single bit of interesting art direction or animation or anything.  It takes place in a boring school with a decent dress code--the boys\u2019 uniforms look a little unusual with the yellow and dark blue color scheme, but calling them garish would be extreme.  The girls\u2019 uniforms are equally decent at the top, but the yellow skirts are a weird combination.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cshut up lux who cares\u201d\\n\r\nMe.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the soundtrack is an interesting sort of entity.  For the most part, it\u2019s obnoxiously loud and mind-shreddingly irritating, but in a way that could\u2019ve possibly been ideal.  The OST places heavy emphasis on each scene, making simple decisions more dramatic and making characters more imposing than they actually are.  The bigger problem is that the art direction is completely lifeless and boring, making the grandiose soundtrack utterly pointless.  If the show looked as intense and excessive as it sounds, this could've made things funnier in a way that Nichijou has mastered, but of course that wouldn't happen.  I hope Silver Link gave the composer a nice participation ribbon for his effort, he deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED suck.  I don\u2019t have anything to say about them because I skipped them every episode except the first, because they\u2019re completely boring.  Too bad I couldn\u2019t skip the entire show tho.  Next.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, that\u2019s all I need to say.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun could\u2019ve been a strong four to a light five, which I\u2019m okay with, and I could\u2019ve let it go about its business without a care in the world\u2026 but the complete lack of delivery alone brings it down to a 2, a number I use to notate something that\u2019s SLIGHTLY watchable, because you could argue that Masamune-kun is a decent and funny rom-com even though it should be a revenge story. \\n\\n\r\nThe non-existent ending and last few episodes just pissed me off so much that I need to let myself go and burn everything in my path.  Damn you, Masamune-kun, let it be known I shall have my own revenge by posting this 2228-word review on a Western database not seen by anyone significant in the industry, for it\u2019s currently the only platform I have to post upon!

            "content": "This is a story about... \u00bfrevenge?\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge is definitely an anime that gives to talk. Just by reading the synopsis you are attracted and curiosity makes you watch it, \u00bfand what do you find? Masamune wants revenge, \u00bfwhy? Because his feelings were rejected as a child. \u00bfHow will he do that? Wasting his life in finding the chick that rejected him to waste even more time in make that she love him and then breaking her heart \u00a1Wow, how mature of his part!\r\nIt is understood that this is a romantic comedy, so as such, the plot should not be taken so seriously, but thatis the main problem. While it has comical moments somewhat agreeable, the serie wants you to take the issue of revenge (which is the main focus it gives) as something totally serious and justified, which collides full with the fact that the serie is EXTREMELY CLICHE. Having cliches is not the problem, as long as they are used in a way that achieves something at least entertaining to see, this is not the case, the theme of \"serious\" revenge is contradicted by cliches, ending in a ridiculous, regrettable and generic development; the revenge is gradually lost to make way for the inevitable: Masamune and Aki end up in love with truth, then resort to plot devices come out of nowhere in order to force revenge and introduce unnecessary drama, (Gasou and the trio of bodyguard morons), because we already know how it will end, which up to the same synopsis tells you: \"However, his friendship with Aki begins to grow, Masamune begins to question the objectives of his devious plans\". \\n\\n\r\nOf the above also carries the fact that with the passage of time, the goal of revenge disappears, leaving the main focus of the serie as a nonsense and emphasizing the fact of the poor development of it, and predictability. \u00bfBut do you know what's the worst part? That in the end nothing happened. \u00bfRevenge? No. \u00bfReal love? No. Nothing, nothing happened. This IS the real nonsense...\\n\\n\r\nMany defend the serie saying that the initial approach to revenge is something original and rarely seen among the animes of this genre... Which is true, but it's no use if the approach is original if the development of it is disastrous and supports in the cliches to end up being more of the same with other condiments. In this sense the serie reminds Oregairu, in which it wants to appear as something different from the usual and ends up falling on more of the same as seen in other animes of the genre.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut if there is anything worse than the poor plotting attempt, it's the characters, EVERYBODY AND EACH OF THEM are a stroke. Starting with the central axis: the protagonist. In the case of many romantic comedies (with or without harem), no matter how fun it is or how nice the girls are, if the protagonist is insufferable, the serie becomes insufferable too, although this obviously depends on how much focus give it to him. In this case, the whole serie is seen from the point of view of Masamune, so the least that is expected, is that this character is interesting or at least enjoyable. I will not deny that Masamune stands out for not being a typical loser dense harem protagonist, and that his internal monologues add some interest to the plot and character in general, but many believe that this, and only this, make him a good character, which is false:\\n\\n\r\n-His revenge motive is stupid: as a child he was an easy target of bullying, and when he met someone who accepted him, he was rejected by that person, which motivated him to change. This is really not bad, but this change is driven merely by the fact of wanting revenge and not by personal improvement, not to mention all the time wasted on something so empty. Apart, just by getting fit he already believes he matured, how innocent...\\n\\n\r\n-His narcissistic attitude is both annoying and unnecessary, one can show self-confidence without resorting to narcissism. In addition, the serie focuses TOO MUCH in show you how every girl that appears on the screen drools for him (something VERY ridiculous and insufferable to see), feeding more his ego, as if they wanted to give the reason to the force to his philosophy of \"only handsome boys win in life\", or as if narcissism was necessary and obligatory for his characterization.\\n\\n\r\n-His personality is ambiguous, varies at the convenience of the script. From a moment he changes from being bold and self-assured (supported by the aforementioned narcissism), to an insecure who is afraid even of talking to a girl and is lost in his own plans. Basically he turns to the typical loser dense harem protagonist for moments. \u00bfWhere is the supposed maturity which he spoke? A very bad characterization, and a character badly done in every way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Aki, \"The Cruel Princess\". The girl who is cruel to everyone but who is really insecure and with a \"cute side\" with chibi faces included to compensate for her bitch side and that half world treat her as waifu... By far the worst character of the whole serie, And one of the worst \"tsunderes\" I've ever seen. A poorly constructed character, with a horrible characterization and a very insufferable attitude that changes to the convenience of the script (yeah, too). Her motives for being cruel are quite questionable and her current way of being doesn't go according to them, her attitude of bitch contrasts with her \"feed me with 20 kg of food while I make moe faces\" and \"I want you to kiss me or tell me you like me... but you're still a piece of crap \u00a1get away, you scum!\". The worst thing is that, I insist, the serie wants you to take this bitch side so badly done seriously to justify Masamune's revenge.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the way her attitude goes from being aggressive to being totally passive according to Masamune's plans is quite fictional (again, as if the plot requires it), and from one moment to another she becomes aggressive again. In her you don't see an evolution of how her hard exterior breaks and little by little she reveals her dere side, you see how she changes from \"tsun\" to \"dere\" in a very fake way when the scene requires it. This is not to be \"hard on the outside, fragile on the inside\" like every normal tsundere, and neither is a gap moe, this is to be hard and fragile at the same time, a mixture of personalities, as if they didn't decide to give her a fixed characterization, And it remains something that changes suitably, something that is demonstrated in Chapters 4 and 5, for example, \u00a1even Masamune himself says it in Chapter 9!\\n\\n\r\nAnd if all that was not enough, she send the demon all her supposed characterization with the appearance of Gasou \u00bfWhere was what she said of \"I always hurt people so they don't hurt me\"? Someone who changed and promised not to fall in love, says to hate men and rejects everyone in a cruel way falls in love instantly, even if it is because she believes that is the Masamune of her childhood is not justified if she says to have changed, all that to force the plot in a terrible last minute plot twist. \u00bfNow do you see what I mean with her personality is something that changes at the convenience of the script? I insist: the worst character in the serie, and one of the worst \"tsunshits\", because she doesn't even count as a \"normal tsundere\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo see interacting with that pair of protagonists is a real headache. Their relationship of \"love-hate\" feels so forced, so poorly executed and without any kind of charisma. However, in most of chapter 6 Aki does not appear, so there was not much of this interaction and the subject of revenge was hardly touched, they also explored better the relations between Masamune and other characters, and it was pleasant to see. Similarly in chapter 9, where a fairly mature discussion took place between Masamune and Neko, and then some sympathetic comedy among the other characters, again, the subject of revenge was mentioned very little. These two chapters were the most passable of the entire serie \u00bfCoincidence? I don't think so\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYoshino is the typical kuudere awkward and moe who has a \"dark side\". That stereotype has always made me illogical and meaningless, since you can not take seriously the dark side (again, what the serie tries to do) with a poker-faced babe who barely whispers and falls down and showing the pantsu. However, and despite everything, she is perhaps the most decent character in the serie, her role in the same is really interesting and contributes to the plot, even her actions can be unpredictable and leave the expectation, but her characterization is not, and makes you lose a little interest in her. I also dare to say that she is perhaps one of the most decent characters of Inori Minase, something that is not very difficult to actually achieve...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNeko is the top of the cliche between the characters, a generic rich girl who falls from the sky and immediately falls in love with the protag \"because yes\", and in the end, she will be the first friendzoned girl from the harem (well, that was the class rep). So many cliches together and so little creativity in a single character, literally she is a Tachibana 2.0 \u00a1even is just as sickly! She seems to have no personality beyond Masamune \u00bfWhat is the real reason why she loves him so desperately? \u00bf\"Because he is kind\"? Although she said her motives, are not sufficient justification of why she loves him with such determination. The only answer I find is: because the plot says, and they need another waifu bait that shows love interest in him so that the story does not feel so linear, although her intervention didn't contribute significantly anything more than the classic Team War. That is worth clarifying, is that I think her rejection was right (although Masamune's motives remain stupid), after all, we talk about a liar who is in love with him for questionable reasons, the logical thing to do is refuse. After that we saw a discussion between the two where they clarified their motivations in a more or less clear way, demonstrating maturity on the part of both characters and a good management of the subject of a love rejection. Point for Masamune and the serie in general, because everything doesn't have to be \"That stupid Masamune should accept her \u00bfwhy? \u00a1Because she's my waifu!... and she's the best girl... and... \u00a1and she kissed him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen there are other characters, like the typical genki girl (although this is nice, it's a shame that she has fallen in love with an idiot like Masamune that aside from rejecting her, he didn't care and only increased his ego, more negative points for this character), the trap, the loli or the sister troll and bitter, we also have Gasou... Who should not even count as a character, since he has no characterization, he's literally a plot device with legs (and a very sassy one), someone who only entered the history to put unnecessary drama and to force even more the disastrous development of the plot, like the trio of lesbianas \"bodyguard\" of Aki, stereotyped girls that only appeared in the end to serve of barrier between the inevitable. A whole cast of characters with almost no brilliance or charisma. Do not ask for complex characters or a deep development, only pleasant characters and justified to what the serie tries, which does not. Neither they have to be 100% original, but that does not imply that all have to be archetypes seen a thousand times in other serie and without basically any change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is no need to talk much about the audiovisual aspects: nice but generic designs, decent quality, an acceptable but very forgettable soundtrack. In general the important aspects of the serie are regrettable, the comedy becomes fun, because I will not lie: it made me laugh on several occasions (after all I enjoy this genre), and I don't dislike all the characters, but that is not enough to forget all the bad. The plot from the beginning is ridiculous and stupid despite not being so common and look attractive in lyrics, and focusing on it in a serious way (because I insist that this is what the series claims, even with all comedy in the middle), the minimum expected is an acceptable development, but this is lousy, and the characters are far from even acceptable. It is worth mentioning that I like harems no matter how generic they are, as long as the girls and the MC are charismatic and interesting. This is not the case. This will undoubtedly endure as one of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen, only surpassed by Nisekoi.",

But there\u2019s another category that needs to be touched upon to create a good anime and that is characters. Smart intellectual characters and ones that strive from the common cheap use of stereotypes make a title memorable due to the unique ways these characters are presented through dialogue and interaction. Your characters are the fore-front in the anime, they are the lens the viewer experiencesthe story through, and so having them well fleshed out and smartly written enhances the experience for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nBut contrary to my statement listed above, \u201cMasamune-kun\u2019s Revenge\u201d brings nothing smart to the table. In concept the show is about some revenge plan thought out by a prepubescent child after getting rejected when he was about 6 years old, a \u201clovers\u201d squabble that has lasted around a decade, why is he so angered that he can\u2019t move on in life and accept fate? I doubt we will ever know.  Our main character Makabe; is optimistic in his revenge plans. Accompanied with tedious actions and that cocky and cool attitude that make me want to fist the table in rage whenever he\u2019s on screen, he makes Subaru look like the second-coming of Christ in comparison. Having a likeable main character should be what many anime strive to portray, this is the character we are supposed to be rooting for and hoping his plans go to success. (if we can scuttle through the ridiculous idea of the plan in the first place that is) stereotypes may piss you off after seeing that same trope rehashed over and over again over many titles of anime, but having a character who is un-bearable to watch due to his unintentional cringe aspects really burdens the show down a lot. His whole \u201crevenge plan\u201d is some of the stupidest shit I have seen in my life, who honestly gives a fuck if he was rejected years prior, his character just comes off as immature but not in the good sense.\\n\\n\r\nHey I\u2019m sure immature characters can be enjoyable to watch at times but Makabe emits the entire opposite enjoyment of that, he\u2019s unlikeable, unfunny and one dimensional all around, I really don\u2019t see the appeal of having this guy being the perspective we enjoy the show through.  Next we have the evil, misandristic; Adagaki Aki or better known as \u201ctext-book tsundere.\u201d She\u2019s the main target and antagonist of Masamune-kun\u2019s Revenge. Though has more characterisation to her compared to our main character, and is overall a better more tolerable character to watch; even if she may just be pretty stereotypical. She is the stated \u201cantagonist\u201d of the show, but due to her past and better development in helping us understand her she becomes greater than Makabe. Overall the cast is a bunch of dumb, unlikeable assholes which are painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThough I\u2019ve only touched upon the surface of characters, alongside the two main characters we have some more terribly written side characters. Firstly; Yoshino Koiwai who is the most enjoyable out of the bunch; and no that\u2019s not just because she is voiced by Inori Minase, she serves as the \u201cmaster\u201d role for Makabe and plans to assist him in his execution of his dumbfounded revenge plan. She\u2019s cute, and funny at times that\u2019s about it. Then we have Neko Fujinomiya who is another rich girl, but she\u2019s mysterious, she knows Makabe prior, but Makabe does not recall ever meeting her. But to be honest I bet if you had an encounter with Makabe he would forget you within the next ten minutes of your conversation (evident in how he forgot of Yoshino\u2019s existence entirely.) Then to top that off we have weird Lolita mom who tries serving Makabe food but whenever there is over a certain amount of calories he becomes extremely triggered by the situation due to him trying to keep up his muscular fit body to impress the ladies. Oh and introduced near the end we have this painfully un-needed and unlikeable fat kid and the SJW brigade who turn to illegal acts to stop the straights and turn Aki into a lesbian man-hater.\\n\\n\r\nThe weaknesses of these said characters is most evident in their interaction; there\u2019s always an awkward pause mid-conversation. With Makabe\u2019s one track mind on the path to revenge nothing said to him ever enters his mind and flies past him; he may have recollection of those words but prefers to ignore those after a while and snap back into his revenge mind-set. The drama in this anime is god damn awful as well; it is impossible to take seriously with the nature of the show and is just as awkward as every other character interaction; bland, stupid and un-meaningful. Most of it is started by Makabe\u2019s dumb irrational attitude constantly messing things up; he can\u2019t fix the problems because he is so mindless on top of that and the quite common \u201ccomedic\u201d part where he falls over constantly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAside from this the show does have some redeemable capabilities that don\u2019t drag the show down into devastation. For the most part the animation is pretty decent; it\u2019s of course nothing special but the bright colours help with the lively atmosphere of some dumb-founded romance revenge plan, so it\u2019s a pleasant sight to the eye for this factor. Its atmospheric shots are pleasant of course bringing light to sights that look pretty generic in terms of animation as a whole but work well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department we are met with an \u201codd\u201d soundtrack to say the least; nothing really stands out and sticks in your head; but overall it weirdly goes along with the shows sense of direction; the opening theme: \u201cWagamama MIRROR HEART\u201d hypes up the show and creates brilliant anticipation; which is how I found myself watching this show in the first place, and contrast to the opening \u201cElemental World\u201d provides a calm yet upbeat theme to lead out the show.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that this anime is simply here to provide a romance comedy; but the problem for me is it wasn\u2019t funny, compared to other romance comedies, the effect and experience I gained from this was weak, and of course mainly because of my statement against the characters of the show which drag down the quality. But even if this was intentional and I am just over analysing this; the show really did not work for me. The show is obviously enjoyable, even if I\u2019m hesitant at watching each episode most of the time provides a decent experience with not the best enjoyment the show could have produced but not enough to create a bitter taste of disgust when watching. On top of that the show features an anti-climactic ending which I will not delve into here; but there\u2019s a possibility that the show will receive a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; Masamune-kun\u2019s short comings lie in trying to create a decent romance/comedy which falls flat due to its unbearable main character and generic side characters. But the side dishes to the show create decent sides to the anime which stop it from plummeting down into the abyss. If you want a bright show with some mutual redeeming factors and decent enjoyment, look no further than this show. There are of course many greater titles out there, but I\u2019m sure if you are the average Joe who doesn\u2019t really care much for the criticisms against this show you will find this for the most part enjoyable. If you do care about the above; I advise you to move on, as this offers nothing new.\\n",

            "content": "Since there are only 4 episodes out, I will be giving my first impressions for this anime.\r\nMasamune-kun's Revenge seems at face value, the virtue of blandness. A plot of blurb that anyone can read so generically and your typical protagonist. However, I don't find that to be the case as I actually find the protagonist quite likable. The revenge theme is also something that rarely happens in the romance genre so the plot isn't exactly linear and boring.\r\nMasamune-kun's Revenge is interesting as it is able to take a rehashed idea and execute it with the sort of panache that leaves you wanting more. By theend of the first episode, I was left speculating about what directions the anime could take. The second, third and fourth episodes are also pretty decent so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the romance genre is notorious for being generic. The OP and ED animation sequences are overdone-to death cuts from your typical romance anime. They are either happy-go-lucky or sad depending on the sub-genre. However, the songs accompanying this anime are actually ringtone-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation in a simple sentence, I would say it\u2019s not at all masterpiece level, but it is gorgeous. I have no complaints here. The character designs look very appealing which I also have no issue with at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Masamune-kun's Revenge is an anime I will definitely be seeing through this to the end, even if it ends up going downhill later on.",

            "content": "Watching Masamune-kun no Revenge (Masamune\u2019s Revenge) feels like listening to a depressing story from a friend that got terminated from their dream job. I can\u2019t exactly say this show is something for everyone. It\u2019s a dramedy teen soap opera that some will find entertaining while others will leave with the thought of never getting their time back. Listen. This show isn\u2019t really hard to understand but to appreciate it? That\u2019s another story.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, the series is pretty straightforward. Well, it is straightforward at first glance considering the premise. You got this hot main male protagonist (Masamune Makabe) who ispopular, handsome, athletic, and pretty much the IT guy that every woman wants to get their hands on. Except of course, he was totally the opposite before. When he was a kid, Masamune used to be fat, unpopular, and subject to being bullied. To add to the injury? A girl he used to have a crush on rejected him while giving him the cruel nickname, \u201cPig\u2019s Foot\u201d. You can probably guess Masamune didn\u2019t take that well so he is set out to commit the ultimate revenge against Aki Adagaki, the girl who wronged him. \\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, while the show sounds like it can be a potentially heavy drama show, it\u2019s really more of a lighthearted romantic comedy. Sure, it has the ingredients for cooking up a melancholic heavy story but it\u2019s really not much so throughout the course of the series. Viewers will come to understand that revenge is far more complicated than how Masamune plans out. Every episode serves as a step forward or backward for Masamune in his plans. And while we also find out more about the characters, the series likes to have fun often with what it has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can\u2019t exactly say fun is a term to describe while watching the characters in their roles. Masamune Makabe is a straightforward guy that shows a bit of narcissism. Don\u2019t believe me? Just watch what he does in the morning before going to school or how he eats his food. In the meantime, there\u2019s Aki Agadaki, a character that many viewers will probably dislike from the start. I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if Aki is a make or break factor for the fans to drop this series. With a cruel personality (she\u2019s even nicknamed \u201cCruel Princess\u201d at school) and has a hobby of tormenting others, the show seems to intentionally make people hate her. I would also say that she\u2019s a spoiled brat as her reliance on Yoshino (her personal maid) is very evident. So at this point, you\u2019re probably asking yourself \u201cShould I really watch this?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Masamune no Revenge emphasizes on relationship developments and how Masamune\u2019s story develops as context gets more and more complicated. This includes the appearance of other characters. I\u2019ve already mentioned Yoshino but viewers will also discover that she is more than she appears to be. Neko Fujinomiya, a transfer student also enters the story and formulates what viewers may designate as a generic love triangle. On top of that, the show seems to be saturated with generic characters. From best friend trap to fujoshi, this show pulls the oldest gags from the book. Still, Masamune can actually be a decent character once you see through his flaws. Although he is narcissistic, he isn\u2019t necessarily a cruel person. In fact, he is actually an ideal character that anyone would want to be friends with. Hanging out with the most popular guy at school gives social status and Masamune is a symbolic image of that. At times, Masamune also shows genuine concern for his friends and even comes to aid of total strangers. Unlike Aki, Masamune\u2019s relationship with others isn\u2019t always one sided either. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of relationships, what can you really expect from this show? At its core, Aki and Masamune\u2019s relationship is perhaps the most complicated. There\u2019s mind games going on between the two in almost every segment. While Aki often asserts herself to be the superior individual, Masamune\u2019s clever tactics helps him understand her better. The two even goes out on dates and some episode shows that Aki has a vulnerable side to her as well. On the other hand, Masamune\u2019s relationship with others are generally casual, friendly, and straightforward. He gets along well with most people such as his best friend Kojuro Shuri, transfer student Neko, and close friend Tae Futaba. As he is a handsome guy, Masamune is also the ideal image of girls at his school. The only other complicated relationship he has with is with Yoshino. In retrospect, the relationships in this show is nothing impressive and on the surface level, you can probably discover them in any romantic comedy literature or on TV.\\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, I confess that the series didn\u2019t do justice in adapting the show. While it starts off in the right direction, certain parts of the story is cut off while other parts are overemphasized. In addition, the opening song is very spoilerish and a degeneration of crafty storytelling. As such, I express not only disappointment at the length of the series but also at what they really adapted. On the other hand, the comedy of the series can be entertaining at times. Popcorn entertainment might be a better way to put it as we see how the characters interact under certain circumstances. Remember, this series is lighthearted and not something for mature audiences. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one major thing they handled right, it would be the art direction. I have to admit, Tiv (the author of the series) has a talent at creating attractive characters. Silver Link brings that attractiveness in full color and animation. In general, the show has a decent production and every main character has their physical appeal. Fan service appears from time to time ranging from full commando scenes or the infamous beach episode. Putting that aside, Masamune no Revenge is a pretty show.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much impression I can say about the overall soundtrack or the music. It just seems to be there and does its job although easily forgettable. The OP and ED theme songs reflects the show\u2019s theme and agendas while dropping many hints at the storytelling. Finally, there\u2019s the voice acting, something that I found to be slightly above average yet nothing too impressive overall. Ironically, I find Aki\u2019s voice to be the best performed as the character really does sound like a cruel princess. The way she speaks to others with her sarcastic tone while mocking others fits her personality just right.\\n\\n\r\nSo by the time you\u2019re reading this part, you\u2019re probably thinking a lot of things on your mind. Just know this though, Masamune no Revenge is still a romantic comedy regardless how the premise appears to be. Revenge is a controversial word and for some of us, it\u2019s something we may even have experienced or want to inflict upon someone we have intense feelings towards. For Masamune, it\u2019s his story and one that begins with his revenge.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You might be thinking, \u201cUgh, is this just another typical harem anime?!\u201d Well, to that I say, \u201cYeah. It is\u2026\" But, at the same time, \"No. It isn\u2019t.\u201d Let me explain why without spoilers:\r\nThe reason why I say \u201cyes\u201d is because if you\u2019ve seen a few harem anime before, you will most likely be able to predict how the story will end from the first episode. There's no concluding ending (probably because it's setting the stage for a second season). This series reminds me a lot of Nisekoi: the story isn't too amazing and doesn't stand out too much, so you most likely won't likethem if it you don't like harem anime in general. The reason why I say \u201cno\u201d is because this isn\u2019t actually a typical harem anime because Masamune-kun (main guy) does actually turn down potential love interests in this season. Also, the route that masamune-kun takes to get to the ending is a new one that I haven\u2019t seen in any other other harem-like anime, but the characters are all pretty much dumbasses in romance. The story's not bad unless you really just don't like harem anime. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR at the end\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty good and relatively unique among harem anime, but it's not anything spectacularly different at all. For example, this anime\u2019s plot is a bit special because rather than trying to find his old love interest and win her over to live happily ever after, Masamune-kun actually trains to become a very \u201chot\u201d and \u201cmuscular\u201d guy that seeks to win her love... and then he wants wreck her (Adagaki Aki\u2019s) feelings as revenge for rejecting him as a kid while giving him the nickname \u201cpiggy\u201d. Luckily, she doesn\u2019t recognize him, but she is extremely difficult to win over since she is well-known for turning down everybody that asks her out and giving them terrible nicknames. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out with a series of convenient coincidences and some random one-time only pantyshots occur (did somebody say plot convenience panty shots?! mmm... my favorite\u2026), he then discovers an embarrassing secret about Adagaki Aki that actually makes it too risky for her to just give him a bad nickname, which sets the groundwork for this series\u2019 progression. There are a good amount of plot twists, which allows the anime to put you through the wringer with suspense occasionally. The pacing was great, the comedy was entertaining, so I really believe that the story deserves an 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art\u2019s not particularly impressive. The background art\u2019s pretty good and relatively detailed, but I don\u2019t think the characters were detailed and/or expressionate enough for me to give this category a higher score. The visual effects, angles, and lighting were all pretty good. The animation\u2019s frame rate is low enough that you can see some lack of fluidity, but it\u2019s fluid enough that you probably won\u2019t be able to notice it unless you really look for it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters are all voiced well and their actors/actresses fill the roles very well. The music in this series is great! This is another factor that I think sets this anime apart from other harem anime. The background music style ranges from this one dramatic flamboyant orchestral piece that sounds like music played when a really fat noble is walking, to other orchestral and harpsichord pieces that are all just generally pretty great background music overall. The opening fits the anime and sounds pretty good. The ending sounds pretty generic, but also fits. Sound effects are good enough. Overall, I think the sound deserves a 9/10 overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the characters in this series. Masamune\u2019s character actually sucks pretty badly (because he turned down best girl), but all jokes aside he\u2019s a pretty solid character and is actually pretty funny. Adagaki Aki is pretty much just a generic small breasted tsundere, but she\u2019s not voiced by Rie Kugimiya, so that\u2019s always a plus. Koiwai Yoshino\u2026 she\u2019s essential to the plot and has lots of PLOT material herself (if you know what I mean). The characters get pretty well-developed by the end, but they are still pretty generic. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the characters in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, I think the series was pretty entertaining. The story kept me in suspense as we watched Masamune kun teeter on the edges of getting caught during his revenge and all of the various plot twists that came up. It was actually a pretty enjoyable series to watch!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAt first glance, Masamune-Kun seems like a generic harem anime but it has elements that sets it apart from other harem anime: while the characters are indeed generic, the story line has a major difference from other common generic harem anime (it reminded me of Nisekoi, but without Shaft\u2019s studio skills). This is definitely one of the better harem anime out there, so I feel that it does deserve a 7/10. The art\u2019s good, the characters are good, the music\u2019s great, and the concept of revenge sets this anime apart from other harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Should you watch this?\\n\r\nIf you like harem anime, then of course. \\n\r\nIf you want to see an unusual harem anime, then yeah. \\n\r\nIf you like dramatic romance anime, then ehh you can give it a shot... but both the drama and the romance weren\u2019t really central elements of this anime. \\n\r\nIf you like tsundere small breasted characters, well\u2026 this series has you covered. \\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for some mesmerizing inspirational story or serious anime romance, drama, or anything other than a romantic-harem-comedy, you\u2019re definitely in the wrong place. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you decide! If it didn\u2019t help, or you disagree, feel free to let me know by sending me a message so I can be better next time!",

            "content": "Yeaaah ... It's not that good... but it's not completely bad. Just really average.\r\nThe story of Masamune-kun is pretty much your generic RomCom harem anime but a little twist in it. Masamune is trying to hook up with the ''Cruel Princess'' to dump her later and getting his revenge on her. Why ? Just read the synopsis, it's not really worth to write about it again here. Fair enough, this could be potentially good but you can pretty much see miles away what's going to happen next and its filled with clich\u00e9. Also the comedy in it is really hit or miss.\r\nHowever, episode 4 gaveme good hopes that maybe it's going the right way with the story ... but something at the end of the episode pretty much ruined the development between Masamune and Aki and at this point, looks like its going to be a good old love triangle/harem thing with some drama in it. Definitly was not a good time to introduce it and its more annoying than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Yoshino, Aki's maid, is pretty interesting. Can't really say too much though because.. spoilers. But she's definitly one of the 2 reason that i keep watching it.\\n\r\nOh yeah, we have a trap and Masamune's mom is a loli. Of course.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty decent, nothing to write home about but Silver Link. does a good enough job. They definitly has done better though. Most of the girls designs are nice, specially Yoshino. Masamune's design is pretty disappointing since he looks like a protagonist from a generic light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is pretty average. The OST does it's job but nothing really standout so far. The Opening is your usual RomCom opening. The ending song by Choucho is pretty nice thought.\\n\\n\r\nSooo, is it enjoyable ? For me not really. But i'm still going to watch it since i'm still interested enough to see where this goes right now. Wouldn't be surprised if they do the predictable route of Masamune not getting his revenge and actually end up with Aki though. I also want to know more about Yoshino and see what's going to happen with her since its pretty much the only character that i still enjoy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, right now i'm at episode 4 and it's pretty much average.\\n\\n\r\n5/10.",

            "content": "Watching this anime is somewhat similar to drinking cheap supermarket cola. It's not outright disgusting, but it leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste. In effect, Masamune-kun no Revenge is certainly not a terrible anime, but it's not really worth investing time on either.\r\nStory (5/10):\r\nCreating a mediocre anime by throwing in a bunch of tried and tested cliches is a sure fire way to earn some cash (by appealing to the otaku audience), and that's exactly what Silver Link has done here. \r\nThe story is absolutely nothing new - a fat kid works out and diets, becomes a pretty-boy and tries to publicly humiliate the girl whorejected him... only to find that he's falling for her. Of course, when he starts getting somewhere, a couple of other girls appear and voila!- a harem is made. \\n\r\nThe developments are all rather abrupt and tasteless. It lacks any semblance of flow and the pacing is quite erratic. All put together, the story aspect is average, if not slightly below average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10):\\n\r\nI'm usually not one to criticize an anime for its artwork, but this one has some major issues. The main thing I found is that the character designs were rather weird - the faces and limbs were all elongated beyond an level that could be ignored, so much so that it almost felt like Code Geass. Other than that, the animation was alright and the color palette used was quite bright. Yet again, average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\r\nThe sound in Masamune-kun no Revenge was alright. The opening and ending songs were decent, but the voice actors sometimes felt a little emotionless and flat. The soundtrack was rather bland.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10):\\n\r\nI'm actually rather impressed with the creators of this series for being able to make characters this weak, while using only the common cliches as raw material. It's not that the characters are terrible or anything - they're just so shallow and two-dimensional that they can't even be taken seriously. I'll give a short description of two of the characters, just to give you an idea of what I mean -\\n\\n\r\n-Makabe Masamune: The 'hero' of the series. Previously a fat kid who was constantly humiliated, he worked extremely hard to improve his appearance. Now that he's hot stuff, he wants to take revenge on the girl who humiliated him in the past... Sounds all well and good, until you find that he starts falling for her within 3-4 episodes. And that's it - That's the entirety of his character, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\n-Adagaki Aki: The one-word description of her is (forgive my language) bitch. She has no positive points other than being rich - as for what draws all those men (including our protagonist) to her, I have absolutely no clue.\\n\\n\r\nOther than those two, there are no characters of any real importance. Then again, having those two as the main characters already makes Masamune-kun no Revenge a failure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nIt's extremely difficult to enjoy something you've seen hundreds of times before, but executed far worse than most. I, for one, couldn't go any further than 7 episodes before dropping it (although I would've dropped it long back had I not wanted to review it)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4.2/10 ~ 4/10):\\n\r\nThe end result is that Masamune-kun no Revenge is a mediocre anime which doesn't bring anything new to the table. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if cardboard characters, boring story and somewhat weird artwork is what you're looking for, then by all means, give it a go.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve known right from the beginning that it\u2019s just going to be another generic school rom-com as I browsed among the entries for Winter 2017, but something within me wanted to watch this show. The premise made me hope that it\u2019s going to be what I wanted it to be, an actual fulfilling story about revenge through love. As an overweight loser who daydreams about obtaining the perfect body and being popular with girls, I quite find Makabe relatable in his endeavor. I was interested how he is going to carry out his plan on Adagaki, but I guess I was asking too much. Iknow I shouldn\u2019t be this disappointed, but damn this show went nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story makes it too convenient for Makabe to get closer with Adagaki. For a cruel princess, she acts very inconsistent. You could say \u201cOh you know, women are really confusing\u201d but I digress. What makes Makabe different from any other dude she has declined? I\u2019m sure they also used the same tactics Makabe is using. To further add into the convenience, Adagaki\u2019s maid Yoshino agrees to help Makabe in his plan for no really good reason. I mean wow, there are so many things in favor of Makabe but ultimately the greatest hindrance to his plan is really himself.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the show has unwanted love interests. Sure, it attempts to create a conflict in which it prevents Makabe\u2019s plan progress but all it does really is derail the main story and put unnecessary complications. \\n\\n\r\nThird, why is Makabe\u2019s mom a loli? \\n\\n\r\nFourth, Makabe is too na\u00efve. While this is not necessarily a bad thing as it can serve as a lesson for him to be more careful and considerate, he is still the same overconfident musclehead at the end of the show. His lack of expertise in female interactions is already a bad signal why his plan is challenging to accomplish. Still, he persists in making his plan succeed out of desperation. I would\u2019ve liked it more if some significant development actually happened due to his flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I really had a hard time whether I should even take the show seriously or not. I mean, I liked some of its dramatic moments like flashbacks of Makabe\u2019s past but how both the serious and non-serious moments flow together is mediocre. The execution also somehow lacks to put a punch on supposedly comedic moments, though I appreciate some of its subtle sarcasm. Overall, the show is a decent time waster if you keep expectations to a minimum. There\u2019s no really profound development and it only serves as a failed attempt at making a dynamic rom-com story. However, it\u2019s not downright terrible and a complete trainwreck. It\u2019s just a show that had a strong start but then forgot what it really wants to go for and then tries to make you deal with its complications for the rest of the duration. Maybe I\u2019m just too let down by this show, but maybe I should have never expected anything from it at all.\\n",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge is another one of those anime which sounds quite interesting on paper, but never comes anywhere close to reaching up to its own potential. What could have been an intriguing story about a man's almost lifelong quest for vengeance through devoted self-improvement and utilization of deceit against the girl who made his childhood a living hell instead ended up being nothing more than a clich\u00e9, predictable and rather generic romcom. Ultimately, it only leaves you thinking about what it could have been.\r\nIn the distant past, Makabe Masamune was a fat kid who found himself being a victim of bullying from numerous otherpeople his age, but especially bad was the abuse from the spoiled rich girl Adagaki Aki, who among other things gave him the nickname \"Pig's Foot\" for his chubby appearance. This experience seemingly traumatized Masamune growing up, and he started working hard at improving himself through excessive body training and studying shoujo manga to learn what girls are into when it comes to boys. Many years down the road, Masamune has become a handsome narcissistic asshole by the time he starts high school, where he once again meets Aki. She fails to recognize Masamune due to his drastic change in appearance but he identifies her immediately, and vows to finally have his revenge on her by making her fall in love with him only to cruelly dump her on the spot once she confesses to him. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if that was all the anime was about, I think I would have liked it quite a lot. Having a smartass MC trying to seduce a cold-hearted bitch, only to then promptly enact his revenge upon her by breaking her heart... I mean it sounds like something really amusing and unique on paper, albeit in a somewhat sadistic way. But unfortunately, that is not how the story plays out at all. In the first four episodes, the story mostly consists of Masamune trying to get closer and closer to Aki with the help of his newfound insider accomplice in Aki's maid Yoshino. We get to learn more about Aki's habits and what she's like as a person, and although he has some difficulties with it, the revenge plan still feels like it is slowly moving forwards. However, with the start of episode five, things quickly start to stagnate as a love rival (Neko) is suddenly brought into the picture and the story turns into a more typical romcom all of a sudden. If this had been a series with a premise designed to be nothing more than that from the start then this would have been fine, but really this story did not need to slowly become a harem. The main plot concept revolves around solely Masamune and Aki, so bringing in outsiders merely results in them coming across as obstacles to the story's progression. More importantly though, at this point the revenge concept is all but gone because since this an anime, our MC and main heroine *obviously* have to end up falling in love with each other. Gone was the interesting original premise, and instead we are left with a narcissist and a bitch crushing on each other, but of course they're both far too dense to realize it, especially Aki. How incredibly original.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this is that Aki as a character does not really function very well outside the revenge concept. No matter how you look at it, she is just a terrible person through and through. Even discounting the childhood trauma that she inflicted upon Masamune, in her current high school life she is known as the Cruel Princess: a girl totally abusing every single male person she comes across, giving them offensive nicknames, insulting them, rejecting everyone who tries to be nice to her, and just plain treats them like crap. Why? Well supposedly because some guys had been mean to her in her own childhood as well, but what right does that give her to treat completely unrelated people in such a discriminating way? Her entire character is perfectly suited for the villain role of the original revenge plot, but when she is suddenly forced to become a tsundere love interest romcom-style... it just does not fit her at all. And even more mindboggling, what the hell does Masamune of all people see in her to make him fall in love with her despite everything? What happened to your resolve? Even discounting her current terrible personality, did you also somehow forget about everything she put you through as a kid? You know, the reason you sought revenge in the first place? Just how mentally weak can you be?\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, while his romantic feelings may be questionable, Masamune can at least be somewhat manly about them at times, as he showcases to great effect in episode eight, which is by far and wide the best episode of the anime. But what does that all amount to? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Whatever strong impact one would have thought that seemingly game-changing episode would have, the anime completely throws it away immediately in the very next episode for seemingly no apparent reason. It felt like the author finally hit the right note for the story without even realizing it himself, and ended up backing on it too quickly. So not only did he first throw away the anime's original potential as a revenge story, but just as it seemed he might actually have successfully converted it into a promising romance story... he throws away that too? Goodness, why? Just what are you trying to do here exactly?\\n\\n\r\nBut as if that was not enough, the story then does not just return to the status quo, but it also gets much, much worse. The final three episodes of Masamune-kun no Revenge are simply horrible. I will not spoil any details, but basically at the start of episode 10, a new character called Gasou is introduced whose backstory and mere appearance are so far-fetched it made me twitch my eyebrows. Has the author ever heard of something known as suspension of disbelief? The whole story suddenly starts feeling incredibly implausible, but the way everyone reacts to the situation is even more ridiculous. To begin with Gasou himself is rather tedious to watch in general, but how Aki reacts to his presence is just absurd. It feels like her entire character changes in a split second as if she had some bizarre personality split, and while I technically understand why it happens, that is only a direct consequence of her being unbelievably dense and stupid. How can she possibly not realize the truth? I thought she was supposed to be a pretty smart girl? Again, it all just feels like too much of a plot convenience. And do not even get me started on Aki's so-called \"personal guard\" and how they decide to interfere with the whole situation for their own absolutely ridiculous reasons, they are just plain annoying and their actions are honestly borderline criminal yet the show treats them as if they are somehow okay or excusable. Furthermore, it is also painfully obvious that the entire story arc (if you can call it that) is just designed to be a roundabout way for Masamune and Aki to eventually get closer to each other, but really... we did not need this. If that was all you wanted, why did you not just continue from the plot development in episode eight instead?? The end result would probably have been the same, but the journey there would have been ten times better. It just baffles me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Masamune-kun no Revenge feels like a story written without much initial thought put into it by the author, almost like if he changed his mind every few weeks while writing about what direction he wanted to take the story in. As a result, it just ends up all over the place but ultimately going almost nowhere. It leaves behind an uncomfortable feeling of wasted potential on multiple levels, and a story which could and perhaps should have been a lot better than what it actually turned out to be. However, if we look past whatever potential the series may have had for a second and just look at the final product instead, then at the very least it passes as an average generic romcom. That is certainly not what I wanted it to be, but it is what we got, and looking at it that way it is at least rarely straight-up boring. Yes, it is packed to the brim with clich\u00e9s, but really what romcom is not nowadays? Masamune-kun no Revenge could have been a great anime. It did not become a great anime however, but it is still at least a tolerable one. I just wish premises like this could be left for authors who actually plan on doing something interesting with them rather than just going back to what has already been done in a hundred different other anime already.\\n\\n\r\nOh and Masamune's mother is also a loli who looks to be about five years younger than her own daughter. Why? I have no idea.",

            "content": "In spite of the many Masamune-kun reviews out, describing the show as \u201creally pretty okay\u201d or used words like \u201cbecuz\u201d, I decided to write a semi-serious review to add to the mix. Revenge is a dish best served cold. I\u2019ve heard of people exacting revenge on others due to everything from getting cheated on to a murdered relative. The reason I state this is to accentuate the weak premise Silver Link\u2019s (Kokoro Connect, Strike the Blood) \u201cMasamune-kun no Revenge\u201d carries. It is a story about a tormented chubby kid (Masamune Makabe), who grows up to be a modern marvel of handsomeness, vowing to enforce justiceon a vicious vixen (Aki Adagaki) by breaking her heart. Not necessarily the strongest basis for seeking revenge\u2026 he could've just, you know, grown up.\\n\\n\r\nThe TL;DR approach to the anime would be the dollar menu version of Nisekoi, with slightly worse art, protagonists and music... and without the delectable waifu Onodera. Knowing this fact, if you didn\u2019t exactly care for the awkward love triangle that series presented, or the bodacious tsundere that was Chitoge, I would advise you to skip Masamune kun altogether. The added revenge element does little to enhance the series past developing a convenient crutch for the plot to hinge on. Though it doesn\u2019t do anything cringeworthy, the anime is mediocre in almost every category.\\n\\n\r\nThe bulk of Masamune-kun\u2019s story is eaten up by the relationship development between himself and Adagaki, and the constant inner monologuing of how he\u2019s going to get back at her. After years of floundering through life as a plump and ridiculed young boy, Masamune kun arrives at Adagaki\u2019s school, unrecognizable from the dark times of his past. He\u2019s a perfect student, has a flawless exercise regiment and every room he walks into becomes his own personal harem. On the contrary, not much has changed in Adagaki\u2019s demeanor. She\u2019s evil, pretentious and constantly makes up degrading names for the various male suitors approaching her. Not to mention she has a ravenous appetite. The story continues with Masamune attempting to inflict his revenge on Adagaki by getting her to like him and eventually squashing her hopes, much like she did to him during their younger years. This story approach is predictable but strangely entertaining, if for no other reason than to listen to Masamune\u2019s multitude of internal dilemmas. The comedy is also unsurprising, however it's still good for a few laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Masamune kun is where the series really starts to drop off in quality. It appears that almost every character and facet of storytelling (sans the chubby betrothed kid) is carbon copies from Nisekoi. This checks out in the manga world as well, due to Masamune kun\u2019s release being over a year after Nisekoi\u2019s. These undeniable similarities make for a less exciting plot overall, as the series becomes less about itself and more \u201cNisekoi did that better\u201d moments. Once the plot is established, it takes a sporadic turn by implanting a random damsel who seemingly wants Masamune at all costs, and a rotund young prince who\u2019s predestined to marry Adagaki. These characters are not eased into the anime, but rather plopped down in the middle of things, with very little backstory to boot. It's really what causes Masamune-kun to meander towards failure. Overall, the series does little to redeem itself and staggers aimlessly toward its bittersweet conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Makabe is actually a much better character than I initially presumed. His mannerisms played off as conceited, but through discovering the ghosts of his past and his countless acts of kindness, he redeems himself quite astoundingly. His counterparts are far less promising, with Adagaki being the only other character with any real depth among them. She fits the bill for Chitoge quite accurately in terms of tsundere-isms but seems to have less focus on her in the story overall. Perhaps this is a result of the reduced episode count from Nisekoi, but still disappointing nonetheless. There aren't any other characters really worth mentioning, as they either add very little to the story or exist merely as plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Masamune kun is great to look at, but there aren't any scenes of astonishing animation present within its runtime. Character models are attractive and colorful, and the environments are drawn coherently, with no more detail than is required. I didn't notice any framing issues, and no evidence of pixel lag, so it's apparent the artists at least did the proper editing. That being said, I felt the OP was animated quite generically relative to the rest of the series, which is honestly the exact opposite than what I'm used to in an anime. It came by surprise, but it also didn't help me get excited for the series at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, I can't say I really cared for either the OP or ED tracks. Generic and Jpop-py tones resonated with underwhelming animations, hitting par for the course for the quality of the rest of the series. The background OST was a tad more reputable, sparking the mood appropriately with tense or lightened styles, and the sound effects were well placed within the episodes. Voice acting is also very well done, with Ayaka Ohashi making a strong case for Adagaki and Natauki Hanae (Ken, Tokyo Ghoul) absolutely nailing the narcissistic Masamune. They certainly brought out the big guns for this one.\\n\\n\r\nThough it certainly won't be in consideration for Anime of the Season, Masamune kun no Revenge is a series that can certainly be enjoyed by the right audience, and perhaps with the right mindset. Preferably if you have seen Nisekoi, do you best to forget the entire series as you watch, because the similarities are uncanny at times. Leave your brain at the door, for there aren't any veiled symbolisms or faint themes to be had here, just your run of the mill comedic romance series. Recommended for modern day anime lovers, or those looking for a laugh or two to change things up. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other Winter \u201817 reviews!",

            "content": "Sometimes revenge may never be a solution to a problem in the real world. Sometimes, it can make things worse and create a bigger problem. But Masamune wants that revenge, no matter the cost. \r\nI'll be reviewing the episodes as a manga reader. Who is currently following the manga.\r\nStory (8)\r\nMasamune is a person I know I never could be. Becuz of his past with the deadly Cruel Princess Aki Adagaki, he then goes through self improvement and exercising for how many years to make sure that he becomes the hottest Kirit- I mean guy in the anime, and boy does he succeed. All the girlsget horny over him, which is quite the success. Masamune wants revenge on Aki, which is technically the whole point of the anime. It shows his process of achieving revenge and obtaining victory over Aki, who oh soever destroyed him in his past. It's time to strike back...\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\r\nSilver Link never fails to disappoint when it comes to school anime, I say never, but uhh. Yah not never, but I love most of the works they do (However I still haven't forgiven them regarding the Kokoro Connect Voice Actor Prank >:( . Since like 99.9% Of all silver link anime'a have a school genre or setting. The art is Fandibbly Dastic. Good art and very colourful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8)\\n\r\nAki- The Bitch\\n\r\nMakabe- Slave of the Bitch\\n\r\nYoshino- The Hot, Big Breasted Maid\\n\r\nFutaba- The Rejected (rip)\\n\r\nNeko- The Hot, Big Breated Girl THAT SILVER LINK SCREWED UP HER HAIR SHOULD NOT BE THAT COLOR SJDJSKIDFKDENWJ7-72$2);&;' >:(\\n\r\nKojurrou- That trap with the cute eyes that has clovers in it. Voiced by Saori Hayami (which I swear is in like 80% of Winter 2017 Anime)\\n\\n\r\nThese character are nothing incredibly special. But damn are they fun to watch. All you need to know is, Aki is a Dere Bitch, Makabe is not your typical Harem MC. He has a set of balls and doesn't nose bleed when looking at a pair of Yoshino'a HOT PANTIES DAMN HER ASS IS FINE. Whoops, inner horny me came out for a second. *clears throat.* Futaba is that side character that most people love including me. I low key wished she and Makabe became a couple tbh. The Character Interactions are funny and we get to see Aki starting to open to Makabe as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nI see why ppl call her a tsundere, but she only hits him like 2 times. After that, the Tsun begins to fade, and it's left with Dere. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8) OP and ED and BGM'a are great. But sometimes the music over intensifies or over dramatizes the situation (not that I have a problem with that for it adds a nice comedic effect) But no problems here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) As a manga reader, I am satisfied with how the adaptation is going so far. I really hope that they can cover the whole manga for it's about to end soon. I swear it can't be done within 12 episode unless they rush or skip some arcs (with some arcs I'm ok with them skipping .-. ) Cuz in 4 episodes which would be 1/3 of the whole show, Neko was just introduced. Maybe it can be done idk. I just hope they can adapt the whole thing. Unless they end it with concluding OVA'a like Kokoro Connect. Overall. Very enjoyable, (still kinda [just kinda] salty how they identify this as 'Harem') Only like 3 girls like him basically, with on getting rejected in like what episode 2 or 3. So yah, not everyone will like it. But I sure as hell do.",

            "content": "(This will be my first review. It was orignally a forum comment that I cleaned up to be more appropriate. I'll stick to more detailed manga reviews in the future.)\r\nThe story seems pretty original at first but then it devolves into your generic RomCom, with all the clich\u00e9.\r\n1) Story and Characters: 4 each\r\nIn the beginning, it looked like the main characters have it all. Yet, under the veneer of wealth, all is not so good. Masamune is popular but thinks excessively of himself. He also has a complex because of of his past. He is confident if we compare him to other MCs of thegenre but he just as dense and stupid at times.\\n\\n\r\nAki is your generic run-of-the mill  tsundere. She has underlying trust issues and often treats others with contempt. However, she will gradually open her heart to other characters. There's not much to say about it without spoiling the story. As our two protagonists get close to each other, they introduce various plot elements and we get to see their quirks. This their interactions rather entertaining. The side characters are gradually introduced, each adding some spice to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent one would be Yoshino. Presented early into the show as an innocent klutz, she fashionably proved that looks are often deceptive. Who would think that the seemingly innocuous Koiwai would be the catalyst behind the premise of the story? Yet, this is the case. Her past is the most tragic one amoing the whole cast and her interactions with the MC are fascinating, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nKojuuro is your habitual trap. Gentle and shy, he is the opposite of the MC. This is a nice contrast. He is a loyal friend better taste that the main characters when it concerns matters of the heart. Tae Futaba aka Class President is also a moderaely fascinating character. The de facto tomboy genki. Energetic and extraverted, she brings life to the show. Her spontaneity often moved the plot when it began to stagnate and made the show much more enjoyable. Her candour would have won me over if it weren\u2019t for Neko.\\n\\n\r\nOh Neko! Many dislike her because her introduction more or less ruined an intimate moment between the two protagonists. Yet, she remains my favorite Character in the show. She reminds me a lot of Marika Tachibana, with a hint of Rem from Re: Zero. Her past is heart-warming and her personality is enthralling.  She is a very forward character and her moments with the other characters are fun to watch. It would be interesting to see a character like her in a leading role.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s main villain was introduced fairly late, at a fairly inauspicious moment. He does have some genuine motications but nothing much to write about him. He serves more as a plot device and introduced some forced drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2) Art and Sound: 6 and 5 respectively\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is quite good but nothing spectacular. My biggest complaint would be the generic, annoying high-pitched girl voice opening song. It is way too overused nowadays. On the other side, it\u2019s quite rare for the main Seiyuu (VA) to sing the OP. The sound effects are appropriately used but then again, it's a Rom Com not an Action Anime. The visuals are actually the best part of this anime. There are some gorgeous scenes and they do not suffer from budget issues. The animation is also fluid.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3) Enjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe pace was more or less satisfactory if we exclude the ending and the direction was average. It isn\u2019t very deep but lies somewhere between a traditional romcom and a romantic drama. Masamune-kun no Revenge managed to portray the restless behaviour that accurs in adolescence in a somehow enjoyable way. \\n\\n\r\n4) Overall Impression: 4\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a passable adaptation of the manga. I would not recommend it though. The story isn't complete and some elements can get too childish. \\n\\n\r\nLike we say in my country, je suis rest\u00e9 sur ma faim. \\n",

            "content": "Unlike most reviewers, I did not come here to rant, although I do have something to rant about. Nevertheless, this anime was not as bad as most people say. \r\nThe beginning is clich\u00e8; it involves a smart, handsome teen who recently transfers schools. However, there is a twist. He transfers not because of educational reasons or because he got bullied in his old one but because he wants to date a girl and break up with her. What the actual f*ck? Yeah, that was me when I watched it. \r\nNevertheless, I gave it a try, and it was fine. The flashbacks which were told lateron on the anime were really important and I understood the main characters desires at last. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough his reasons were quite childish and immature, the main character still had his own ambitions and points to prove. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was going very well, until a lot of obstacles came. Things started getting crazy and unorganized. A girl suddenly proposed to the MC, and another guy was about to date the girl. The other guy was a douche, but he deserved to date the girl much more than the main character. The girl was stupid as crap too. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the ranting, I really despised the fact that the main character rejected a cute, perfect wife-material girl who was deeply in love with him to date a tsundere, bully, agressive, unkind, and selfish girl. Honestly, I don't know if the MC is smart or not. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, if you haven't known, all characters who are not the main ones are plainly stupid. They are just the \"extra\" characters who only react accordingly without any self-identity. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this was a fun anime. It is definitely original, and it has pleasurable art and sound. But if you are competent and do things based on common sense, not by your gut, you would find many scenes relatively irritating.",

            "content": "warning: spoilers\r\n(The review has a tl;dr section as well.)\r\nOnce in a while you come across an anime which actually has a nice premise: a boy called Masamune seeking revenge against his former childhood friend Aki Adagaki. So far so good. Then you take a careful look at the genres shown on the MAL page - harem, comedy, romance and school - the absolute worst combination of genres, which usually indicate a mediocre story. Thus the first doubts appear. In the first minutes you are presented a \u201cnarcissistic\u201d personality of the MC and think that he could be interesting despite of expecting a generic harem protagonist.Unfortunately, when his mother and Aki appeared for the first time, the death flag for this anime was set and the potential was wasted.\\n\\n\r\nI will try to hold back cursing words and talk about the characters first. As I have already said, up to 2 minutes it actually looked decent with the promising trait. But then the clich\u00e9s started to be used left and right. First his mother, who looks like a kid, not even able to give birth him and his sister with her physique , is used to draw out laughter with the viewer, which it doesn't. Because of the poor timing and bad execution of the joke, she is reduced to a generic one-dimensional character and has no further use in the story later on. Great!!!\\n\\n\r\nBesides having a sister, who isn't explored and stays an irrelevant character as well, he meets his fated arch enemy (or not), Aki, when he transfers into the new school. We are shown his pretty delicate past with her and why he \u201chates\u201d her as well. Thus he swears to retaliate by doing the same. But as it couldn't be made even more predictable, the writer decides to throw in the tsundere archetype besides making her a gluttony just to have a moe trait as well, in order to distract from the bigger problems, her personality. It's not enough to make her a tsundere, but an asshole as well (the way she rejects people). And the other students in the school become even more interested in her because of that. It makes no sense, especially because you would have at least a balance of haters and followers, if not only having haters. Just to make her a \u201cgreater existence\u201d and live in her nice fantasy bubble even more. I'll come back to her later. Great!!!\\n\\n\r\nThen the next girl, Tae Futaba, who just pops out of nowhere and confesses to him, is another character who makes an appearance for a short time and just serves the purpose of showing, how \u201cpopular\u201d Masamune is. Why or how did she fall in love with him? No idea, it just happened. She has a severe case of \u201cfalling in love with transfer students\u201d syndrome, which can be found in multiple run-of-the-mill harem stories. Masamune, \u201cdetermined\u201d to have revenge, rejects her and then she follows him for the whole anime while staying in the background. So what is the point of her character? Probably just to establish a harem and pander to viewers who like girls like her. Great!!\\n\\n\r\nBut fear not, for there is a guy, yes, you read correctly, a guy, in this show. How could he possibly fit in? There is only one correct answer, as the trap archetype. He receives no development or exploration whatsoever either because his main objective is to pander to fujoshis and he has no deeper reason to be there. You can blank him out and move on, but he actually appears a few times, so you still remember that there was someone like him in the show. If you were to recall one of his traits (not only superficial ones), congratulations, you seem to have more information than me about him, because he is only presented as a bland character in the series. If you want his name, look it up, I've forgotten it. Great!!\\n\\n\r\nJust when you think it can't become any worse, a \u201cninja\u201d, Yoshino Koiwai, joins the scene. While serving as fanservice in the first two episodes, she becomes the supporting pillar for Masamune's revenge because he can't manage it on his own. Unfortunately, the motive for her support is insufficient and doesn't dive any deeper like for the other characters. So she ends up resembling the \u201ckuudere\u201d archetype and who would've guessed, she receives no further development of her motivations either. She is just there like the trap, and while she has a few good moment (her schemes), in the end she is another shallow character. No point in introducing her as a character either other than showing another \u201ccute\u201d girl. Great!\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the author expands the harem even more by introducing another childhood friend, Neko Fujinomiya. Her convenient introduction looks more of a plot convenience rather than a natural one though. Of course she has to \u201clove\u201d him from the beginning of her introduction. Even she is used to pander again as she is commonly referred to as the \u201cpanty-less girl\u201d. Problematic are Masamune's interactions with her. He is distracted by her to the point that he thought about stopping his initial plan against Aki even though this event apparently deeply \u201cscarred\u201d him. Furthermore, he's so dense to the point that he doesn't even notice Neko's issues or her intentions. I'll elaborate later why that is a problem. While her past and issues are a bit explored, they're swept under the rug  and forgotten again. In the end she doesn't play a bigger role than just serving as a side lover. Compared to the other characters, she actually seems to be quite decent in terms of writing, although overall (compared to other stories), it's still mediocre. Great.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought that they reached the tip of the iceberg, you're wrong though. By a very convenient chance, another boy, Kanetsugu Gasou, with a same build as Masamune in the past appears and attempts to steal Aki. What a way to accelerate the relationship between them. Besides dragging the story out even more and annoying the hell out of the viewer by including more tropes, he has just as generic motivations to act like he does. The studio/writer probably assumed that it would be enough to just show a short flashback, but that makes it come off as weak motivation and feels like an unnatural twist again. Not to mention Aki's affection to him, being deceived so easily. It starts off a series of events which are rather clich\u00e9 and ends up conveniently advancing the relationship with Masamune with the play and the kiss at the end. After that he seems to become unimportant again. With his introduction also followed a few annoying girls who messed with Masamune (borderline kidnapping) and got out of the whole mess without even a scolding, pointless characters again for the sake of advancing the plot and creating drama without actual essence. Great...\\n\\n\r\nAfter talking shortly about the characters, I want to further elaborate on Aki and Masamune and their relationship, as they are making up the main cast of the anime and represent the biggest weakness of the anime. As the story progresses, Masamune seems to lose sight of his initial target to crush Aki's heart as well. That is especially bad because 1. it's the premise that Masamune is out for revenge and 2. he was so much scarred by it that he changed his complete appearance and behavior. That isn't just simple resentment, it's way more realistic that he'd hate her to the point, where they can't go back. And yet, he almost falls in love with her. Another example of the convenient way how the story works. The motivations tend to be weak and they change from one scene to another. Not to forget how dumb he behaves at times even though he is the best student in the grade. Although grades aren't everything, they're a general indicator how smart and diligent someone is and when you see scenes where he acts like he can't even calculate with basic operators, I feel slightly hoaxed by the writer. The same applies for Aki at times. Not great.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story itself, it's very bad because neither does it have a general direction, proven by the amount of generic events (beach scene etc.) and other ones to draw out the plot, nor is it original because of the amount of clich\u00e9s thrown into the plot. The series doesn't even flesh them out so that the viewer wouldn't mind the initial use of clich\u00e9s. Thus the story doesn't really feel like it has any worth or wants to leave a lasting impression. Definitely not great.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect hindering the series is the comedy because it feels out of place. When the anime is actually featuring a serious development, they drop a weak joke (generic joke like it's taken from another anime) and completely destroy the atmosphere. So did it actually make me laugh even once? Maybe once or twice in the whole series, but not more because the transitions were weak and the gestures weren't supporting the joke. Generic empty eyes don't make it funny, if that's what I want, I could watch any other run-of-the-mill comedy. The effort put into the comedy is so low, that it drags the drama and series down. What's left of the drama is, just like I described in the previous paragraphs, pretty bad as well and leaves the anime with a weak balance of drama/comedy. If the series attempted to be more serious about the whole revenge theme, it could have actually been pretty decent. Or if they made fun of the whole revenge affair. But working with the middle ground  damaged the quality a lot especially because of its poor execution. Bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe other genres (harem, romance, school) are dragging its quality down as well. On one hand, the harem is poorly executed because the girls keep popping up left and right just to disappear completely from the plot or losing all relevance as well. It's unoriginal and generic and doesn't contribute at all to the series. Even if it's meant for pandering, the characters feel so lifeless and unappealing that the pandering itself is actually poor as well. On the other hand, the school genre is just there to make it relatable for students, but even the school aspect is poorly executed, evidenced by Aki's standing (acting like a scumbag \u2192 being treated like a goddess) and the lack of real life school themes. Very bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe only aspect I want to talk about before coming to my conclusion is the final episode. With the final episode always comes the responsibility of a series to either make a satisfying conclusion in the best case or leave it off at a cliffhanger at an ideal moment. Unfortunately, the final episode provides neither. After the kiss in the play, they only go to the karaoke (yes, another typical clich\u00e9) and draws out the conclusion even more. By the time you've finally survived the pointless subplot, it ends without answering important questions and using a pretty bad cliffhanger, not hyping up the viewer for more. As a final episode, that's unforgivable. Furthermore, it also looks like Masamune is even torn between revenge and real love. So what was the point of making his past like that? Not to mention that his thoughts are still way too pure. The ending was basically a slap into the face. Atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Masamune-kun no Revenge tries to aim for a pretty interesting idea, just to fall down from a cliff with its execution. Its countless clich\u00e9s and plot conveniences feel out of place and make the story very unnatural, especially the school setting and Aki's behavior. The characters themselves are also consisting more of stereotypes than being fleshed out during the episodes. Even the main characters flip from one moment to another and stay bland until the very end. Thus most characters feel like they were copy-pasted into the anime and just there because of either pandering or because the writer had no idea how to write characters. Either way, the story and characters have a bad synergy and drag down each other.  Even the comedy was, just like I mentioned, more of a hindrance than increasing my enjoyment. It didn't succeed with anything in any of the categories and will stay in my memory as a bad anime, which I couldn't even laugh at. If the writer perhaps excluded the harem, put more emphasis on the school setting and using it to his advantage for a battle between Aki and Masamune or just using better comedy or relying solely on drama, I could have enjoyed the series at least a bit. Neither did the art or animation change my thoughts significantly because neither is the art pretty original, nor was the music memorable or improving the atmosphere. Especially the OP and ED were very average.\\n\\n\r\nThe final words from each paragraph of this review have more development than the whole cast of the series. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\\n\r\n- very clich\u00e9 and bland characters with next to no character development\\n\r\n- main characters flip personalities and their motivations are forgotten at times\\n\r\n- out of place comedy and unfunny jokes + weak transitions with drama\\n\r\n- plot conveniences at times just to advance their relationship (especially into the direction of Masamune actually loving Aki and not into the direction of revenge)\\n\r\n- harem and romance contribute nothing to the story\\n\r\n- weird school with a mentality to worship Aki\\n\r\n- drawn out plot\\n\r\n- no general direction\\n\r\n- weak final episode (especially with the karaoke scenes)\\n\r\n- average to mediocre art\\n\r\n- not memorable soundtrack and weak OP + ED\\n\\n\r\nscores:\\n\r\nstory: 1/10\\n\r\ncharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nsetting: 2.5/10\\n\r\nart/animation: 4/10\\n\r\nmusic: 4/10\\n\\n\r\noverall: 2/10",

            "content": "HEAVY SPOILERS (Entire Anime ruined, With Already Obvious Manga End Spilled, Progress At If You Know And Do Not Care): \r\nThis anime started well enough. Masamune's Revenge requires a little amount of disbelief in the premise, because of course it is going to end with the main girl he is trying to get revenge on become his lover, and while I would fault this anime for making it so starkingly obvious upon reading the synopsis, I am somewhat of a fan of these stories, where hostiles give way to mutual understanding and feelings of affection. How Masamune's will learn to forgive Aki could be executewell, but....\\n\\n\r\nThat is not what I received.\\n\\n\r\nFor the attempted progress in Nisekoi that did not happen to \"acts of God\", Masamune's Revenge suffers from plot induced stupidity just as often, and in frustration for the writer prolonging the development for more slice of life segments, this also makes the characters infuriating to watch. This, coupled with convenient prolonging inconsistency in the character's' attitude and actions, makes it an exercise in futility This leads to arcs being longer than they should be for the information known, with irrational display of actions to pile on, which is what makes my score a humbling 3.\\n\\n\r\nBut first of, let me argue the story: Masamune is trying to get revenge on a girl who break his heart when they children, by breaking her heart as an unknown High Schooler. This premise is already shaky. Besides establishing that Masamune being supposedly narcissistic, it also exclaims that Masamune is an asshole. A petty one at that. This does not mean we do not initially root for him, because conveniently, Aki, the one who broke his heart, has grown to be an even bigger asshole, fond of maintaining a schedule of constantly rejecting boys who confessed based on her misandry. Besides begging the question, \u201cWhy any of these boys would find a cruel, man hating bitch being prominent potential girlfriend material\u201d, this establishes a conflict for Masamune to overcome, with his methods being...using shoujo manga as guides to woo Aki\u2019s heart. For some, it may be funny, and I chuckled at times, but contrasting his intelligence, Masamune honestly believes they would work, especially without any real life innovation on his part, and consistently uses them for the first few episodes, making an alliance with Aki\u2019s Maid Koiwai (Who has been Aki\u2019s maid since they were children, despite the whole ethical nature of coerced child labor) in the meantime, who instead of just giving him advice, sometimes has to directly talk to Aki at times to push her in a certain direction.\\n\\n\r\nBesides being a little unimaginative, with various animes, such as The World God Only Knows, profiting off of this now trite humor, this was okay if you were a fan of the genre, with other tropperiffic romance hijinxs thrown in for good measure. People who want a better than \u201cdecent\u201d romantic comedy should search elsewhere at this point. This was also a reason why it was rated highly, because many put up preemptive reviews before finishing the series, or at least the end of the Neko \u201carc\u201d. It serves as an okay transition to the first appearance of Neko in episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nNow to rant.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I disliked the Neko saga. It was prolonged out of stupidity, and Neko's reasoning to be rather built up for no reason, and even a little bit of shallow randomness at that, even if she did end up loving him. For all she knows, Masamune could have attacked you with scissors or something, be in a relationship, anything, which bites Neko in the butt for falling in love before meeting him, seeing as he has admittedly cruel reasons for breaking off any potential relationships for the sole purpose of getting his revenge, contrary to the nice guy you imagine he would be. Nevertheless, in hindsight, one would ask \u201cWhy bother with the fake background story that Masamune knew was false? Why didn't he confront her then, or about the missing picture?\u201d She could have easily just as confessed her reasons without hiding behind a fake love story, and the honesty would have been a lot more better for the show, especially as being a contrast to Masamune's deception with Aki. The reason was built up beyond importance, sure, but it isn't a bad reason in itself. I do not see any reason to hide it at all. Teenagers are extraordinarily stupid to think they should fall in love with someone at a distance, before a relationship starts. That is not how it usually works, and Neko might have been a subversion of that reasoning if she did not play it straight based on a photograph Masamune's Loli mother sent, out a heap of other suitors. To an extent, we can exercise the choice over who we love, and it is entirely possible to fall in love after repeated social engagements, even outside of dating, among other things. I mean, is that not the point of the Masamune's relationship with Aki? Although, he sure was accepting of Neko laying him on the bed after all that creepy shit that has happened in the previous 5 minutes. Never stick your dick into crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Masamune is a hypocrite, for refusing Neko, on the basis of her love not being \"genuine\" (Partly because he did not interrogate her, partly because she thought the truth was \"inconvenient, neither of which are really logical), when he is in a insincere relation with Aki for the sole purpose of breaking her heart, for an incident that happened when they fucking 8 years old. Masamune's standards are sorts of fucked up here to criticize someone for the same thing he is doing (In the case of Neko, it was an assumption bought by a lack of asking, of all things, not a truthful observation), even if it could be demonstrated to be an example of why revenge is bad, or that Masamune is unknowingly falling in love with Aki (Questionable after the scene at the school where he watches her laments her own struggles with love, angering him deeply), because we both know that he will end up with Aki because she is the designated heroine.\\n\\n\r\nIf I did not explain Neko\u2019s reasoning good enough, she wanted to fall in love before her surgery, and thus seeked a relationship with Masamune, and ends up falling for him, having picked him as a potential suitor based on a photograph Masamune\u2019s Loli Mother sent.  Again, sometimes you fall in love with someone you know or just seem, but at other times, it arises out of a mutual physical attraction cemented by personalities that get along, not \u201clove at first sight\u201d, but a slow process of fondness growing out of being familiar and enjoying each others\u2019 company. This is not bad, and Neko has no reason to \u201chide\u201d it with a fake story. She should have just transferred, and expressed romantic interest in Masamune, however uninteresting that is.\\n\\n\r\nPoint being, the plot investigation of the mysterious Neko, who appeared her entirety in episode 5 and being promptly declared a liar without her motives being known, did not get any headway till episode 8, and promptly ended with a life or death situation in episode 9, without any real reason than teenagers gonna teenage, with the episodes in between being filler. Fuck, you do not state a plot point that the protagonists needs to address, fuck around for 3 episodes, then have it turned into a dramatic show of events, especially after episode 7 was a fucking beach episode. This is plot induced stupidity at its finest, and hamming it up with an inconsistent tone is nonsensical.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Gasou, oh poor Gasuo, pretending to be Masamune. Apparently, he is a rival for Aki\u2019s affection, despite the truth later being found out. The difference being, that his intentions were expected to have actually good consequences for people besides himself, even if the deception requires taking advantage of a girl, who hates men, because she thought the very same Masamune had left her\u2026.causing her to hate men? Does not compute, not at all. Not to mention Aki wants to marry this imposter off the bat, despite supposedly never seeing each other for years? No offense anime, but the childhood tag kind of feels ridiculous when things ended the way that they did, with reverberations to the modern days, and for love to blossom right where it picked off\u2026.because? I mean, Gasou might not have try to seduce Aki out of love for her, but Masamune is exceptionally more self interested and obsessed for his own self satisfaction, which makes him seem more villainous if anything else. I think Aki is a bitch, but she is not one worth obsessing over, even if she does deserve a comeuppance. She is worth less than spending most of your high school life breaking, which is not easy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for why I REALLY despise this series. You might have heard of the source material\u2019s imminent ending, I myself was able to figure it out quickly enough, due to inconsistent freudian excuses and hints that the characters know different stories, but\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAki isn't responsible for what happened 8 years ago it seems, and that is fucking perfect. What is the point of revenge in the title then? This isn't so much forgiveness because she is the wrong target of his ire in the first place, and this subverts the premise to allow a romantic situation to happen without the debate of revenge versus forgiveness and love, with all those feelings included being irrelevant too, because it is entirely cast aside to another person who may or may not be forgiven. This still doesn't absolve Aki of her bitchiness. Everyone has a sob story in anime, but it does not matter, especially when you are a sexist brat in High School acting out childhood trauma that is not even so bad, if not a little enforced.\\n\\n\r\nIt subverts its \u201cRevenge\u201d  tag entirely, something that the anime made obvious in the last 4-5 episodes, leaving only the question \"Who caused it\". This is a major plot point over the course of several years for the protagonist that doesn't get resolved in any way except that \"She did not do it\", thus leaving forgiveness out of Masamune sorting his feelings for Aki.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the equivalent of the murderer being a supernatural entity, or that the family has had a long lost secret twin, without the essential backdrop needed for the viewers believe it. It entirely uproots the story narrative, and for Masamune Kun, it is the plot point. It is a plot convenient twist that aims to settle for a romantic pairing without all those complicated working out of feelings, and honestly? That is crap. Complete crap. What a fucking plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike the ending, but it is understandable why, and I personally prefer no ending than badly done anime ending or sequel hook. In any case, the fact that nothing comes from it within 12 episodes is why the ending is so jarring. If there is any change that would happen, it would be here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Fine.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune: I never found him to be that narcissistic, just overconfident, especially in seduction where he relies on shoujo manga. (Unless it was a realistic one, they're not step by step panecea to seducing girls like flies to honey, especially with Aki, which is a nice touch to the shallow world we we introduced in the first 5 minutes). In essence, his  cynicism about appearance is wrong the first time he meets Aki, because looks do not \"matter\" to her (In more than one way). His talk with Neko in episode 9 was somewhat reasonable, if not brought on by unreasonable circumstances before, and that is really all I have to say that is decent about his characters.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, for someone portrayed as a searing knife of directness in a relationship, he never confronts Neko about her lies, despite being a detriment to his plan. Why? He also blushes and forgets to say stuff in the most important moments, specifically \"Who the hell are you\" to Neko, thus making his relation with Aki on the rocks. He also comes off as a hypocrite for his reasoning for breaking up with Neko (An \"I do not know you enough for sexual intercourse\" would have been enough), but is wise and kind when he carries the secretary, saying typical heartwarming lines, from the haunted house one episode before, something that is completely out of character. This is the same dude who relies on shoujo manga all the time, steals romantic quotes, and we expect to take him seriously when he says this line of maturity right here, a teenager trying to get revenge for what has happened as children? This is terribly done, and terrible consistency in his personality, often happening when the plot demands it, or merely hacked on to make him a protagonist we would be able to like. This is not a coincidence, but his personality is dictated by what needs to happen, rather than what happens as a result of his choices. This is common enough in dramas, where it demands dramatic inter-character conflict to happen, even if said characters were establish as being reasonable enough to work it out.\\n\\n\r\nNow to take a break, you may wonder that \"teenagers do act this way\", and they do, but realism is hardly an excuse to create an entertaining story, with the author dictating everything as a God. For a romcom, that is the saving grace if the dramas comes off as overly hormonal, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nAki: She is a bitch. For most of first episodes, that is what she is, complete with \"cute\" segments, such as her eating 3 meals a per lunch to compensate for her metabolism or something, moe face and all. She is also terribly in love with Masamune at some point, asking for a kiss and then freaking out and uppercutting him.\\n\\n\r\nShe does shine for me in some instances, but a lot of these character moments are also her weakness. She is self aware of her personality, and acknowledges at times that she does not know why anyone would want her, demanding Masamune's reasons for choosing to date her, then reasonably being hurt when Masamune comes up with crap reasons. Then, there are similar moments, when she try to justify her current personality for what has happened to her in the past. Except this past hurt manifests as literal misandry, and it comes off as a \"woe is me\" type of deal, and it makes her far more annoying if not slightly more understandable. Everyone has a sob story, huh? This would have been great if she changed, but for the most part of the anime, it isn't earnest improvement, but brought on by the plot, with her reminiscing over young, fat Masamune before Gasuo shows up, seducing her, despite previous hints and flashbacks that explained her misandry arised out of the incident with Masamune supposedly leaving her. Yeah. I am not a psychologist or anything, but this is just inconsistency on her part. The change is so sudden that I wonder if Aki is the same person, which then boomerangs back when Masamune and Aki get back together after Gasou was defeated, and literally nothing has changed at this point. You had 12 episodes, what is with this lack of development?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, hardly any of the other characters can justify watching this anime. They were cutouts that I found entertaining only as background characters, and based on what has transpired, I hope they stay that way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is terrible at worst, run of the mill at its better parts. The comedy is okay, but drama is a difficult beast that is not done well. You cannot just pile on more drama like you can do jokes on top of ones that fell flat. A bad dramatic event will usually stay with the viewers as does a good one. Unfortunately, there is a lot of mediocre drama facilitated by poor characters choices and personalities you cannot sympathize with for long.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short, I rated this a 3/10.",

            "content": "S.P.O.I.L.E.R.S. - Stupid Pissed Off Idiot Likes Emphatically Raging at Shit\r\nThis review is honest, but purposefully exaggerated so that it may be entertaining to some people, much like the anime itself except I believe myself to be halfway amusing.  It also contains bad words like \u201cfuck\u201d and \u201cdick\u201d and \u201ckittens\u201d, so to all children who can\u2019t handle a few motherfucking swears, avert your goddamn eyes!!\r\nLet\u2019s talk about the concept of Masamune-kun for a moment, and why I was immediately nervous about where the anime would go.\r\nThe plot has a clear ending that it is working toward:  Makabe Masamune will get revenge on AdagakiAki in a most grandiose and satisfying way.  But you can\u2019t just have a good ending; otherwise the audience would just skip to the last episode to see how it plays out.  You need to somehow make the ending satisfying, but also balance the rest of the story so that the build-up is worth it as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s where those spoilers really kick in.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun has neither a good build-up, nor the ending it promises.  In fact, it has no ending at all.  The final episode is a fucking karaoke party.  Why the fuck did they even make this?  I feel like a complete idiot for subjugating myself to watching every minute of this mumbo jumbo, which was admittedly okay and non-offensive for several episodes, but after a while it feels like even the writer didn\u2019t know how the revenge was gonna work, so they started making excuses for some weeks or years or however long you\u2019ve been experiencing this series.  Oh god, could you imagine a second season of this?  This is not any sort of narrative that requires more than twelve episodes to develop.  It initially appears as a typical romcom, but with a twist ending and nothing more.  The presence of a sequel would immediately imply that the ending is prolonged longer than necessary, like a really awkward handshake.  Not like Hand Shakers tho.  That anime was flawless in every aspect.\\n\\n\r\nYes, yes \u201cit\u2019s about the journey\u201d whatever, except the actual journey towards the non-existent climax is about as fruitful as an average expedition in The Oregon Trail.  Masamune, being a charming young lad, simply oozes with swagger and sex appeal.  Yes, this little piggy got /fit/, and now every teenage girl within a five-mile radius wants to bang him.  But instead, Masamune would rather reject these fine 2D women and chase after the dumb ugly bitch so he can end up rejecting her too.  You know, even though chasing after one girl for your entire high school life is probably the worst thing you can do as a high schooler, I can respect Masamune for being so determined to work towards his goal.  You know, IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while you sit back and watch Masamune make irritating decisions, Masamune-kun will do its damndest to make you laugh.  If you love WITTY ANIME HUMOR then this is about as much WITTY ANIME HUMOR as you could possibly need.  Characters overreact because their actual personalities can\u2019t carry the scene, people often compare scenarios to those seen in anime and manga, and the main character comments on so many things in his head that the Fine Bros would\u2019ve sued Silver Link a year ago.  No, I\u2019m not saying you should feel bad for finding these things funny.  I\u2019m just saying that I didn\u2019t.  Masamune-kun doesn\u2019t have any strong nor original jokes, and the only thing I can say about its general style of comedy is that it\u2019s \u201cvery anime\u201d.  The ONE joke I actually laughed at is Masamune\u2019s mom looking like a five-year-old girl, because it's so weird and illogical and out there that I just kinda like it.  Doctors HATE her!\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s really what I could say about Masamune-kun in general, it\u2019s \u201cvery anime\u201d:  A decent but not particularly unhealthy dose of \u201cunderage\u201d partial nudity, the leading female as a high-and-mighty bitch quee--I mean tsundere, an oblivious main character, and a high school containing all the silliness.  Masamune-kun never sets out to break the mold or add anything new, although a twist ending would\u2019ve been nice.  Maybe at the end of the series, Masamune could\u2019ve said \u201cha, PRANK\u2019D\u201d and dunked Adagaki Aki into a shark tank as his way of getting revenge.  You know.  Just a suggestion.  Any sort of revenge plot would\u2019ve been nice to see.  But anyway, Masamune-kun just wants to be a plain high school rom-com.  And you know what?  I\u2019m okay with that.  For most of the season, Masamune-kun failed to evoke a single reaction from me.  Nope, not one.  I watched episode after episode week after week and didn\u2019t crack a smile, didn\u2019t have any particular thoughts, didn\u2019t twitch an eyebrow, didn\u2019t slit my wrists, nothing.  It was a perfectly acceptable five out of ten, and if it sounds negative, it's actually something that I am 100% okay with.\\n\\n\r\nBut then something happened later.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the lack of delivery on Masamune-kun\u2019s part is bad enough.  Since I keep mentioning it, I really don\u2019t like the fact that it doesn\u2019t bring about the ending it promises.  But before that cuckening even ignites, we get this abysmal \u201cfinal\u201d arc where an actual antagonist is brought in.  No, the antagonist is not Adagaki Aki, it\u2019s just a random kid who looks like Masamune when he was fat, and he\u2019s to take Adagaki Aki\u2019s hand in marriage as some sort of business arrangement or something.  So, this kid is an obstacle for Masamune to tackle so he can not get his revenge.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that I\u2019m expected to believe this is a bad thing.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t care about Masamune.  He\u2019s not an interesting character.  I like the fact that he was a fat kid who ended up getting buff, and uhhhhhhhhhh, yep that\u2019s pretty much it.  Beyond this, he\u2019s just a high school protagonist who gets a small harem that\u2019s still big enough to include a trap, because that\u2019s WITTY ANIME HUMOR.  I don\u2019t care about his revenge plot either.  Yeah, I would kinda like to see it, but I also see it as something worth giving up.  Masamune has almost nothing to lose by not getting his revenge; all that happens as a result is that he\u2019ll feel a little bested by that one prick from his childhood--who the hell cares, anyway?  Just leave that shit in the past--if you want, you can aggressively bang one of the eighteen billion other girls in school and think of Badagaki the whole time.  I\u2019d watch that hentai. Or anime. Or cartoon. Or attack helicopter. Whatever the community is arguing about.  Hey, isn\u2019t that what that shitstorm Scum\u2019s Wish is doing, anyway?\\n\\n\r\nYet, despite these things, Masamune-kun thinks I do actually care about Masamune\u2019s endgame, \u2018cuz he\u2019s the main character and all.  So this lookalike dude is apparently a bad thing. And to that, I say\u2026\\n\\n\r\nFuck you.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun actually made me angry at this point of the story, because this abominable terrorist is a nice kid who just wants to do the right thing.  He\u2019s sucked into the marriage just like Whaki is, but his intentions are angelically good.  He even approaches Adagaki\u2019s friends in private to clear up any misconceptions they have, because he truly respects his to-be bride.  What\u2019s the problem? Yeah, Adagaki Aki is an obnoxious bitch who deserves to trip and fall into a vat of rotten donkey milk.  But you know what they say:  bitches ain\u2019t shit.  Why do we gotta worry about them so much?  Just let them go.  She might\u2019ve embarrassed a few people in brutal ways (even though they were all basically fedora tippers so they got what they deserved), but it\u2019s not like she throws rocks at kittens and steps on fennec foxes in her free time.  She\u2019s not so horrible that she NEEDS a taste of her own shit.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m just baffled at how completely pointless Masamune-kun\u2019s Revenge is.  Really, all it needed to do was set up this grand revenge, but instead it insisted on taking this weird detour so that it could evolve the romance.  Give me a break.  I didn\u2019t want to see that in the first place.  Not just because I\u2019m expecting a revenge plot, but also because I don\u2019t like these two characters, and seeing them form a relationship isn\u2019t satisfying.  In fact, Adagaki Aki is meant to be unlikable, so why would I want the main character to date her?  She\u2019s supposed to be the villain, but then at the last minute they throw in this secret side of her that actually found fat Masamune to be attractive??  What????  All of the sudden the revenge plot is gone, so now she needs to be presented as likable.  Ten episodes is a bit too late to change my mind on someone\u2019s personality.  It\u2019s also too late to rewrite the entire show. Man, I thought I avoided the new Rewrite this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe other thing about Adagaki Aki that strikes me as odd is how she\u2019s supposed to be the most beautiful and magnificent creature in the entire world; that world being the high school.  They demonstrate this by showing people I don\u2019t care about saying that she\u2019s beautiful. Adagaki Aki in the flesh has a fairly tall and slender figure with a sharp face and uh\u2026 oh yeah, NOTHING.  Remember, this is the most beautiful girl in the entire school, according to literally everybody in the school.  So the anime then dumps all of the jiggle physics and panty shots onto Aki\u2019s sidekick, a maid girl with short hair and big tits voiced by Inori Minase.  Now that's some good casting.   Good job, Silver Link. \\n\\n\r\nIf this were a live-action series with actual human beings and all of their many physical flaws, these comments wouldn\u2019t exist as Adagaki Aki could look like an actually attractive person with as few flaws as possible.  But when you have an anime (or manga) where every character is painstakingly drawn to be beautiful and perfect and eye-catching to the audience, I have no idea how I\u2019m supposed to believe that any single one of them are considered attractive in comparison to the others.  I guess if you have a domination fetish, yeah, Aki\u2019s your girl, but if you\u2019re one of\u2026  *ahem*  THOSE people\u2026  then you might prefer Mr. Boipussy~ over there with the weird yellow pluses in his or her eyes.  Why is that a thing. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, my point is the character designs all suck and that NotRem is the better girl because her tits are bigger. Masamune doesn\u2019t even look muscular despite that being his entire character, but whatever.\\n\\n\r\nYou might think that the lack of strong character designs could imply more movement, but if you believe that then you probably thought that Masamune would get his revenge, didn\u2019t you.  No, there\u2019s not any single bit of interesting art direction or animation or anything.  It takes place in a boring school with a decent dress code--the boys\u2019 uniforms look a little unusual with the yellow and dark blue color scheme, but calling them garish would be extreme.  The girls\u2019 uniforms are equally decent at the top, but the yellow skirts are a weird combination.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cshut up lux who cares\u201d\\n\r\nMe.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the soundtrack is an interesting sort of entity.  For the most part, it\u2019s obnoxiously loud and mind-shreddingly irritating, but in a way that could\u2019ve possibly been ideal.  The OST places heavy emphasis on each scene, making simple decisions more dramatic and making characters more imposing than they actually are.  The bigger problem is that the art direction is completely lifeless and boring, making the grandiose soundtrack utterly pointless.  If the show looked as intense and excessive as it sounds, this could've made things funnier in a way that Nichijou has mastered, but of course that wouldn't happen.  I hope Silver Link gave the composer a nice participation ribbon for his effort, he deserves it.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP and ED suck.  I don\u2019t have anything to say about them because I skipped them every episode except the first, because they\u2019re completely boring.  Too bad I couldn\u2019t skip the entire show tho.  Next.\\n\\n\r\nOh wait, that\u2019s all I need to say.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun could\u2019ve been a strong four to a light five, which I\u2019m okay with, and I could\u2019ve let it go about its business without a care in the world\u2026 but the complete lack of delivery alone brings it down to a 2, a number I use to notate something that\u2019s SLIGHTLY watchable, because you could argue that Masamune-kun is a decent and funny rom-com even though it should be a revenge story. \\n\\n\r\nThe non-existent ending and last few episodes just pissed me off so much that I need to let myself go and burn everything in my path.  Damn you, Masamune-kun, let it be known I shall have my own revenge by posting this 2228-word review on a Western database not seen by anyone significant in the industry, for it\u2019s currently the only platform I have to post upon!

            "content": "This is a story about... \u00bfrevenge?\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge is definitely an anime that gives to talk. Just by reading the synopsis you are attracted and curiosity makes you watch it, \u00bfand what do you find? Masamune wants revenge, \u00bfwhy? Because his feelings were rejected as a child. \u00bfHow will he do that? Wasting his life in finding the chick that rejected him to waste even more time in make that she love him and then breaking her heart \u00a1Wow, how mature of his part!\r\nIt is understood that this is a romantic comedy, so as such, the plot should not be taken so seriously, but thatis the main problem. While it has comical moments somewhat agreeable, the serie wants you to take the issue of revenge (which is the main focus it gives) as something totally serious and justified, which collides full with the fact that the serie is EXTREMELY CLICHE. Having cliches is not the problem, as long as they are used in a way that achieves something at least entertaining to see, this is not the case, the theme of \"serious\" revenge is contradicted by cliches, ending in a ridiculous, regrettable and generic development; the revenge is gradually lost to make way for the inevitable: Masamune and Aki end up in love with truth, then resort to plot devices come out of nowhere in order to force revenge and introduce unnecessary drama, (Gasou and the trio of bodyguard morons), because we already know how it will end, which up to the same synopsis tells you: \"However, his friendship with Aki begins to grow, Masamune begins to question the objectives of his devious plans\". \\n\\n\r\nOf the above also carries the fact that with the passage of time, the goal of revenge disappears, leaving the main focus of the serie as a nonsense and emphasizing the fact of the poor development of it, and predictability. \u00bfBut do you know what's the worst part? That in the end nothing happened. \u00bfRevenge? No. \u00bfReal love? No. Nothing, nothing happened. This IS the real nonsense...\\n\\n\r\nMany defend the serie saying that the initial approach to revenge is something original and rarely seen among the animes of this genre... Which is true, but it's no use if the approach is original if the development of it is disastrous and supports in the cliches to end up being more of the same with other condiments. In this sense the serie reminds Oregairu, in which it wants to appear as something different from the usual and ends up falling on more of the same as seen in other animes of the genre.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nBut if there is anything worse than the poor plotting attempt, it's the characters, EVERYBODY AND EACH OF THEM are a stroke. Starting with the central axis: the protagonist. In the case of many romantic comedies (with or without harem), no matter how fun it is or how nice the girls are, if the protagonist is insufferable, the serie becomes insufferable too, although this obviously depends on how much focus give it to him. In this case, the whole serie is seen from the point of view of Masamune, so the least that is expected, is that this character is interesting or at least enjoyable. I will not deny that Masamune stands out for not being a typical loser dense harem protagonist, and that his internal monologues add some interest to the plot and character in general, but many believe that this, and only this, make him a good character, which is false:\\n\\n\r\n-His revenge motive is stupid: as a child he was an easy target of bullying, and when he met someone who accepted him, he was rejected by that person, which motivated him to change. This is really not bad, but this change is driven merely by the fact of wanting revenge and not by personal improvement, not to mention all the time wasted on something so empty. Apart, just by getting fit he already believes he matured, how innocent...\\n\\n\r\n-His narcissistic attitude is both annoying and unnecessary, one can show self-confidence without resorting to narcissism. In addition, the serie focuses TOO MUCH in show you how every girl that appears on the screen drools for him (something VERY ridiculous and insufferable to see), feeding more his ego, as if they wanted to give the reason to the force to his philosophy of \"only handsome boys win in life\", or as if narcissism was necessary and obligatory for his characterization.\\n\\n\r\n-His personality is ambiguous, varies at the convenience of the script. From a moment he changes from being bold and self-assured (supported by the aforementioned narcissism), to an insecure who is afraid even of talking to a girl and is lost in his own plans. Basically he turns to the typical loser dense harem protagonist for moments. \u00bfWhere is the supposed maturity which he spoke? A very bad characterization, and a character badly done in every way.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Aki, \"The Cruel Princess\". The girl who is cruel to everyone but who is really insecure and with a \"cute side\" with chibi faces included to compensate for her bitch side and that half world treat her as waifu... By far the worst character of the whole serie, And one of the worst \"tsunderes\" I've ever seen. A poorly constructed character, with a horrible characterization and a very insufferable attitude that changes to the convenience of the script (yeah, too). Her motives for being cruel are quite questionable and her current way of being doesn't go according to them, her attitude of bitch contrasts with her \"feed me with 20 kg of food while I make moe faces\" and \"I want you to kiss me or tell me you like me... but you're still a piece of crap \u00a1get away, you scum!\". The worst thing is that, I insist, the serie wants you to take this bitch side so badly done seriously to justify Masamune's revenge.\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly, the way her attitude goes from being aggressive to being totally passive according to Masamune's plans is quite fictional (again, as if the plot requires it), and from one moment to another she becomes aggressive again. In her you don't see an evolution of how her hard exterior breaks and little by little she reveals her dere side, you see how she changes from \"tsun\" to \"dere\" in a very fake way when the scene requires it. This is not to be \"hard on the outside, fragile on the inside\" like every normal tsundere, and neither is a gap moe, this is to be hard and fragile at the same time, a mixture of personalities, as if they didn't decide to give her a fixed characterization, And it remains something that changes suitably, something that is demonstrated in Chapters 4 and 5, for example, \u00a1even Masamune himself says it in Chapter 9!\\n\\n\r\nAnd if all that was not enough, she send the demon all her supposed characterization with the appearance of Gasou \u00bfWhere was what she said of \"I always hurt people so they don't hurt me\"? Someone who changed and promised not to fall in love, says to hate men and rejects everyone in a cruel way falls in love instantly, even if it is because she believes that is the Masamune of her childhood is not justified if she says to have changed, all that to force the plot in a terrible last minute plot twist. \u00bfNow do you see what I mean with her personality is something that changes at the convenience of the script? I insist: the worst character in the serie, and one of the worst \"tsunshits\", because she doesn't even count as a \"normal tsundere\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo see interacting with that pair of protagonists is a real headache. Their relationship of \"love-hate\" feels so forced, so poorly executed and without any kind of charisma. However, in most of chapter 6 Aki does not appear, so there was not much of this interaction and the subject of revenge was hardly touched, they also explored better the relations between Masamune and other characters, and it was pleasant to see. Similarly in chapter 9, where a fairly mature discussion took place between Masamune and Neko, and then some sympathetic comedy among the other characters, again, the subject of revenge was mentioned very little. These two chapters were the most passable of the entire serie \u00bfCoincidence? I don't think so\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nYoshino is the typical kuudere awkward and moe who has a \"dark side\". That stereotype has always made me illogical and meaningless, since you can not take seriously the dark side (again, what the serie tries to do) with a poker-faced babe who barely whispers and falls down and showing the pantsu. However, and despite everything, she is perhaps the most decent character in the serie, her role in the same is really interesting and contributes to the plot, even her actions can be unpredictable and leave the expectation, but her characterization is not, and makes you lose a little interest in her. I also dare to say that she is perhaps one of the most decent characters of Inori Minase, something that is not very difficult to actually achieve...\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nNeko is the top of the cliche between the characters, a generic rich girl who falls from the sky and immediately falls in love with the protag \"because yes\", and in the end, she will be the first friendzoned girl from the harem (well, that was the class rep). So many cliches together and so little creativity in a single character, literally she is a Tachibana 2.0 \u00a1even is just as sickly! She seems to have no personality beyond Masamune \u00bfWhat is the real reason why she loves him so desperately? \u00bf\"Because he is kind\"? Although she said her motives, are not sufficient justification of why she loves him with such determination. The only answer I find is: because the plot says, and they need another waifu bait that shows love interest in him so that the story does not feel so linear, although her intervention didn't contribute significantly anything more than the classic Team War. That is worth clarifying, is that I think her rejection was right (although Masamune's motives remain stupid), after all, we talk about a liar who is in love with him for questionable reasons, the logical thing to do is refuse. After that we saw a discussion between the two where they clarified their motivations in a more or less clear way, demonstrating maturity on the part of both characters and a good management of the subject of a love rejection. Point for Masamune and the serie in general, because everything doesn't have to be \"That stupid Masamune should accept her \u00bfwhy? \u00a1Because she's my waifu!... and she's the best girl... and... \u00a1and she kissed him!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThen there are other characters, like the typical genki girl (although this is nice, it's a shame that she has fallen in love with an idiot like Masamune that aside from rejecting her, he didn't care and only increased his ego, more negative points for this character), the trap, the loli or the sister troll and bitter, we also have Gasou... Who should not even count as a character, since he has no characterization, he's literally a plot device with legs (and a very sassy one), someone who only entered the history to put unnecessary drama and to force even more the disastrous development of the plot, like the trio of lesbianas \"bodyguard\" of Aki, stereotyped girls that only appeared in the end to serve of barrier between the inevitable. A whole cast of characters with almost no brilliance or charisma. Do not ask for complex characters or a deep development, only pleasant characters and justified to what the serie tries, which does not. Neither they have to be 100% original, but that does not imply that all have to be archetypes seen a thousand times in other serie and without basically any change.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThere is no need to talk much about the audiovisual aspects: nice but generic designs, decent quality, an acceptable but very forgettable soundtrack. In general the important aspects of the serie are regrettable, the comedy becomes fun, because I will not lie: it made me laugh on several occasions (after all I enjoy this genre), and I don't dislike all the characters, but that is not enough to forget all the bad. The plot from the beginning is ridiculous and stupid despite not being so common and look attractive in lyrics, and focusing on it in a serious way (because I insist that this is what the series claims, even with all comedy in the middle), the minimum expected is an acceptable development, but this is lousy, and the characters are far from even acceptable. It is worth mentioning that I like harems no matter how generic they are, as long as the girls and the MC are charismatic and interesting. This is not the case. This will undoubtedly endure as one of the worst romantic comedies I've ever seen, only surpassed by Nisekoi.",

            "content": "There are a lot of things that factor into creating a well-rounded enjoyable anime title. It\u2019s a combination of the story writing, uniqueness, sounds and animation poured into the creation of the work that produces that golden quality to it. But there\u2019s another category that needs to be touched upon to create a good anime and that is characters. Smart intellectual characters and ones that strive from the common cheap use of stereotypes make a title memorable due to the unique ways these characters are presented through dialogue and interaction. Your characters are the fore-front in the anime, they are the lens the viewer experiencesthe story through, and so having them well fleshed out and smartly written enhances the experience for the viewer.\\n\\n\r\nBut contrary to my statement listed above, \u201cMasamune-kun\u2019s Revenge\u201d brings nothing smart to the table. In concept the show is about some revenge plan thought out by a prepubescent child after getting rejected when he was about 6 years old, a \u201clovers\u201d squabble that has lasted around a decade, why is he so angered that he can\u2019t move on in life and accept fate? I doubt we will ever know.  Our main character Makabe; is optimistic in his revenge plans. Accompanied with tedious actions and that cocky and cool attitude that make me want to fist the table in rage whenever he\u2019s on screen, he makes Subaru look like the second-coming of Christ in comparison. Having a likeable main character should be what many anime strive to portray, this is the character we are supposed to be rooting for and hoping his plans go to success. (if we can scuttle through the ridiculous idea of the plan in the first place that is) stereotypes may piss you off after seeing that same trope rehashed over and over again over many titles of anime, but having a character who is un-bearable to watch due to his unintentional cringe aspects really burdens the show down a lot. His whole \u201crevenge plan\u201d is some of the stupidest shit I have seen in my life, who honestly gives a fuck if he was rejected years prior, his character just comes off as immature but not in the good sense.\\n\\n\r\nHey I\u2019m sure immature characters can be enjoyable to watch at times but Makabe emits the entire opposite enjoyment of that, he\u2019s unlikeable, unfunny and one dimensional all around, I really don\u2019t see the appeal of having this guy being the perspective we enjoy the show through.  Next we have the evil, misandristic; Adagaki Aki or better known as \u201ctext-book tsundere.\u201d She\u2019s the main target and antagonist of Masamune-kun\u2019s Revenge. Though has more characterisation to her compared to our main character, and is overall a better more tolerable character to watch; even if she may just be pretty stereotypical. She is the stated \u201cantagonist\u201d of the show, but due to her past and better development in helping us understand her she becomes greater than Makabe. Overall the cast is a bunch of dumb, unlikeable assholes which are painful to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThough I\u2019ve only touched upon the surface of characters, alongside the two main characters we have some more terribly written side characters. Firstly; Yoshino Koiwai who is the most enjoyable out of the bunch; and no that\u2019s not just because she is voiced by Inori Minase, she serves as the \u201cmaster\u201d role for Makabe and plans to assist him in his execution of his dumbfounded revenge plan. She\u2019s cute, and funny at times that\u2019s about it. Then we have Neko Fujinomiya who is another rich girl, but she\u2019s mysterious, she knows Makabe prior, but Makabe does not recall ever meeting her. But to be honest I bet if you had an encounter with Makabe he would forget you within the next ten minutes of your conversation (evident in how he forgot of Yoshino\u2019s existence entirely.) Then to top that off we have weird Lolita mom who tries serving Makabe food but whenever there is over a certain amount of calories he becomes extremely triggered by the situation due to him trying to keep up his muscular fit body to impress the ladies. Oh and introduced near the end we have this painfully un-needed and unlikeable fat kid and the SJW brigade who turn to illegal acts to stop the straights and turn Aki into a lesbian man-hater.\\n\\n\r\nThe weaknesses of these said characters is most evident in their interaction; there\u2019s always an awkward pause mid-conversation. With Makabe\u2019s one track mind on the path to revenge nothing said to him ever enters his mind and flies past him; he may have recollection of those words but prefers to ignore those after a while and snap back into his revenge mind-set. The drama in this anime is god damn awful as well; it is impossible to take seriously with the nature of the show and is just as awkward as every other character interaction; bland, stupid and un-meaningful. Most of it is started by Makabe\u2019s dumb irrational attitude constantly messing things up; he can\u2019t fix the problems because he is so mindless on top of that and the quite common \u201ccomedic\u201d part where he falls over constantly.\\n\\n\\n\r\nAside from this the show does have some redeemable capabilities that don\u2019t drag the show down into devastation. For the most part the animation is pretty decent; it\u2019s of course nothing special but the bright colours help with the lively atmosphere of some dumb-founded romance revenge plan, so it\u2019s a pleasant sight to the eye for this factor. Its atmospheric shots are pleasant of course bringing light to sights that look pretty generic in terms of animation as a whole but work well.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound department we are met with an \u201codd\u201d soundtrack to say the least; nothing really stands out and sticks in your head; but overall it weirdly goes along with the shows sense of direction; the opening theme: \u201cWagamama MIRROR HEART\u201d hypes up the show and creates brilliant anticipation; which is how I found myself watching this show in the first place, and contrast to the opening \u201cElemental World\u201d provides a calm yet upbeat theme to lead out the show.\\n\\n\r\nI understand that this anime is simply here to provide a romance comedy; but the problem for me is it wasn\u2019t funny, compared to other romance comedies, the effect and experience I gained from this was weak, and of course mainly because of my statement against the characters of the show which drag down the quality. But even if this was intentional and I am just over analysing this; the show really did not work for me. The show is obviously enjoyable, even if I\u2019m hesitant at watching each episode most of the time provides a decent experience with not the best enjoyment the show could have produced but not enough to create a bitter taste of disgust when watching. On top of that the show features an anti-climactic ending which I will not delve into here; but there\u2019s a possibility that the show will receive a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall; Masamune-kun\u2019s short comings lie in trying to create a decent romance/comedy which falls flat due to its unbearable main character and generic side characters. But the side dishes to the show create decent sides to the anime which stop it from plummeting down into the abyss. If you want a bright show with some mutual redeeming factors and decent enjoyment, look no further than this show. There are of course many greater titles out there, but I\u2019m sure if you are the average Joe who doesn\u2019t really care much for the criticisms against this show you will find this for the most part enjoyable. If you do care about the above; I advise you to move on, as this offers nothing new.\\n",

            "content": "Since there are only 4 episodes out, I will be giving my first impressions for this anime.\r\nMasamune-kun's Revenge seems at face value, the virtue of blandness. A plot of blurb that anyone can read so generically and your typical protagonist. However, I don't find that to be the case as I actually find the protagonist quite likable. The revenge theme is also something that rarely happens in the romance genre so the plot isn't exactly linear and boring.\r\nMasamune-kun's Revenge is interesting as it is able to take a rehashed idea and execute it with the sort of panache that leaves you wanting more. By theend of the first episode, I was left speculating about what directions the anime could take. The second, third and fourth episodes are also pretty decent so far.\\n\\n\r\nThe music of the romance genre is notorious for being generic. The OP and ED animation sequences are overdone-to death cuts from your typical romance anime. They are either happy-go-lucky or sad depending on the sub-genre. However, the songs accompanying this anime are actually ringtone-worthy.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and the animation in a simple sentence, I would say it\u2019s not at all masterpiece level, but it is gorgeous. I have no complaints here. The character designs look very appealing which I also have no issue with at all.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Masamune-kun's Revenge is an anime I will definitely be seeing through this to the end, even if it ends up going downhill later on.",

            "content": "Watching Masamune-kun no Revenge (Masamune\u2019s Revenge) feels like listening to a depressing story from a friend that got terminated from their dream job. I can\u2019t exactly say this show is something for everyone. It\u2019s a dramedy teen soap opera that some will find entertaining while others will leave with the thought of never getting their time back. Listen. This show isn\u2019t really hard to understand but to appreciate it? That\u2019s another story.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, the series is pretty straightforward. Well, it is straightforward at first glance considering the premise. You got this hot main male protagonist (Masamune Makabe) who ispopular, handsome, athletic, and pretty much the IT guy that every woman wants to get their hands on. Except of course, he was totally the opposite before. When he was a kid, Masamune used to be fat, unpopular, and subject to being bullied. To add to the injury? A girl he used to have a crush on rejected him while giving him the cruel nickname, \u201cPig\u2019s Foot\u201d. You can probably guess Masamune didn\u2019t take that well so he is set out to commit the ultimate revenge against Aki Adagaki, the girl who wronged him. \\n\\n\r\nFirst things first, while the show sounds like it can be a potentially heavy drama show, it\u2019s really more of a lighthearted romantic comedy. Sure, it has the ingredients for cooking up a melancholic heavy story but it\u2019s really not much so throughout the course of the series. Viewers will come to understand that revenge is far more complicated than how Masamune plans out. Every episode serves as a step forward or backward for Masamune in his plans. And while we also find out more about the characters, the series likes to have fun often with what it has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I can\u2019t exactly say fun is a term to describe while watching the characters in their roles. Masamune Makabe is a straightforward guy that shows a bit of narcissism. Don\u2019t believe me? Just watch what he does in the morning before going to school or how he eats his food. In the meantime, there\u2019s Aki Agadaki, a character that many viewers will probably dislike from the start. I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised if Aki is a make or break factor for the fans to drop this series. With a cruel personality (she\u2019s even nicknamed \u201cCruel Princess\u201d at school) and has a hobby of tormenting others, the show seems to intentionally make people hate her. I would also say that she\u2019s a spoiled brat as her reliance on Yoshino (her personal maid) is very evident. So at this point, you\u2019re probably asking yourself \u201cShould I really watch this?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nAt its core, Masamune no Revenge emphasizes on relationship developments and how Masamune\u2019s story develops as context gets more and more complicated. This includes the appearance of other characters. I\u2019ve already mentioned Yoshino but viewers will also discover that she is more than she appears to be. Neko Fujinomiya, a transfer student also enters the story and formulates what viewers may designate as a generic love triangle. On top of that, the show seems to be saturated with generic characters. From best friend trap to fujoshi, this show pulls the oldest gags from the book. Still, Masamune can actually be a decent character once you see through his flaws. Although he is narcissistic, he isn\u2019t necessarily a cruel person. In fact, he is actually an ideal character that anyone would want to be friends with. Hanging out with the most popular guy at school gives social status and Masamune is a symbolic image of that. At times, Masamune also shows genuine concern for his friends and even comes to aid of total strangers. Unlike Aki, Masamune\u2019s relationship with others isn\u2019t always one sided either. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of relationships, what can you really expect from this show? At its core, Aki and Masamune\u2019s relationship is perhaps the most complicated. There\u2019s mind games going on between the two in almost every segment. While Aki often asserts herself to be the superior individual, Masamune\u2019s clever tactics helps him understand her better. The two even goes out on dates and some episode shows that Aki has a vulnerable side to her as well. On the other hand, Masamune\u2019s relationship with others are generally casual, friendly, and straightforward. He gets along well with most people such as his best friend Kojuro Shuri, transfer student Neko, and close friend Tae Futaba. As he is a handsome guy, Masamune is also the ideal image of girls at his school. The only other complicated relationship he has with is with Yoshino. In retrospect, the relationships in this show is nothing impressive and on the surface level, you can probably discover them in any romantic comedy literature or on TV.\\n\\n\r\nAs a manga reader, I confess that the series didn\u2019t do justice in adapting the show. While it starts off in the right direction, certain parts of the story is cut off while other parts are overemphasized. In addition, the opening song is very spoilerish and a degeneration of crafty storytelling. As such, I express not only disappointment at the length of the series but also at what they really adapted. On the other hand, the comedy of the series can be entertaining at times. Popcorn entertainment might be a better way to put it as we see how the characters interact under certain circumstances. Remember, this series is lighthearted and not something for mature audiences. \\n\\n\r\nIf there\u2019s one major thing they handled right, it would be the art direction. I have to admit, Tiv (the author of the series) has a talent at creating attractive characters. Silver Link brings that attractiveness in full color and animation. In general, the show has a decent production and every main character has their physical appeal. Fan service appears from time to time ranging from full commando scenes or the infamous beach episode. Putting that aside, Masamune no Revenge is a pretty show.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not much impression I can say about the overall soundtrack or the music. It just seems to be there and does its job although easily forgettable. The OP and ED theme songs reflects the show\u2019s theme and agendas while dropping many hints at the storytelling. Finally, there\u2019s the voice acting, something that I found to be slightly above average yet nothing too impressive overall. Ironically, I find Aki\u2019s voice to be the best performed as the character really does sound like a cruel princess. The way she speaks to others with her sarcastic tone while mocking others fits her personality just right.\\n\\n\r\nSo by the time you\u2019re reading this part, you\u2019re probably thinking a lot of things on your mind. Just know this though, Masamune no Revenge is still a romantic comedy regardless how the premise appears to be. Revenge is a controversial word and for some of us, it\u2019s something we may even have experienced or want to inflict upon someone we have intense feelings towards. For Masamune, it\u2019s his story and one that begins with his revenge.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "You might be thinking, \u201cUgh, is this just another typical harem anime?!\u201d Well, to that I say, \u201cYeah. It is\u2026\" But, at the same time, \"No. It isn\u2019t.\u201d Let me explain why without spoilers:\r\nThe reason why I say \u201cyes\u201d is because if you\u2019ve seen a few harem anime before, you will most likely be able to predict how the story will end from the first episode. There's no concluding ending (probably because it's setting the stage for a second season). This series reminds me a lot of Nisekoi: the story isn't too amazing and doesn't stand out too much, so you most likely won't likethem if it you don't like harem anime in general. The reason why I say \u201cno\u201d is because this isn\u2019t actually a typical harem anime because Masamune-kun (main guy) does actually turn down potential love interests in this season. Also, the route that masamune-kun takes to get to the ending is a new one that I haven\u2019t seen in any other other harem-like anime, but the characters are all pretty much dumbasses in romance. The story's not bad unless you really just don't like harem anime. \\n\\n\r\nTL;DR at the end\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7/10 \\n\r\nThe story is actually pretty good and relatively unique among harem anime, but it's not anything spectacularly different at all. For example, this anime\u2019s plot is a bit special because rather than trying to find his old love interest and win her over to live happily ever after, Masamune-kun actually trains to become a very \u201chot\u201d and \u201cmuscular\u201d guy that seeks to win her love... and then he wants wreck her (Adagaki Aki\u2019s) feelings as revenge for rejecting him as a kid while giving him the nickname \u201cpiggy\u201d. Luckily, she doesn\u2019t recognize him, but she is extremely difficult to win over since she is well-known for turning down everybody that asks her out and giving them terrible nicknames. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts out with a series of convenient coincidences and some random one-time only pantyshots occur (did somebody say plot convenience panty shots?! mmm... my favorite\u2026), he then discovers an embarrassing secret about Adagaki Aki that actually makes it too risky for her to just give him a bad nickname, which sets the groundwork for this series\u2019 progression. There are a good amount of plot twists, which allows the anime to put you through the wringer with suspense occasionally. The pacing was great, the comedy was entertaining, so I really believe that the story deserves an 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art\u2019s not particularly impressive. The background art\u2019s pretty good and relatively detailed, but I don\u2019t think the characters were detailed and/or expressionate enough for me to give this category a higher score. The visual effects, angles, and lighting were all pretty good. The animation\u2019s frame rate is low enough that you can see some lack of fluidity, but it\u2019s fluid enough that you probably won\u2019t be able to notice it unless you really look for it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10 \\n\r\nThe characters are all voiced well and their actors/actresses fill the roles very well. The music in this series is great! This is another factor that I think sets this anime apart from other harem anime. The background music style ranges from this one dramatic flamboyant orchestral piece that sounds like music played when a really fat noble is walking, to other orchestral and harpsichord pieces that are all just generally pretty great background music overall. The opening fits the anime and sounds pretty good. The ending sounds pretty generic, but also fits. Sound effects are good enough. Overall, I think the sound deserves a 9/10 overall. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the characters in this series. Masamune\u2019s character actually sucks pretty badly (because he turned down best girl), but all jokes aside he\u2019s a pretty solid character and is actually pretty funny. Adagaki Aki is pretty much just a generic small breasted tsundere, but she\u2019s not voiced by Rie Kugimiya, so that\u2019s always a plus. Koiwai Yoshino\u2026 she\u2019s essential to the plot and has lots of PLOT material herself (if you know what I mean). The characters get pretty well-developed by the end, but they are still pretty generic. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the characters in this series.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall, I think the series was pretty entertaining. The story kept me in suspense as we watched Masamune kun teeter on the edges of getting caught during his revenge and all of the various plot twists that came up. It was actually a pretty enjoyable series to watch!\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nAt first glance, Masamune-Kun seems like a generic harem anime but it has elements that sets it apart from other harem anime: while the characters are indeed generic, the story line has a major difference from other common generic harem anime (it reminded me of Nisekoi, but without Shaft\u2019s studio skills). This is definitely one of the better harem anime out there, so I feel that it does deserve a 7/10. The art\u2019s good, the characters are good, the music\u2019s great, and the concept of revenge sets this anime apart from other harem anime.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: Should you watch this?\\n\r\nIf you like harem anime, then of course. \\n\r\nIf you want to see an unusual harem anime, then yeah. \\n\r\nIf you like dramatic romance anime, then ehh you can give it a shot... but both the drama and the romance weren\u2019t really central elements of this anime. \\n\r\nIf you like tsundere small breasted characters, well\u2026 this series has you covered. \\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for some mesmerizing inspirational story or serious anime romance, drama, or anything other than a romantic-harem-comedy, you\u2019re definitely in the wrong place. \\n\\n\r\nHope this helps you decide! If it didn\u2019t help, or you disagree, feel free to let me know by sending me a message so I can be better next time!",

            "content": "Yeaaah ... It's not that good... but it's not completely bad. Just really average.\r\nThe story of Masamune-kun is pretty much your generic RomCom harem anime but a little twist in it. Masamune is trying to hook up with the ''Cruel Princess'' to dump her later and getting his revenge on her. Why ? Just read the synopsis, it's not really worth to write about it again here. Fair enough, this could be potentially good but you can pretty much see miles away what's going to happen next and its filled with clich\u00e9. Also the comedy in it is really hit or miss.\r\nHowever, episode 4 gaveme good hopes that maybe it's going the right way with the story ... but something at the end of the episode pretty much ruined the development between Masamune and Aki and at this point, looks like its going to be a good old love triangle/harem thing with some drama in it. Definitly was not a good time to introduce it and its more annoying than anything else.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, Yoshino, Aki's maid, is pretty interesting. Can't really say too much though because.. spoilers. But she's definitly one of the 2 reason that i keep watching it.\\n\r\nOh yeah, we have a trap and Masamune's mom is a loli. Of course.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation are pretty decent, nothing to write home about but Silver Link. does a good enough job. They definitly has done better though. Most of the girls designs are nice, specially Yoshino. Masamune's design is pretty disappointing since he looks like a protagonist from a generic light novel.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in the anime is pretty average. The OST does it's job but nothing really standout so far. The Opening is your usual RomCom opening. The ending song by Choucho is pretty nice thought.\\n\\n\r\nSooo, is it enjoyable ? For me not really. But i'm still going to watch it since i'm still interested enough to see where this goes right now. Wouldn't be surprised if they do the predictable route of Masamune not getting his revenge and actually end up with Aki though. I also want to know more about Yoshino and see what's going to happen with her since its pretty much the only character that i still enjoy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, right now i'm at episode 4 and it's pretty much average.\\n\\n\r\n5/10.",

            "content": "Watching this anime is somewhat similar to drinking cheap supermarket cola. It's not outright disgusting, but it leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste. In effect, Masamune-kun no Revenge is certainly not a terrible anime, but it's not really worth investing time on either.\r\nStory (5/10):\r\nCreating a mediocre anime by throwing in a bunch of tried and tested cliches is a sure fire way to earn some cash (by appealing to the otaku audience), and that's exactly what Silver Link has done here. \r\nThe story is absolutely nothing new - a fat kid works out and diets, becomes a pretty-boy and tries to publicly humiliate the girl whorejected him... only to find that he's falling for her. Of course, when he starts getting somewhere, a couple of other girls appear and voila!- a harem is made. \\n\r\nThe developments are all rather abrupt and tasteless. It lacks any semblance of flow and the pacing is quite erratic. All put together, the story aspect is average, if not slightly below average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10):\\n\r\nI'm usually not one to criticize an anime for its artwork, but this one has some major issues. The main thing I found is that the character designs were rather weird - the faces and limbs were all elongated beyond an level that could be ignored, so much so that it almost felt like Code Geass. Other than that, the animation was alright and the color palette used was quite bright. Yet again, average.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound (6/10):\\n\r\nThe sound in Masamune-kun no Revenge was alright. The opening and ending songs were decent, but the voice actors sometimes felt a little emotionless and flat. The soundtrack was rather bland.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (2/10):\\n\r\nI'm actually rather impressed with the creators of this series for being able to make characters this weak, while using only the common cliches as raw material. It's not that the characters are terrible or anything - they're just so shallow and two-dimensional that they can't even be taken seriously. I'll give a short description of two of the characters, just to give you an idea of what I mean -\\n\\n\r\n-Makabe Masamune: The 'hero' of the series. Previously a fat kid who was constantly humiliated, he worked extremely hard to improve his appearance. Now that he's hot stuff, he wants to take revenge on the girl who humiliated him in the past... Sounds all well and good, until you find that he starts falling for her within 3-4 episodes. And that's it - That's the entirety of his character, nothing more.\\n\\n\r\n-Adagaki Aki: The one-word description of her is (forgive my language) bitch. She has no positive points other than being rich - as for what draws all those men (including our protagonist) to her, I have absolutely no clue.\\n\\n\r\nOther than those two, there are no characters of any real importance. Then again, having those two as the main characters already makes Masamune-kun no Revenge a failure.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10):\\n\r\nIt's extremely difficult to enjoy something you've seen hundreds of times before, but executed far worse than most. I, for one, couldn't go any further than 7 episodes before dropping it (although I would've dropped it long back had I not wanted to review it)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall (4.2/10 ~ 4/10):\\n\r\nThe end result is that Masamune-kun no Revenge is a mediocre anime which doesn't bring anything new to the table. I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone, but if cardboard characters, boring story and somewhat weird artwork is what you're looking for, then by all means, give it a go.",

            "content": "I\u2019ve known right from the beginning that it\u2019s just going to be another generic school rom-com as I browsed among the entries for Winter 2017, but something within me wanted to watch this show. The premise made me hope that it\u2019s going to be what I wanted it to be, an actual fulfilling story about revenge through love. As an overweight loser who daydreams about obtaining the perfect body and being popular with girls, I quite find Makabe relatable in his endeavor. I was interested how he is going to carry out his plan on Adagaki, but I guess I was asking too much. Iknow I shouldn\u2019t be this disappointed, but damn this show went nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, the story makes it too convenient for Makabe to get closer with Adagaki. For a cruel princess, she acts very inconsistent. You could say \u201cOh you know, women are really confusing\u201d but I digress. What makes Makabe different from any other dude she has declined? I\u2019m sure they also used the same tactics Makabe is using. To further add into the convenience, Adagaki\u2019s maid Yoshino agrees to help Makabe in his plan for no really good reason. I mean wow, there are so many things in favor of Makabe but ultimately the greatest hindrance to his plan is really himself.\\n\\n\r\nSecond, the show has unwanted love interests. Sure, it attempts to create a conflict in which it prevents Makabe\u2019s plan progress but all it does really is derail the main story and put unnecessary complications. \\n\\n\r\nThird, why is Makabe\u2019s mom a loli? \\n\\n\r\nFourth, Makabe is too na\u00efve. While this is not necessarily a bad thing as it can serve as a lesson for him to be more careful and considerate, he is still the same overconfident musclehead at the end of the show. His lack of expertise in female interactions is already a bad signal why his plan is challenging to accomplish. Still, he persists in making his plan succeed out of desperation. I would\u2019ve liked it more if some significant development actually happened due to his flaws.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I really had a hard time whether I should even take the show seriously or not. I mean, I liked some of its dramatic moments like flashbacks of Makabe\u2019s past but how both the serious and non-serious moments flow together is mediocre. The execution also somehow lacks to put a punch on supposedly comedic moments, though I appreciate some of its subtle sarcasm. Overall, the show is a decent time waster if you keep expectations to a minimum. There\u2019s no really profound development and it only serves as a failed attempt at making a dynamic rom-com story. However, it\u2019s not downright terrible and a complete trainwreck. It\u2019s just a show that had a strong start but then forgot what it really wants to go for and then tries to make you deal with its complications for the rest of the duration. Maybe I\u2019m just too let down by this show, but maybe I should have never expected anything from it at all.\\n",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge is another one of those anime which sounds quite interesting on paper, but never comes anywhere close to reaching up to its own potential. What could have been an intriguing story about a man's almost lifelong quest for vengeance through devoted self-improvement and utilization of deceit against the girl who made his childhood a living hell instead ended up being nothing more than a clich\u00e9, predictable and rather generic romcom. Ultimately, it only leaves you thinking about what it could have been.\r\nIn the distant past, Makabe Masamune was a fat kid who found himself being a victim of bullying from numerous otherpeople his age, but especially bad was the abuse from the spoiled rich girl Adagaki Aki, who among other things gave him the nickname \"Pig's Foot\" for his chubby appearance. This experience seemingly traumatized Masamune growing up, and he started working hard at improving himself through excessive body training and studying shoujo manga to learn what girls are into when it comes to boys. Many years down the road, Masamune has become a handsome narcissistic asshole by the time he starts high school, where he once again meets Aki. She fails to recognize Masamune due to his drastic change in appearance but he identifies her immediately, and vows to finally have his revenge on her by making her fall in love with him only to cruelly dump her on the spot once she confesses to him. Perfect.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if that was all the anime was about, I think I would have liked it quite a lot. Having a smartass MC trying to seduce a cold-hearted bitch, only to then promptly enact his revenge upon her by breaking her heart... I mean it sounds like something really amusing and unique on paper, albeit in a somewhat sadistic way. But unfortunately, that is not how the story plays out at all. In the first four episodes, the story mostly consists of Masamune trying to get closer and closer to Aki with the help of his newfound insider accomplice in Aki's maid Yoshino. We get to learn more about Aki's habits and what she's like as a person, and although he has some difficulties with it, the revenge plan still feels like it is slowly moving forwards. However, with the start of episode five, things quickly start to stagnate as a love rival (Neko) is suddenly brought into the picture and the story turns into a more typical romcom all of a sudden. If this had been a series with a premise designed to be nothing more than that from the start then this would have been fine, but really this story did not need to slowly become a harem. The main plot concept revolves around solely Masamune and Aki, so bringing in outsiders merely results in them coming across as obstacles to the story's progression. More importantly though, at this point the revenge concept is all but gone because since this an anime, our MC and main heroine *obviously* have to end up falling in love with each other. Gone was the interesting original premise, and instead we are left with a narcissist and a bitch crushing on each other, but of course they're both far too dense to realize it, especially Aki. How incredibly original.\\n\\n\r\nAnother problem with this is that Aki as a character does not really function very well outside the revenge concept. No matter how you look at it, she is just a terrible person through and through. Even discounting the childhood trauma that she inflicted upon Masamune, in her current high school life she is known as the Cruel Princess: a girl totally abusing every single male person she comes across, giving them offensive nicknames, insulting them, rejecting everyone who tries to be nice to her, and just plain treats them like crap. Why? Well supposedly because some guys had been mean to her in her own childhood as well, but what right does that give her to treat completely unrelated people in such a discriminating way? Her entire character is perfectly suited for the villain role of the original revenge plot, but when she is suddenly forced to become a tsundere love interest romcom-style... it just does not fit her at all. And even more mindboggling, what the hell does Masamune of all people see in her to make him fall in love with her despite everything? What happened to your resolve? Even discounting her current terrible personality, did you also somehow forget about everything she put you through as a kid? You know, the reason you sought revenge in the first place? Just how mentally weak can you be?\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, while his romantic feelings may be questionable, Masamune can at least be somewhat manly about them at times, as he showcases to great effect in episode eight, which is by far and wide the best episode of the anime. But what does that all amount to? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Whatever strong impact one would have thought that seemingly game-changing episode would have, the anime completely throws it away immediately in the very next episode for seemingly no apparent reason. It felt like the author finally hit the right note for the story without even realizing it himself, and ended up backing on it too quickly. So not only did he first throw away the anime's original potential as a revenge story, but just as it seemed he might actually have successfully converted it into a promising romance story... he throws away that too? Goodness, why? Just what are you trying to do here exactly?\\n\\n\r\nBut as if that was not enough, the story then does not just return to the status quo, but it also gets much, much worse. The final three episodes of Masamune-kun no Revenge are simply horrible. I will not spoil any details, but basically at the start of episode 10, a new character called Gasou is introduced whose backstory and mere appearance are so far-fetched it made me twitch my eyebrows. Has the author ever heard of something known as suspension of disbelief? The whole story suddenly starts feeling incredibly implausible, but the way everyone reacts to the situation is even more ridiculous. To begin with Gasou himself is rather tedious to watch in general, but how Aki reacts to his presence is just absurd. It feels like her entire character changes in a split second as if she had some bizarre personality split, and while I technically understand why it happens, that is only a direct consequence of her being unbelievably dense and stupid. How can she possibly not realize the truth? I thought she was supposed to be a pretty smart girl? Again, it all just feels like too much of a plot convenience. And do not even get me started on Aki's so-called \"personal guard\" and how they decide to interfere with the whole situation for their own absolutely ridiculous reasons, they are just plain annoying and their actions are honestly borderline criminal yet the show treats them as if they are somehow okay or excusable. Furthermore, it is also painfully obvious that the entire story arc (if you can call it that) is just designed to be a roundabout way for Masamune and Aki to eventually get closer to each other, but really... we did not need this. If that was all you wanted, why did you not just continue from the plot development in episode eight instead?? The end result would probably have been the same, but the journey there would have been ten times better. It just baffles me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Masamune-kun no Revenge feels like a story written without much initial thought put into it by the author, almost like if he changed his mind every few weeks while writing about what direction he wanted to take the story in. As a result, it just ends up all over the place but ultimately going almost nowhere. It leaves behind an uncomfortable feeling of wasted potential on multiple levels, and a story which could and perhaps should have been a lot better than what it actually turned out to be. However, if we look past whatever potential the series may have had for a second and just look at the final product instead, then at the very least it passes as an average generic romcom. That is certainly not what I wanted it to be, but it is what we got, and looking at it that way it is at least rarely straight-up boring. Yes, it is packed to the brim with clich\u00e9s, but really what romcom is not nowadays? Masamune-kun no Revenge could have been a great anime. It did not become a great anime however, but it is still at least a tolerable one. I just wish premises like this could be left for authors who actually plan on doing something interesting with them rather than just going back to what has already been done in a hundred different other anime already.\\n\\n\r\nOh and Masamune's mother is also a loli who looks to be about five years younger than her own daughter. Why? I have no idea.",

            "content": "In spite of the many Masamune-kun reviews out, describing the show as \u201creally pretty okay\u201d or used words like \u201cbecuz\u201d, I decided to write a semi-serious review to add to the mix. Revenge is a dish best served cold. I\u2019ve heard of people exacting revenge on others due to everything from getting cheated on to a murdered relative. The reason I state this is to accentuate the weak premise Silver Link\u2019s (Kokoro Connect, Strike the Blood) \u201cMasamune-kun no Revenge\u201d carries. It is a story about a tormented chubby kid (Masamune Makabe), who grows up to be a modern marvel of handsomeness, vowing to enforce justiceon a vicious vixen (Aki Adagaki) by breaking her heart. Not necessarily the strongest basis for seeking revenge\u2026 he could've just, you know, grown up.\\n\\n\r\nThe TL;DR approach to the anime would be the dollar menu version of Nisekoi, with slightly worse art, protagonists and music... and without the delectable waifu Onodera. Knowing this fact, if you didn\u2019t exactly care for the awkward love triangle that series presented, or the bodacious tsundere that was Chitoge, I would advise you to skip Masamune kun altogether. The added revenge element does little to enhance the series past developing a convenient crutch for the plot to hinge on. Though it doesn\u2019t do anything cringeworthy, the anime is mediocre in almost every category.\\n\\n\r\nThe bulk of Masamune-kun\u2019s story is eaten up by the relationship development between himself and Adagaki, and the constant inner monologuing of how he\u2019s going to get back at her. After years of floundering through life as a plump and ridiculed young boy, Masamune kun arrives at Adagaki\u2019s school, unrecognizable from the dark times of his past. He\u2019s a perfect student, has a flawless exercise regiment and every room he walks into becomes his own personal harem. On the contrary, not much has changed in Adagaki\u2019s demeanor. She\u2019s evil, pretentious and constantly makes up degrading names for the various male suitors approaching her. Not to mention she has a ravenous appetite. The story continues with Masamune attempting to inflict his revenge on Adagaki by getting her to like him and eventually squashing her hopes, much like she did to him during their younger years. This story approach is predictable but strangely entertaining, if for no other reason than to listen to Masamune\u2019s multitude of internal dilemmas. The comedy is also unsurprising, however it's still good for a few laughs.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing in Masamune kun is where the series really starts to drop off in quality. It appears that almost every character and facet of storytelling (sans the chubby betrothed kid) is carbon copies from Nisekoi. This checks out in the manga world as well, due to Masamune kun\u2019s release being over a year after Nisekoi\u2019s. These undeniable similarities make for a less exciting plot overall, as the series becomes less about itself and more \u201cNisekoi did that better\u201d moments. Once the plot is established, it takes a sporadic turn by implanting a random damsel who seemingly wants Masamune at all costs, and a rotund young prince who\u2019s predestined to marry Adagaki. These characters are not eased into the anime, but rather plopped down in the middle of things, with very little backstory to boot. It's really what causes Masamune-kun to meander towards failure. Overall, the series does little to redeem itself and staggers aimlessly toward its bittersweet conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Makabe is actually a much better character than I initially presumed. His mannerisms played off as conceited, but through discovering the ghosts of his past and his countless acts of kindness, he redeems himself quite astoundingly. His counterparts are far less promising, with Adagaki being the only other character with any real depth among them. She fits the bill for Chitoge quite accurately in terms of tsundere-isms but seems to have less focus on her in the story overall. Perhaps this is a result of the reduced episode count from Nisekoi, but still disappointing nonetheless. There aren't any other characters really worth mentioning, as they either add very little to the story or exist merely as plot devices.\\n\\n\r\nThe art in Masamune kun is great to look at, but there aren't any scenes of astonishing animation present within its runtime. Character models are attractive and colorful, and the environments are drawn coherently, with no more detail than is required. I didn't notice any framing issues, and no evidence of pixel lag, so it's apparent the artists at least did the proper editing. That being said, I felt the OP was animated quite generically relative to the rest of the series, which is honestly the exact opposite than what I'm used to in an anime. It came by surprise, but it also didn't help me get excited for the series at all. \\n\\n\r\nSound wise, I can't say I really cared for either the OP or ED tracks. Generic and Jpop-py tones resonated with underwhelming animations, hitting par for the course for the quality of the rest of the series. The background OST was a tad more reputable, sparking the mood appropriately with tense or lightened styles, and the sound effects were well placed within the episodes. Voice acting is also very well done, with Ayaka Ohashi making a strong case for Adagaki and Natauki Hanae (Ken, Tokyo Ghoul) absolutely nailing the narcissistic Masamune. They certainly brought out the big guns for this one.\\n\\n\r\nThough it certainly won't be in consideration for Anime of the Season, Masamune kun no Revenge is a series that can certainly be enjoyed by the right audience, and perhaps with the right mindset. Preferably if you have seen Nisekoi, do you best to forget the entire series as you watch, because the similarities are uncanny at times. Leave your brain at the door, for there aren't any veiled symbolisms or faint themes to be had here, just your run of the mill comedic romance series. Recommended for modern day anime lovers, or those looking for a laugh or two to change things up. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out my other Winter \u201817 reviews!",

            "content": "Sometimes revenge may never be a solution to a problem in the real world. Sometimes, it can make things worse and create a bigger problem. But Masamune wants that revenge, no matter the cost. \r\nI'll be reviewing the episodes as a manga reader. Who is currently following the manga.\r\nStory (8)\r\nMasamune is a person I know I never could be. Becuz of his past with the deadly Cruel Princess Aki Adagaki, he then goes through self improvement and exercising for how many years to make sure that he becomes the hottest Kirit- I mean guy in the anime, and boy does he succeed. All the girlsget horny over him, which is quite the success. Masamune wants revenge on Aki, which is technically the whole point of the anime. It shows his process of achieving revenge and obtaining victory over Aki, who oh soever destroyed him in his past. It's time to strike back...\\n\\n\r\nArt (9)\\n\r\nSilver Link never fails to disappoint when it comes to school anime, I say never, but uhh. Yah not never, but I love most of the works they do (However I still haven't forgiven them regarding the Kokoro Connect Voice Actor Prank >:( . Since like 99.9% Of all silver link anime'a have a school genre or setting. The art is Fandibbly Dastic. Good art and very colourful.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (8)\\n\r\nAki- The Bitch\\n\r\nMakabe- Slave of the Bitch\\n\r\nYoshino- The Hot, Big Breasted Maid\\n\r\nFutaba- The Rejected (rip)\\n\r\nNeko- The Hot, Big Breated Girl THAT SILVER LINK SCREWED UP HER HAIR SHOULD NOT BE THAT COLOR SJDJSKIDFKDENWJ7-72$2);&;' >:(\\n\r\nKojurrou- That trap with the cute eyes that has clovers in it. Voiced by Saori Hayami (which I swear is in like 80% of Winter 2017 Anime)\\n\\n\r\nThese character are nothing incredibly special. But damn are they fun to watch. All you need to know is, Aki is a Dere Bitch, Makabe is not your typical Harem MC. He has a set of balls and doesn't nose bleed when looking at a pair of Yoshino'a HOT PANTIES DAMN HER ASS IS FINE. Whoops, inner horny me came out for a second. *clears throat.* Futaba is that side character that most people love including me. I low key wished she and Makabe became a couple tbh. The Character Interactions are funny and we get to see Aki starting to open to Makabe as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nI see why ppl call her a tsundere, but she only hits him like 2 times. After that, the Tsun begins to fade, and it's left with Dere. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8) OP and ED and BGM'a are great. But sometimes the music over intensifies or over dramatizes the situation (not that I have a problem with that for it adds a nice comedic effect) But no problems here.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9) As a manga reader, I am satisfied with how the adaptation is going so far. I really hope that they can cover the whole manga for it's about to end soon. I swear it can't be done within 12 episode unless they rush or skip some arcs (with some arcs I'm ok with them skipping .-. ) Cuz in 4 episodes which would be 1/3 of the whole show, Neko was just introduced. Maybe it can be done idk. I just hope they can adapt the whole thing. Unless they end it with concluding OVA'a like Kokoro Connect. Overall. Very enjoyable, (still kinda [just kinda] salty how they identify this as 'Harem') Only like 3 girls like him basically, with on getting rejected in like what episode 2 or 3. So yah, not everyone will like it. But I sure as hell do.",

            "content": "(This will be my first review. It was orignally a forum comment that I cleaned up to be more appropriate. I'll stick to more detailed manga reviews in the future.)\r\nThe story seems pretty original at first but then it devolves into your generic RomCom, with all the clich\u00e9.\r\n1) Story and Characters: 4 each\r\nIn the beginning, it looked like the main characters have it all. Yet, under the veneer of wealth, all is not so good. Masamune is popular but thinks excessively of himself. He also has a complex because of of his past. He is confident if we compare him to other MCs of thegenre but he just as dense and stupid at times.\\n\\n\r\nAki is your generic run-of-the mill  tsundere. She has underlying trust issues and often treats others with contempt. However, she will gradually open her heart to other characters. There's not much to say about it without spoiling the story. As our two protagonists get close to each other, they introduce various plot elements and we get to see their quirks. This their interactions rather entertaining. The side characters are gradually introduced, each adding some spice to the plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe most prominent one would be Yoshino. Presented early into the show as an innocent klutz, she fashionably proved that looks are often deceptive. Who would think that the seemingly innocuous Koiwai would be the catalyst behind the premise of the story? Yet, this is the case. Her past is the most tragic one amoing the whole cast and her interactions with the MC are fascinating, to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nKojuuro is your habitual trap. Gentle and shy, he is the opposite of the MC. This is a nice contrast. He is a loyal friend better taste that the main characters when it concerns matters of the heart. Tae Futaba aka Class President is also a moderaely fascinating character. The de facto tomboy genki. Energetic and extraverted, she brings life to the show. Her spontaneity often moved the plot when it began to stagnate and made the show much more enjoyable. Her candour would have won me over if it weren\u2019t for Neko.\\n\\n\r\nOh Neko! Many dislike her because her introduction more or less ruined an intimate moment between the two protagonists. Yet, she remains my favorite Character in the show. She reminds me a lot of Marika Tachibana, with a hint of Rem from Re: Zero. Her past is heart-warming and her personality is enthralling.  She is a very forward character and her moments with the other characters are fun to watch. It would be interesting to see a character like her in a leading role.\\n\\n\r\nThe show\u2019s main villain was introduced fairly late, at a fairly inauspicious moment. He does have some genuine motications but nothing much to write about him. He serves more as a plot device and introduced some forced drama.\\n\\n\\n\r\n2) Art and Sound: 6 and 5 respectively\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is quite good but nothing spectacular. My biggest complaint would be the generic, annoying high-pitched girl voice opening song. It is way too overused nowadays. On the other side, it\u2019s quite rare for the main Seiyuu (VA) to sing the OP. The sound effects are appropriately used but then again, it's a Rom Com not an Action Anime. The visuals are actually the best part of this anime. There are some gorgeous scenes and they do not suffer from budget issues. The animation is also fluid.\\n\\n\\n\r\n3) Enjoyment: 5\\n\\n\r\nThe pace was more or less satisfactory if we exclude the ending and the direction was average. It isn\u2019t very deep but lies somewhere between a traditional romcom and a romantic drama. Masamune-kun no Revenge managed to portray the restless behaviour that accurs in adolescence in a somehow enjoyable way. \\n\\n\r\n4) Overall Impression: 4\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this was a passable adaptation of the manga. I would not recommend it though. The story isn't complete and some elements can get too childish. \\n\\n\r\nLike we say in my country, je suis rest\u00e9 sur ma faim. \\n",

            "content": "Unlike most reviewers, I did not come here to rant, although I do have something to rant about. Nevertheless, this anime was not as bad as most people say. \r\nThe beginning is clich\u00e8; it involves a smart, handsome teen who recently transfers schools. However, there is a twist. He transfers not because of educational reasons or because he got bullied in his old one but because he wants to date a girl and break up with her. What the actual f*ck? Yeah, that was me when I watched it. \r\nNevertheless, I gave it a try, and it was fine. The flashbacks which were told lateron on the anime were really important and I understood the main characters desires at last. \\n\\n\r\nAlthough his reasons were quite childish and immature, the main character still had his own ambitions and points to prove. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development was going very well, until a lot of obstacles came. Things started getting crazy and unorganized. A girl suddenly proposed to the MC, and another guy was about to date the girl. The other guy was a douche, but he deserved to date the girl much more than the main character. The girl was stupid as crap too. \\n\\n\r\nOnto the ranting, I really despised the fact that the main character rejected a cute, perfect wife-material girl who was deeply in love with him to date a tsundere, bully, agressive, unkind, and selfish girl. Honestly, I don't know if the MC is smart or not. \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, if you haven't known, all characters who are not the main ones are plainly stupid. They are just the \"extra\" characters who only react accordingly without any self-identity. \\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, this was a fun anime. It is definitely original, and it has pleasurable art and sound. But if you are competent and do things based on common sense, not by your gut, you would find many scenes relatively irritating.",

            "content": "warning: spoilers\r\n(The review has a tl;dr section as well.)\r\nOnce in a while you come across an anime which actually has a nice premise: a boy called Masamune seeking revenge against his former childhood friend Aki Adagaki. So far so good. Then you take a careful look at the genres shown on the MAL page - harem, comedy, romance and school - the absolute worst combination of genres, which usually indicate a mediocre story. Thus the first doubts appear. In the first minutes you are presented a \u201cnarcissistic\u201d personality of the MC and think that he could be interesting despite of expecting a generic harem protagonist.Unfortunately, when his mother and Aki appeared for the first time, the death flag for this anime was set and the potential was wasted.\\n\\n\r\nI will try to hold back cursing words and talk about the characters first. As I have already said, up to 2 minutes it actually looked decent with the promising trait. But then the clich\u00e9s started to be used left and right. First his mother, who looks like a kid, not even able to give birth him and his sister with her physique , is used to draw out laughter with the viewer, which it doesn't. Because of the poor timing and bad execution of the joke, she is reduced to a generic one-dimensional character and has no further use in the story later on. Great!!!\\n\\n\r\nBesides having a sister, who isn't explored and stays an irrelevant character as well, he meets his fated arch enemy (or not), Aki, when he transfers into the new school. We are shown his pretty delicate past with her and why he \u201chates\u201d her as well. Thus he swears to retaliate by doing the same. But as it couldn't be made even more predictable, the writer decides to throw in the tsundere archetype besides making her a gluttony just to have a moe trait as well, in order to distract from the bigger problems, her personality. It's not enough to make her a tsundere, but an asshole as well (the way she rejects people). And the other students in the school become even more interested in her because of that. It makes no sense, especially because you would have at least a balance of haters and followers, if not only having haters. Just to make her a \u201cgreater existence\u201d and live in her nice fantasy bubble even more. I'll come back to her later. Great!!!\\n\\n\r\nThen the next girl, Tae Futaba, who just pops out of nowhere and confesses to him, is another character who makes an appearance for a short time and just serves the purpose of showing, how \u201cpopular\u201d Masamune is. Why or how did she fall in love with him? No idea, it just happened. She has a severe case of \u201cfalling in love with transfer students\u201d syndrome, which can be found in multiple run-of-the-mill harem stories. Masamune, \u201cdetermined\u201d to have revenge, rejects her and then she follows him for the whole anime while staying in the background. So what is the point of her character? Probably just to establish a harem and pander to viewers who like girls like her. Great!!\\n\\n\r\nBut fear not, for there is a guy, yes, you read correctly, a guy, in this show. How could he possibly fit in? There is only one correct answer, as the trap archetype. He receives no development or exploration whatsoever either because his main objective is to pander to fujoshis and he has no deeper reason to be there. You can blank him out and move on, but he actually appears a few times, so you still remember that there was someone like him in the show. If you were to recall one of his traits (not only superficial ones), congratulations, you seem to have more information than me about him, because he is only presented as a bland character in the series. If you want his name, look it up, I've forgotten it. Great!!\\n\\n\r\nJust when you think it can't become any worse, a \u201cninja\u201d, Yoshino Koiwai, joins the scene. While serving as fanservice in the first two episodes, she becomes the supporting pillar for Masamune's revenge because he can't manage it on his own. Unfortunately, the motive for her support is insufficient and doesn't dive any deeper like for the other characters. So she ends up resembling the \u201ckuudere\u201d archetype and who would've guessed, she receives no further development of her motivations either. She is just there like the trap, and while she has a few good moment (her schemes), in the end she is another shallow character. No point in introducing her as a character either other than showing another \u201ccute\u201d girl. Great!\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the author expands the harem even more by introducing another childhood friend, Neko Fujinomiya. Her convenient introduction looks more of a plot convenience rather than a natural one though. Of course she has to \u201clove\u201d him from the beginning of her introduction. Even she is used to pander again as she is commonly referred to as the \u201cpanty-less girl\u201d. Problematic are Masamune's interactions with her. He is distracted by her to the point that he thought about stopping his initial plan against Aki even though this event apparently deeply \u201cscarred\u201d him. Furthermore, he's so dense to the point that he doesn't even notice Neko's issues or her intentions. I'll elaborate later why that is a problem. While her past and issues are a bit explored, they're swept under the rug  and forgotten again. In the end she doesn't play a bigger role than just serving as a side lover. Compared to the other characters, she actually seems to be quite decent in terms of writing, although overall (compared to other stories), it's still mediocre. Great.\\n\\n\r\nIf you thought that they reached the tip of the iceberg, you're wrong though. By a very convenient chance, another boy, Kanetsugu Gasou, with a same build as Masamune in the past appears and attempts to steal Aki. What a way to accelerate the relationship between them. Besides dragging the story out even more and annoying the hell out of the viewer by including more tropes, he has just as generic motivations to act like he does. The studio/writer probably assumed that it would be enough to just show a short flashback, but that makes it come off as weak motivation and feels like an unnatural twist again. Not to mention Aki's affection to him, being deceived so easily. It starts off a series of events which are rather clich\u00e9 and ends up conveniently advancing the relationship with Masamune with the play and the kiss at the end. After that he seems to become unimportant again. With his introduction also followed a few annoying girls who messed with Masamune (borderline kidnapping) and got out of the whole mess without even a scolding, pointless characters again for the sake of advancing the plot and creating drama without actual essence. Great...\\n\\n\r\nAfter talking shortly about the characters, I want to further elaborate on Aki and Masamune and their relationship, as they are making up the main cast of the anime and represent the biggest weakness of the anime. As the story progresses, Masamune seems to lose sight of his initial target to crush Aki's heart as well. That is especially bad because 1. it's the premise that Masamune is out for revenge and 2. he was so much scarred by it that he changed his complete appearance and behavior. That isn't just simple resentment, it's way more realistic that he'd hate her to the point, where they can't go back. And yet, he almost falls in love with her. Another example of the convenient way how the story works. The motivations tend to be weak and they change from one scene to another. Not to forget how dumb he behaves at times even though he is the best student in the grade. Although grades aren't everything, they're a general indicator how smart and diligent someone is and when you see scenes where he acts like he can't even calculate with basic operators, I feel slightly hoaxed by the writer. The same applies for Aki at times. Not great.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the story itself, it's very bad because neither does it have a general direction, proven by the amount of generic events (beach scene etc.) and other ones to draw out the plot, nor is it original because of the amount of clich\u00e9s thrown into the plot. The series doesn't even flesh them out so that the viewer wouldn't mind the initial use of clich\u00e9s. Thus the story doesn't really feel like it has any worth or wants to leave a lasting impression. Definitely not great.\\n\\n\r\nAnother aspect hindering the series is the comedy because it feels out of place. When the anime is actually featuring a serious development, they drop a weak joke (generic joke like it's taken from another anime) and completely destroy the atmosphere. So did it actually make me laugh even once? Maybe once or twice in the whole series, but not more because the transitions were weak and the gestures weren't supporting the joke. Generic empty eyes don't make it funny, if that's what I want, I could watch any other run-of-the-mill comedy. The effort put into the comedy is so low, that it drags the drama and series down. What's left of the drama is, just like I described in the previous paragraphs, pretty bad as well and leaves the anime with a weak balance of drama/comedy. If the series attempted to be more serious about the whole revenge theme, it could have actually been pretty decent. Or if they made fun of the whole revenge affair. But working with the middle ground  damaged the quality a lot especially because of its poor execution. Bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe other genres (harem, romance, school) are dragging its quality down as well. On one hand, the harem is poorly executed because the girls keep popping up left and right just to disappear completely from the plot or losing all relevance as well. It's unoriginal and generic and doesn't contribute at all to the series. Even if it's meant for pandering, the characters feel so lifeless and unappealing that the pandering itself is actually poor as well. On the other hand, the school genre is just there to make it relatable for students, but even the school aspect is poorly executed, evidenced by Aki's standing (acting like a scumbag \u2192 being treated like a goddess) and the lack of real life school themes. Very bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe only aspect I want to talk about before coming to my conclusion is the final episode. With the final episode always comes the responsibility of a series to either make a satisfying conclusion in the best case or leave it off at a cliffhanger at an ideal moment. Unfortunately, the final episode provides neither. After the kiss in the play, they only go to the karaoke (yes, another typical clich\u00e9) and draws out the conclusion even more. By the time you've finally survived the pointless subplot, it ends without answering important questions and using a pretty bad cliffhanger, not hyping up the viewer for more. As a final episode, that's unforgivable. Furthermore, it also looks like Masamune is even torn between revenge and real love. So what was the point of making his past like that? Not to mention that his thoughts are still way too pure. The ending was basically a slap into the face. Atrocious.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Masamune-kun no Revenge tries to aim for a pretty interesting idea, just to fall down from a cliff with its execution. Its countless clich\u00e9s and plot conveniences feel out of place and make the story very unnatural, especially the school setting and Aki's behavior. The characters themselves are also consisting more of stereotypes than being fleshed out during the episodes. Even the main characters flip from one moment to another and stay bland until the very end. Thus most characters feel like they were copy-pasted into the anime and just there because of either pandering or because the writer had no idea how to write characters. Either way, the story and characters have a bad synergy and drag down each other.  Even the comedy was, just like I mentioned, more of a hindrance than increasing my enjoyment. It didn't succeed with anything in any of the categories and will stay in my memory as a bad anime, which I couldn't even laugh at. If the writer perhaps excluded the harem, put more emphasis on the school setting and using it to his advantage for a battle between Aki and Masamune or just using better comedy or relying solely on drama, I could have enjoyed the series at least a bit. Neither did the art or animation change my thoughts significantly because neither is the art pretty original, nor was the music memorable or improving the atmosphere. Especially the OP and ED were very average.\\n\\n\r\nThe final words from each paragraph of this review have more development than the whole cast of the series. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr:\\n\\n\r\n- very clich\u00e9 and bland characters with next to no character development\\n\r\n- main characters flip personalities and their motivations are forgotten at times\\n\r\n- out of place comedy and unfunny jokes + weak transitions with drama\\n\r\n- plot conveniences at times just to advance their relationship (especially into the direction of Masamune actually loving Aki and not into the direction of revenge)\\n\r\n- harem and romance contribute nothing to the story\\n\r\n- weird school with a mentality to worship Aki\\n\r\n- drawn out plot\\n\r\n- no general direction\\n\r\n- weak final episode (especially with the karaoke scenes)\\n\r\n- average to mediocre art\\n\r\n- not memorable soundtrack and weak OP + ED\\n\\n\r\nscores:\\n\r\nstory: 1/10\\n\r\ncharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nsetting: 2.5/10\\n\r\nart/animation: 4/10\\n\r\nmusic: 4/10\\n\\n\r\noverall: 2/10",

            "content": "HEAVY SPOILERS (Entire Anime ruined, With Already Obvious Manga End Spilled, Progress At If You Know And Do Not Care): \r\nThis anime started well enough. Masamune's Revenge requires a little amount of disbelief in the premise, because of course it is going to end with the main girl he is trying to get revenge on become his lover, and while I would fault this anime for making it so starkingly obvious upon reading the synopsis, I am somewhat of a fan of these stories, where hostiles give way to mutual understanding and feelings of affection. How Masamune's will learn to forgive Aki could be executewell, but....\\n\\n\r\nThat is not what I received.\\n\\n\r\nFor the attempted progress in Nisekoi that did not happen to \"acts of God\", Masamune's Revenge suffers from plot induced stupidity just as often, and in frustration for the writer prolonging the development for more slice of life segments, this also makes the characters infuriating to watch. This, coupled with convenient prolonging inconsistency in the character's' attitude and actions, makes it an exercise in futility This leads to arcs being longer than they should be for the information known, with irrational display of actions to pile on, which is what makes my score a humbling 3.\\n\\n\r\nBut first of, let me argue the story: Masamune is trying to get revenge on a girl who break his heart when they children, by breaking her heart as an unknown High Schooler. This premise is already shaky. Besides establishing that Masamune being supposedly narcissistic, it also exclaims that Masamune is an asshole. A petty one at that. This does not mean we do not initially root for him, because conveniently, Aki, the one who broke his heart, has grown to be an even bigger asshole, fond of maintaining a schedule of constantly rejecting boys who confessed based on her misandry. Besides begging the question, \u201cWhy any of these boys would find a cruel, man hating bitch being prominent potential girlfriend material\u201d, this establishes a conflict for Masamune to overcome, with his methods being...using shoujo manga as guides to woo Aki\u2019s heart. For some, it may be funny, and I chuckled at times, but contrasting his intelligence, Masamune honestly believes they would work, especially without any real life innovation on his part, and consistently uses them for the first few episodes, making an alliance with Aki\u2019s Maid Koiwai (Who has been Aki\u2019s maid since they were children, despite the whole ethical nature of coerced child labor) in the meantime, who instead of just giving him advice, sometimes has to directly talk to Aki at times to push her in a certain direction.\\n\\n\r\nBesides being a little unimaginative, with various animes, such as The World God Only Knows, profiting off of this now trite humor, this was okay if you were a fan of the genre, with other tropperiffic romance hijinxs thrown in for good measure. People who want a better than \u201cdecent\u201d romantic comedy should search elsewhere at this point. This was also a reason why it was rated highly, because many put up preemptive reviews before finishing the series, or at least the end of the Neko \u201carc\u201d. It serves as an okay transition to the first appearance of Neko in episode 5.\\n\\n\r\nNow to rant.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, I disliked the Neko saga. It was prolonged out of stupidity, and Neko's reasoning to be rather built up for no reason, and even a little bit of shallow randomness at that, even if she did end up loving him. For all she knows, Masamune could have attacked you with scissors or something, be in a relationship, anything, which bites Neko in the butt for falling in love before meeting him, seeing as he has admittedly cruel reasons for breaking off any potential relationships for the sole purpose of getting his revenge, contrary to the nice guy you imagine he would be. Nevertheless, in hindsight, one would ask \u201cWhy bother with the fake background story that Masamune knew was false? Why didn't he confront her then, or about the missing picture?\u201d She could have easily just as confessed her reasons without hiding behind a fake love story, and the honesty would have been a lot more better for the show, especially as being a contrast to Masamune's deception with Aki. The reason was built up beyond importance, sure, but it isn't a bad reason in itself. I do not see any reason to hide it at all. Teenagers are extraordinarily stupid to think they should fall in love with someone at a distance, before a relationship starts. That is not how it usually works, and Neko might have been a subversion of that reasoning if she did not play it straight based on a photograph Masamune's Loli mother sent, out a heap of other suitors. To an extent, we can exercise the choice over who we love, and it is entirely possible to fall in love after repeated social engagements, even outside of dating, among other things. I mean, is that not the point of the Masamune's relationship with Aki? Although, he sure was accepting of Neko laying him on the bed after all that creepy shit that has happened in the previous 5 minutes. Never stick your dick into crazy.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, Masamune is a hypocrite, for refusing Neko, on the basis of her love not being \"genuine\" (Partly because he did not interrogate her, partly because she thought the truth was \"inconvenient, neither of which are really logical), when he is in a insincere relation with Aki for the sole purpose of breaking her heart, for an incident that happened when they fucking 8 years old. Masamune's standards are sorts of fucked up here to criticize someone for the same thing he is doing (In the case of Neko, it was an assumption bought by a lack of asking, of all things, not a truthful observation), even if it could be demonstrated to be an example of why revenge is bad, or that Masamune is unknowingly falling in love with Aki (Questionable after the scene at the school where he watches her laments her own struggles with love, angering him deeply), because we both know that he will end up with Aki because she is the designated heroine.\\n\\n\r\nIf I did not explain Neko\u2019s reasoning good enough, she wanted to fall in love before her surgery, and thus seeked a relationship with Masamune, and ends up falling for him, having picked him as a potential suitor based on a photograph Masamune\u2019s Loli Mother sent.  Again, sometimes you fall in love with someone you know or just seem, but at other times, it arises out of a mutual physical attraction cemented by personalities that get along, not \u201clove at first sight\u201d, but a slow process of fondness growing out of being familiar and enjoying each others\u2019 company. This is not bad, and Neko has no reason to \u201chide\u201d it with a fake story. She should have just transferred, and expressed romantic interest in Masamune, however uninteresting that is.\\n\\n\r\nPoint being, the plot investigation of the mysterious Neko, who appeared her entirety in episode 5 and being promptly declared a liar without her motives being known, did not get any headway till episode 8, and promptly ended with a life or death situation in episode 9, without any real reason than teenagers gonna teenage, with the episodes in between being filler. Fuck, you do not state a plot point that the protagonists needs to address, fuck around for 3 episodes, then have it turned into a dramatic show of events, especially after episode 7 was a fucking beach episode. This is plot induced stupidity at its finest, and hamming it up with an inconsistent tone is nonsensical.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Gasou, oh poor Gasuo, pretending to be Masamune. Apparently, he is a rival for Aki\u2019s affection, despite the truth later being found out. The difference being, that his intentions were expected to have actually good consequences for people besides himself, even if the deception requires taking advantage of a girl, who hates men, because she thought the very same Masamune had left her\u2026.causing her to hate men? Does not compute, not at all. Not to mention Aki wants to marry this imposter off the bat, despite supposedly never seeing each other for years? No offense anime, but the childhood tag kind of feels ridiculous when things ended the way that they did, with reverberations to the modern days, and for love to blossom right where it picked off\u2026.because? I mean, Gasou might not have try to seduce Aki out of love for her, but Masamune is exceptionally more self interested and obsessed for his own self satisfaction, which makes him seem more villainous if anything else. I think Aki is a bitch, but she is not one worth obsessing over, even if she does deserve a comeuppance. She is worth less than spending most of your high school life breaking, which is not easy.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now for why I REALLY despise this series. You might have heard of the source material\u2019s imminent ending, I myself was able to figure it out quickly enough, due to inconsistent freudian excuses and hints that the characters know different stories, but\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAki isn't responsible for what happened 8 years ago it seems, and that is fucking perfect. What is the point of revenge in the title then? This isn't so much forgiveness because she is the wrong target of his ire in the first place, and this subverts the premise to allow a romantic situation to happen without the debate of revenge versus forgiveness and love, with all those feelings included being irrelevant too, because it is entirely cast aside to another person who may or may not be forgiven. This still doesn't absolve Aki of her bitchiness. Everyone has a sob story in anime, but it does not matter, especially when you are a sexist brat in High School acting out childhood trauma that is not even so bad, if not a little enforced.\\n\\n\r\nIt subverts its \u201cRevenge\u201d  tag entirely, something that the anime made obvious in the last 4-5 episodes, leaving only the question \"Who caused it\". This is a major plot point over the course of several years for the protagonist that doesn't get resolved in any way except that \"She did not do it\", thus leaving forgiveness out of Masamune sorting his feelings for Aki.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the equivalent of the murderer being a supernatural entity, or that the family has had a long lost secret twin, without the essential backdrop needed for the viewers believe it. It entirely uproots the story narrative, and for Masamune Kun, it is the plot point. It is a plot convenient twist that aims to settle for a romantic pairing without all those complicated working out of feelings, and honestly? That is crap. Complete crap. What a fucking plot twist.\\n\\n\r\nI dislike the ending, but it is understandable why, and I personally prefer no ending than badly done anime ending or sequel hook. In any case, the fact that nothing comes from it within 12 episodes is why the ending is so jarring. If there is any change that would happen, it would be here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Fine.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune: I never found him to be that narcissistic, just overconfident, especially in seduction where he relies on shoujo manga. (Unless it was a realistic one, they're not step by step panecea to seducing girls like flies to honey, especially with Aki, which is a nice touch to the shallow world we we introduced in the first 5 minutes). In essence, his  cynicism about appearance is wrong the first time he meets Aki, because looks do not \"matter\" to her (In more than one way). His talk with Neko in episode 9 was somewhat reasonable, if not brought on by unreasonable circumstances before, and that is really all I have to say that is decent about his characters.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, for someone portrayed as a searing knife of directness in a relationship, he never confronts Neko about her lies, despite being a detriment to his plan. Why? He also blushes and forgets to say stuff in the most important moments, specifically \"Who the hell are you\" to Neko, thus making his relation with Aki on the rocks. He also comes off as a hypocrite for his reasoning for breaking up with Neko (An \"I do not know you enough for sexual intercourse\" would have been enough), but is wise and kind when he carries the secretary, saying typical heartwarming lines, from the haunted house one episode before, something that is completely out of character. This is the same dude who relies on shoujo manga all the time, steals romantic quotes, and we expect to take him seriously when he says this line of maturity right here, a teenager trying to get revenge for what has happened as children? This is terribly done, and terrible consistency in his personality, often happening when the plot demands it, or merely hacked on to make him a protagonist we would be able to like. This is not a coincidence, but his personality is dictated by what needs to happen, rather than what happens as a result of his choices. This is common enough in dramas, where it demands dramatic inter-character conflict to happen, even if said characters were establish as being reasonable enough to work it out.\\n\\n\r\nNow to take a break, you may wonder that \"teenagers do act this way\", and they do, but realism is hardly an excuse to create an entertaining story, with the author dictating everything as a God. For a romcom, that is the saving grace if the dramas comes off as overly hormonal, so to speak.\\n\\n\r\nAki: She is a bitch. For most of first episodes, that is what she is, complete with \"cute\" segments, such as her eating 3 meals a per lunch to compensate for her metabolism or something, moe face and all. She is also terribly in love with Masamune at some point, asking for a kiss and then freaking out and uppercutting him.\\n\\n\r\nShe does shine for me in some instances, but a lot of these character moments are also her weakness. She is self aware of her personality, and acknowledges at times that she does not know why anyone would want her, demanding Masamune's reasons for choosing to date her, then reasonably being hurt when Masamune comes up with crap reasons. Then, there are similar moments, when she try to justify her current personality for what has happened to her in the past. Except this past hurt manifests as literal misandry, and it comes off as a \"woe is me\" type of deal, and it makes her far more annoying if not slightly more understandable. Everyone has a sob story, huh? This would have been great if she changed, but for the most part of the anime, it isn't earnest improvement, but brought on by the plot, with her reminiscing over young, fat Masamune before Gasuo shows up, seducing her, despite previous hints and flashbacks that explained her misandry arised out of the incident with Masamune supposedly leaving her. Yeah. I am not a psychologist or anything, but this is just inconsistency on her part. The change is so sudden that I wonder if Aki is the same person, which then boomerangs back when Masamune and Aki get back together after Gasou was defeated, and literally nothing has changed at this point. You had 12 episodes, what is with this lack of development?\\n\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, hardly any of the other characters can justify watching this anime. They were cutouts that I found entertaining only as background characters, and based on what has transpired, I hope they stay that way.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is terrible at worst, run of the mill at its better parts. The comedy is okay, but drama is a difficult beast that is not done well. You cannot just pile on more drama like you can do jokes on top of ones that fell flat. A bad dramatic event will usually stay with the viewers as does a good one. Unfortunately, there is a lot of mediocre drama facilitated by poor characters choices and personalities you cannot sympathize with for long.\\n\\n\r\nSo in short, I rated this a 3/10.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no revenge review\r\nLet\u2019s talk about a revenge story that never happened with clich\u00e9 characters set in a school.\r\nStory 1/10\r\nThis is one of the those original stories that gives facts to the saying \u201cCan I copy your homework ? Yeah just changed it up a bit so it doesn\u2019t look so obivious\u201d.Don\u2019t worry if you are looking for worldbuilding and character development there is no such thing. Cmon be serious it\u2019s a masterpiece!\r\nIt\u2019s about revenge or a stupid grudge a fat guy has over a tsundere princess since childhood and can\u2019t move on with his life because guess what that is a great idea tomake a story for the author.Make a better story author next time!\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very clich\u00e9 set in a school and the development is as it should be the first episodes focuses on the heroine and mc then other characters are added to spicy up the story or to make it more of a mess. \\n\r\nAs every 12 episodes anime needs to respect his standards we have the legendary beach episode where we are shown plot and flat 100 years war , the transfer student who is always a girl preferably with big boobs because plot is needed , and the same rooftop scenes and action to conquer the heroine who guess what it\u2019s a fck tsundere!\\n\r\nWe also have a trap in this story who is treated as a girl because if we add a little spice to the plot it\u2019s more entertaining or stupid and clich\u00e9.\\n\\n\r\nI almost forgot the reverse trap girl who dresses as a guy because she has her circumstances and nobody notice that because everybody in this anime is stupid as fck.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 0/10\\n\\n\r\nThese are the characters you can find in any anime so they\u2019re copy paste characters starting from their looks to their personality.\\n\\n\r\nMakabe is the main character of this show,his looks way of acting and level of density and dumbness fits him in a romantic comedy anime. Even his haircut is the same as other mc from rom/com anime. He is the \u201cmacho\u201d type who does sport and eats healty food because he was a fat guy in his childhood. Such a retarded 1D character.He always saves the day or fails to achieve his goals because this anime doesn\u2019t needs a conclusion and a story. He is dumb as fck too.\\n\\n\r\nAdagaki Aki the heroine who everybody wishes for the princess from a fairy taile.She is tsundere of course what did you expect and flat chested too. What a joke of character. She eats a lot too and doesn\u2019t get fat because anime logic.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino this is the joint character added to the love triangle usually has a bulb haircut and two personalities one of the silent type and the other a vicious predator. To fit the standards of this anime usually she knows the heroine from childhood and tries to protect her from other male characters.\\n\\n\r\nNeko is the legendary transfer student with big boobs who every romantic comedy anime needs it . Usually she is kind hearted towards the mc and likes to act as a smartass and superior to other characters. She also has a important role in the plot vs flat endless war.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation 8/10 \\n\r\nThe only good thing about this show and the vivid colors will attract every pleb who has shit taste in anime to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound 4/10\\n\r\nI liked the opening \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first episodes where enjoyable but the repetitive jokes and the tsundere heroine became so annoying that it ruined my enjoyment. The main character dumbness and retarded actions ruined the anime too.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10\\n\r\nThe ending of this show is a total mess the interaction between characters is awfull and to make it worse the fact that a new character is added and never explained his past or circumtances and role in the story it\u2019s like a trash can who is overfilled with garbage and somebody should empty it.The last episode crumbled everything and the ending is number one clich\u00e9 spot in the history of anime.",

Most of the comedy was cringe funny (like how Masamune says weird pick up lines he got from manga, I FELT THE AWKWARDNESS THROUGH THE SCREEN).\r\nI really expect Masamune and Aki to actually fall in love at some point (if there will be a 2nd season, I haven't read the manga) so I'm not paying too much attention that Masamune's whole drive is to break her heart. \r\nThe show ended in the middle of an arc which was pretty awkward, it could have at least had a resolution andcomplete the arc.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nEach of the characters are very unique and have lots of detail in their personalities. Some characters are not exactly likable because the cast consists of the narcissist, the men hater, the girl that tries to completely ruins the main characters relationship etc. but they were enjoyable to watch\\n\r\nLittle development except for the minimal advancement in the main character\u2019s relationship and *SPOILER* the other girl giving up on Masamune, overall supporting him and Aki *END OF SPOILER*\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nCharacters were wonderfully designed. Adagaki Aki is definitely eye catching and beautiful. No complaints on art! :)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\nVoice acting was good. The opening song is now one of my favorite anime songs!\\n\\n\r\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\\n\r\nThe show was good, but not great. It made me feel extremely awkward at times but it had a good laugh to it. Overall 7/10 \\n\\n",

            "content": "I noticed there are many hate reviews regarding this show, I decided to make one defending it and explaining its brilliance instead, which some of you have missed, or hate it because it's popular to do so (as with SAO).\r\nA fat boy turns a muscular young man after being rejected as a kid and plots revenge on the girl who broke his heart. Right away I experienced Nisekoi vibes mixed with Maid-sama and sprinkled with a little bit of Oreairu.\r\nFirstly, there's an abundance of absolutely hilarious scenes throughout the anime, his mom being a 'loli hag' is just one of the examples. All the girlsin the anime are extremely likable and have a character of their own and the main girl characters get plenty of backstory, even the ones not introduced in the show from beginning. Voice actresses are superb as always, my personal favorite is Yoshino's - hits the tone in any given situation supremely.\\n\r\nThe atmosphere is very cheerful and colors are bright and vibrant, generating a pleasant and soothing ambience for laugh inducing and embarrassing situations to flourish. The sound further embellishes the enjoyable feel the series create.\\n\\n\r\nCoupled with the fact the MC is a unique character and has a nuance feel about him is very refreshing. Think of him as a combination of Kanie (Amaburi) and Arata (Trinity 7). I like his way of dealing with situations. I like how he gets things done and dares doing what most harem leads never do, but going in details would spoil the show. Super refreshing and a pretty much a contrast to what people familiarized with harem know how a generic male lead acts.\\n\\n\r\nThis is also one of few anime that caters to the audience of leg enthusiasts, more specifically tights/pantyhose enthusiasts and it's further emphasized by the art of the show and follows with lots of fanservice on the aforementioned... enthusiasm.\\n\\n\r\nOnly thing I had a problem with was towards the end the story sort of dragged out, but that was pretty much diminished by the obvious indication of the continuation, an upcoming sequel or perhaps more.\\n\r\nI understand the point of view of some people who dislike story not progressing fast, but that's exactly the goal of the series. You're here for the fill, to experience as many ups and downs following the protagonist's path and having a great time doing so rather than arriving at its ultimate resolve promptly.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, if you like good romance harems, like the shows I mentioned and agree with most of the arguments I presented, this show is definitely for you.",

            "content": "In the attempt of making something special, the makers just created an anime which is pretty generic. Im not saying that being generic is something bad, but it's just that I had a feeling that they wanted to make something that breaks the typical Romance/Comedy/School-Life genre. A little information (or perhaps a personal impression) of this anime:\r\nArt -8-\r\nWhen I first watched the first episode, the first thing that I noticed was that the artwork of the characters was stunning. Our heroine was well animated and had a special and unique look. The background and the side characters also were nicely done. As for our MC,I had the feeling that the animation studio used more time and cash to animate him than all the other (female) characters (lol). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters -7-\\n\\n\r\nEarly in the anime the motive of our MC is already clear; he wants to date the main heroine (Aki) due to seeking revenge to her. Now, you may think: Yeah! Awesome, finally a MC who does his shit for a different reason. Someone who doesn't want to get all Lovey Dovey with the babes in the story. But in reality what we have here is THE typical MC:\\n\r\nComing to a new school where he doesn't know anyone? Check. \\n\r\nHaving an hyperactive and sweet imouto (lil' sis)? Check. \\n\r\nNo common sense in terms of love/romance? Cheeeck. \\n\r\nAnd as for our heroine...\\n\r\nNo common sense in terms of everyday life and social interaction? Check.\\n\r\nHaving a naturally weird hair color (blue)? Check.\\n\r\n100% TSUN, 0% dere??? CHEEECKKKKKK.\\n\r\nAs I said, the stated stuff up there doesn't strictly mean something bad. It's just my opinion that they wanted to make something special but didn't work out.\\n\\n\r\nStory -6-\\n\\n\r\nI think you at least until now you understand my point of this anime being generic... The story isn't really something special. The motivation of the MC is different than others but still I think the result is the same. Nothing good and nothing bad either, so a solid 6, although the process in my opinion is a bit slow.\\n\\n\r\nSound -8-\\n\\n\r\nYeah, as long as the sound and music in the anime don't suck, then everything's ok for me I guess... But I think I enjoy that one instrument which you always hear when you see the Eiffel Tower or Paris in TV...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -7-\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of enjoyment, the anime definitely isn't bad, if you like Romance/School Life/Comedy animes like me. All the characters have their certain charm sometimes. I just simply enjoy watching these types of anime no matter if they're special or normal I'd watch them all :).\\n\\n\r\nSooo overall I'd give it a solid 7 right now. The anime isn't over yet so I can't really comment about the final score I'd give it but let's hope for something good and exciting at the end :D\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Aki is basically the female lead and well a total bitch she is that and even more turning down any boy and well mocking the guys who asked her out and gave them nicknames. Neko is a supporting character and also loves Masamune she is a sweet and also cool girl. Yoshino another supporting character she is also the maid for aki but she does turn on her to help Masamune get revenge on aki she is a clumsy but a nice person.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: so this anime was HELLA good in my honest opinion the comedy was pure gold and the characters were very good. my gripes were that the ending was just like WTF they basically had a karaoke to basically end it but when i thought she might kiss him nope and they still aren't going out so season 2 inbound spoilers incoming. (they basically ended it with him not getting revenge and even Masamune made it like a season 2 will happen so it better) \\n\\n\r\nOverall: giving this a 8 for sure again the ending was crap and is why its getting a 8 and not a 9 from me but the characters were so good and the comedy was pure gold a anime worth a watch (please let this anime have a season 2)",

I'll try to keep this spoiler free\r\nStory:5\r\nThe story is pretty generic with a few touches here and there, it's not really good story wise, just your generic rom com with some drama added in the middle and it ends with again a generic ass ending. It's about Masamune a boy who is entering a specific high school for one reason, to get revenge on the girl who bullied him when he was akid, this girl is named Adagaki Aki a cruel girl who rejects every single boy who wants to date her. That's pretty much the summary of the story it's nothing special at all.\\n\\n\r\nArt:8\\n\\n\r\nIf i have to give something positive it's the art, Silver Link did a really good job with the art, it's shiny, flashy and above all else really pretty to look at. Nothing to complain here\\n\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\\n\r\nIt's ok, the OP and ED is pretty much your standard rom com OP and ED with a woman singing the OP and ED, the score also isn't special at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:5\\n\\n\r\nThey're your standard characters. The male MC Masamune is pretty decent with some things i found interesting, he's pretty much the best character other than one girl. The female MC Aki is not interesting at all, she's just your mean but smart waifu that has no boobs and ass. A character that i do find interesting is Yoshino, she's aki's maid and the only one she trusts. Yoshino has these traits that make her interesting like the fact that she can be a fucking assasin. The supporting cast is generic, that's it\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it enough to the point of actually wanting to finish it, it's actually really disappointing at the end, that's all i can say\\n\\n\r\nOverall:5\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-Kun no Revenge is just your standard middle of the road forgettable rom com, if you want to watch this expecting something gold, i hate to break it to you but all you're gonna find watching this is just disappointment if you're expecting something like Oregairu. But if you want to watch a middle of the road rom com this is it.",

            "content": "What happens when you can review a show after two episodes, and off the dialoge alone you can infer its quality? Either it's a masterpiece, or Masamune-kun happens.\r\nI have already read a decent chunck of the manga. As it was late at the time, I didn't feel as dissapointed, and as such, know that this is not based solely off the first two episodes. \r\nAdmittedly, each season has at least one Masamune-kun, so i'm not particularily impressed by how bad it is. However, I am impressed by how easily they fucked up a good set-up. By all means, the idea of a narcissist and aself-indulgent drama queen hitting it off, only for said narcissist having planned to dump said drama queen all along is interesting. So then the question becomes: why exactly did it go wrong?\\n\\n\r\nEasily like a lot of other run of the mill anime - have everything be exaggerated. Let's begin with the main love interest, who's motives I will quickly showcase: ''Oh, some ugly nerd asked me out? I am like 10 years old, but for some reason since the plot dictates it, I am supposedly not only attractive, but also the queen of deriving pleasure from publicly humiliating guys in sadistic fashion.'' Why? Why is this necessary? This is not relatable to anyone, and for that matter, when she gets older, you'd think anyone interested enough in her already would be aware of her shitty nature as a person, therefore choosing not to want to be around her! And then, somehow, her biggest weakness is the fact that she eats too much and tries to hide it? Not the fact that she is a hateful bitch, which no real person would ever feel compelled to be friends with, much less date?\\n\\n\r\nAnd let's not forget our protagonist, Masamune-kun \u2665, whom swoons all the girls in his school. Why? I dunno. I think all girls are vain assholes or something. He has pretty much zero personality, and for that matter, no one really knows him that well, but he is decent looking and gets good grades. OMG Liek so cool! I thougth his narcisissm would play a bigger role/be more interesting, as it could have opened a deep discussion on human psychology and our society as a whole, but fuck that! We have to meet a standard here guys! \\n\\n\r\nHell, maybe I just don't understand the cultur, or here is a better idea: maybe this anime is just an attempt at appealing to the lowest common denominator, whom has the hots for any girl that aknowledges their existince? If I didn't know any better, it would seem like a team of marketers knew their audience's lack of social skills and ran with it; they ran with it all the way to the bank. \\n\\n\r\nAnd for that matter - wtf is this backstory? When starting this, I expected the main character's actual reason for revenge would be a tiny, just tiny bit more nuanced. In the words of Chuck Testa \"Nope.\" In reality, he is still angry over the fact that she called him a piggy when they were like, I dunno - ten years old. This goes into that whole theme of overexaggeration I discussed previously, where the actual act she commited was so tame, no real human being would ever be this bothered by it, or if they were, they wouldn't keep a grudge for approximately (based on my statements) 7 or so years! At some point, that being maybe at most a month, you would forget about it and move on. But years of Contempt. Are you for fucking real?! And let's say it could actually bother somebody to such a degree. That still wouldn't make it compelling to watch what would inevitably be a shitfest of a series.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I was just about ready to forgive it and move on, but one scene at the start of episode two solidified my position on this show - that being the fact that it's actual garbage. Sadist miss bitch sally's servant. Yes, servant... Had gone to buy her master's lunch. Now, because of the absolutte madness which apparently occurs at japanese school cafeterias, miss servant was not able to pass through the crowd. And let this be said - I have nothing against fanservice in anime, but this scene was just disgusting. Miss servant, as she is pushed by the crowd does a 180, landing in perfect position for the main character to see her blue panties, and I felt desimated. Not only is this scene garbage for being unnecessary and coming completely out of left field, but in order to infuriate me even more, they had the gall to do a completely unrelevant joke at the end, the servant asking \"Am I in heaven?\" This isn't just unfunny, but it's patting of an already unneseccary scene. \"Oh, she is just a dumb cutie.\" haha so funny much XD. Please go fuck yourselves! \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that something like this could even get an anime adaption still bothers me. I know that the industry is cruel, and that companies need to make money somehow, but shit like this ends up being wasted animation, which is sad because the art and animation aren't even that bad. Although it is generic, such is every aspect of this show and shows similar to it.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun no revenge is truly the epitome of generic garbage. Embrace your garbagness. Masamune-kun every year for another hundred years for all time. Masamune-kun forever and ever. We will allways love Masamune-kun. Hail our leder - the great Masamune-kun, and may you and your contemporaries live for another hundred years. We embrace thy lord! Amen. Peace. I'm outta here.",

What I was not fine with is that his freaking identity is like stolen and that doesn't even get resolved. Seriously what the fuck.\r\nI am in no waya good critic when it comes to anime, I usually rate stuff pretty high as long as I enjoy it. This anime really manages to piss me off. I stayed up to 5:30 because I was waiting for everything to get resolved, it doesn't. WHY. Why does this even exist. It achieved nothing, I feel like the people that made this were just trying to waste my time. I can't even go to sleep now because I feel like this anime has ruined my world view, everything is meaningless, it doesn't matter what you do, because you probably just wasted a few hours of your life and now I'm gonna have to stay up at least another 4 hours to watching something else that hopefully wont leave me utterly disappointed.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun in the Revenge had all the obnoxious points so that it was close enough for me to quit the anime for good. And guess what? The idiot here continued to force himself to watch because he had a tiny expectation that it would improve, but in the end it was a cluster of random episodes and extremely boring cliches that exuded the predictable in an uninterrupted and boring way. Holy shit, for the most part, you could predict what would happen in the next episode pretty much all based on what you saw before; It was ridiculous.\r\nThe whole plot is more like a randomset of OVAS, in which, some parts, will be surprisingly important in the plot. Actually, this was not supposed to be a novelty, most of the anime / manga that approach this annoying and saturated theme, always develop this way, but really, does not stop or tire of being impertinent to see.\\n\\n\r\nVisually, it's cute. The visual (environment) of the anime is pleasant, a pity that what the anime has to present does not follow this line ...\\n\r\nThe animation looked like it would be good, but it suffers a considerable loss of quality.\\n\r\nAnd the soundtrack, nothing much. It does not disturb or help, basically.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now it is here that I lay all my eternal and profound repudiation of the anime; The characters, or rather the two protagonists. God, how horrible they are. In fact, their personality is that it is so hateful.\\n\r\nLet's go in parts, first, Masamune: man, it's out of the ordinary, how fucking he is. To start with his goal, which almost completely outlines the plot. It is certain that even the anime itself does not give a seriousness to it, but seriously, it is so unbearably unbearable what it does because of this totally childish and superficial goal, rather than being funny, it is pathetic. He just did not give a fuck what was going on around him (mostly), because of a revenge he was supposed to have been in the past. But no, he holds an extremely strong and ultra relevant rancor because of a... rejection. Wow, it's really pathetic.\\n\r\nAnd second, last, and definitely not least, Aki: I actually wondered, how the hell does one like it, even getting on a level to consider it a love. She has such a fucking boring and unpalatable ego. Why then, moe is not enough to make a character a person's love, okay? Well, let's face it, having a superiority complex so inflated to the point of tearing up a simple love letter, and putting on an embarrassing nickname and humiliating whoever is confessing, I think it's not very lovely...\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, my relevant hate for anime is mainly due to the characters. If they were other than the two protagonists, I probably would have enjoyed the anime much more and would not give such a big deal to a totally boring, predictable, and meager storyline.",

            "content": "In summary, I absolutely loved this anime. It was a great spin on the typical shojou romance.\r\nThe story of Adagaki Aki and her cruel outlook on men, mixed with the hilarity of masamune makabe trying to be the cool ikemen he looks like, created a wonderfully entertaining anime.\r\nStory 7: The story isn't all that satisfying, honestly. There are several ways to look at it of course, I personally love a rich story with comedy and an interesting take to a typical genre. To me, \"Masamune-kun no Revenge\" did that. The story was cute, funny, and light. I feel like these days so many anime aredark and depressing; Finding an uplifting anime is a nice change to the mainstream stuff I have been seeing. \\n\\n\r\nArt 7: The art was not too bad, I didn't hate it, however for those that don't like typical, or common, you would not like this art style. Yes, it was a typical style but there is nothing wrong with that. The male characters all had the same sort of \"baby face\" that a lot of anime/manga artists fall into occasionally. However, I found the use of typical art style in this anime added to the overall quality. The story follows, what one would assume, is a typical shojou romance, however the plot takes quips and interesting digs at these cliche typical romances with the characters. Adding the typical art style only adds to the comedy and irony of the cliche.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: I found that the soundtrack in this anime didn't really stick. It matched the overall feel of the anime with the lighthearted nature, however I didn't find myself, at any point, thinking \"hey these are some pretty cool tunes\". However I don't think that the sound quality/soundtrack of an anime should be a part of whether or not you watch it. Unless the anime is something like Starmyu. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10: I absolutely loved the characters in this anime. Sure a few of them were rather common, but the majority of them were so masterfully crafted I found myself actually screaming when I was watching their interactions. My personal favourite characters are, in no particular order,  Kae futaba, Kojuuro shuri, yoshino koiwai, and of course, masamune makabe. In order of why I love them: Kae Futaba is a fellow fujoshi, several times throughout the show we see her fangirl over the pairing of Kojuuro-kyun and... Well basically any other guy. Next is my sweet sweet kojuuro-kyun. he is described as the \"designated bottom\" this again appeals to my fujoshi heart as we see several references to this. In the first episode We see so, so, many references. At one point we see him adorably chomp on a NEKO DONUT.. I REPEAT A NEKO DONUT. Yoshino Koiwai is by far one of the most well thought out characters in the whole show. She starts off all sweet and shy but then, oh but then, we see her actual sense of Kuudere-ness. She is so cold and calculating and no one knows it, except for Masamune of course. Then finally our main, dorky, hero: Masamune Kun. Masamune is such a lovable character. From his good looks to quirky/dorky thought process, he is just adorable. Several times throughout the series he tries to be the \"cool ikemen\" his appearance makes him seem to be. However his take on romance is strictly from his \"master\" koiwai-san or from Shojou manga. \\n\\n\r\noverall 10: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and think that anyone who is looking for a lighthearted adorable anime should give this one a try. The show was so fun to watch, and I loved the \"cliche yet not\" take the creators took with this. The characters are so enjoyable, the plot is funny, and the overall enjoyment levels I get from this are well beyond a ten out of ten. I hope a second season is made, and if not I will be reading as much as I can from the manga.",

The drama is awesome, and funny amongst it's stupidity. Makabe just has me laughing episode after episode, and I just love Aki altogether.

Now, bear with me here.\r\nAlthough people dislike it around the last parts, this anime cant be denied how well crafted it was performed.\r\nBesides having the newest animations, music, and characters that resemble your anime favorites, this show ties together both HUMOR and drama in a way that is rarely shown.\r\nMy god, this anime's romance-struggle was a real cliff hanger, and it only gets better with the plot twist. Truly a fun and thought provoking anime about love.\r\nAlthough Masamune no Kun Revenge was done before the manga ended, and with itsstandard 12 episode series, this anime still holds a place in my heart for how satisfying it was to watch, even if it left us with a few questions.\\n\r\nI say, not every anime should be allowed to give us all we want. The other movie[ Byousoku 5 Centimeter] taught us that not all things in the real world get resolved. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime deserves to be watched. The enjoyment outweighs your stubborn flaws.",

My first impression was that I thought the main character was irritating but knowing he was influenced because of his past I continued on. Some of his lines and behavior about food and exercise were relatable. However I thought his revenge on his childhood friend was pointless, it felt like the story was iffy and dragging on although I had a feeling there's a reason why she became like that--which i'm itching for the revelation. Although some characters were interesting, out of all characters I don't like Aki not because out how she treats guysbut because of an assumption she made in a certain future episode which made it seem like the story should have ended there. There were few cliche fansevice moments and I think it wasn't necessary as it isn't that funny to see girls undergarments.\\n\\n\r\nStory is okay, but the motivation is stupid.\\n\r\nArt is mediocre for this century however the manga art is way better.\\n\\n\r\nSound is not bad nor amazing. That rise in the OP theme had a good feeling to it.\\n\\n\r\nThere were interesting characters. The loli mom bothers me.. is it even possible for someone not to grow old(by growing old I mean not looking like a child) from having 2 children. I'd root for Masamune to pick Neko, she seems fitting with her knowledge about nutrients and Masamune's obsession for fitness.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes were somewhat enjoyable and cringey at times.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I'd give it a six. I'd say the guy should have just forgotten about her, why go out of your way to exact revenge on someone who rejects you?  I gave it a chance to see if it was good but it isn't my cup of tea.",

The problem that some of you may dislikes may be due to the typical and cliche characters in the show, including male trap, loli with big boobs, loli mom, random girls flocking onto our MC for some reason, annoying Tsundere MC (well this one is alot more stubborn than those out there), girl who eat hella alot but still doesn't get fat, side character that lack a story or personality to go in depth with (making them look sorta likeweak and conveniently used character to move the plot forward, they just feels like an AI tbh) and so forth. Even so, the story make remind you of that anime where a fat girl get turn into a beauty just because she was on a diet, and 5 hot or cute men would flocks towards her, and try to at least get into a relationship with her. But the story is pretty original as far as i'm concerned, and that's what makes this anime interesting to watch. While trying to see what would happen in the very end of the story.\\n\\n\r\nAll the aside though, the music is incredible for an anime such as this, the art is substantially appealing and consistent; however, the drama and the development in the story of those dramatic moment or romances was done pretty crudely, or as if forced as well. But if you do truly enjoy watching this, then that's cool, I somewhat enjoy it as well. But not to the point where I could rewatch the entire thing, while knowing the writing structure, the plot and such.",

            "content": "Did you ever have thoughts of wanting to get revenge on the bullies you had in school? What if you planned what you were going to do since you were a very little child, working overly hard to become a very popular handsome/beautiful person to where the other person wouldn\u2019t recognize you? This is sort of the premise of this show and I have to say that I am a little disappointed. With how short the show is, we are barely given any information on what exactly happened to make our main character, Masamune, want to seek revenge outside the idea that she called hima \u2018Pig\u2019s Foot\u2019 because of his looks and weight when he was just a child. We are given a hint there is more to the story then what we are told but never given a answer to our question. Let\u2019s break down the show a little bit. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters seem to be rather typical in personality although it was sort of a nice change having our main character be more narcissistic. Masamune is mostly a one beat character, very obsessed with his looks and the revenge he wanted to exact on Aki. While he does show signs of being kind and caring, I found I had a hard time liking him. I myself was teased for my weight but his revenge plan seems as though it would be way too harsh for a woman. His plan was to make her fall in love with him, then ditch her. His plan doesn\u2019t even change when he finds that she doesn\u2019t trust any guy out there, he doesn\u2019t even question why she can\u2019t trust them. This goes again into my past and people trying to use me for things only to suddenly turn on me. Because of that, I\u2019m pretty annoyed when revenge is based on someone\u2019s emotions. As the anime went on, I did start to see his own charms but the show wasn\u2019t long enough for me to actually love him as a main character.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I did not like Masamune much, I had a similar feeling for Aki being a rather stuck up rich girl. There have been other stuck up rich girls in anime who\u2019s personality was similar to this tsundere princess but the anime didn\u2019t give me much reason to understand why she was like that. They spent so much time on Masamune and how he was trying to get revenge that when we got to a point that we were starting to understand Aki, we didn\u2019t have much time. It\u2019s only a 12 episode show and definitely did not have enough focus on who should have been our main female lead while other background characters seemed to get most of the screen time for their backgrounds. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good but very basic. If you look at any other anime that came out around the time this one did, you will find that came out in 2017 this year, it just looks very similar to every other show. Bright colors, clean lines, similar drawing styles for the faces and so on. I don\u2019t really have much to talk about with the animation; it\u2019s basically like any other Romantic Comedy. I do have to bring one thing up though, what is with making the best friend a girly looking guy in these sometimes? I kept looking at Masamune\u2019s best friend, Kojuro, and I kept asking myself if he was actually a guy. They designed him rather girly which I do understand is one of the jokes of the show, but did nothing for the plot. Maybe if they do a second season, we can understand him better but as it was, it was only a strange side thing that felt like fan service for yaoi fans.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is pretty good with most of the characters voiced by Funimations\u2019s super stars. Monica Rial has played characters in 27 other shows (as of this review and the list on Wiki) during 2017 and this was one of them. While I am glad she was acting as more of a supporting role to the two who should have been out mains, her delivery of her lines made Yoshino Koiwai sound more like a robot then a human which made me roll my eyes. Josh Grelle voiced Masamune and gave a rather good self centered delivery of lines and Morgan Garrett as Aki gave a good stuck up voice but as I couldn\u2019t feel for the characters as much as I wanted to because of their lack of drive, I found myself thinking they were pretty generic.\\n\\n\r\nSo what did I think of this show? Basic. It\u2019s good if you want to watch the present triumphs and fails of the characters but it definitely does not spend enough time giving any sort of background to them more makes you feel much for whom we should be rooting for. The anime is just way too short to give us any sort of ending (probably because the manga isn\u2019t even finished) nor does it give us enough time to understand exactly what happened between Masamune and Aki. With no second season that I have heard about coming in the near future, we are given an ending that says \u2018read the manga for the answer\u2019 and I have always hated that. Lots of manga based anime that do the whole read the manga ending don\u2019t actually have a manga that is easy to find translated or even outside of Japan. I searched forever for the Ghost Hunt manga to give me an ending and answers I wanted. If you're fine with open endings then it's okay to watch or if you're already a fan of the manga but if not, you would be better off reading the manga I think.",

            "content": "The premise of this anime was so intimate to me because I have been through the stage of \"being hated for your body and trying to change it\" except that I don't share the same objectif as Masamune. We have all been wanting to change for a reason, and we all think it's fun and good watching someone achieve their goals. Except that this anime failed MISERABLY in SO MANY LEVELS. Let's dig in the review.\r\nStory :\r\nMasamune is a boy who was overweight in his childhood, and got rejected by Adagaki Aki who rejects every single boy. He wants his revenge. He lose weight andcome as a handsome guy, wanting to make her fall in love with him and then break her heart. We all watch him climb the stairs slowly but surely. We even climb with him. But after episode 6 or 7, we fall to our face. And we keep on falling. You thought it ended there, nope, more falling for you, and in the last episode, you get a shot in the head. CONGRATULATIONS! \\n\r\nSeriously, the story takes another turn midway.\\n\r\n\"Let's add a rival to the MC\" they said, \"Let's make Adagaki's perspective change\" they said, \"It will be alright and fun\" they said. Well, the anime ended in a karaoke party, the MC wasn't even in the third stage of his plan. No resolution, nothing. We were left flat. I remember looking at the screen for two minutes after it ended. \"WAIT MAYBE IT'S A PROMISE FOR A 2ND SEASON?\" LIKE HELL I CARE! A SEASON SHOULD BE SATISFYING IN ITS OWN TO MAKE VIEWERS WANT TO WATCH THE 2ND ONE. IT'S NOT A DETECTIVE CONAN EPISODE.\\n\r\nArt 7/10 :\\n\r\nThe animation was fluid with some beautiful background sceneries, but nothing over the top or excelling. Easy on the eye.\\n\r\nSound 6/10 :\\n\r\nI always watch the opening once, if it's good (I'm looking at you Youjo Senki !) then I make sure to listen to some of it before skipping, but if it's not memorable, then SKIPPING is my BFF. That is the case. The OSTs are nothing memorable, too, they serve their purpose if nothing else.\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10 :\\n\r\nNo development. None at all. Shallow characters with almost no background story (except for Masamune). Also, can someone tell me the purpose of that Loli mom? IT'S SO EMBARRASSING SHE'S 1/3 THE CHARACTER'S HEIGHT. She's there just to cook and for comedic relief. \\n\r\nEnjoyment 5/10:\\n\r\nI looked forward to this series in the beginning, but since that downfall, I basically put it on hold until I had nothing else to do and finished it like a chore. Nonetheless, the comedy was somewhat acceptable.\\n\r\nOverall 6/10:\\n\r\n(It's literally 5.8). I'm hesitant to watch the 2nd season of this if they decided to do it because I don't want a poor ending again and a waste of my time, and, if your anime left this impression on the viewer then you know you failed somewhere.\\n",

Though our M protagonist and S princess are annoying as hell, there are some characters which is interesting too. Koiwai is the best (it.. it's not that I like inori minase or anything), her character are solid and heracting dumb is funny. I like neko as well, and she is not as mysterious as I think first, actually when progress with episodes I find that she is the most simplest and earnest character here.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all for the good parts, everything else are disaster. The story is quite promising at first, but sadly, the development is nowhere near fulfilling. The romantic and stupid events are all over the place, the main story itself is not progressing. There are no meaning of every single episode, it just show our masamune stupidity again and again. The S princess just like someone with brain damage and memory disorder, her behaviors are so random which is very annoying. To make it worse, instead of making the past events clear and show the result off this childish revenge, they decide to add half ass characters in the ending, which is neither interesting nor blend well with the story progression. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, this is not about revenge, it is just story of some random boy who pathetically chasing after beautiful girl with serious mental issues. For anyone who is interested in masochism and humiliation this anime will be entertaining. For me, I really regret finishing this pathetic comedy.\\n\\n",

            "content": "The problem with this anime is that it struggles to find it's own Identity. Is it a Comedy harem? A seinen romance? Or perhaps a psychological drama?! The anime had mixed and match sub genres that were in conflict with each other as  they did not, nor could not mixed without adverse affects.\r\nWithin this struggle are poorly developed characters that make no absolute sense, such as Fujinomiya - who represented the spontaneous insertion of harem as a sub genre. She and the characters were strangers and pretty much remained strangers by definition. Her backstory turned out to be anti-climatic, despite it having some potential,and frankly, her presence in the anime had no purpose, aside from trolling the audience. This redundancy with character traits and presence was a common sight in the anime.   \\n\\n\r\nIn fact all the characters can be summed up with one world - \"horrendous\". You had your basics set of Visual novel characters. The Himedere, the Kuudere, the sickly observer/lover, the energetic/popular girl, etc. That set up is fine if you get creative with it, but in this case nothing extra was added to their characteristics. Most anime modify these traits - for example a self-proclaimed rich girl who's father is actually bankrupt, or a cold-hearted girl who enjoys the company of domestic animals. In this anime we get all the default traits with the default back stories.\\n\\n\r\nThe concept was great, but where it fell short was it's execution. It could have went down any route, but it crippled it's outcome - by choosing to make a story more suited for a Romance/Drama - into a cheesy comedy with unimaginative scenarios, and completely redundant characteristics - that obviously have the intent to amplify the comedy, but fail to do so.  The story is honestly pathetic, with it taking short cuts to skip look dramatic build ups in exchange some progression. It's pretty much forced to since the comedy genre slows down progression and at times makes it stagnant .\\n\\n\r\nWhat personally ticked me off was the fact that whenever the opportunity to thicken the plot came around, they ruined it with a gag or just outright ignored it so they could progress onto a beach episode or school festival scene that just reiterated the same sections of the plot and character traits, such as the Main character's motives.\\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't that bad, nor are the special. The art is the sub standard 2 tone drawings with a bit of glow added in the few romance senses. It was simple with only basic creases outlined on characters and an environment that has minimal affects on the animation. I wasn't a fan of the over sized boobs, the clearly unrealistic uniform (which seemed to have no consistency) nor the comic comedy drawing style. The sound was decent - but again- nothing special. I liked the really audacious tune they played in sticky situations, but the rest again was sub standard and boring.\\n\\n\r\nOverall did I enjoy the anime? No. Will you? Most likely not.\\n\r\nAs a fan of comedy and an avid watcher of Romance anime, I can't advocate this to any anime veteran, considering how unoriginal it is. It seems like a nice starter for someone new to anime (If the understood Anime cliches and basic Japanese culture), but even then I can only imagine it putting them off anime or the romance genre. It's deceptive high school seems to be from it's heavy marketing (target at casual through something like Crunchy ads) and the appeal of it's synopsis (which likely has a few stubborn watchers on the defensive, as they wait for the plot to get better to tell the early sceptics \"I told you so!\")",

            "content": "I have huge expectation for this anime coz it\u2019s pretty popular, and the first 3 episodes are actually fun. But as episodes goes by, it gets very boring to watch.\r\nStory: 3/10\r\nThe story is centered around Makabe Masamune who is plotting to revenge against Adagaki Aki. That\u2019s it. No serious plot twist or anything. Truth to be told, I think the story would be much better if the main heroine is Fujinomiya Neko.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nIt\u2019s very good. Characters are beautifully drawn.  Backgrounds are lively as my backyard. Adagaki Aki is a candy to my eye. This is the only thing this anime could be proud of.\r\nSound:6/10\\n\r\nOP and ED songs actually fun to listen. But the background music in some scenes is almost nonexistent. Voice acting are also very plain. I think only Makabe\u2019s voice actor did a good job. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nThis one is too awful. A main character sucks. Masamune is an idiot. Adagaki is probably one of the worst tsundere I\u2019ve ever seen. Supporting cast doesn\u2019t do very well either. Not only that only fewer than 10 characters are introduced, all of them are very useless; with the exception of Fujinomiya Neko. For me, she is the best character in the series. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nDespite having an awful story and character development, this anime is quite enjoyable. Fan service are great in my opinion. Gags are sometimes fun. And the romance is sometimes sweet.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10\\n\r\nWasted potential. But still a joy to watch if a simple romcom is enough to make you happy.\\n",

            "content": "Warning: There are some spoilers in here. I tried to limit them but I feel like the quality of the show is best represented with this information being given out.\r\nMasamune-kun was the first show that I started this season. It was something my friend suggested and who knows it had the chance to be interesting so I started it. Luckily because I did so I decided to see what else was airing. In that process I found a lot of other shows that sounded good. So I started them! So thanks to Masamune-kun I was able to find a lot of good anime and watchit during the season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that is the last good thing I have to say about this horrible trainwreck of a show.\\n\\n\r\nThis show was always going to depend on how well they handled the premise. From the very first episode this show reminded me of another show. Take one guess what it is. It's Nisekoi. Of course it's Nisekoi. Now for me then this was a cautionary tale. Why? Because I fucking loathe Nisekoi. There was hope that this show could be good, that it could use its premise and be able to execute it well giving an emotional and interesting rom-com that takes on revenge, and what happens when someone tries to get it but must contend with their feelings. But there was also fear. Fear that it'd end up like Nisekoi. A show that despite an interesting premise decided to screw it up through the usage of filler, unlikeable characters, and just general bad writing BS.\\n\\n\r\nSadly it basically went straight into my worst fears. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every part about Masamune-kun is just a worst version of Nisekoi. The play finale? Copied from Nisekoi. Sickly girl who shows up in the middle of the series to add tension to the relationship? Copied from Nisekoi. Annoying side-characters who fight the MC because he's not good enough for the main girl? Copied from Nisekoi. Main Female Character who is a cold tsundere? Copied from Nisekoi. Shitty Writing? Copied from Nisekoi. It's almost as if this show was trying so hard to be Nisekoi instead of trying to be itself. Copying a show is bad enough, but copying a miserable mistake for a show like Nisekoi? WHAT COULD GO WRONG!\\n\\n\r\nTo be fair Masamune-kun did write Neko better than Nisekoi did Marika, and Aki is nowhere near as bad as Chitoge, but still it copies the same exact problems as Nisekoi. These weren't good ideas to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there's fake Masamune-kun.. Due to the length of the show his addition was pointless from the start. Why add on a character just to have him as a rival for 3 episode, it's pointless. Furthermore, he's not exactly a good rival. The only reason why he does well is because Aki thinks that he is Masamune. Which reminds me of the convoluted plot behind all of this. Which happened to NOT BE REVEALED. If you're going to have some important plot point like that at least do the service of actually telling the audience once it's over. Because it's pretty dang important to how the series works and why the characters act like they do. The fact that they left that as a gaping black hole is criminally bad writing.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily I can tell you this, the idea is stupid. It only helps make the show a more convoluted mess. Not that it needed any help in that.\\n\\n\r\nHave I mentioned Aki's friends yet? I absolutely loathe characters who act like moral guardians for others. They aren't in charge of Aki and they have to deal with that. Seeing them get enduced into rage because Aki dare might be with a man is infuriating. Even worse it adds nothing to the show. So it's just there, making me this much more pissed at this crap while adding absolutely nothing to the show. They're overall a small part of the show since they only matter in the last 3 episodes and even at that they barely matter but they're that detrimental to my enjoyment that I have to point them out.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part of this isn't the characters themselves. It's that none of this needed to happen. Neko and Fake Masamune are unnecessary bloatware. They are solutions in need of a problem. They're supposed to serve as reasons for Masamune to strive to go forward and to block his path. To give him challenges.\\n\\n\r\nBut he never needed any challenge. In fact the challenge itself should have been dealing with his feelings while also dealing with revenge. IT's clear the author wanted Masamune to like Aki and for him to end up with Aki. And that is fine. That works. But the problem is the whole series is set up with this craving for revenge in the background, but it never happens. The issues were all right there from the start. Aki has to deal with her feelings but also deal with her hurt feelings from prior. Masamune would have to deal with his revenge but also his growing love. The opportunity to make a great romcom was sitting right there, lying in the premise. They could have both hurt each other find out that they really did love each other and then try to grow from the misdeeds that they did in the past. That would be been amazing. \\n\\n\r\nBut sadly we didn't get anything like that. We didn't get any revenge, or any closure, or even anything resembling a cohesive story. Instead, the revenge got delayed farther and farther while time got wasted on Neko and Fake Masamune. And we didn't even get a complete ending or even something resembling an ending in the end.\\n\\n\r\n... I was always afraid of this show becoming Nisekoi II. I thought that Aki with her Chitoge like traits would become the new show ruiner for me, but surprisingly Aki was fine. I still dislike her but it's not her fault for ruining this show. Instead, it's the author's' for adding in all these terrible ideas stolen from a terrible show. I never thought this show would be just as bad as Nisekoi, no matter how much I feared it. But it was. \\n\\n\r\n2/10 \\n\\n\r\n(At least Kojuurou was cute.)",

            "content": "No spoilers in this review, pls send feedback if you have any.\r\nMasamune-kun's Revenge is about one fat boy's dream to make his childhood crush, who rejected his feelings, fall in love with him so he can shut her down faster than you can say \"What the fuck am I watching?\"\r\nSo what does he do to make his dream a reality? He works out, eats healthy, reads a shit tonne of romance manga. After years of \"training\", he becomes the narcissistic sex machine that we know as Masamune Makabe. (Note: no one in this anime has or will have sex throughout the show. Don't get yourhopes up ecchi fans)\\n\\n\r\nBut what has become of the childhood crush? Aki Adagaki has made herself an infamous name at her high school. Dubbed \"The Cruel Princess\", (or as I like to call her \"Mega Bitch\") she has had many men follow after Masamune's footsteps, hoping to score a date with the beautiful Adagaki. Instead of accepting any of them, she rejects each and everyone one by giving them all a cruel nickname, ruining their fragile reputation.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's the show. An interesting premise and two interesting main characters. So where did this all go so wrong? Let's start with the title of the show. When someone's love confession gets rejected, they usually give up. Maybe they'll try again, but if it proves futile then they will give up eventually. Not Masamune. How dare a girl say she doesn't like him. Sure, she could have said it in a nicer way, but a rejection is a rejection. Instead of letting it go like a certain snow queen, he dedicates his life to his revenge. And for what? If he manages to pull it off, the only person really getting hurt is him. His hard earned reputation as the popular ladykiller crumbles as his classmates will only see him as the new school heartbreaker. Adagaki would, in fact, benefit from this revenge, as it would most probably snap her out of her #HateAllMen phase and allow her to actually get herself a good boyfriend. The consequences are so one sided that you wonder if Masamune accidentally lost more than just his belly fat.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the show is so cliche and predictable, you could remove the revenge theme and turn it into your every day generic harem anime. There is no surprise, no suspense to actually keep you interested. Almost every plot twist does absolutely nothing to change how the anime is progressing. We get a new character, they try and mess up Masamune-kun's Revenge, they fail and become dust in the wind, never to be relevant again.\\n\\n\r\nSo, how can I describe the main character? Well, he's an idiot. Masamune's only way of getting Adagaki to swoon is to repeat what he has seen done in manga. A cliche pick up line and a wall slam is what he believes are appropriate ways of getting women to fall for him. And when a girl actually does like him and tries to ask him out, he rejects them. Why? Cause he's already in a commitment with his revenge. Fuck meaningful relationships and a normal high school life, he'd rather try and break one girl's heart then spend the rest of his life happy with virtually anyone else in the freaking school.\\n\\n\r\nAdagaki ain't any better. I cannot for the life of me figure out why such an obvious asshole is so popular and has so many people continuously try asking her out. After the first few guys, you would think the school would take a hint and avoid her, but instead, they put her on a high horse and make her the centre of the universe.\\n\\n\r\nNone of the other characters have anything to offer to the show. Shallow and stereotypical, they rely on overreactions to fool viewers into thinking that they have a decent personality.  Even the character development is teased at best. All the focus is on the narcissist and the bitch, (even though they stay virtually the same throughout the whole series) every other character could be thrown away and replaced and no one would care. Sometimes you see a glimpse of something more than just a background character, but it never gets expanded on and ends up forgotten.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing I enjoyed from this dreadful experience is the comedy. I'm a sucker for overreactions, and it's the only thing keeping it from being a 1. Instead of the comedy being a plus, it becomes the single thread that this show hangs on, desperately trying to convince you that it has more to offer, even though it never delivers.\\n\\n\r\nWhat started off as a great first episode filled with potential, crashed and burned harder than Masamune whenever he hears the name \"Pig's foot\". Watch it if you are a masochist, avoid if you have good taste.",

            "content": "TL;DR: A very good romance anime, highly recommended.\r\nThis anime is qualified as a 'harem' on myanimelist. Please do not be mislead as this is in fact nothing of the sort. Masamune-kun no revenge is a romantic comedy at best, and even then has the decency to take it's 'Romcom' moments somewhat seriously, where these moments actually have an impact on progression, and it isn't just dropped like in other anime.\r\nThe 'harem' in actuality consists of only two girls [SPOILER] one of which even removes herself from the love triangle in the end, leaving the romance we all want. [END SPOILER]\r\nBy taking this approach, with it'sunique plot of revenge for his mistreatment, Masamune-kun's revenge definitely strikes as something out of the ordinary for School Life anime. There is actual romance, good progression in terms of story elements, setting itself up as a very good romance anime from the mediocre harem that I was expecting before I watched it.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people seemed ticked off by the ending of this show, but it is to keep in mind that is anime is almost identical to it's manga and as such has teased a second season already, with the next plot in mind. Overall, I had a lot of fun watching this, and is in the end a lighthearted anime that has a pretty good spin on romance for what it is. \\n",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge is the latest entry in the romantic comedy genre and, looking at it from the outside, seems fairly promising, because Masamune-kun gives our protagonist an actual objective. Personally, after watching the first episode, I had quite a bit of hope. The comedic parts of the episode were genuinely funny, and potential of a dramatic and romantic story between our two main characters got me excited to see how the show would play out. Unfortunately, the show completely squandered any potential the early episodes had, and by the end of the shows twelve episode run, we were left with a product that isless than mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nMost romcom anime follow a similar story structure broken up into three distinctive parts. The beginning of these anime normally starts with introducing the main couple and start to develop the dramatic storyline between them that will later take center stage at the end of the series. The anime then starts introducing the rest of the harem and other side characters episode by episode to fill out the cast. The middle is generally focused on trivial events (looking at you, beach episodes) that \u201cfurther\u201d the relationships between our characters along with the plotlines of our side characters. Finally, the end of the average romcom has a dramatic arc between the main characters who work through their problems to get to a happily ever after. Masamune-kun nails the beginning and sets itself up to be one of the most popular and talked about shows of the season, dips significantly in the middle, and completely skips any kind of resolution.\\n\\n\r\nBefore I get into why this show was such a failure, let me first sing this shows praises. Masamune-kun has, in my opinion, a fantastic concept for a romcom and executes that concept well. The idea of having a fat and spoiled kid get rejected by his crush and taking that rejection so poorly that he devotes his life to emotionally hurting that person as much as it hurt him is comedy gold. Not only is this absolutely hilarious, but it gives our main character a goal to strive for. After the first episode, I genuinely liked Masamune's character and was already rooting for him to take down his childhood crush, Adagaki, and it came as a severe disappoint when I realized the show never planned on having Masamune take his revenge on her, but rather force them together as a couple. Adagaki\u2019s character is unredeemable as soon as the anime starts. She is immediately portrayed as someone who is cruel and deeply hurts people emotionally while not having any regard for their feelings. There is no way to redeem this character without it feeling forced, and when they do try to change her, it feels just that, forced. I had still had some hope that Masamune-kun could work around this major problem at first, but instead of trying to climb out of the hole it put itself in, it only dug itself deeper as the show progressed.\\n\\n\r\nThe beginning of Masamune-kun was a bit of a rocky start, but it was still solid overall. I cannot say the same for the rest of the anime. The side characters in Masamune-kun are\u2026 pretty terrible. I want to take a look at the only other characters with any real relevance to the plot besides Masamune and Adagaki, Fujinomiya and Gasou. Fujinomiya fills the role of the last piece of the main love triangle and is the only member of Masamune\u2019s harem, other than Adagaki, to receive any significant amount of screen time and an actual story. She is a generic sickly girl with very little personality, but she is a nice person, unlike Adagaki, and seems to have a real reason for being in love with Masamune\u2026 but she doesn't. The reason she loves Masamune could have been anything, and she would have easily had a more compelling relationship with Masamune than Adagaki, but her reasoning is LITERALLY NOTHING. She only falls for Masamune because she wanted to \"experience love\". As soon as her motivations were revealed I immediately lost any interest in her character along with any interest I still had for the show. To put salt in the wound, right after her story, Masamune-kun introduces the main antagonist, Gasou, who has a terrible and trivial motivation for why he wants to break apart the relationship between Masamune and Adagaki, and it makes his character feel irrelevant. Masamune-kun attempts to pull these motivations for Fujinomiya and Gasou off as jokes, but rather than coming across as comedic, it just feels like awful writing.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending to Masamune-kun is nonexistent and, similarly to the plotlines of Fujinomiya and Gasou, ends with no resolution. During the entire show, the viewer is waiting to see the confrontation between Masamune and Adagaki when their past finally comes to light in hopes of giving a legitimate reason for Adagaki\u2019s actions to possibly redeem her character. We are never given that. We are never given anything close to that. We are given nothing at all. The manga is still ongoing, so it is understandable that the studio wants to leave an open ending for there to be another season down the road, but there is a difference between an open ending and no ending at all. Masamune-kun left us with absolutely nothing and I struggle to think of a worse ending than that.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun was a letdown. It had a good premise and started it off well, but it slipped so far out of reach by the end, having some of the worst writing I\u2019ve seen in a long time. Should you watch Masamune-kun no Revenge? No. You should read the synopsis, have a quick chuckle, and move on with your life.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge, also known as Masamune-kun's Revenge, is an anime that focuses around our protagonist named Makabe Masamune and his attempts to win Adagaki Aki's heart with the intent on rejecting her once she's fallen for him, hence the title being \"Masamune-kun's Revenge\".  \r\nNow yes, our protagonist does have the intent of crushing a girl's heart but he has reasoning behind his actions.  In the past Makabe Masamune has been hurt by Adagaki Aki when they were children and he works towards winning her over now that they are older by being muscular, handsome, studious, and everything you'd want in a guy.He and Adagaki Aki's maid, Koiwai Yoshino, believe that Adagaki Aki thinks too highly of herself and needs a taste of her own medicine.\\n\\n\r\nNow that the summary is over lets break down this review into sections for you:\\n\\n\r\nStory  -  The plot of Masamune-kun no Revenge is quite original in my opinion, however I do believe it could have been executed better in many areas.  This anime does have the occasional clich\u00e9s you'd expect to see in a romance comedy and some areas of the story have been seen and done before, but that being said it doesn't mean this anime was bad.  I found the plot to be interesting as well somewhat unique and I did enjoy watching the characters interact with each other and develop the story further, the only downside was that this anime ended a bit abruptly and leaves the viewer wanting more because the story didn't feel finished.\\n\\n\r\nArt  -  The art style for this anime was very pleasant and easy to look at, characters were well drawn and animation wasn't choppy, and the backgrounds were well executed.  All in all, there was nothing in particular wrong with this anime visually.\\n\\n\r\nSound  -  The audio present in Masamune-kun no Revenge revealed no issues.  Voice acting was well done and both the opening and ending song were catchy and pleasant to listen to.  Background music blended in well with scenes and conveyed the feel and mood of what was going on as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters  -  Characters for the most part were very diverse design wise and thought out well too.  Even though the characters were planned on being unique, they did have many clich\u00e9 personalities stuck onto them.  This wasn't too much of an issue though because although they can be labeled for what the base of their personality is, the creator did also give characters quirks about them that still made them appealing to the viewer.  For the most part most characters were likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment  -  After finishing this anime and looking back on it, I can say that I have enjoyed it and had no hesitation to keep watching nor did I feel bored with it, in fact I looked forward to finishing it.  The only major issue I have with this anime is how it ended.  The ending deserved more or at least a season two because the story feels incomplete.  Around halfway through the anime it seemed as though the story was making lots of progress at a good pace, but it never did reach it's potential.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Masamune-kun no Revenge was interesting to watch due to its unique plot for its genre and the fact that it stayed being somewhat original throughout the season.  If you enjoy romance anime I would suggest watching this, however do keep in mind that this anime does end leaving many with the feeling that more should have happened, but don't let that deter you because in the end Masamune-kun no Revenge was an interesting anime and I do hope for a season two so I can continue to watch this story go on and I'm sure after watching this you will probably be left with similar feelings.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoy the anime if you plan on watching it, and thank you for reading!",

            "content": "Masamune's Revenge could have been great. It's just... filled with so much \"filler\". It can't seem to stick to it's story. \r\nStory:\r\nThe concept is actually really good in my opinion. A mysterious past about getting rejected, and coming back to take \"revenge\"? And then it is hinted that it was all a misunderstanding? \r\nThe romance is MUCH different from shows like Nisekoi. The romance is meant to be forced, and that isn't what you really watch it for. This guy doesn't love Adagaki Aki, so the romance is meant to feel off.\r\nThe mystery element is a huge part of why I liked this anime. Itis not clear what happened in the past, and new characters are introduced from the past. The small, vague flashbacks are the best parts of the anime in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art... was not good. I mean, the art style itself wasn't too bad, but the animation was rather subpar.\\n\\n\r\nNow, is that bad? No. It's a story/character driven anime, not an action anme like Fate/Zero. If you want good animation in a romance, I would recommend Oreshura. However, it is not needed here. The animation is okay, and does not positively or negatively affect my viewing experience.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked the opening. Many say its rather \"cliche\", but I found it fine. A lot of anime have this type of 'energetic girl singing\" thing, and for good reason. It has been proven to sound good. 7/10 (Also, some say the opening has a lot of spoilers, but as someone who has never read the manga, all of the images are taken out of context, so in reality its not really spoiling anything.)\\n\\n\r\nThe ending was... okay? It wasn't particularly good or bad. Okay music, okay animation etc. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nThe OST was also subpar. Not something I would listen to on my own, but didn't destroy the mood or anything. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nEvery character had some sort of mystery behind them, which was really interesting in my opinion. I found all of the characters very likable, and only one or two characters were particularly irritating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the shit out of this anime. However, some of it is nostalgia and the parellels between this anime and SNAFU were real. I really liked SNAFU, and one of the elements that it included was the \"mysterious past\" that dragged me in. However, this was a personal taste kind of thing, so although I really enjoyed this anime, I gave it a lower score.\\n\\n\r\nSo, without spoilers... the ending was shit. No way around it. It's a manga, so it continues further.\\n",

Nope. \r\nIn the beginning, the story is clearly defined as a person trying to achieve revenge on a girl named Adagaki Aki. As the story progressed, there are instances where Masamune starts to think whether he should continue on with his plan or not. If a person keeps going back and forth on whether to do it or not, they should be more decisive, otherwise, it doesn't progress forward.\r\nThe execution of how the story goes, and especially how it ended, is extremely bad.\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nThe art is pretty good.

The plot, if ever was one, rapidly fades through the first episodes.\r\nYou'll say to yourself 'what the frick are this characters doing and are we even going anywhere?' And the obvious answer is no.\r\nWe're in mid series and the main characters fail to accomplish absolutely anything plot, development, romance wise, you nameit! they're in a constant rope pulling kind of relationship that takes the series nowhere. After that, a filler episode. Yes, you read that well.\\n\r\nKnowing this, the story is a solid 6/10.  I gave it some points, since we have never seen a protagonist get \"jacked\" for \"revenge\"(he's actually skinny as fried potatoe; revenge was just a word they used to try to give this series some drama)\\n\\n\r\nThe art man, don't even get me started on that one. The drawings of the faces are so inconsistent, that the lead female will look like Adagaki aki, and in the next frame like a deformed teletubbie that doesn't know where to point it's eyes.\\n\r\nThis anime makes Dragon Ball Super look like a gibli movie. That all you need to know, seriously.\\n\r\nI call this 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' art style. And it happens to all the characters! Everytime! So it's a constant remainder of 'what i'm doing with my life?'.. 'end my suffering onegai shimasu.'\\n\r\nArt is a stone carved 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThe backgrounds are as generic as they can be, you have your 'generic walking to school background', 'generic classroom', 'generic school hallway' and your 'generic classmate characters'. I include everyone aside from Masamune and Aki, as part of the background because they don't add anything to the non existing plot, they produce the most basic, empty and superficial conversations with our childhood-traumatized main character. They're like NPCs but with brain damage.\\n\r\nThey simply exist to fill the empty spaces of your generic backgroud. Do not expect anything more from this 5/10 mediocre characters.\\n\\n\r\nComedy? Haha nice one. Violence, failed approach attemps, rage, screams, life threats, blackmail are the tools that this series tries to convey as humor, through poor character interactions. Is either this or nothing, because you already know that dialogue wise, this series has nothing to offer, so the poor anime team had to make them all agressive, because nonsence violence is funny right? right?...\\n\r\nTake it for 12 stiff episodes or leave it.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Kun no Revenge is a big eyed hunchback teletubbies anime. It won't transmite you any feelings, you won't care about the characters. As someone who followed the manga and ended up very disappointed with the anime, i advise you not to watch it. Search in your 'plan to watch' list and you'll find something better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5.",

            "content": "First things first. My \"reviews\" system is explained on a blog entry. Which can be found through my profile.\r\n------\r\n\u2726Story\r\nA cute little harem Anime with odd goals. What made this a bit more unique than most of the this type of Anime, the characters were a bit more \"real\" on top of having stereotype.\r\nAside that I seriously cannot mention much, would be spoiler. But mostly it's daily high school life with minimal drama and a bit of cute romance. Also how lot of things were oddly shadowed and hidden, made the story element a bit annoying, but at the same time kinda real. Which isn't exactlya good thing, but in this Anime I did end up enjoying it quite a lot. I'll talk about it in character section a bit more.\\n\\n\r\nLong story short, it's a harem school life Anime that has a touch of oddness and \"realism\" in a sense. But sadly it's one of those Anime where you have to read the source material if you want to know how it all will end, as this was pretty much prelude of possible drama and romance that could be. So story wise this Anime did not wrap up anything pretty much, but it gave fair amount initial love/hate towards the characters and the premise.\\n\\n\r\nI probably forgot to add something....\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Art & Sound\\n\r\nGood enough, nothing special. Pretty basic, but pretty fitting.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Characters\\n\r\nWell in short, type of Anime where I dislike every character for certain reasons but as well like them for certain reasons.\\n\\n\r\nAside having stereotypes, this anime had a lot of double facades behind each character actions and feelings. Which did quite annoy me as I dislike lies to others and self. Justifying lies in the end just hurts someone, so no matter what lies they still are something I hate and in this Anime pretty much the whole cast had their past and reasons which added lot of facades and lies to their growth. For sake of changing on not having similar experiences, they decided to create false personas. \\n\\n\r\nOur main girl, I would say she is stereotypical tsundere, but she feels more of a just selfish b****, but the at same time she really has adorable cute side. But her own self-consciousness and past that kinda created her face of hatred/evilbeing. But her development slowly being true and cute as she is, is probably the endgame of this series.\\n\\n\r\nMain guy is as well someone with past they didn't like, but for some reason he ended up growing kinda superficial as people who he had to deal with in the past. But in comedic value his narcissism, ego facade he created, was actually entertaining and as well slowly the mask was torn off.\\n\\n\r\nIn-between I'm going to mention, that every character has basically layer or two stupid facades because of their past and for some reason the need to lie to others and self. (feelings as well) is the whole plot of this series.\\n\\n\r\nThem we have ojou-sama'esque girl who has \"good ojou-sama\" type of a facade with a little naughty and teasing character, but again. Kinda disliked her at the start for the trying to steal the guy with \"?\" reasons. But again... her background seems actually not be at all what I felt at start. (but damn, I love her \"dress sense\", if you know what I mean). Her teasing, soothing and naughty personality made her one of the favorite characters in this series.\\n\\n\r\nMoral of the story, I have something to say about pretty much every character. That is how much they did interest me. But they all have similar pattern, development, which is nice. But I do want to know how all of them will end up. And sadly.. for that you will have to check out the source material.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI had mixed feelings and wanted to give it 6, but somehow growing in the characters and having semi like/dislike feelings towards em, made me somehow want to praise this Anime. But indeed, it doesn't really wrap up anything and is simply one of those Anime where in the end it simply staples a paper in your face that says \"read the manga\".\\n\\n\r\nAlso the whole lies thing, having facades makes me relate it to reality too much which I absolutely hate. In both ways. Lies, facades for sake of \"image\" or for sake of \"not hurting someone\" or for sake of \"getting something/someone\" is just ugly business. Manipulation and lies.... never understood them nor ever thought in such process. Thus why I end up getting burnt as I cannot comprehend/see through lies, facades and using people.\\n\\n\r\nSo that wise, this Anime was kinda uncomfortable and angering? But at the same times as Anime always, such things are taken to more extremes and idealized, which kinda makes it comedic or even as it did, cute. And that is why I said its stereotypes + kinda \"realism\" . But more precise would probably be stereotypes + facades.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum it up, I can't say it's bad Anime nor amazing. Maybe even 7 is too much. But I did seriously feel like praising it a bit more. And it did interest me enough to actually add manga to \"plan to read\". So yeah, I did enjoy this binge watch.\\n\\n",

            "content": "If one doesn't know the manga's development of what happens after the anime ending, it is understandable why many people are left with a sour taste in one's mouth.\r\nTLDR:\r\nIf you don't like content that's not complete, or has little to no content for future sequels, DO NOT WATCH THIS. You will be extremely disappointed. However if you don't mind waiting for how the situation is currently resolved in the manga, give this a try.\r\n*obvious spoilers ahead*\r\nStory (7):\r\nThe rating of a 7 given to the anime is extremely generous and could have been much worse. My rating is perhaps affected by my knowledge of what happensafter the anime ending, which resolves a lot of the complications left unanswered at the end of the anime ending. The story is a typical ROM-COM with a slight twist to it, where a previously chubby boy, turned hunk, is trying to get revenge on a girl who rejects him. People who didn't read the manga will not understand what truly happened *wink wink* and the story created by the mangaka is decent. However, I must agree that the studio's aim to have an open-ended ending is somewhat naive, considering there is not enough manga chapters to develop a full season 2. If one was to take the anime at face value, without looking forward to how the complications in the manga, I would have given the story a far worse rating.\\n\\n\r\nArt(7):\\n\r\nJust the typical art standards. Nothing much to evaluate.\\n\\n\r\nSound (6):\\n\r\nThe OP and ED are not the most memorable, but still enjoyable to listen to. I usually only listen to the really good and catchy OP and ED's. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter(7):\\n\r\nAll the character analysis is just analysed based on the anime, and not the further development in the manga.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Makabe is just your typical high-school hot-looking dude, with some slight distinctions from the generic character. He is nothing that special. \\n\r\nAdagaki Aki is your rich, spoiled girl, who many may consider as the typical \"tsundere\".\\n\r\nFujinomiya, Neko is an interesting character, and even the MC himself wants to fall in love with her. The problem is that apparently Neko is not \"serious\" about falling in love, and rather wanted to just \"try falling in love\". Also, there wasn't a large development of her relationship with Masamune, except a brief insight that they knew each other when they were extremely young (just like Adagaki Aki).\\n\r\nYoshino ironically also is an interesting character, because she is extremely elusive. It is extremely hard to evaluate her without talking about the manga, because the manga has GODDAMN good development about what happened 8 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime itself has your standard characters, and their standard developments, but the manga itself is where we see the true nature of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (6):\\n\r\nWatching this anime was sometimes extremely boring because of \"filler content\". One good example is Episode 12, where they spent half the episode for karaoke. It was not that I didn't like it, it's just that it felt like it was just put in there to pad run time. There are many other scenes that pad the run time, but this one was the most prominent. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (7):\\n\r\nIf one just evaluates the anime by itself, I can understand why the community has such intense dislike for this anime due to its open-ended ending. I too was disappointed at the end of the anime and it is heavily implied there will be a second season, or at least some OVAs to finish it off (considering how little content there is). It also seemed very naive for the studio to assume they can just start a second season, when the manga has barely anything to produce with. If anyone wants to know what happens after the anime ending, the manga so far has solved a lot of the complications, and perhaps it is why I didn't evaluate this anime as harshly because of the decent development in the manga. The manga is also being released irregularly, and the latest chapter has some weird \"cliffhanger\". Nevertheless, I would still give this anime a try and read the manga up to the latest chapter, because it resolves a lot of complications left unanswered in the anime. Even if there is a second season, I would not expect it until 2018 or 2019, because there is not enough close to enough content to adapt.\\n\\n",

            "content": "When I first added \"Masamune-kun no Revenge\" to my 2015 Winter lineup, I thought it would be an okay watch--something to pass the time. After a while of procrastinating and not going through with watching it, I took it off my list, as I thought it would be another stupid romcom show that would be okay, but have no depth. \r\nMan, am I grateful I decided to add it back on!\r\nStory - 8:\r\nAs the synopsis goes, \"Masamune-kun no Revenge\" is a tale about a rich, fat brat that fell in love with a beautiful girl when she saved him from bullies. However, once he confessedhis love, she cruelly rejected him, thus nicknaming him 'Pig's Foot.' Grown up, and now a hot guy with a muscly body, Masamune vows revenge on this girl. He will make her fall in love with him and then break her heart. But will things go according to plan? \\n\r\nThe plot is pretty solid. Intriguing and tells the whole story without spoiling the anime. It's what pulled me into the show. The story stays consistent throughout the entire anime, and it doesn't change focus, which I loved a lot. It was the focal point that kept me into the anime the whole time. Here's a warning, though. Some episodes have an extra scene after the ED, others do not. So watch out for this when watching!\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10:\\n\r\nThe art was absolutely fantastic. The characters, the background scenes, the filters, all exceptionally clear and pristine. The art of this show made me want to draw again. It was detailed without looking gaudy or too realistic. It was still cartoonish--anime, which was easy and appealing on the eyes. The color scheme was very warm and sunny, which made me very emotionally happy while watching it. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 7:\\n\r\nThe music was pretty good. Upbeat, and matched the show perfectly. The opening theme wasn't anything great in the beginning, but as I continued listening to it, I sang along. However, no one would be sad to just skip it. The ending theme was even more unmemorable, and didn't stick out too much. I found myself just skipping onto the next episode. The OSTs (Original Sound Tracks) seem very thought out, and are enjoyable to listen to within the scenes. Sometimes they almost sound very fairytale like. Always dramatic and quirky. They fit whatever scene they're placed into, and don't get very repetitive. However, it's easy to overlook their existence. \\n\r\nHere's a link to the OST if you wanna give it a listen: https://goo.gl/sAAR6F\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 7:\\n\r\nThe characters are pretty good. Nothing extraordinary, but definitely a good watch.\\n\r\nEnter Makabe Masamune: Former bullied fat kid, now reformed hottie. He appears narcissistic at points due to his insecurities. The audience can visibly see him struggle between being his real self and what he wants others to see. As the show is from his point of view, there's never a dull moment. Thankfully, he is one of those main characters that isn't bland and dull. \\n\r\nEnter Adagaki Aki: Renowned man hater. Anything else I have to say about you, you shouldn't hear until you watch the film. BUT! People, you can relax because she is not a stereotypical annoying tsundere. That is not all her character consists of, THANK GOD. \\n\r\nThe other characters shall remain a mystery, but they're good~ This anime has a whole range of interesting and unique characters. Some tropes, others not, but they're played off well.\\n\r\nNear the end of the series, a character is thrown in, and some developments are undergone that kind of shake up the show a little to where I had to take off a point, but it only affects the critical analysis of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9:\\n\r\nI had a kick out of this show! There were so many times where I was fangirling, laughing, and just having a blast. The comedy never stops, but it never gets overwhelming either. It filled me with such emotions of happiness, that I just couldn't get enough. If you want a light watch between your more serious series, I  suggest this one. Or if that's all you're looking for is a short, no commitment, funny series, come watch this one!\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8:\\n\r\nThe breakdown is really an 8.2 if you wanna get technical, but MAL only lets you round up or down. This anime deserves an 8 because it is very good, and does a magnificent job of not going off topic like others shows with such a limited episode count. Very good watch~ Soooo check it out!\\n\\n\r\nAnd if you have any further questions on this review, you know where the message button is c:",

            "content": "This is my first review :)\r\nMasamune-Kun no Revenge, what kind of show is this? Lets see.\r\nStory 8/10 : Basically in Masamune-Kun no Revenge we have our main protagonist Masamune Makabe, and this guy has a very unusual past. Eight years ago from the time where the story takes place our buddy Masamune used to be a fat loser. He was always getting bullied and called a pig. Without spoiling anything he meets a female named Adagaki Aki. Long story short he had a certain event happen to him to make him hate Adagaki. Then he proceeds to develop a sexy body and is no longera loser, and using this body he plans to get Adagaki to love him and then destroy her feelings as revenge (hence the name of the show ). The story seems like it would be goofy and stupid but it is suprisingly enjoyable. ( if you feel like the story wasnt full enough, read the manga to get a better sense of whats going on )\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound 7/10 : The art in this show in my opinion was very good. The character designs were very beautiful and none of the characters had overly large boobs or wierd features. However ther were no moments i can recall with gorgeous backgrounds or noticable things like that ( thats why I have art at 8 instead of a 9 ). The sound was pretty unnoticable  and I guess the opening was not that bad but I usually skipped it. The voice actors all did a good job and none of the characters had annoying voices. So overall the sound was good but forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8/10 : I believe the characters in this anime were the determining factor in if you like it or not. Adagaki ( the heroine ) is a really big asshole to everyone around her for certain reasons in her past and you can never really tell what she is thinking because she is very unpredictable in her actions. If her character sounds interesting to you it will greatly increase your enjoyment of the show. Masamune ( the MC ) is very different from Adakagi but similar at the same time. He is very popular and nice to everyone but all of the things he does are a part of his plan to become a \" hot guy \" so its kind of all a lie. He also has his master plan to get revenge which makes you think he is even more of an asshole deep down. The support characters in this show are all likable but kind of forgettable in my opinion because of how focused I was on Adakagi and Masamune's relationship. There is also a love triangle in the middle of the show, however I still could tell which girl he would choose. The characters are very unpredictable in this show and the main two develop nicely so thats why I give the characers an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6.5/10 : After all of the good things I said about this show you were probably expecting a higher score here but that is not the case for two main reasons. The backstory of Masamune and Adagaki is revealed very slowly throughout the show. The other reason is that the ending was garbage  and unsatisfying but I guess that is a little bit unfair because I believe the show is eventually getting a second season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 : In conclusion this is a decent anime to watch if you are simply looking for new animes in the genre because like me you seem to have seen everything else. It has its cute moments and the story is pretty good and unique. Another thing about this show was that the pacing was very good as even though there is only 12 episodes, I felt like it was longer which was a bonus for me. I also realized that this anime did not really seem like a harem but I know why it is in that genre from the manga. The ecchi tag is also on a barely needed level as there was next to no ecchi it seemed to me at least.\\n\\n\r\nI feel I had to add this part at the end. I highly recommend that you watch this anime and then read the manga afterwards. It goes more into detail on the story and it is ongoing as well so it continues after the anime ending. I give this anime a 7/10 but i would give the manga an 8.5.\\n\\n\r\nThis was my first review.",

            "content": "Minor spoilers ahead\r\nLet me start off by saying that this anime had a promising premise, but the way the anime progresses and executed feels way to forced and rushed and produced one of the worst 'harem' anime. \r\nStory---5\r\nI will admit, the first 5 episodes show that this anime might be promising. but later on I feel like Masamune forgets about the so called 'revenge' plan and Aki who is ruthless and will never date or fall for a man spontaneously having a crush on Masamune over some cliche.  The worst thing is when 'he' (you know who I am talking about) comes towards theend and let me say that he is the most random character I have ever seen popping out in a anime in a very long time. \\n\\n\r\nArt--5\\n\\n\r\nThe art is mediocre, nothing special and it does not really stand out. It feels rushed at some parts and I can tell that there is a low budget later on towards the end.\\n\\n\r\nSound--7\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly, I really liked the OST in the anime, and somehow it stands out for me when compared to other anime under the romance or harem category. The op gets a bit annoying after a few episodes but I never got sick of the two ending songs. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter--3 \\n\\n\r\nThere is almost no character development except for one episode (episode 8) which is the only episode which actually surprised me for a increase in quality in terms of writing. Other than that, there is no 'in-depth' character development and I feel like the characters are forced to interact with each other or they all seem aware about the revenge plan, maybe it is just me. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment-6\\n\\n\r\nIt has a old, traditional anime vibe and feel from the 90's for some reason, which made me feel excited and can't wait a week for a new episode to be released. However, I lost interest in the last few episodes, especially the final episode which felt like a slap to my face and a manifestation of a headache. The last few episodes were really cringe. \\n\\n\r\nOverall--4 \\n\\n\r\nI must say, I was rather disappointed that the anime ended like that, especially how the series ends with a karaoke night which was filler. What really pissed me off what 'fake Masamune' is forgiven by Aki almost immediately like as if nothing happened, it is as if she is blind after her backlash in the previous episode. \\n\r\nThe anime is decent and what hurts is that Masamune kun no Revenge had high potential.",

Of course, I also experienced the same thing. But in my opinion, it's just a trick that Masamune-kun no revenge is awaited by the audience. Overall, I do not really know about genree like harem in detail. but I think, it's been good and not overdone.\r\n2) Sounds and Character: 7\r\nFor the use of sound and character is good enough. Many people say that the main character was boring, too panicked. But I think the author is already set it pretty well.\r\n3) Enjoyment:8\\n\r\nI especially enjoyed the anime and even I'm still curious about the continuation of the first season\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7-7.5\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gives the good enough impression. The storyline is difficult to guess, make us all wonder would it goes. In each character Also has different characteristics increase the uniqueness of this anime. But, in my opinion. there is little that needs to be improved. The appearance of the characters that Appear Suddenly like Neko and lack of comedy in the anime. So, I Gave a rating of 7 for this anime\\n\\n\r\n(PS: This is my first review, It's just my opinion and please don't get mad)\\n",

            "content": "Masamune-kun No Revenge, nice title, but, very disappointing, when you have something like this where it can be called as a Chicken running around with it's head cut-off, right now, I feel like going to Japan, hunt down the staffs who thought about making this into an anime and give each and one of them a whack on their heads , so before I get even pissed, here are my fucking ratings for this anime:\r\nPathetic 1. Story\r\nStorywise, it was good on the first few episode before the arrival of Neko, but things turned messy upon her arrival, let's not forget that the story plot reliesupon Masamune getting even with Aki, but what we see next , was his foolishness of not pushing through with it and often stopping midway despite of the opportunities , situations and even with Yoshino's help, that alone was a 360 degree turn around was a turn off for me.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7. Art\\n\\n\r\nOk, so there isn't much about the art, but what makes me give it a 7 was for Yoshino and Midori's panchira, ya know it's kinda disappointing, that Yoshino is the only one who has the most panchira here, I mean, no Tae, Aki, Mari, kiba and Kaneko panchira moment? Also, there is Shuri Kojuro, he....or she is a mystery in fact I'm thinking that he is a she, but that's on the next category.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVery Good 8. Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe score is for the closing theme \"Elemental World\" which pretty much fits in for this anime's ending.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3. Characters\\n\\n\r\nMy pet peeves about the characters:\\n\\n\r\nAdagaki, Aki, a typical primadonna tsundere, who belong to the upper echelons not only in society but in her school as well, not the kind who wants to show her weakness, and not the kind who openly admits it, then again she is a character that one would like to hate.\\n\\n\r\nKoiwai, Yoshino, Aki's loyal servant whose personality has a two face in it, one point she is this yes ojosama to Aki, and the other is the \"You Bitch\" ojosama where she helps out Masamune to get even, you know she should just put some snot and boogers in Aki's food and just kick Masamune's ass outta her life, since he's useless anyways.\\n\\n\r\nTae Futaba, ok she likes Masamune, but she isn't the kind who should be going for that guy instead she should be smacking him on the face for taking over Gasou place during the festival, now c'mon what Masamune did is a stabbed on the back for his own class.\\n\\n\r\nShuri Kojuro, I fully believe he is a she, though we would never know that in this anime , it's highly certain that in later chapters of the manga all will be reveled, I would never understand as to what's going on the mind of original creator, Takeoka, Hazuki for making him or her like that.\\n\\n\r\nFujinomiya, Neko, to me I see her as Masamune's lost chance and missed opportunity, she could have serve as the guy's tool for getting even with Aki, man, I really like her for Masamune.\\n\\n\r\n Gasou, Kanetsugu, well he's a nobody here in the anime, so fuck him.\\n\\n\r\nMari, Kikune, and Kaneko, are nothing more that just Aki's lesbian lackeys, whom Masamune should have given each of them a bitch slap.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the main disappointment Masamune Makabe, he is the epitome of stupidy, disorganization, vanity and too much bush beating that he never was able to implement what he want's to do, and thus makes him totally annoying.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3. Enjoyment\\n\\n\r\nIt may be nice to watch, but as one watches, one would be filled with annoyance for the character, Masamune, as we wish that he get's even, frankly from episode 1 to 11 would be watchable, but when one get's to episode 12, that there is 360 degree turn around, where one would be filled with disappointment for seeing Masamune as this Pussy who is all talk and no action.\\n\\n\r\nPoor 3 Overall\\n\\n\r\nThis totally SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't even think about having a season 2, BITCH!\\n\\n\r\nOUT!!!!!!!  \\n\\n\\n\\n",

You have Makabe Masamune who is the hot guy in high school and you have the beautiful cruel girl Aki Adagaki. The plots develops around Makabe driven to take revenge on adagaki for events that happened in the past regarding Makabe falling in love with adagaki.\r\n[Story] 8/10\r\nThis anime has great story which is easy to follow, but sometimes feels hollow a problem found in some Harem anime. \r\n[Art] 9/10\r\nThe art was pretty good the characters felt aliveand there was a really great sense of life to be felt from this world.\\n\r\n[Sound] 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound was great i felt that the op/ending were both amazing.  \\n\r\n[Character] 10/10\\n\r\nThe character development was probably one of the greatest aspects of this anime the interactions that these characters had with one another made it a great watch this winter season. \\n\r\n[Enjoyment] 10/10\\n\r\nThis anime was also a lot of fun and it also knew not take it self to seriously unless the moment called for some sort of drama inducing sad moments which there were and felt serious which is something really difficult to pull of in this type of series. \\n\r\n[Overall Conclusion] 8/10\\n\r\nThe winter season brought us a bunch of good anime and i think that masamune-kun no revenge is one of them. The only thing is that it is not an anime for everyone since there are some that hold a grudge towards the harem genre in general, but people that feel the need for some romance, comedy should not hesitate to pick up & start watching Masamune-kun no revenge.\\n",

            "content": "Hey folks, this will be a review for Masamune-kun no Revenge. This show was better than expected. I think that's a proper way of summarizing it. If you had read the summary of the show then more than likely you can imagine exactly how the show goes. I guessed most of it fairly accurately, however it was more entertaining than I expected.\r\nThe story itself isn't a terrible one. A once fat kid attempts to get revenge on a girl who once rejected him because of his fat. How he attempts to get revenge is by becoming hot and then dating her then dumping her. \r\nTheshow actually flows pretty well with that goal and only gets slightly derailed for what seems like interesting back story. However as anyone with a brain could guess the ending probably will not include revenge. Though I say that I'm not certain as this season ended on a fairly weighty cliff hanger. \\n\\n\r\nMy problem with the story of this show is actually how quickly they throw it at you. They do a good job making you feel informed about the situation, however this show would probably be really good if they took it a bit more slowly and gave it a two or three seasons to develop.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was awesome and the soundtrack was equally as good.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were pretty typical. Snobby tsundere main girl, strange powerful and detached maid, and fragile rich girl. The only plus side to these tropes is how they were handled. The fragile rich girl doesn't play out like you would expect, and the main character is really fun. I enjoyed the characters as much any other show, however like I mentioned above the way the show paced itself made the characters pointless. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this show was really fun to watch, and I look forward to season 2. There are a few odd twists and things here and there but overall its a fun rom com. It could have been better if they took time to introduce and get us attached to the characters. The comedy is pretty good, the main story line is fun and easy to follow. They do add in twists and roadblocks, but it doesn't detract from the show in any real way. Overall I would recommend this show to anyone who likes rom com shows, just be warned its not the best. \\n\\n\r\nTLDR: Not bad, better than you might think. Poor character development, and a cliff hanger ending. Rom com fans will probably enjoy it.",

            "content": "If you have ever had the experience of eating a tub of ice cream to immediately regret it the moment you have finished, than you know how it feels to have watched all twelve episodes of Masamune Kun. To accurately describe my frustration in regret after watching this series, I really delve into one fundamental question, \"was it bad\"?\r\nMasamune Kun is exactly what you would expect it to be. A cliche plot that the teeters the line from being easily digestible filth to above average fanfare. If this show receives a lot of hate, it is not because it is low quality but mostly becauseit is an easy target. The entire premise of a boy who loses weight and becomes obsessed with his image to get revenge on a girl is the most trite premise in history. Anime of this kind are meant to hit certain plot points and build to emotional crescendo's; that is the baseline understanding you need to have to enjoy this series. Which is asking more knowledge that the average viewer probably does not have. I think some people approach a series of this type and expect it to be more similar to Aku No Hana or Toradora. But here is your disclaimer, this show is just dumb entertainment, turn your brain off type entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nEverything in this show, with the exception of the writing, is just passable or bad. After having watched so many animes of this type, it is easy for me to see the inner workings of the writing. Masamune Kun has pretty lazy character writing. Characters are just meant to be window dressing. They either contribute absolutely nothing to the story, or do something really eccentric and wacky that either makes me laugh or skip to the next scene. Frankly, that is the way this show is structured, the mangaka throws something out there, hopes it is good; if not, well we have moved on to the next scene before you have even noticed.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I am being a little lenient is because it was not a complete waste of my time. About halfway through there is a subplot that involves \"a mysterious transfer student\"(Fujinomiya) that has a romantic interest in Masamune. From her introduction, to her rivalry with Aki. I was extremely skeptical of this character. However, I was pleasantly surprise. This character serves as a much needed foil to Masamune, who for all intents and purposes is a narcissistic manipulator. His entire identity is driven by this desire to be attractive, and his motivations for all of his actions are shrouded in dishonesty. On top of that he is a high schooler who does not understand this about himself. Where Fujinomiya is the polar opposite, her innocent love and genuine pursuit of him causes him to self reflect. These interactions were the bedrock of emotional depth that caused me to enjoy an otherwise lackluster high school comedy.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion Masamune's biggest problem is that the source material is still unfinished. This show has twelve episodes and 11/12 episodes covered the bulk of content from the still in production manga. Although this is somewhat of a tangent, the last episode is the best example of how not to do a non-canon anime episode. They did not have anymore material to adapt in the twenty minute runtime, so what was their solution. \"Well let's just animate all the characters singing karaoke. \" I would actually go as far to say that the last episode was the worst of the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nMasamune had a fair bit of charm. The source material is good enough that it will not bore you. On the same end of that spectrum the characterization of this show takes a backseat to all of the boring details that the audience does not care about. There is scene after scene of Masamune working out, or Adagaki shoving her face full of food. The first time, the joke is funny. After the fifth or sixth time, the joke just becomes repetitive. \\n\\n\r\nI have a hard time recommending this show. I enjoyed it enough, especially from episode 6-8. The lack of any meaningful characterization and the repetitive nature of the show will probably lead most to drop the series before it manages to pick up steam.\\n\\n",

Don't get me wrong but it doesn't teach anything like other animes (I mean there is much of the learning in love too!). It doesn't co-relate with actual life and that's what many viewers don't like about \"Non-action, romantic type\" anime. Masamune don't have any friends, how is it possible? At least one should be there, everyone have. This one should have a funny guy who is the friend of Masamune and he falls in love with any of the \"girl-friends\" and watchingthem, Masamune always rethink about revenge (Getting different views about love). \\n\\n\r\nSeason 2 is not coming at least this year. If we see the quality : story ratio then i would say that the quality of anime is far better than the story-line, they put lot of money in animations and left some brains for the story-line. Only Harem scenes in HD doesn't attract many viewers. \\n\\n\r\nI hope in next season they will try to make it much better and work on the story-line. I am not saying change the whole plot but make little changes in it. \\n\\n",

At first it kinda off looked like an interesting story because it brought up an new idea to the anime world, like how he will take revenge on her because she dumps people for her problems and also dumped the main character  bcas he was fat and stuff. As she didn't understand the feeling of getting dumped, so that was the main character aim, but in my point of view the main story line of this anime was not good.i know i am contradicting but wasting all 12 episodes just to show how he will take his revenge ( In my opinion he will not take revenge on her instead he will love her ) is just stupid. The characters are not relatable in any way and one of the character is a boy who looks like a girl and acts like girl, gross. Anyhow the whole point is whether it entertained me or not, right ??? So a \"BIG NO\"",

            "content": "I don't normally write reviews, but since this show is pretty polarizing, it's kinda interesting, so I wanna put my thoughts into it. Note that this review will be spoiler free.\r\nMasamune no Revenge is definitely a twist unto the original romance genre, and a very good one at that. Typically romance comedy anime have really cliche plot and characters. Masamune no Revenge has exactly the opposite, it has really interesting (though unrealistic) characters and the relationships that occur between them really drove me to the next episode.\r\nStory: 8\r\nA really unique story, it's not often you have a plot where on the surface, one person ishead over heels for another person, while in their secrets, it's the other way around. It's actually surprising how much the plot progresses for a slice of life anime, but it really did feel like the plot was going somewhere, instead of spinning around in circles. Which is the reason why it's not your run in a mill romcom anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nNothing spectacular, but nothing to laugh about either. Although the overall animations were lacking, the character designs (except for Masamune) were unique and really showed their characters. Solid\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nNothing really stands out as the \"WOW OPENING OF THE YEAR DESU\". But, the music does fit with the anime, so there's nothing to complain about. The opening, however, to me is pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nOh my, character development in a slice of life anime? Nani????!?!?! Yes, this show actually fleshes out its main characters, while not forgetting to develop it's side characters as well. The unique character interactions is really fun to watch, because they are not cardboard cutouts, you really can't predict what they are gonna do, like you can in most of these genres. Another thing, is Master one of the most unique character you have ever seen? lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nThere's no reason not to try this anime, it's funny, different, interesting, and just overall a pretty relaxing anime to watch.",

            "content": "Masamune Revenge is the latest entry into the rom-com genre. not only that, but it is something i would classify as an Typical Aypical show. this being a show that although remaining the same tries to break out of the normal conventions of a rom-com, even though it's now in the long list of shows that have tried before.just from the premise you can tell it's trying to be different, where instead of a show about a guy trying to get a girl out of love; now it's a guy trying to get a girl out of revenge. now that's something not seen that much.however what it has for an interesting premise; it lacks for the actual content the show has. it's a show that doesn't try to distance itself from it's tropes and cliches, but tries to use them in an interesting way yet in the end fall for the same traps that made them unsatisfactory in the first place.it still goes through the same motions of a rom-com, since even though it's about revenge it's still about how to get miss popular,  then there's the love-rival, the beach episode, and the school festival/play for that icing on top. in the end nothing is resolved and in the end very little happened, second season or not the conclusion for the anime was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\n all the characters in the show are flat and two/one-dimensional, with each fitting their respective arch-types and not much else, although i would give them that they did a little more for our main guy and gal. the main character Makabe is a narcissist out for revenge, but also has a past he'd like to keep hidden and that's about it. the main girl Aki is a hime/tsundere with a eating habit and guilt about her past, and that's about it.there's also Aki's maid that was bullied by her and because of that conspires with Makabe, but i wouldn't say she's overflowing with personlaity and feels more like a plot device to get things going. than for the rest there's the class rep just cuz, the guy that looks like a girl,  the sickly pretty girl, some bullshit love rival and Aki's entourage but aren't worth noting for each. there's little development character or plot wise other than the introduction of more characters, and everyone remains the same.\\n\\n\r\nin terms of art/animation it all feels same at this point. there's not much that makes this show stand out from the rest. the color pallet, and the lighting feel like something i have seen a hundred times over. the animation is decent , but than again there's not a lot of movement going on. the character designs aren't interesting and the comedic scenes with differing art style don't cut it much.\\n\\n\r\n the ost as pretty good surprisingly if you bother to give a listen, but since it's in this show it now feels like a tragedy. the voice acting is okay i guess. however those sfx for those comedic bits do get annoying pretty fast\\n\\n\r\ncouldn't care less i knew i was in for disappointment , and that's exactly what i got. no moments to rule an exception, no one interesting character to rule out an exception. just dullness through and through\\n\\n\r\noverall- the writing isn't that good even with the \"effort\" they put in and the art and sound are good enough even if generic",

Only the most central characters to the story have their intentions considered, and some of the interesting, less central characters areleft out. What can be called the 'major' plot twist doesn't occur until nearly the end of the series, and as such it isn't given much chance for development. \\n\\n\r\nEven the main character, whose initial intentions are set in stone, quickly falters on his plans when complications arise, and at times I wasn't sure if he was even seriously pursuing his main goal, one which he had striven for his whole life.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style and sound were both redeeming features, as to be expected of silver link.

If you don't enjoy it, this showisn't for you. Also keep in mind that the ending is not conclusive, so unless you're willing to dive into the manga (which I recommend), you will be left with a lot of loose ends at the end, as the last arc is pretty weak.

It has a unique idea but ultimately fails because of all the cliches.  Let me explain:\r\nThe whole idea of revenge was promising, but, to be honest, it quickly became a typical tsundere romcom sort of thing. The whole \"getting rejected as a child\" backstory was pretty decent, but it could have been explored more. There were many moments that were sorta like filler, except that they were canon. The relationship progression is pretty slow and the whole plot withthe \"second guy\" was not actually finished. The ending felt like a cliff hanger to me, so I hope they make a second season. The side characters really dragged on the story, because no one really cared about them. \\n\\n\r\nThe two main characters have a decent backstory but the show doesn't really bring it up very much. The MC Makabe was pretty unique, in my opinion,  because I haven't seen too many hot guys that were not experienced with relationships and had a toxic motive. The female MC, Aki, was a pretty generic tsundere that hated guys, but her motives are pretty unique. She has a weird fetish for a certain kind of person too....  Most of the characters are pretty bland and I could care less about them. Many of them are super annoying because they cause conflict within the story (too keep it going), but they just extend the length of the story. A few of the minor characters were into the gay/lesbian stuff, so If you don't like watching fujoshi characters shipping guys, you may be slightly annoyed. \\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good and the characters looked great! I really liked the colourfulness and art style. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty decent, with good voice actors/actresses and a good OP and ED. The background music was sorta boring and not really important. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, even though the anime isn't the most unique or has the best story, It was enjoyable to watch and one of the only anime that I kept up to date with. If you want a rom-com to watch, this should be on your list, albeit on the bottom of the list. If you want something new and unique with a great plot, you should look elsewhere. \\n\\n\r\nNOTE: Rating it a 5 means that overall, it was a positive experience watching the anime, but It lacked a story and had meh characters. I do not hate the anime, so don't message me saying \"OMG you suck because you hate my favourite anime!\" I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it. \\n\\n\r\nTL:DR : Had a promising idea, but ended up being a generic romcom. The story isn't finished yet, so I hope for a second season. Was fun to watch.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge started with a not quite tired yet premise: a fat guy got rejected by a hot chick so he decided to become a hot guy, seduce the hot chick then dump her. Of course the premise is simply to hook you in. It\u2019s the execution that keeps you in. And maybe this time it\u2019ll be a better and more nuanced take. Maybe this time the guy will be so tunnel-visioned into his revenge it reaches unhealthy levels and he ends up offing his social interactions and a real chance at happiness and love. Maybe this time\u2026 oh wait no. They\u2019re making aharem-comedy and our dumbass MC has a 99.9% chance of ending with one of the least interesting female leads to ever grace the rom-com genre. I mean the title blatantly say \u201cMasamune-kun no Revenge\u201d. (Get it? Because it says no revenge. Eh? Eh\u2026? I have no friends.) To the shows credit, it dashes your hopes early on so you don\u2019t have high expectations.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the characters, which I believe are the show\u2019s gravest and greatest weakness. We have the MC who went out of his way to make it flat-out impossible for us to like him, a flat tsundere (and I\u2019m not talking about cup size), a quiet girl that you have a sneaking suspicion is the root of the problem, a tomboyish probably-meant-to-be-a-genki girl that got sidelined so fast before she could even utter \u201cIt\u2019s not like I like you or anything ba--baka!\u201d, best gril Kojuurou, an obese monkey wrench, and Stage 4 Plot-itis.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are of so little note and lack even the most basic character development that much of the show\u2019s drama relies on external circumstances to wreck havoc. There\u2019s nothing that makes you root for any of them. You have no investment in any of their actions because you know squat diddly what\u2019s in it for them and how it will change them. Even the eponymous revenge you\u2019ll eventually find hard to care because there\u2019s no sense of stake on how it affects the MC or the female lead, other than well putting the female lead, a right bitch, in her place. That\u2019s it for most of the show\u2019s runtime. You get a glimpse who Aki is so late into the story that it doesn\u2019t even matter anymore because by then you\u2019d like nothing more than to make sweet love to her lovely empty head with the business end of a pike.\\n\\n\r\nStage 4 Plot-itis is probably the most likable character, to the point where you\u2019re left wondering what\u2019s a girl like her doing in a show like this. She\u2019s also the most pointless one introduced. Yes, even more than obese monkey wrench. The purpose of Stage 4 Plot-itis is that she represents a way out for the MC -this sweet, soft-spoken, pretty girl who\u2019s going out of her way to make her intentions known and all he has to do is give up on his revenge. But the way she was introduced and the cagey defense of the MC about the circumstances of their encounter only adds unnecessary friction and drama. It feels like the author was just throwing obstacles after obstacles to the main pairing and the characters involved are handed the temporary idiot ball to deliberately make the obstacle worse. And if they actually developed Futaba to be Aki\u2019s competition, Stage 4 Plot-itis could be safely written out and the show could proceed with its drama, but this time coming from the characters themselves as their motivations, dreams, hopes, and feelings collide.\\n\\n\r\nThe setting and the story aren\u2019t even noteworthy so the show has to rely on their characters to carry the series. Which they failed. They\u2019re not the first and they will not be the last in a genre so rife with the same failures repeated over and over that you\u2019re left wondering if it\u2019s pretty much tradition at this point.\\n\\n\r\nBut let\u2019s be real, the reason why we\u2019re watching this is to participate in our favorite annual event: Best Gril 2017. If that\u2019s the case, don\u2019t waste your time. This one\u2019s a no go. Neko trumps Aki, no contest.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun's Revenge became quite the surprise hit of Winter 2017 as it ended up being the second most watched series that season. Seeing as it was made by Silver Link, which has been known for some consistent entertainment with their school anime (Kokoro Connect, Baka and Test, Watamote, Tanaka-kun is Always Listless and others) everyone quickly picked it up after craving for another classic, clean romance. A word about a decent first episode started spreading around and even more users picked it up. \r\nBut this review isn't really about all that, it's about what I think of it. So let's jump right into it.\\n\r\n*Slight spoilers warning* \\n\\n\r\nEverything started off better than I could expect, the main character was a guy that actually worked out every day and studied to the point of becoming the best on his entrance exams. As he walked alongside the tennis court with his phone out, all the girls expressed how much would they like it if he took the photos of their underwear. It made sense, Masamune was presented as the hottest and smartest guy around. It was a clear message to the viewer, all girls in the world should want that piece of ass. We don't see that often enough in anime romances. They didn't stop there though. There's a reason why he tried so hard, why he put himself through inhuman training in the mountains a goal that let him study day after day, a dream that pushed him to his absolute limits. \\n\\n\r\nHE WANTED TO CUCK THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF THE GIRL WHO FAT SHAMED HIM WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE OBESE PIG. \\n\r\n(Disclaimer: It's the show's fault, not mine) \\n\\n\r\nAnd still, that's not all. The girl who he wanted to cuck, was Aki Adagaki - the omega bitch, the tsundere that is able to send  all affection she receives flying in a way that will destroy someone's life. She gives all the rejected guys awful nicknames and she does it in the most ridiculous way she can come up with. In the first episode alone, after sending one of her underlings to do a background check, she reveals to the entire school that the guy who confessed love to her has weird fetishes and rolls down a huge scroll with a nickname from the top of the school roof. \\n\r\nNow that's quite the beginning to a story isn't it? All of that happens in the first 5 minutes of the show. The more it went on, the more harem tropes it blew out of proportion. That's exactly why the expectations for it were skewed. You see, this show isn't a parody of the harem genre, nor is it one of the romance genre, nor is a parody at all. It turned out to be only a romance, with the unique spin being that everyone is a walking stereotype multiplied by ten. \\n\r\nThat didn't bring down my spirit though, I don't mind cliches and stereotypes as long as they're done well, so I continued with good faith, and wouldn't you know, the comedy got better, the ideas and the execution were still providing new sources of absurdity, the dialogues were quite funny and my happiness was on the rise. It provided solid entertainment without major flaws, but with no big positives as well. \\n\r\nHowever, just as every other series, it had to hit a rough patch at one point, but  unfortunately, unlike some, it wasn't able to pick itself up from the falls it made. Every major event felt inconsequential, story progressed and regressed through the span of one episode. It wasn't long until I realized that the only ones getting cucked in this show were going to be Masamune and me, because this show is going nowhere with its main plot points. Masamune pushed to get Aki to fall for him, but then something came up and she hated him again. He got close to a romantic moment, but then something was misinterpreted and it all went back to square one. Even when everything went right according to the plan, no progress was made, every character acted the same way towards each other, the only places where something would change were the supposedly serious scenes that often got interrupted so nothing could ever go down. \\n\r\nWas this the show's plan all along? Is this entire experience supposed to teach the viewer that cucking is wrong and it hurts? Was the lack of progression intended, so it could make me feel this way? Who knows! I just know that I've had enough for now. This story provided a clear example of how to annoy me with the persistent lack of any sort of progression in the behavior of the main couple. Even if their feelings changed, that doesn't help to fill the void it leaves me with. This show is full of dialogues, monologues. It doesn't leave a lot of empty places where one character could sit around and just think about her situation. All I could do is speculate whether something really did change, but in the end I realized that even if it did, it didn't help the show's flow and pacing feel less empty. \\n\r\nNow don't get me wrong, there were fun moments where the cast got into amusing situations, several unexpected plot twists and mysteries going on in the background, most of which thankfully got resolved in a respectable way. As mentioned before, it threw many characters and multiple themes to feed my brain. I never felt bored while watching an episode, but upon finishing, I was left scratching my head thinking about the main point of the series and how it once again didn't go anywhere. I'm fine with a lot of side stories, but Masamune-kun's Revenge lost itself in all of them. It sidetracked me from what was supposed to be a story about understanding revenge and long lost love. None of those stories provided any motive for that purpose. It was like some other anime just barged in to steal Masamune into its own world, like all the girls could only dream about. \\n\r\nTo be fair, some episodes contained more substance than others, the slice of life breathers helped the character's interact more casually than at any other point in the show, some even brought back the overblown motives and that was pretty fun, but all that was still just filling in the spot of all the things that I liked about it in the beginning. Everything was just a distraction that used the characters who show bits of romantic interest. Nothing connected to anything. while there were places where it felt like it's back on track again, it always turned out that it's just a beginning of another arc. \\n\r\nIn conclusion, the main premise of Masamune-kun's Revenge got pushed away too far to make me care about it. What I got instead is a bunch of stories, some more solid, some less solid, but everything felt wrong because it missed the points it tried to make at first, not to mention it being rushed towards the end, unfinished and bland. \\n\r\nI'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters could be split into groups, where one would be the Masamune's main harem, the second one would be Masamune's side harem that tries to not be a harem but it is, the third one would be Adagaki's harem, and the individual characters like Masamune, Aki and some very minor ones are ungrouped. \\n\r\nWhat I expected out of the main character, Makabe Masamune, is to be the deconstruction of the \"harem MC\", because in the first episode he was aware of the feelings of the girls he met, all of them except the specific ones. He praised himself and felt proud about the state he's currently in. Hell, the entire idea of the show was supposed to be based around him dominating the relationship and then dropping the girl he was trying to get at the worst possible moment! But no! He doesn't do any of that! He gets pushed around by another characters, he gets into a group of \"friends\" that consist of the girls that want/wanted to be with him and one trap, he fails to realize some people's feelings for him and whenever he tried to do something himself, he either ultimately chickened out or got interrupted. All that's because he's actually not the guy he seemed to be. He wasn't a popular guy before, so he's still antisocial on the inside, after all it's his first year being the hot guy. He gets all his  knowledge from shoujo manga, which would explain his initial behavior and the the cheesy, typical hot guy lines he nonchalantly throws around. It turns out he's just a muscular otaku who has no experience talking to girls and he begins to spend time with them. \\n\\n\r\nOh goodie! \\n\\n\r\nI'm not mad because he isn't a deconstruction, I'm not like that and I was surprised and excited for the idea of him secretly being someone else, but his best moments are the ones where he tries to be the perfect guy and throws those cheesy lines around, at least for me. Despite that, every time he gets confident and actually tries harder, when he seems like he'll start changing and developing, he regresses back into his original, otaku-like self. His character doesn't go anywhere, even by the end when some major complications come up, he still acts the same way, pretending to be someone who he never became in the first place. It isn't played for the jokes or anything at all actually, all the special moments between him and Aki are just that - the circle of nothingness. \\n\r\nSpeaking of Aki and her relationship with Masamune, it was really weird. I don't understand why would it be done like this. The Omega Bitch does exactly what she wants, sometimes with dubious reasoning and sometimes with none. She just hates men, but when Masamune does something she always blushes. It's giving this feeling of some kind of progression in their relationship, but then she pushes him away completely next episode. This continues throughout the entire run of the show. The way they interact with each other is so random and all over the place that it might as well have been a shonen rivalry for all I care. It certainly felt that way. \\n\r\nLater on we start to see more of Adagaki's sidekick who decided to pretty much play a prank on her to bash reality into her head, which should be interesting and it was, but she got pushed back and forth, working in the background or in the front, wasn't really consistent, she pulled off just as many random decisions as the other characters. I like her because she feels like she can from a different setting and it surprisingly didn't affect anything negatively, but the show doesn't know how to handle its characters for a viewer like me to care. \\n\r\nOh, and there's also Neko, that best girl candidate that hops on Masamune's biceps around the middle of the show. She had a good arc thematically, but the execution was once again snatchy, but it threw bits and pieces of it around to hint at certain things and it actually had a conclusion, which was solid. She definitely brought out one of the best parts of the series out and she had a lot going for her. I do think about her character in a positive light, not a very strong one, but noticeable enough to get me through the dark tunnel that this show was in the end. \\n\r\nDespite the likable side cast with their goofy, strong moments, the cast overall fails at doing anything well. Nobody had the potential to make this anime great ever since episode two or so. The writing is inconsistent and yet never great, the dialogues are always plain and sometimes cheesy, the romantic touches didn't even exist. There was nothing good about the interactions. Everything felt like it was done just to get it through, like not much effort went into it. It's like the romantic comedy level of writing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art wasn't particularly great. While the close ups are solid, the character designs are well done and tidy, I don't like the mushy color pallet which consists of either too many shades of blue or too many shades of red and orange, with the occasional green mixed in. It's a bit too simplistic for me and it wouldn't be a problem if the art style looked better on its own. Not to mention the awful looking zoomed out shots, which were a very noticeable huge gaps in comparison to the standard look of the rest of the show, which wasn't that good to begin with.\\n\r\nThe animation is passable. Lots of still shots and sever lack of movement in the backgrounds when other people appear in it. It isn't something that bugged me constantly throughout the series, but sometimes when it happens it stands out. I like the use of the shaky camera, even if it isn't something special it adds something to look out for here and there, and it doesn't make me sick like in some other series. On the other hand, the animation feels a bit choppy sometimes. There were numerous scenes where that was easily visible.\\n\r\nI'm simply indifferent about the art. I've seen all those cons before done worse, and all those pros done better. I'm okay with it. \\n\\n\r\nThe music on the other hand, while technically not worse than the animation, was so bland and forgettable that it almost made the series boring on its own, especially in the later episodes. Usually when I finish an anime, even those that I didn't like, there are some tracks that stick in my mind, for better or worse. In Masamune kun no Revenge there were none. I guess the opening sounded nice and the ED was okay, but if someone would tell me to hum some music from this show right now, I would struggle to find anything. \\n\r\nIt doesn't fit the scenes well, it barely helps with setting the atmosphere, certain tracks repeat too often for my taste and so on. I can't rag on it too much, it really did nothing wrong, but for a romance to not have an emotional track or a solid, happy and catchy one for the slice of life moments, there must be something wrong with it. Or me. There's always that possibility. \\n\\n\r\nMy personal thoughts on the show are pretty positive. While not the best, Masamune-kun's Revenge was a highlight of the season for me. It was easy to watch, entertaining, well paced, consistently funny with the well build up jokes that avoided feeling repetitive and the visual gags that kept me smirking throughout episodes, kept me interested and satisfied until the last arc and had some good, though not particularly memorable moments. As an experience it was solid, as a show that I would look back to, it failed. \\n\r\nThe important question is: Would I recommend this to anyone, and if so, to who? \\n\r\nIf you don't have anything planned, if you already watched all the other Silver Link school anime or simply don't feel like checking them out, if you just feel like watching a romance with a small harem, if you're still new on the genre or simply really want to watch this specifically, then yeah, I'd say it's worth a shot. This is still a pretty broad statement, because I'm pretty sure people from other groups could find something for themselves here as well.  It definitely had something going for it, there are several well thought out elements that some may find more enjoyable than others. I wouldn't go around telling people about this series, but if someone would stumble upon it, I'd say they might as well check it out. Perhaps it's a series more fitted for other anime fans out there. \\n\r\nTo wrap it up in a few short sentences: To me Masamune-kun's Revenge is an okay beginners anime at best. The mass audience could certainly enjoy it, but for people who've seen other things that they consider great, this might even feel offensive, as the flaws are certainly noticeable and will most likely influence their experience negatively. I found it enjoyable, but very flawed. Watch at your own risk, or at your own whim if that's what you want. \\n\\n\r\nAs always, this is purely my opinion and I kinda recommend you to develop you own.",

Leaving a confusing unsatisfying season not as a whole but for the most part.\r\nThe title literally has the word \"revenge\" on it. So if they are going to make a story about revenge then they should at least make it much longer and more serious.\r\nAlso don'ttrust manga fan readers for this series.

            "content": "There have only been a handful of times that I have been truly uncomfortable when an anime character is rejected, or depressed. The ones that stick in my mind the most are angel beats, charlotte, little busters, or mirai nikki. It was interesting enough, seeing as the premise of the show does look promising. I was constantly holding on to my seat in excitement even though there were some very cliched scenes.\r\nthere was just something about this show that makes them- well, tolerable!\r\nIn so many words, that's how I feel about Masamune-kun no revenge, a 12-episode series from 2017-to god knows when, based on thehit manga that ran in seven seas entertainment. The show itself is solidly entertaining, a romantic comedy of high calibre. Episodes fly by, and when my family was ignoring me recently, I bum-rushed the whole thing in two days(speaking of the manga) -- a record for me. The animated show is defined by high-quality animation, a relaxing soundtrack, stunning visuals and a lovable cast. So what's the problem? Simply this: it is a show that desperately needs moral underpinning, yet does not have any. That makes it an uncomfortable watch for people like me who really start thinking about the program's ramifications. When you think that it was targeted to kids -- young teens who watched it in droves -- you begin to realise just how awkward the series really is.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun no revenge tells the story of masamune makabe, a strikingly handsome and brilliant young man who one day was a chubby little rich kid.\\n\r\nLong story short, when you are raised as a kid of a very successful business man, you get picked on. Alot. Now most people in this situation would just grow up to being fat little snubs who think they can have the world on a whim and are just rejected because people are jealous of them. But our protagonist is different. Masamune has a unique -- no, make that obsessive -- sense of justice. He believes that he can truly get the justice that he deserves by getting revenge on a girl that shut him down for being fat. Before long, a string of hope emerges for the lad, he winds up transferred to his grandfather's house (reason still unknown) in inexplicable fashion. by then the world knew Light him by the nickname \"pig's foot\", which was given to him by adagaki aki, his childhood crush, and the woman he wants revenge on. He begins practice with his grandfather for 3 long years, promising himself that he would one day be able to possess a girl's heart with his remarkable charm, and before we know it, Masamune is the one name on everyone's lips.\\n\\n\r\nnow I, myself have yet to finish the animated series so i don't quite know how its going to turn out, but its shaping up to be good, considering it goes the way it did in the manga. if not, im expecting a second season\\n\\n\\n\r\nthe show has exquisite narrative through the vision of our protagonist and an amazingly baffling plot twist two-thirds of the way through that nearly wrecks the final third -- but the curves and turns along the way kept me engaged throughout.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING:\\n\r\nanimation:10/10\\n\r\nstory:9/10\\n\r\nsoundtrack:7 (nothing special)\\n\r\nenjoyment:8(i cant be the only one that thinks tsundere characters are very irritating right?)\\n\r\nall and all:8\\n\\n\r\nThe long and short of it is this: Masamune kun no revenge is wildly inappropriate for the Shonen audience for which it is intended. Middle school and early high school teens are going to have a difficult time relating to the show, because most of the ways that love is portrayed are physical rather than verbal. but that's waht makes it so much fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe creators may have wanted to make a simple rom-com, but they built a world that cries out for your attention and will have you smiling for no apparent reason, other than the fact that you are wildly and greatly entertained",

He wanted revenge on a girl that broke his heart when he was younger. There is a lot of comedy scenes and romance (?) scenes.

The animation is good and the movements are natural. I especially like the way the hair is drawn/animated. It looks so fluffy! The colours are really nice, it isn't too bright, yet not dull.\\n\\n\\n\r\n==========\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\n==========\\n\r\nI personally really like the opening and the ending song.

The story is very simple, the main character Masamune Makabe was called the nickname Pig's Foot (due to his chubbiness) by the cruel princess Adagaki Aki in his childhood. After a few years he has slimmed down, worked up his muscles, and has become a very attractive man. Since now, he goes to the same school as Adagaki Aki, he deems revenge by befriending her and getting to know her more, and later on break her heart, but it may not sound as easy as it seems.\r\nI personally thought allthe characters were lovable, and memorable, not just some characters we'll know then forget\\n\\n\r\nThe songs really got stuck in my head for some time which kinda annoyed me at first, but then I got used to it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime was pretty good, and really went on the light side of anime, my only concern was how it was pretty rushed, since so much happens in (currently)10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMy Rating=8/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "MAY CONTAIN SLIGHT SPOILERS\r\nWell, this is going to be my first review and the reason for me writing this is because I'm feeling really in need to talk about this show.\r\nSorry for any English grammar issues that may show up throughout this review. \r\nInitially I thought this was going to be one of those cliche anime where the main character manages to \"change\" that cold, quiet and proud girl who, at first, doesn't like him but as the anime goes on, she starts to fall in love with him. Well this isn't entirely false but as I watched this show, I realized that it waskind of different.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune isn't your everyday school type anime protagonist. He is actually a handsome guy who is very popular in school and even though he could get pretty much any girl he wanted,  he is obsessed with his revenge on Adagaki  Aki. The whole anime develops around that.\\n\\n\r\nNow I don't really want to talk about the plot itself but about my thoughts of what was missing and what was too much in this anime. \\n\r\nI really loved the concept of Masamune being a good looking guy after his terrible experiences in the past for being fat. He was bullied and supposedly rejected by his childhood love (Adagaki Aki). He worked very hard to change his appearance and to become the perfect kind of person you would date.\\n\\n\r\nIt's really annoying the whole revenge thing because at certain points it really looks like he is in love with Adagaki-san, not just for her but even for the viewers. I think the story is kind of stuck in the same concept and that prevents it from developing. \\n\r\nI really loved  like  the first 4 or 5 episodes. Because the relation between the two main characters seemed to be making sense. But then, all of a sudden, the plot turns and we're back at the start. They seem to become more and more distant. Conversations that you'd expect to happen don't happen and the whole thing just gets weird. Then another character shows up and \"steals\" Adagaki's heart, as well as Masamune's identity. For some reason the main character doesn't seem to be much bothered about this and nothing really happens.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe it's just me being unsatisfied by the fact that the story was getting weirder, simply because the characters wouldn't do what I was expecting, or what would be expected in a romance anime. \\n\\n\r\nAlso what the hell was that ending? Seriously the whole karaoke thing  didn't make any sense. That last sheet of paper was, probably, an opening for a future 2nd season or ova. But seriously if the story doesn't start developing I don't see any reason to keep watching it.\\n\\n\r\nI know this is mostly a negative review which contrasts with the score I gave. The thing is, I'm just really sad and unsatisfied with the plot, I was expecting it to be a little deeper. The whole concept, animations, and characters were very good, soundtrack was OK, but I just feel that there's something missing.\\n\\n\r\nI did not read the Manga but from the reviews I saw it really is better and deeper than the anime. So if you're either planning to watch this show, or, like me, unsatisfied with it, I highly recommend you to read  the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's not a bad show and you actually get attracted and familiarized with it's characters and story. I've seen the most various opinions about \"Masamune-kun no Revenge\" so go ahead, watch it and take your own conclusions. I'm pretty sure you'll enjoy it, even if slightly.",

As it moves on the characters are shown to be deeper than we thought, some really good storytelling is made and it turns the show into more than a silly revenge rom com. \r\nHere's where it gets bad, after it started getting so good the show takes a COMPLETE 180 and ruins everything they've built up to that point (This happensin the manga as well which is 20 chapters ahead of the final episode as of righting this and it's still an absolute shithole and mess)\\n\\n\r\nI can only count on one hand the amount of times a show has left me with such a sour taste in my mouth after finishing it (So much so that i'm writing my first review because it's pissed me off so much)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR Show goes from amazing to a shitfest in the last few episodes, and don't bother reading the manga as the shitfest just keeps on going..",

Pretty much.\r\nThe disappointment can be summed up in a few words - not the outcome I had hoped for. Ever since the first episodes it makes you think his revenge will be that legendary ending this anime is aiming for, but it flunked when itdidn't do anything it so openly promised.

            "content": "Preface: I think if you are going to watch this anime you should try to rely on your own unbiased judgement when it comes to your personal connection/how much you resonate with the characters. As well, how much you enjoyed/will enjoy this anime shouldn't be dependent on something someone else has to say about it. I will try my best to keep you open-minded about this anime, while I also won't shy away from what it does poorly. ANY SPOILERS WILL BE KEPT TO THE END OF THE REVIEW IF ANY.\r\nLet's start with getting the most objective parts of the anime out of the way.\r\nARTAND SOUND. When it comes down to the art style, I don't think you will be disappointed or turned away, and I also don't think it will blow your mind. It has the same art style most other shows like it made after 2013 use. They use the classic chibi expressions on funny lighthearted parts, the dramatic camera angles and blushing of the cheeks on dramatic parts, and everything in-between that you would expect. Nothing groundbreaking here, there were a few parts that I noticed looked slightly more professional than normal, typically in the most climatic scenes, which is still normal for most other shows like it. As for the sound, it doesn't sound like the characters are too far away or have bad quality audio, and it also doesn't sound way too close and crystal clear, which is something you will normally find more of in anime movies or very serious high production value shows. When factoring in music, it's also nothing that I would write home about. The show has good background music that fit the tones they were trying to capture perfectly, and that's about all there is to say about it. I didn't personally find the intro music to be that thrilling, but maybe you will appreciate it more than I did. It all comes down to personal opinion.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS. I personally really enjoyed most of the characters in this show. The personalities may annoy you at times as they did me, but I think that is exactly what the writers were trying to portray and they did a great job at it. When you're screaming at your computer screen yelling at the main character for being such a narcissist yet not being able to get a single girl's phone number, you know that, good or bad, they made you feel some sort of emotion, which is what I strive to get out of watching anime. Although I will admit, sometimes during this show they go a little too far, and you can't help but feel that occasionally the characters aren't real, just classic tropes you see in every other rom-com anime of it's kind. However, I stand by my feeling that the characters personalities bring a fun twist to a typical anime of it's kind, as most would make the main character a classic Joe, with no real \"out there\" traits, at least certainly not to the extent of Masamune-kun. That is as far into the characters as I will go to not spoil anything else.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY. (I WILL TRY MY BEST TO AVOID SPOILERS BUT BE WARNED). The story of this show starts off really really well. Like, with the potential of it becoming one of my top rom-com anime of all time. However, about halfway through the show they start throwing in very very strange plot twists for reasons that can't really be explained by the viewer, or even the writers. With random characters showing up and the attitudes and entire purpose of the show seeming to change in the blink of an eye, with no better explanation than, \"It's just chance is all hehe\". This is still bearable throughout most of the show though, and these out-of-the-blue characters ended up making the anime even more enjoyable than it already was for me, with a little better tie-in's I think they would have nailed it perfectly. That is until almost the end of the show. I won't put spoilers here, but I feel the need to help mankind for the better and let you know that if you don't like complete out-of-the-blue plot twists right when you think the show is coming to it's ultimate badass and heart-throbbing climax- you might not want to bother watching this show. I'm not stressing this when I say it is BAD. It is the reason I gave the story of this show a 5 instead of a 9. The ending truly ruined a lot for me. I don't regret watching it by any means, but if you're one of those people that think if the ending isn't good then it's a waste of time to watch it, then spare yourself the 4 hours.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, what could have been a great show with refreshing characters and a great plot setup, was just a good show, due to the non-existent tie-in's and poorly executed plot twists. However, that's just my personal opinion. Maybe you'll love it, in the end only you can decide.\\n",

            "content": "Before I start giving a review to Masamune-kun no Revenge, I want to state that I read other reviews before watching. That made me very sceptical and I was actually scared to watch. But that feeling flew away within the first few episodes of Masamune-kun no Revenge.\r\nI think that the storyline is pretty unique. Someone getting bullied, a beautiful girl broke his heart. And now instead of accepting the fate that he could never reach her, he is trying to improve himself and goes through a tough process doing a lot of sport to loss weight and gain muscle. Howether, after this process he isable to approach her in a very different situation and the mind to broke her heart as she did to him.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art of the anime is really good and pretty as expected from a SIlver Link production. I felt the sound and especially the music made the anime unique at some situations and I don`t know how you feel, but the intro is definetely worth watching everytime.\\n\\n\r\nI think Masamume itself it a great, lovely and especially humorful character, but I`m not happy about it that he might will do the same as Aki did to him.\\n\\n\r\nI will say that I will give this anime an overall rating of 9/10, why? Because the genres are so matching. You definetely see sort of harem, a lot of comedy and romance. The fact that he might will break her heart during the next season If there will be any, what I hope because the letter in the last episode said so, is making me very uncomfortable to continue to watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nWithout the revenge, this anime could have been the best romance comedy animes of the winter season of 2017, or maybe the best of 4 seasons for me. I hope everyone enjoy watching it or enjoyed it.\\n\\n",

Also, introducing a brand new \"alter ego-fatassmune\" character in the last few episodes.... How original! Hmm a doppelganger introduced to throw a wrench in the protagonists plan! That isn't the laziest run-of-the-mill harem anime implementation ever or anything. It does not help that when he was introduced the characters and plot ofthe series became reprehensibly convoluted.  The flip-flop of the character personalities does nothing to enhance the story, and only leads to overwhelming frustration.\\n\\n\r\nat the end of episode 8 I was rating this anime probably around an eight.  After episode 10 I would have given it a two.  I was generous in giving it a poor rating.  \\n\\n\r\nThis anime had so much potential, until it introduced bipolar personalities, an idiotic plot twist from a \"doppelganger,\" nearly shifted main character focus from the antagonist to three sub-characters\u2014the nazi triplets, and continued to embrace this disconcerting new format of the show, like the last 9 episodes hadn't happened.\\n\\n\r\nThis review is shorter than what this abysmal train-wreck deserves, but I feel I have said enough.  Avoid this show unless you want to break your fing TV with your fist after the last three episodes.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge was almost a really fun and likeable anime. However, it was just painfully obvious throughout the entire season that the team behind the show wasn't good enough to execute on their premise. From the start, you can see that the story will end one of two ways; he'll get his revenge on Adagaki Aki, or won't and they'll fall in love and live happily ever after or whatever. And then, for the entire season, nothing happens. Like, nothing at all. The story doesn't progress, they keep throwing in other characters that waste your time, etc. I don't have a problem with lovetriangles in general, but I do object to throwing characters into the show that have no personality and their only purpose is simply to be a stumbling block to the plot. The two main characters have some personality, but I know nothing about the characters of anyone else in the show except for their one gimmick that seems to define everything about them. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the show focused more on the 'comedy' part of Romantic Comedy than the romance. This isn't a problem, and which you prefer is a matter of taste, but I think everyone can agree that something that focuses so strongly on comedy should at least be funny. The show's best moments, in my opinion, was when it had drama related to the motivations of the central characters, but these were so diluted by poor gags that they didn't have as much impact as they ought to have. Poor writing and poor timing changed a story that, with very few alterations, could have been a six or seven, into a clear four. What makes me sad about this show is that if a competent team had worked on it, it would already have the foundations to be a great show. The entire time while watching the show I wished I was watching something else that would have handled the same scenes and situations differently and better. So that's what I did; I watched Toradora again instead.",

Like Masamune, I was bullied a lot when I was younger because I was fat. Like him, I also worry about foods with high calories. Other than that, there is nothing else relatable as I didn't try or want to get revenge on those who bullied me. I also didn't want to have a build like his.\r\nAnyway, on to the story. It's about I guy who used to be fat and bullied when he was younger and was called \"Pigs Foot\"from Aki when he asked her out even though she told hm him to be stronger. As time went by, his grandfather trained him to lose weight. Later on, he also built muscles. \\n\\n\r\nHe then transfers to a school where every girl flirts with him. He figured that Aki goes to the same school and plans to get revenge by rejecting her after getting her to love him. As the story went on, Masasume keeps getting close to his goal but his plans keep getting messed up. Masamune never got his revenge.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I liked anime because there are several scenes that made me laugh/chuckle, and its characters are unique.",

            "content": "Intro \r\nMasamune Kuns revenge based off the popular manga of the same name is a comedy/romance genre anime. With the interesting premise of a revenge story mixed with a romance and comedy this anime sure piqued my interest when looking through the seasonal anime. Although I haven\u2019t read the source material for the anime I may do so after watching this anime. \r\nStory and setting \r\nThe main story of Masamune kun\u2019s revenge is centered on the titular character Masamune Makabe\u2019s  goal of attaining revenge on the stories main heroine Aki Adagaki for a perceived humiliation that she had inflicted on him when they werelittle. The story largely follows the plans of Makabe as he tries to follow the plan that he has created and set up and try and get the heroine to fall in love with him. Along the way Makabe would encounter a number of support characters that either hinder or aid him in his plans. The anime itself is largely set within the school that Makabe and the majority of the cast attend though it does feature other locations when the plot demands it. \\n\\n\r\nAs a comedy/romance anime the story itself I felt was a mix between being serious and being funny with equal emphasis on both aspects. The story was one aspect that I quite enjoyed and the fact that the cast was well integrated into the story and was played by an excellent cast really helped in making the story enjoyable. Like most anime, the story for Masamune Kun\u2019s revenge features a subplot that features its focus on one of the main characters in this case being Neko.  This subplot I felt was reasonably done and made even better by the actions of Neko and the skill of her seiyuu Suzuko Mimori. \\n\\n\r\nMasamune \\n\r\nMasamune Makabe voiced by veteran voice actor Natsuki Hanae of Twin stars\u2019 exorcist and the Digimon Tri movies fame is the one of the main characters of the show and the titular protagonist. A confident, quick thinking and resourceful teenager that is determined to enact the plan that he has created and attain the revenge that he wants on Aki for the humiliation that he thinks she inflicted on him. Makabe\u2019s life and personality can be said to revolve around his revenge plan which seems to have the funniest of names. Masamune\u2019s personality like his plan exhibits subtle changes as the series progresses as he encounters a number of characters in his school life that change his perception on things. In the beginning Masamune\u2019s personality and life was focused on the plan of his which had the effect making appear both devious and bold especially when he stands up to Aki. However, this also had the effect of making him look villainous. It\u2019s not until Masamune meets Neko that his personally really starts to change becoming more caring and understanding of others than before. Although his plan remains meeting Neko and seeing Aki\u2019s true self helped create a better personality for Masamune that I felt was more suited to him. The main point of Masamune is that he\u2019s equally serious but at the same time can be quite comedic at times as well. This makes him somewhat of a hard character to portray as being too serious will make him look like a villain while too comedic will make him look like a clown. All in all, I felt that Natsuki Hanae did a pretty good job portraying him. \\n\\n\r\nAki \\n\r\nAki Adagaki played by veteran seiyuu singer Ayaka Ohashi of Akame ga kill fame is one of the main characters of the show and the main heroine of the series. A rich girl and a childhood friend of Masamune before an incident made him create a plan of revenge Aki is a bossy, arrogant and somewhat cruel girl on the outside. However, Aki\u2019s true personality is slightly different as she is innocent, loyal to her classmates and somewhat considerate to others. Although ruthless towards people that she doesn\u2019t like she can be surprisingly loyal and considerate towards her friends and kohai. Aki has two prominent traits that make her stand out more than the fact that she\u2019s a rich girl that\u2019s also relatively pretty. Her first trait is that she has a real intense hatred towards men and would humiliate any that try to ask her out usually by giving them embarrassing nicknames in a little show that she arranges. However, this doesn\u2019t have any effect on the number of men that confess to her. Her second but probably most notable trait is that she has a rather monstrous appetite for food so much in fact that im amazed that she can still maintain such a good figure. Like Masamune Aki\u2019s personality changes as the series goes on with her caring more about the feelings of others and being truer to herself. I felt that her seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi did a pretty good job portraying the character of Aki. \\n\\n\\n\r\nYoshino \\n\r\nYoshino voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Inori Minase of Re Zero and Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon fame is one of the main characters of the show. The personal maid of Aki and at the same time a supporter of Masamune Yoshino is a quiet, clumsy and shy girl who from surface appearances appears to be someone that\u2019s easily bullied and intimidated. However unknown to others Yoshino has another personally that\u2019s the opposite to what she appears to be to others. Beneath the clumsy exterior Yoshino is a cold, methodical and deceptive person that also a mind for strategy and deception. Yoshino\u2019s greatest asset is actually her analytical mind that can come up with the most devious of strategies that is mostly followed by Masamune to allow him to get further with his plans. These plans for the most part are usually funny and is mostly disinformation that Aki due to her naive nature easily falls for. At the same time, it\u2019s quite funny when seeing Yoshino try to safeguard her plans from interlopers in which she can quite intimidating which is best shown when the cast go to Aki\u2019s beach villa. As an analogy, Yoshino is more akin to a puppet master that manipulates both Masamune and her master Aki in her plans. Overall I feel that Inori Minase did a pretty good job voicing Yoshino.   \\n\\n\r\nTae \\n\r\nTae played by veteran seiyuu singer Azusa Todokoro is one of the support characters of the anime. A classmate of Masamune and the class rep of the class Tae is a positive, upbeat and earnest person that also has a rather weird fascination with BL. When not talking about BL Tae is a dependable student that tries to put the needs of the class first and foremost.  When Tae gets serious however she can become quite stubborn and not be willing to give up easy even when the odds are stacked against her. Despite that at her heart Tae is still a teenager and a maiden at heart and her confession to Masamune early on was quite unexpected but still sweet.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nKojuro \\n\r\nKojuro voiced by veteran seiyuu Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada and the seven witches fame and my fourth favourite seiyuu is one of the support characters of the show. A classmate of Masamune and Tae Kojuro is a positive, upbeat and somewhat shy person that is nonetheless loyal to his friends and classmates. The most notable trait of Kojuro is that due to his appearance he is often mistaken as a girl despite being a boy which I found to be pretty funny. This fact is often used against him by Tae when she due to her fascination with BL often pairs Masamune with him. Despite that Kojuro bears no hatred towards Tae and indeed treats the fact that he can be mistaken as a natural occurrence. It\u2019s interesting to note that Tae is popular with both boys and girls which is probably due to his quiet but helpful nature. As a support character Kojuro has more limited screen time than other characters but when he does appear he tends to bring a sort of comedic relief to the scene. Kojuro can be considered to be Masamune\u2019s best friend as he was the first person in class that he met plus he also provides some good advice to Masamune when needed. Overall I felt that Saori Hayami did a reasonable job portraying Kojuro though I felt that this role was a waste of her talents. \\n\\n\r\nNeko \\n\r\nNeko voiced by veteran seiyuu Suzuko Mimori of Denpa Kyoushi and Digimon Tri fame is one of the main support characters of the show. A rich girl from a reasonably rich family Neko is kind, caring and sincere and can be the ideal image of a good natured one. Masamune and Neko first met by chance halfway through the series though in actual fact they met ages ago. Neko actually has her own story arc within the main story that revolves around her relationship with Masamune and her love for him. Neko\u2019s most prominent traits is her kind and understanding nature and her utter devotion to Masamune which comes from her relationship with him. All in all, I felt that as a character Neko was a well-designed one that was also paired with an excellent seiyuu and thus making her one of the best characters on the series. In fact, after Aki she is undoubtedly one of the best girls on the series. I also like the fact that as a role Neko acts as a good contrast and counter to the likes of Aki in that they have opposite personalities.  This allows Neko to easily smooth over moments when things are tense. I felt that Suzuko Mimori did a pretty good job voicing Neko. \\n\\n\\n\r\nKanetsugu Gaso \\n\r\nKanetsugu Gaso voiced by veteran seiyuu Mitsuki Saiga is one of the main support characters of the show. A transfer student that shows up near the end of the series Kanetsugu is the spitting image of Masamune before he started his fitness regimen and acts as rival for Masamune in the main story. A good natured, kind hearted person that seems to be able to get on with just about anyone Kanetsugu is a rather simple person in that he doesn\u2019t seem to bear any ill intent towards anyone and in fact is nice to everyone that he meets. This easy-going nature enabled him to easily fit into the school after the transfer. His relationship with Aki serves as the main obstacle for the main plot in the latter half of the series but as he enters the series at such a late time the amount of damage that he can do is limited. However, the interesting thing about him is that his appearance which is a spitting image of how Masamune looked like before actually caused changes in Aki\u2019s behavior due in part to what his appearance has bought to her family. All in all, I felt that Kanetsugu helped bring a nice opponent to the game that Masamune is playing in that it forced him to be more active rather than going for the long game that he seems to have been playing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStudent council (Sonoka, Mari and Kikuon) \\n\r\nSonoka, Mari and Kikuon voiced by veteran seiyuu\u2019s Mariya Ise, Satomi Sato and Kanae Itou respectively are the members of the student council within the school that the cast attends in this series. The three are very loyal to Aki and share her belief that all males are up to no good. However humorously they also have a rather strange view of Aki who they seen to see as the man killer who represents the hopes of the girls that have been hurt by men by hurting them back by rejecting them. The three don\u2019t really have much of a role until the latter part of the series but their plans were actually quite funny.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nArts and animation \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs for each of the characters I felt was pretty well done and I especially like the uniforms that are worn by the main cast. Animation wise I felt the anime\u2019s animations were pretty well done with the animation being pretty crisp and clear and having a good balance of color in it. \\n\\n\r\nMusic \\n\\n\r\nI felt that the music that was used in the anime was reasonably done with the opening song that was sung by Aki\u2019s seiyuu Ayaka Ohashi being my favourite. The ending theme I though was also well done. \\n\\n\r\nVoice acting \\n\\n\r\nIn general I thought that the voice acting for each of the characters was done pretty well but I have to say that I was really impressed by Ayaka Ohashi who voiced Aki. The first and only other time that I heard her in was in Akame Ga kill in which she played the main character\u2019s sister. At that time, I felt her voice was ok but not standing out as much. In this however I was surprised by how much her voice has grown since then. I felt that Ayaka did a pretty good job voicing Aki who is not the easiest of characters to portray. Another seiyuu that I felt deserves special praise is Suzuko Mimori who voiced Neko. I felt that she did a great job portraying Neko helped by the fact that she has a pretty unique tone of voice which actually made Neko stand out more. \\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nAs an anime that is both a comedy and a romance story it is important that it strikes the balance between the two as featuring too many of one genre would affect the other genre as well. In this I felt that the series managed to accomplish this as Masamune Kun\u2019s revenge is filled not just with jokes and funny moments but also with a well-designed and though out romance story. The main story I felt was pretty interesting in that I never thought that a childhood trauma could actually cause a character to not just have the motivation to get fit but also to use that time to create a plan in which he hopes to use to get back at the person that wronged him in the past. Having this as the main plot I felt was a good move on the writer\u2019s part as it was both compelling and made the story stand out more. However, since this anime is a part comedy part love story the story was never designed to be serious but still it was enjoyable. The combo of being an anime that has both genres means that the anime has plenty of funny and sweet and cute moments between Aki and Masamune most of which are quite funny. I also felt that the support characters also did a great job in moving the story along while also advice and support to the main characters. Neko in particular was a pretty compelling character with her story arc being equally sweet and sad at the same time. Of course, the main thing that we look for in all animes is character development and im glad to say that just about every character that was featured had good levels of character development especially the leads. With a combination of an interesting premise, setting, story and a great cast of characters that are voiced by great cast of seiyuu\u2019s I felt that Masamune Kun\u2019s revenge was a pretty good anime and one that I enjoyed immensely. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This entire anime is literally just one long commercial to make people buy the manga and read it. Its like it started off all energetic and stuff but then all it did is just wander aimlessly like a lost child. If you watch anime regularly I expect that anti-climactic endings are something that do not shock you at all, in fact you might even be used to it. Sometimes an anime that ended anti-climactically can be so good and enjoyable that you're willing to let that ending slide, however, Masamune-kun no revenge is not one of them.\r\n*THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\nMasamune-kun no revenge is exactlywhat it sounds like... It has absolutely no revenge whatsoever even though that was supposed to be the main aim of the mc. Does it ever happen? no. Does it even get close? nope.  This anime was supposed to be about Masamune getting his revenge on Aki, this rich ass sadistic bitch who used to bully him as a child, When they meet in highschool she doesnt realize it's him, so Masamune uses that to his advantage and tries to make her fall for him, but obviously that's not easy bc she's a bitch/ tsundere, at around episode 4 or 5 suddenly a wild Neko appears and makes the anime just a little bit more easy to watch but because the mc is too preoccupied with his revenge he doesn't choose her. and I guess that's okay because this anime IS supposedly about his revenge... right? RIGHT?? Towards the end of the anime this new fat side character whose name I can't remember is introduced and is pretending to be the fat childhood friend of Aki. Ever since his appearance everything feels vague and incomplete, and it feels that the anime really lost its aim. Nothing is ever achieved by the end of the anime, the way the both Masamune and Aki feel towards each other is unclear, revenge doesn't happen and in fact Aki never even finds out that the fat kid in her childhood was actually Masamune.\\n\\n\r\n*END OF SPOILERS*\\n\\n\r\nStory - 1/10\\n\r\nArt - 7/10; The art was nothing new however some scenes were detailed, It was pretty to look at.\\n\r\nSound - 5/10; I'll give this a 5 because it was just average, the OP and ED never particularily stood out to me, but they never gave me a headache either.\\n\r\nCharacters - 3/10; pretty much all the characters are typical and cliche. I did like Neko, Yoshino and Kojuurou just a little bit though.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4/10; Even though everything was pretty expected and cliche, I'll give it points for making me laugh a few times, even if it was at how cliche it is.\\n\r\nOverall - 5/10\\n\r\nSide note: this is my first review so I'm not very experienced in this, and sorry for any grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language.",

For example, there is always someone with a beach house and of course, the school festival or play is one of those clich\u00e9s that apparently cannot be avoided. \r\nThe pacing was good, I guess, but the ending\u2026 seriously? Is that a way to tell us that there will be a second season? If that was the intention, please don\u2019t use the final episode was a karaoke competition\u2026 \r\nArt\r\nThe art style fits this anime withbeautiful sceneries and colors. I can at least say I enjoyed how the characters were portrayed. Something had to be good, right?\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nNot a memorable OST. It wasn\u2019t bad but not something that I will look afterward to download. It was still fitting the different scenes of each episode. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nYoshino was probably one of the characters that I will not forget because she was the one who surprised me. I thought she would be one of those sleepy, good for nothing characters that are only there to look dumb and cute but it turns out, she is definitely more interesting than it seems. I laughed in a lot of the scenes that included her and Masamune or even Masamune alone when he was having some weird monologs and wild imagination that made me laugh.\\n\r\nStill, Adagaki even with her reasons to be the way she is, I cannot sympathize with her. She takes things to far and I even find Fujinomiya more interesting than her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nI am not re-watching this in the future, I would only recommend this if that person enjoys some comedy and predictable romance with no expectations of something actually happening.\\n\r\nIf that\u2019s your thing, go for it.\\n",

            "content": "Ah Masamune-kun no Revenge! Or what I consider a pale imitation of Nisekoi, but instead of having a fake relationship, there is a revenge story between the male and female MCs. In a few words, this anime is trash and it is not worth your time. But, with a greater analysis...\r\nStory: 1.0/10\r\nWell, I have to admit that Nisekoi's story also is kind of shit, but just watching the chemistry between the characters was a little bit endearing. In M-knR, there is not something like that and the plot is just mind-numbing forced melodrama. I also cannot understand why he would become even more terrible ofa person just to take his revenge. Even if he got his revenge, none would ever like him anymore because he is a major jerk.  As far as originality goes, this show has none.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now to the icing of this disgusting cake:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 0.2/10\\n\\n\r\nLet me show you what I think of each character:\\n\\n\r\n-Masamune Makabe: A huge narcissistic jerk that I hope he gets karmic retribution. (If you saw Episode 8, you will know what I mean).\\n\r\n-Aki Adagaki (aka The Wicked Witch of the Show): A run of the mill tsundere who is just the unlikeable aspects of Chitoge (Nisekoi) in one person. Chitoge's mannerisms could be slightly justified because she is forced in a situation she hates to be in and she had difficulties during her childhood which is explained later in the anime. But Aki is just a cold, spoiled, savage c*** who is clearly a nasty person that you must stay away from as much as you can. \\n\r\n-Yoshino Kowai (the Master): The person that helps the main protagonist who is completely apathetic and feels nothing about him. Basically, Kosaki Onodera's friend from Nisekoi, but with a kawaii upgrade and a stone-faced mask.\\n\r\n-Neko Fujinomiya: An exact copy of Marika Tachibana from Nisekoi. Basically, a beautiful and polite girl whose kindness is just a facade since she suffers from an illness and knew the main protagonist from her childhood. Even though I hated Marika from Nisekoi as much as I do not like Neko, she is actually the character that I dislike the least. Go figure!\\n\r\n-Tae Futaba (aka The Stereotype of the Class Rep): Kosaki Onodera but without a soul. She is just a walking trope with no character.\\n\r\n-Kojuurou Shuri: A pale unmemorable imitation of Hideyoshi from BakaTest. Just your typical trap.\\n\r\n-Masamune's mom: Why a loli mom? Only in Anime!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, none of these characters is at least likable because either they are horrible persons or they are copies of characters already seen and done better in other shows. However, I feel a little empathy for Neko since she holds such a stance in her life even though she is sick.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 6.7/10\\n\\n\r\nI will admit that the art is actually fair to a certain extent, but it is generic as hell. And that sums up my thoughts about the animation.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nI did not like the op and the ost. The op was so annoying to listen to and the ost is as standard as it gets. The ed is not bad but it is unmemorable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 0.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is true that at the beginning I thought this show might actually be interesting but in the way of guilty pleasure. But after episode 4, it fails at even being that.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2.68/10\\n\\n\r\nMy recommendation is to avoid it. But if you get into this show, suit yourself. What I know is that this show is just deplorable for existing and it is yet another proof that anime quality has declined throughout the years. Off to the trash can! \\n\\n\r\nAlternative Recommendations:\\n\r\n-Nisekoi for doing this formula better in every way, although being the same sh*t.\\n\r\n-Trinity Seven for a way more interesting lead and with no Ice Queens.",

            "content": "So we're suppose to root for the guy wanting revenge...even though he's a horrible character himself?\r\nSo by this premise alone got LA interested and an *ahem* \"exotic\"  take on the romance genre, geared towards a protagonist who wants revenge through romance towards a love interest who too is a \"horrible character\" in the sense of her cruelty and extreme tsundereness.\r\nSo since we're talking characters...\r\nLet's start with our main protagonist, Makabe Masamune voiced by Natsuki Hanae, previously a kid bullied because he was fat and was a childhood friend and had a crush on our central love interest Aki Adagaki, but she turned her downwho nicknamed him \"Pig's Foot\" or \"Piggy\", thus years later, Makabe turned slim and wanted revenge on Aki by romancing Aki then dumping her...as much as this goal is horrible and the current Makabe IS a horrible character only thinking about revenge and him burning calories no matter what and is a complete dunce at romance in the first place, it doesn't give him much leeway into liking him....however the only thing that does IS his goal for revenge as weird as that sounds and that's because of Aki Adagaki herself voiced by Ayaka Ohashi, dubbed the \"Cruel Princess\", giving horrible nicknames to ANYONE who dares tries to go out with her and with her extreme tsundereness and general cold-hearted nature (besides her friends of course), she too is generally a horrible love interest BUT two horrible characters together is better than a horrible character together with a GREAT one right?. That leads into the best thing about their relationship, Yoshino Kowai voiced by Inori Minase, Aki's personal maid, she is the unpredictable factor and \"Master\" to Makabe in getting his revenge that makes this horrible relationship intriguing to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nMoving onto the other cast, we have Tae Futaba voiced by Azusa Tadokoro and Neko Fujinomiya voiced by Suzuko Mimori, THEY are the BEST characters in the anime overall for LA, Tae for being the general nice girl of the series and Neko for both her character development, unpredictable love interest and connection to Makabe as well as shaking up the entire revenge plot by making Neko \"a way out\" in  a ways, but nonetheless Tae and Neko were the best characters in an anime filled with horrible characters. The only other character to take note is the very feminine yet he's totally a guy Kojuurou Shuri voiced by......Saori Hayami and he's your expected friend of Makabe and is more a satellite character until he gains something of a development during the Cultural festival arc. \\n\\n\r\nNow there are a couple of flaws to note about Masamune-kun no Revenge. Let's easily start with Makabe himself, he is seriously your cliche, dunce about romance main male protagonist in a romance anime, his only thoughts are nothing but his revenge and his hobby of being constantly fit (and demeaning anyone who's remotely fat let alone romantic rival), he has a VERY one-track mind not making him very likable and for the majority of the time, he is and that directly factors into the romance not being believable in some sense due to how stupid both Makabe and Aki are (in the common sense and romance variety) to how crippling how Makabe's goal turns into as we start to get to know more about Aki's backstory as his goal slowly shifts away from revenge (heck add in Neko AND Kanetsugu Gasou voiced by Mitsuki Saiga into this mix and his goal strays even further!) as to whether he'll succeed or not. But to this anime's defense, both the straying away from his main goal and how both horrible our main leads are kinda WANTS us to root for Makabe's goal (depends but you get LA point with this), thus because of how sadistic and horrible Makabe is, makes US the people who root for Makabe's root somewhat sadistic too and this anime kinda knows what these characters are, no matter how horrible or good they are. Next is that before Neko's appearance, there's a bit of a lull concerning the pacing of the plot with Makabe's futile attempts at wooing her and it's episodic feel to it was the lull, LA kinda just wanted something crazy to arrive and that crazy and this defense turned out to be Neko!. Finally, the last flaw is how many cliche they pull from this anime, we have our typical beach, test of courage, cultural festival and our main protagonist being a dunce at romance all listed BUT once again, to this anime's credit, although NOT all put a crazy twist to it (see test of courage and beach episodes), but for the rest, they do put in a crazy twist to it's proceedings making it at least a bit interesting to it. Ohhh and to add a bit of salt to the flaws, the ending leaves it as it is, still having Makabe's goal still hanging with a hint if there's gonna be another season...it's a \"read the manga\" ending alright.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Studio Sliver Link, the animation is decent enough with vibrant and polished character designs and with ok backgrounding makes the anime very good to look at. -sigh- if anything, the animation is decent but not the focal point of this anime overall and LA thinks the anime itself knows this, it's not the animation as it's characters, ironic for a main male protagonist who cares NOTHING BUT APPEARANCE.\\n\\n\r\nAs for voice cast is where things get interesting however, we have Ayaka Ohashi as the Cruel Princess Aki and this ISN'T the first time LA saw her voicing a quote \"horrible character\" unquote before, LA thought Natsuki Hanae was acceptable as Makabe as he had the right tones of being an ass and narcissistic as possible. Suzuko Mimori as a mysterious girl with ojou vocals?...seen it but nonetheless did a great job as Neko. Inori Minase as a maid who has a dark side with deadpan vocals..where has LA heard THAT before?...again seen it but still great performance from Inori Minase as well. The minor voice cast did decent with some well known names as well such as Yui Ogura as Makabe's loli mother (no seriously, with all her squeakiness to boot!), Kanae Ito, Mariya Ise and Satomi Sato as Aki's friends of Kikuon Kiba, Sonoka Kaneko and Mari Mizuno respectively (with LA really liking Satomi Sato's role in playing against the type of the cute yet sadistically coordinated thorn in Makabe's side). The weird but fitting choice is Saori Hayami as Kojuurou, why?...is because of Saori's purposeful feminine vocals in a guy role, nonetheless as weird as it is, is a GREAT playing against the type role for Saori. Overall, this voice cast is decent with some hidden gems here and there (those hidden gems being Satomi Sato, Saori Hayami and Suzuko Mimori being LA's favourite voice actor in Masamune-kun no Revenge).\\n\\n\r\nYes, Masamune-kun no Revenge has lots of flaws especially concerning the main goal and focus of the anime and even worse if you don't like the main romance can easily turn you off with this anime, but LA kep throwing this word, but it's kinda \"exotic\" look at a revenge story within a cliche romance story and that intrigue is kinda what kept LA going through all this and even to the point LA consciously started to root for the growing beta couple *cough Neko best girl *cough* by the later episodes, LA still kinda saw some potential in Makabe's conquest for revenge in all the kerfuffle that occurs. Masamune-kun no Revenge entirely relies on the audience to root for our main leads as horrible as they are, whether you do or not WILL differ the experience at looking at this anime. For LA, LA hated these our main leads at first but kinda wanted Makabe's goal to succeed (as well as not seeing the cliches laid in front of LA), but as the anime went on with more characters and chaos added to it, LA started legitimately wanting Makabe and Aki to get together as well as really liking the anime as cliched as it is all due how it defies expectations \"at times\" AAAAAND Neko best girl.",

            "content": "This is very disappointing\r\nWith a really fresh start, I literally hoped the show will end on something that will be satisfying.\r\nInstead of that, we see a male main character that didn't accomplish anything major at all.\r\nThe story is worse than some harem/romance that I've watched, The story is clich\u00e9 and similar plots can be seen in other shows. I can hardly see any good thing at how the romance in this story is bring handled, There is multiple girls on one guy but obviously because of the plot, the main coupling cannot be toppled (Just like other animes), the story stopped going forward at onepoint just to announce at the end about a possible super clich\u00e9 second season.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is ok,  but the colors are a little too satured for my taste and it looks like the characters were drawn in a little hurry in the few last episodes. There is not a lot of elements that can define a character's personality. The animation in the other side is pretty mediocre, it feels like closing and opening the eyes 10 times per second.\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds are also ok, The opening and ending weren't complete garbage, the voice actors did their job at interpreting their characters, The ost during the scenes did the trick at setting up the mood.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's see the characters.... Completely c.l.i.c.h.\u00e9. (maybe not completely) but the general aspects of all the main characters are definitely something you shouldn't expect to be original, (Tsundere: Done ; Loyal and Passionate Girl : Done ; Normal Girl : Done) It looks like a copy paste of the characters of Nisekoi which is a copypaste of something else (with few exeptions), Character developpement is here but not as satisfying as I thought.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment : I did enjoyed few parts of the anime but most of the time, I just sat in front of the screen watching silentely.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:  I think it's a great anime for starters and casuals but in my opinion for someone that is pretty accustomed to good shows (Which I'm definitely not) I think it isn't worth the stop.\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, no hate mate.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun no Revenge is the kind of anime that would inevitably come out every season. It is, in essence, a harem, high school life, comedy, light romance show. It is the kind of show that would appeal to younger anime fans, especially those with less experience in knowing the tropes and cliches in the industry. \r\nDon't get me wrong. Just because an anime roots itself in a genre that can easily be seen as cliched does not mean it has to be so. My subjective opinions aside, there are definitely some good shows that I've seen in the past in this genre that have someunique aspects to them. However, Masamune is definitely not one of them. It does have a premise that has potential. As it turns out, though, the plot is more or less filled with tropes from the standard drama shows, of which plot development depends on. The eye-catching premise of \"revenge for childhood rejection\" is just another excuse to make the main romantic pairing, without going very deep.\\n\\n\r\nOne of the things that this show suffers from is that it tries to adapt the entire source material so far in 12 episodes. While even the source story is not complex, adapting the whole thing in one season turned out to be not so great. The show starts off fine, but rushes through character relationship with other main heroines during the middle, only to abruptly sweep them aside as \"side characters\" to make way for the main heroine in the end. While this seems to be the standard adaptation practice for harem shows nowadays, it is still very bad for the story.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else is there to say? If you've seen a dozen shows in this genre you can predict how the story is going to go. The artwork is vibrant and character design is quite nice, but there is no \"wow\" factor to be found in visuals. BGM and theme songs are typical JPOP. If you enjoy it, you would like the music. Obviously, songs vocalized by upstart seiyuus are nowhere near the levels of \"professional music\", as you would expect. I would not call the main characters flat, but their depth are quite far from being intricate. In fact, the main girl is the amalgam of two tropes: ojousama and tsundere. The protagonist is just... another male harem lead. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Masamune is an above average harem show, but still deeply entrenched in cliches and tropes of the genre without its own quirks. Most people who enjoyed watching this show would probably not going to remember its title after a while.\\n\\n\r\n5.5/10",

            "content": "Romance in anime is a laborious task.  The standard plotline for romance anime is to make the ending of the entire series the confession where the two main characters get together, and the entire runtime is a slog up to that point with the majority of it being the classic will they/won't they push/pull action that gets cumbersome and tiring after it has been done over and over again.  So, does Masamune-kun's Revenge break that mold?  If I'm being honest here, kind of?\r\nStory: Makabe Masamune was a kid, a very chubby fat kid when he was young.  During his youth, hemade friends with a rich girl named Adagaki Aki, and a friendship between the two sparked.  But one day, after being bullied repeatedly, Masamune asks Aki to defend him and help him out of his predicament, only to be spat on and thrown away like a piece of garbage.  Now in high school with a body shaven down to that of a male model, Masamune returns with sworn vengeance against Aki.  His plan: Make her fall in love with him.  Then dump her!  MUAHAHAHA!!!\\n\\n\r\nAs ridiculous as the plot sounds, Masamune-kun's revenge is an interesting twist on the romance formula.  Though watching it has a lot of moments that will have predictable results, the plotline follows the classic revenge plot that's not too commonly seen in the romance genre.  Each episode follows Masamune's progress to try and raise Aki's flags and try to achieve the end goal of dumping her to make her feel the pain that he felt many years ago.  For this, I have to commend the series for trying something that feels new, and it doesn't part from the series's runtime at any point in the show.  While yes it's not completely immersed in the revenge plot, as many common highschool anime tropes like the school festival, beach episode, etc, are used as the backdrops for many of its episodes, they at least feel different enough to not just feature them just for the sake of having them.  (Though your mileage may vary on some of those tropes.)  \\n\\n\r\nAdditionally, the plot features several 'wrenches' in Masamune's plan in the form on new characters that get introduced in the middle and last areas of the series.  These characters help make up the majority of the later arcs of the series and help serve as catalysts to further Masamune's revenge plot.  The quality of these characters vary however, as some of them work while others could've been handled better.  \\n\\n\r\nThe downside to the whole series however comes in the form of the series's ending and its overall pacing.  This adaptation covers roughly 30 chapters of the original manga, and succeeds in squeezing in all of that content in 12 episodes by cutting out a lot of seemingly unnecessary scenes.  As someone who reads the manga, the story still holds up, but the last arc that they decided to do for this adaptation could've been handled better, as the last three episodes that were used for that arc rushed through the content and created some disparity in the urgency of the situation.  Not only that, but the anime ends on a 'read the manga' ending, where they tease the next arc in the last few scenes of the anime before ending it off.  To anyone who doesn't read the original series, this leaves a bad taste in anyone's mouth, and it honestly bugged me cause I feel like they could've handled it a little better.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ The revenge plot stays consistent\\n\r\n+ Doesn't feel too too generic\\n\r\n-  Uneven pacing at the end\\n\r\n-  Read the manga ending\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: While I do praise the story for having some form of originality with how it plays out anime highschool scenes, characters, particularly one, have some faults that I really want to point out.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the easy stuff.  Makabe Masamune.  Having an extremely vain personality to the point that he has on occasion spent time looking at himself in the mirror, Masamune is our MC hellbent on making Aki pay for her past transgressions.  While seemingly one-note, Masamune progresses through the series trying to make heads or tails about what his true intentions are with trying to make Aki confess to him.  I feel like there's genuine growth with him as the series progresses, and the whole thought of trying to make his revenge happen feels like it persists, but changes in how he does it the longer the series goes on.  Personally, I quite like Masamune.  While he might not be the most original character, there's something about him that feels worthwhile to watch.  And that's honestly something that I don't find a lot of in most MCs.  Especially those in romance anime.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Kowai Yoshino, the large-breasted (cause we always need one of these kinds of girls) stone-faced girl who's the personal attendant of Adagaki Aki.  Largely playing a supporting role in the series, Yoshino acts as Masamune's ally in helping him with his revenge against her mistress and spends the majority of the series working from behind the scenes and aiding our main character whenever he needs a little help to get things working.  She's a seemingly clueless girl with a silver tongue and while not important beyond being a mentor for Masamune on how to deal with Aki and/or pulling strings behind the scenes, Yoshino does play a big role in the series even if it doesn't seem like it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd...last but not least...Adagaki Aki...  Being honest here, I don't like this girl.  Aki is what you would come to expect when it comes to a main rich love interest in a romance series.  A spoiled tsundere brat who lengthens the series more by being stubborn and hardheaded while both never being true to your feelings and being a bitch in the process.  No matter how many times the series tries to make her seem cute by making her clueless to the world or inhaling unholy amounts of food into that frail-looking body of hers, Aki exists as Masamune's struggle to fulfill his plan.  Sure we may understand a little bit more about her as time goes on, but the first impression and the trope she represents is god fucking awful, and I didn't realize how much I didn't like her until I watched the adaptation.  I didn't like her while reading the manga, but the anime told me again and intensified why I didn't like her in the first place.  \\n\\n\r\nOther characters fall into one of two categories.  Side characters like Koujuuro and Futaba are those that persist throughout the series and are basically dragged along to the romance drama that goes on in the series, and ones like Neko are characters who have the arc wrapped around them with changes to Masamune in particular packaged along with them.  Neko in particular is the more interesting one of the lot, as she has a large portion of the middle of the series dedicated to her arc, which is a section of the story that was given the attention it deserved, and for that I'm grateful.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Most of the MCs don't feel too trope-ish\\n\r\n+ Most side characters have a great real of relevance, screentime, and impact\\n\r\n-  Aki's a bitch \\n\\n\r\nArt:  Silver Link's bad habit of taking on multiple shows in a single season has reared its ugly head on more than one occasion.  Winter 2017 has them take on two shows, and Masamune is one of those two.  So how does it fair?  To be honest, not bad.  \\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun's art is largely what I would say is standard fare for the company.  The colors are light, the art has little to no flaws with the quality of the drawings, and everything looks pretty good.  Admittedly there're no dramatic action scenes or anything that require hundreds of frames in order to animate correctly, so that would help save time and money, I suppose.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+/- Art is standard fare\\n\\n\r\nSound: Admittedly, the soundtrack is not really all that's cracked up to be.  It's not a bad OP or ED to listen to, and there were a few times where I didn't feel like skipping them, but they're just...not worth remembering.  Which for me, is a bit of a disappointment, as we have \"Elemental World\" by ChouCho as the ED, which was a bit of a lackluster track to listen to considering the artist has stuff like Prillya's 4th season OP and Heaven's memopad's OP under her belt as previous works.  It just doesn't stack up, so I'm not too bothered wth the sound.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  I honestly like this series.  As someone who has the majority of their lists consist of romance stuff, Masamune-kun separates itself from the pack by being a more interesting version of your slow-paced romance.  Sure, it's expected that the two MC's will get together, but at the very least, the journey that they're taking to reach that point is something different.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nI did.  Particularly Neko.  I love Neko.  She's a fun character that adds quite a bit of impact in the middle portion of the series.  Which ends up becoming naught because best girl never wins anything, now do they?\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nAside from the clear and obvious one of our main 'heroine' (if you can even call her that), the whole last arc didn't sit right with me.  It felt too fast-paced and I was disappointed with the execution.  Also with what happened to Neko.  I don't think a lot of people were happy with what happened to Neko.  Did I mention that I'm a fan of Neko?  Neko.  (Insert more \"Neko\"s here.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a different kind of romance anime that doesn't stray too far from the norm, Masamune-kun's revenge is probably your best bet.  It tries to do something different from the generic romance anime formula and manages to pull it off fairly well.  The ending is a bit annoying, Aki's insufferable, and best girl doesn't win, but it still has entertainment value nonetheless.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun was a very average romance anime. Despite it's interesting premise, it was in no shape or form a masterpiece. Basically Masamune wants to get revenge on this girl who dissed him when he was a kid. Even though like I said, it's an interesting premise for a romance anime. Despite this, it is very cliche. Some people are going to enjoy this show, some won't. Personally i found it simply boring. Most of the show is all bark and no bite and comes off as a \"Villain of the Week\" type story. It has a formula of Masamune gets into a problem with hisplan, then he needs help. I'll get into this more later. \\n\\n\r\nStory- 6 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe basic premise for this story is, like I said, revenge. When Masamune (our mc) got bullied as a kid by a girl who rejected him, he tries to make her fall in love with him so he can reject her like she did to him. I mean, it's pretty interesting compared to the traditional romance formula. This isn't to say the traditional romance is bad, since I did enjoy shows like Kaichou wa Maid-sama. However, the formula to this show is very routine and uninteresting after a few episodes. It becomes very systematic, and frankly boring. It goes like this: Masamune is in trouble, and needs the help of his master Yoshino to help him. And that's basically how it is every week. The twist was okay, but it doesn't really get explained too much. I was confused for a while when it happened. This show sounds like it'd be a really intense drama, and that's what i thought when I read the description. It ends up being a romantic comedy. I feel it would have worked much better the other way, with a more heavy tone. This anime was mostly talk and little action. Half of the story took way too long to get through, and some of it didn't even really give too much character development. Now, for the ending... I really shouldn't spoil anything, but I'll say it's completely lackluster form what you'd probably expect. But by the last episode, I saw it coming. It comes off as plain depressing. Overall, there isn't much wrong per say with the story, more it's just nothing special and could have been executed better than it was. \\n\\n\r\nArt- 8 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe art style was very similar to shows like SAO and the like. It is a good looking show, and I have to give it credit for that. There's nothing too special about it, though it does look very clean and polished. I guess some of the characters are cute if that's what you're looking for. Nothing much to say here.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 6 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nSimilarly to the art, there isn't much to say here. The into forshadows a lot of what will happen in the series, and does have a catchy tune. I felt that the ED was bland and uninteresting as well. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 5 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of this show are kind of a mixed bag. Many are uninteresting but there are a few good ones. \\n\\n\r\nAdagaki- She's the main antagonist of this show. Guess what? She's the generic ruthless tsundere. This was probably the least interesting character in the entire show even though she should have been one of the most important ones. Not to mention she was infuriating to deal with.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune- He's our MC. He isn't too bad as a character. He's intelligent and knows what he's doing for the most part. He also gets the most character development since he eventually has a relationship with another character (Fujinomiya).\\n\\n\r\nFujinomiya- She's another uninteresting character. Half the time I forgot she existed. She almost ruins Masumne's plans and then gets sick. It was kinda hard to deal with her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 4 out of 10\\n\\n\r\nLike I said, many characters were uninteresting and bland, as well as the story. I fast fowarded through some of these episodes to the important parts because it was just that grating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 6 out of 10.",

Theres a beach episode, love triangles, small tiddy tsundere, melodrama. great. fine. what more do i want right. \r\nBut then it slowly descended into confusing the audience with the main character actuallymixing up the boundaries between liking the girl and just trying to make her fall for him. it genuinely felt like he liked her the whole episode but then at the end he would say some sly shit like ' fuck yueah this is all for my revenge lmoa' not buying it buddy. its just fucking confusing since i obviously want to fulfill my dreams of having a qt 2D waifu vicariously through this cartoon but then he shoots me in the dick by still going on with this revenge shit. the show just totally lost its plot.\\n\\n\r\nThe end is shit. the fat boy is just annoying and confusing. the two or three un-introduced girl characters that just pop up are fucking confusing. sure there was a nice moment in the final episode but it doesnt really forgive the producers for fucking cucking me like this. \\n\\n\r\ni get it, its meant to be a total tease to sell some paper copies but for a casual anime watching fedora wizard like myself , it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth when something had potential to be a pretty good romcom SoL cartoon. I did enjoy most of it tho. If you like the typical traits of school romcom SoL anime. this is fine.\\n\\n\r\nbest girl - was adagaki, then it was neko, for one episode it was that boy that looks like a girl and is pretty much a girl but then it was adagaki again but then the ending kinda sucked so the best girl was actually the loli mom.",

It's a lot different than other harems out there because this has a unique plot. I think the anime is a bit underrated but I can see why some people can criticize this series. If you like plot and harems then this is for you. \r\nIf you guys want to know what this is about then heres the gist of it. This isabout a boy who wants revenge on this nasty attitude girl from way back when. Apparently he wants revenge by making this girl named Adagaki Aki fall in love. This boy wants to take revenge because he was being made fun of by the way he looked like. \\n\\n\r\nAdagaki Aki was the biggest scar in his past and now he wants revenge. Not everything goes according to plan but you will have to watch it to find out those revenge tactics. I really like this series and this character Masamune. I think he will get this revenge.",

I will try to convey what i feel like went wrong in this series. The art and sound are mediocre, the characters are unrelatable and somwhat boring, and the show lacks alot of humor. On top of it all some of the plot points and episodes are suspiciously similar to Nisekoi. The story is what originally drew me in as i have always had a soft spot for cheesy rom-coms. But i do realise its not something to be praisingthe anime for.\\n\\n\r\n-Spoilers-\\n\\n\r\nBut the thing I have the most problems with is the ending. And it made me so mad i almost lost it. The whole point of the series is centered around the fact that he was a childhood friend and that he would get his revenge, but nothing happens. Nothing. I remember watching the last episode as i watch the timer slowly go downwards, i remember patiently waiting for the big finale. But as the timer slowly came closer and closer to zero. I realised that there would be no finale. I immediatly started searching for some kind of season 2, just to have some kind of conclusion. But absolutely nothing happens, meaning that i have succesfully wasted 4 hours of my life on a trash anime that lead nowhere.

            "content": "I usually would have a much more comprehensive and outlined review because that's just how I like to do things and it makes it easier for people to understand my points. BUT THIS ONE WILL BE AN EXCEPTION AND I WILL  JUMP RIGHT INTO SPOILERS AND I'M JUST GONNA BE EVERYWHERE. If you haven't, please do watch the anime first before reading this review. You'll have a much better understanding of what I'm about to talk about. Also, I might come off as harsh with this review but I just have a lot of questions, that's all. I actually don't despise this anime forthe record.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I only really have only have one question: WHY?\\n\\n\r\nWHY on earth would you give me a revenge plot only for you to not even commit to it in the end? I understand having other arcs in your story but abandoning your main narrative doesn't really count as an artistic choice. You just come off as confusing. I actually had some form of anticipation in the very beginning since the plot line is something I'm not very familiar with when it comes to RomCom. A revenge story, cool, will they actually fall in love? Will he actually reject her spectacularly and get another girl? Or will it just have such a sad ending that nobody is happy at all? DAMNED IF I KNOW. This anime was too busy focusing on Masamune THINKING about his revenge and never gets on with it. IF YOU'RE GONNA TEASE ME WITH A ROMANCE BETWEEN THEM, THEN GO WITH IT YOU COWARDS. Otherwise, stick with what you intended.\\n\\n\r\nWHY would you give me a memory of the protagonist being rejected by the heroine because he was fat only to show me that she actually liked him being fat?! YOU DIDN'T EVEN EXPLAIN WHY HE WAS REJECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE. The beginning episode of this anime will greet you with the arc of Masamune working out for the past 8 years of his life because he was rejected by Aki and called him a pig. We get reminded of this \"tragic\" backstory quite often through his flashbacks. My one concern though is the fact that later on in the series, Aki mentions that she actually loved Masamune when he was fat. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?! I get it, you wanna mix things up. Cool. Good for you. But at least  give me something to connect those two ideas with. For starters, it was never really revealed to Aki that Masamune was the fat kid in the past, so if you wanted that to happen, tough luck bud, it was only teased. Secondly, why did Aki call him a pig and rejected him if she actually liked him? We even see in Masamune's flashback that he had flowers for her but when she rejected him, he just dropped it on the spot, THEN in Aki's flashback, she actually found the flowers and waited for him to come back, which he never did since he did get rejected. SO WHAT DID HAPPEN? Give me something. Clear it up please. You don't even have to tell me the whole thing,  it can be subtle. Otherwise I'm just here thinking one of them has a false memory or something.\\n\\n\r\nWHY is he still plotting revenge? Look, in the beginning, the plot was actually sounding pretty neat-o. I was genuinely interested for a while. But after everything that plays out, especially with Neko and Gasou coming in, Masamune didn't need his revenge anymore. WHAT'S THE POINT OF THIS ANIME? Neko fell in love with him. Gasou (which by the way is a man who pissed me off at first but when I saw his character as a whole, he really doesn't have bad intentions) is gonna be married to Aki. There really is no loss here if he gave up on her. It would be much different if Masamune ACTUALLY fell in love with her and they develop romance. OR HELL, YOU CAN EVEN GO ON WITH YOUR REVENGE PLOT AND I'LL SUPPORT YOU, BUT PLEASE, ACTUALLY STICK WITH IT. But no, the anime ends in a cheesy \"oh are they gonna kiss?\" thing. I think they had intentions for a second season which honestly sounds like it's just gonna drag this story pretty long when it could've honestly been told with 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nSo what's the verdict? Well, you can probably tell I'm not the biggest fan. Saying that I'm disappointed would mean I had some form of expectation, which I honestly didn't. It was (personally) an enticing plot but it falls apart immediately. There were some parts that I enjoyed but to be honest,  the only thing that sticks out is the fact that this anime seems to not have an idea of how to go through with his EPIC revenge plot that they decided to half-ass the ending. If you still find yourself liking this, well, to each our own I suppose.\\n",

Whenever someone hurt us, whenever someone insult is, it already became our way of thinking to fight back, to get even. Though the concept of this anime is somewhat cliche, there is also something that capture my attention when watching this one. There is one thing I'm waiting to play in front of my eyes. I want the protagonist to be himself. To take away his mask and show the true him. Like what Neko said, he is charming and he just did not realize it. It is not worthit to waste his time taking revenge to someone. In short, I ship Neko and Makabe, always!\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt is always the tsundere one who's going to end up in a romance anime. But I hope in this one, Neko will end up with Makabe. He is too charming and simple minded. He is also a kind person and he take action to help as long as he can. Ge is somewhat narcissist and full of himself but it's what makes him cute. Cause he really does not know anything, most of the time. And who appreciate it all? Who's the person who accept it? I don't hate a tsundere character, in fact, I love Taiga's personality in Tora Dora. But of course, it's not always pushing away those people around them, a simple voicing out of their feelings would be good enough. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND AND ANIMATION: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nMasamune Makabe looks like Kirito of SAO, and the protagonist of the series The devil is a part timer, and also the one in Black Bullet. Oh! If Makabe looks like Kirito and Neko looks like Asuna, is there a chance that they'll end up together? The animation is somewhat common, but it's good. And I do love the song with Hadapure, though I really don't know it. Is it from a child's TV Program? The voices of the character also suit each others expression and actions. While the song is catchy and entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis series is cute and funny. Sometimes, it's also annoying that I want to take Aki away from the scenario. Well, that just means I'm hooked up watching it. I think it's somewhat a typical story, but watching something like this from time to time is good and the way the story deliver the scenarios are great so it breakeven. \\n\\n\r\nENDING: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThis really tear my heart. Where's the next episode? I want to know who will end up together. I want to see more of Makabe's expression. When he's serious. When he's in pain. When he get enough of Aki's attitude and give up. I did want to continue it by reading in manga but after I'd check it out, it seems that the continuation is not that far. I'll be wating for season 2. Neko and Makabe please!\\n",

The MC was not a cookie cutter character and the reasons for his actions made sense.  The secondary characters had their own motivations but some of reasons are kept hidden/unclear to help add to the suspense.  I would like another season of this anime but like so many others that actually are worthy of one I doubt it as they need room for another lame season of dudes doing sports, or trying to make cooking exciting.  Also,ignore most of the reviews I think they are just upset that this is an original story that doesn't fit within a mold.",

            "content": "Let me start of with saying I did really enjoy the anime and I think most of this review will be based on things they did wrong with little things about what I enjoyed.. It's what I do ok? SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 7/10: So.. the main story is based on a guy whose trying to get revenge for being rejected by a girl who humiliated him as a child. So plot wise, I thought this was actually pretty decent and it could of made for some killer drama moments where the two finally come together and realize that they're actually childhood friends... But at last itdid not come down to that! The series ended quickly with basically so many unsolved questions and it could of gone a hundred different ways! The ending definitely was the worst thing about this entire show and if there is no season 2 then I think they've got a screw loose... The story was decent though and it made for some interesting parts! I loved the part where he gave her the cold shoulder and she couldn't take it anymore, I was really hoping to see another one of those and I'm definitely a big fan of those situations! \\n\r\nI like to see how the endings go to animes before watching and tbh.. I'm glad I do this because if it's not a happy ending then I'll try not to bother watching it.. It's just how I am and I probs won't change. I did enjoy the little thing with the fiance thing at the end and wish it would of been solved before it ended but it didn't and I'm bitter inside because of it! Overall to sum this up.. Really good story line which could of gone so many ways and I'm glad it went this way! I really enjoyed it and it made for interesting twists and turns!\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Art is decent and I didn't really find anything drastically wrong with it at any point! \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: Same goes for sound, it had some nice soundtracks at some points and nothing really felt out of place..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10: I thoroughly enjoyed each character in their separate way and also the main protagonist was really enjoyable to watch! Although I dislike the types of characters like Aki and don't approve of them in anime, I still enjoyed parts of her character including alot of her backstory to the entire thing! Even though alot of it was unanswered, I would of really liked to see more of her cute/romantic side! \\n\r\nSupporting characters were fairly decent and none of them were over used to a point where it made no sense for them to be there..\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really enjoyed the watch and would recommend it to anyone whose looking for a semi-decent comedy with a good romance story line! BUT do NOT get your hopes with it all working out in the end! Unless a season 2 is released then do not watch this hoping for everything to end up solved and they run happily off into the sun set together!",

The number of times that I felt the show went off on an unnecessary tangent or avoided character development was too many. As for the finale... well, it lacks any sort of resolution, and hardly even provides a hook to pull you into a second season. In my opinion, the last few episodes were half-assed, especially the finale. I spent a good ten minutes after the last episode looking for where the next one was, not out of excitement or want to watch more, but just because I felt so dissatisfied with the endingof it that I thought there would be something better to come. I'd watch a second season, but only if there's going to be some sort of actual resolution in development. \\n\\n\r\nWould not recommend.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nWhen I was a teenager, my mother and I would sometimes try to spook the other for fun.\r\nI can\u2019t remember who started it, but my mother was mad because it often happened near a dangerous area: the steps leading into the basement. The door would be closed, and someone would round the corner after reaching the top, only to find the spookster ready and waiting.\r\nIt was initially revenge on both ends. \u201cShe scared me, so I\u2019m going to scare her back\u201d and vice versa. But the petty revenge eventually waned and it became more ofa \u201cgame\u201d that kept us on our toes.\\n\\n\r\nNowadays, my spooking habits are over. No more revenge either. Yet Masamune-kun no Revenge reminds me of just how far some people are willing to go to exact the latter (minus the spookiness).\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nPoor Masamune-kun of Masamune-kun no Revenge has been bullied his entire life. His only friend as a kid was a young girl by the name of Aki Adagaki. However, she also (presumably) turned on Masamune-kun, going so far as to call him \u201cPig\u2019s Foot.\u201d In that moment, Masamune-kun concocted the ultimate revenge plan against her: become the hunkiest hunk imaginable, make her fall in love with him, and turn her down as cruelly as possible.\\n\\n\r\nWhen thinking about the anime, it\u2019s actually a very fun setup. In other, similar stories where the show \u201casks\u201d the audience to place themselves in the shoes of the main protagonist \u2013 otherwise known as \u201cself-insert\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s usually done with someone as plain, as normal, and as unassuming as possible. All to feel as though the audience are the ones in his or her shoes.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge takes a slightly different approach. Rather than \u201cbecoming\u201d the main character, the audience gets to live vicariously through him. Beefing up? Regulating a diet? Dedicating a portion of a lifetime to exact some petty revenge? A lot of people don\u2019t have or cannot have the chance at such a life, so the anime provides that opportunity for them.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it does so with the usual rom-com-drama direction in mind. A normal venture for most viewers given that the anime doesn\u2019t do anything exceptionally unique.\\n\\n\r\nComedically, the anime (understandably) achieves most of its laughs through the characters\u2019 attempts at maintaining their facades. Aki hiding away to munch on a lot of fattening foods all cute like. Masamune-kun cursing Aki under his breath. Neko coughing up \u201cblood.\u201d This constant contrast of the characters easily gets at the laughs the anime aims for.\\n\\n\r\nDoubly so when the characters clash and interact. Masamune-kun\u2019s \u201cson of a bitch\u201d line during Aki\u2019s rapid-fire, mid-hallway questioning comes out of nowhere in hysterical fashion. And his mother worries about her baby boy when she believes him to be catching a cold, sprinting into the room with blankets and love at the ready. None of these examples even count the harsh responses from Yoshino or the running gag of Kojuurou always tagging along with the girls despite being a boy himself. In short, Masamune-kun no Revenge can be quite the funny show when it so chooses.\\n\\n\r\nDramatically, the anime doesn\u2019t always do its best, for it can sometimes lean on many a clich\u00e9 rather than going for more inventive setups. Opening the dressing-room curtain as Aki undresses earns Masamune-kun a punch to the face. Later, he saves her from an oncoming vehicle to win her heart. The whole group tackles the super-common test of courage while away at a private island. Then, near the end of the show, there\u2019s the classic (in this case Snow White) on-stage, mid-play kiss.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not all clich\u00e9s, though. In using its fa\u00e7ade premise, the anime takes the time to present its plot through other means. Small flashbacks of the characters provide better insight on their pasts. Their inner thoughts in the moment feel natural given the motif. And it has a few memorable scenes, too, like when Neko lays bare her own feelings to Masamune-kun in her room. In this sense, the anime balances its comedy with a reasonable level of drama.\\n\\n\r\nRomantically, Masamune-kun no Revenge does have its moments, too. There\u2019s sacrifice when Masamune-kun gets injured from a crazy dude with scissors, and there\u2019s affection when Aki gets extremely shy when she can\u2019t comprehend why Masamune-kun has been ignoring her on purpose for so long. Much like the comedy and the drama, the romance can work. If only because Masamune-kun and Aki must do a lot to make it work, giving their romance a more meaningful backing.\\n\\n\r\nYet much of the romance feels like a game of one step forward, two steps back. Masamune-kun will often have those romantic moments \u2013 only it goes nowhere or, even worse, regresses their relationship. This annoyance amplifies when Neko officially arrives. Aki\u2019s about to reveal her feelings for him, but Neko throws herself into his arms. Masamune-kun is distracted by Neko stealing the picture of him as a kid, angering Aki when he doesn\u2019t listen to her. He gives Aki the cold shoulder when he leaves Neko\u2019s hospital room.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, it\u2019s a lot of highs and lows mixed between the comedy, the drama, and the romance. If any one item should be discussed, though, it\u2019s the final arc due to its conflicting nature.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Gasou appears, it does feel entirely too convenient since he shows up out of nowhere and Masamune-kun just-so-happens to be out of the loop as he trains in the mountains without cell service. Worse still, Gasou maximizes that romantic regression seen multiple times throughout the season, practically ruining all that Masamune-kun had done up to this point.\\n\\n\r\nIn all honesty, it\u2019s very annoying to watch unfold. But (as hard as it is to admit) that\u2019s exactly how it should feel. If Gasou\u2019s interference wasn\u2019t frustrating, then this plot point wouldn\u2019t be doing its job. Not to mention, it\u2019s a natural extension of the plot itself. Masamune-kun cannot reveal his true identity without compromising his revenge, so a \u201crival\u201d impersonating him simply makes sense on a narrative level.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, the final episode is poorly constructed. It gives the audience the climax of the plot: Masamune-kun kisses Adagaki. The kiss itself doesn\u2019t really have any emotional foundation since it\u2019s tied to the play in which it happens. But it still gives the audience the satisfaction of seeing the two destined lovebirds having a decidedly special moment together. That\u2019s pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat\u2019s bad comes in the second half of the episode, and it\u2019s a two-fold problem.\\n\\n\r\nOne, the anime doesn\u2019t resolve its last conflict. Gasou doesn\u2019t leave Aki\u2019s side let alone have his cover blown. Instead, he sticks around, the whole group taking part in an awkward karaoke scene that sucks away the satisfaction from the climactic moment minutes prior.\\n\\n\r\nTwo, the anime introduces a final plot point very near the last scene of the show. It\u2019s what people in the community call a \u201cread the source material\u201d maneuver. Rather than ending on a narrative high, it chooses instead to conclude the story in an unfinished state.\\n\\n\r\nAll told, Masamune-kun\u2019s plan may be nicknamed \u201cDead or Love,\u201d but it\u2019s leaning towards dead for the time being.\\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge doesn\u2019t do too much on a visual level. In other words, it continues its standard streak with a standard set of visuals.\\n\\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t get too adventurous, sticking with its simple school setting and nominal level of cinematography. Given how the anime mostly focuses on the characters talking or interacting with one another, its subdued presentation does make sense. But it leads to a less engaging experience overall.\\n\\n\r\nA couple of noticeable errors do pop up, like when Masamune-kun runs away with his bag over his shoulder but without a bag when the same scene is shown from Aki\u2019s perspective. Or how, when he\u2019s talking to Neko in the hospital room, he\u2019s standing in one shot but suddenly sitting down the next. These errors are few and far between, though, and they don\u2019t cause a huge distraction, so they can be mostly ignored.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does include fantasy-based scenes from time to time. For example, Masamune-kun imagines what the finale of his revenge will look like, and Aki quarrels with Tae about their competing plays, the backdrop changing into a menacing dragon and a fierce tiger ready to attack each other. Again, these scenes aren\u2019t used a whole lot, but they do help in spicing up the visuals whenever possible.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters\u2019 designs are the only constantly interesting visual aspect.\\n\\n\r\nAki\u2019s predominately blue-and-white outfit highlights her ice-cold personality while simultaneously hinting at a depressing, more innocent girl trapped within.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun\u2019s contrast between his derpy child self and his super-handsome current self makes his transformation even more impressive.\\n\\n\r\nYoshino\u2019s small white hair clips and yellow eyes give her a semi-robotic look that fits her character well.\\n\\n\r\nAnd Neko is just unfairly attractive: long brown hair, ample assets, beauty marks, and a gentle demeanor. She no doubt has the looks, but it also serves the purpose of further hiding her sickliness behind an air of perfection. (It also helps that she\u2019s constantly going commando.)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThematically, the cast of Masamune-kun no Revenge do well in keeping focus on a common idea: ulterior motives. These main characters are by no means complex, but their fa\u00e7ade-formed parallels keep a nice consistency within the cast, upping the show\u2019s execution overall.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s somewhat easy to pinpoint. Masamune-kun does tone his body, and he gains the brains to boot, but he only strove so hard to eventually exact his revenge against Aki. Aki herself seems to suppress her original \u201cbetrayal\u201d on Masamune-kun. Yoshino pretends to work for Aki, but she secretly helps Masamune-kun in his quest. Neko lies about her lies. Gasou impersonates the Masamune-kun of old.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s an interesting setup. As the characters interact, they sometimes know of their deception and sometimes not. What results are characters making deliberate actions that progress their fa\u00e7ade that much more. For instance, Gasou befriends Aki\u2019s \u201cdefenders,\u201d giving him more outs as he pursues his own motives. Yoshino, too. She becomes Masamune-kun\u2019s \u201cmaster\u201d as she guides him on how to best melt Aki\u2019s icy exterior.\\n\\n\r\nThey also accentuate the characters who don\u2019t have ulterior motives. Characters like Kojuurou and Tae wear their intentions and personalities right on their sleeves, allowing them to balance out the fa\u00e7ade-laden main cast.\\n\\n\r\nBeginning with Neko, she makes her appearance at the absolute worst (but for her the best) time possible. She\u2019s quite the saint, what with her formal speech and utmost kindness. However, her no-panties policy and penchant for dietary nuance suggest that she\u2019s (like everyone else) more than meets the eye.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, the more Masamune-kun interacts with her, the more obvious it becomes that Neko isn\u2019t being very honest. She makes up a backstory as to how she came to fall in love with him, and she even goes so far as to steal his childhood picture, the biggest piece of incriminating evidence against him.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s what makes Neko arguably the most interesting character of the show. She lies about being sick by pretending to be sick (the ultimate cover-up move), and she lies about her origins even after her butler reveals her medical problems. Constantly lying, her fa\u00e7ade has a fa\u00e7ade, and her fa\u00e7ade\u2019s fa\u00e7ade has a fa\u00e7ade. It\u2019s what ultimately makes Masamune-kun reject her advances, for, while her feelings are true, he sees himself in her, acting dishonest in her delivery.\\n\\n\r\nAki is nowhere near as interesting as Neko, but, as the main female love interest, she gets attention all the same. Her rejections of the boys who ask to go out with her are almost as legendary as the nicknames she \u201cbestows\u201d upon them. She despises men, and she actively proves it by leading Masamune-kun on a wild answer hunt that ends with his rejection, too.\\n\\n\r\nBut she\u2019s not entirely an ice queen. She seems to eat a lot of food (a habit she keeps secret from everyone else), and, in true tsundere fashion, she has her cute moments such as when she attempts to justify why she went on her first date with Masamune-kun to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, while Aki may get a lot time, she doesn\u2019t have much substance. She rarely has the chance to improve herself as a character since whatever potential progression she earns is stripped away by the plot. Neko\u2019s interference, Gasou\u2019s arrival, and some of Masamune-kun\u2019s decisions push her away rather than bring her closer, disrupting the shift in mindset that must inevitably occur for her character.\\n\\n\r\nBecause, as far as the audience can tell, she\u2019s troubled by something. Her gluttonous eating habit derives from an event in her past, she\u2019s saddened by Neko\u2019s loneliness, and her flashbacks reveal that she wasn\u2019t always so cruel. Indeed, Masamune-kun no Revenge seems to imply that Masamune-kun\u2019s beef with Aki may not be exactly as he remembers it.\\n\\n\r\nWhether he\u2019s an unreliable narrator or not (unintentional or not), Masamune-kun proceeds with his plans. After becoming the hunkiest hunk imaginable, he commences his revenge against Aki, plotting to make her fall in love with him just so he can reject her without remorse.\\n\\n\r\nExpectedly, the time he spends following through on his plan and interacting with Aki affects his feelings. Especially when the other characters get involved. Yoshino makes him realize he cannot always rely on somebody else to grant him the personal revenge he seeks. Neko\u2019s rejection and sickened state acts as a metaphor for what could be Masamune-kun\u2019s fate should he fail in his quest. And Gasou pushes him to fight harder than he ever has before.\\n\\n\r\nTo reiterate once more, the season doesn\u2019t have him flip his switch about Aki, meaning his whole character arc isn\u2019t finished either. However, he messes up a lot, and he sometimes makes the right move, crafting him into at the minimum a believable guy whose trying his best at earning love and seeking revenge.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Kanetsugu Gasou, the anime surprisingly doesn\u2019t go as cliched with him as it does with its story. He\u2019s the fat guy who\u2019s neither gross nor evil but instead normal. A regular dude who, while holding similar schemes as everyone else, isn\u2019t outwardly menacing. At the very least, he\u2019s no different from the others in that he lies and does whatever he can to get his way. Plus, he\u2019s only in it for the money. That\u2019s more to appease the minds of the audience since it makes his \u201cmarriage\u201d to Aki less creepy and more about his own personal gain.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s nothing else to him besides being a wrench in the works. And he still deserves all the hate he receives for his insufferable goody-two-shoes attitude. Despite this direction, he does deserve credit for his slightly unconventional antagonist role.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND\\n\\n\r\nMost people praise Masamune-kun no Revenge for its original soundtrack \u2013 and for good reason. These tracks are not only filled with variety but also fit to a tee. To the point that almost nothing else could work within the show. A pronounced acoustic guitar signals tension like a modern Western film. Flutes, choirs, and harps spell out mystery. Sharp, high-pitched piano keys haunt the air. An Italian accordion arrangement spells out a bittersweet feeling. It\u2019s musical diversity at its finest, and it gives the show a lot of power during its different scenes.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting also remains strong throughout the season. In particular, Natsuki Hanae as Masamune-kun channels his frustration when monologuing his inner thoughts, and Inori Minase as Yoshino delivers deadpan speech with softness in mind, proving yet again how cute her voice tends to be.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening track doesn\u2019t reach the same heights. It\u2019s a rather upbeat piece due to the dainty instrumental choices and the quickness of it all. The English \u201cplease don\u2019t; please wait\u201d line doesn\u2019t flow very well within the middle of the song, but final lyrical push, where the words and the beat step together, does introduce some much-needed flavor. Overall, though, the song is about as standard as the story itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track is a small step above its OP counterpart. A prominent electric guitar leads into yet another normal beat that doesn\u2019t go for anything interesting. However, compared to the OP, its English lines fit a bit better, and the higher focus on the vocals gives it more emotion. Again, though, it\u2019s not too immersive.\\n\\n\r\nAnd, while a strange complaint, it should be noted that the stomach sound-effects are weird in design. It seemed as if the anime didn\u2019t want to use the same stock sound (which any anime fan can hear in his or her head right now), but it tried way too hard. Aki sounded more like she had to go to the bathroom due to constipation than needing to eat food loaded with carbs.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nLike most others who watched the show, I, too, was very frustrated and annoyed by Gasou. Even though he was only it for the money, and he\u2019s technically the same as everyone else in his conniving, I still disliked those last three episodes either because of or indirectly due to him. He was annoyingly, overly kind, and Aki being all super sweet when around Gasou got on my nerves right quick.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I liked Masamune-kun quite a bit; he wasn\u2019t afraid to call her a \u201cdamn bitch\u201d or a \u201cstupid ham.\u201d Under his breath or in his mind, of course, but seeing and hearing him being absolutely fed up with her horrible personality had me both laughing at the show and relating with its main protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters could also be a lot of fun, too. Yoshino\u2019s innocent and emotionless personas made for a hilarious silly-serious combo. Neko trying to play off dropping her ketchup packet had me laughing. And Kojuurou always failing to explain that he is, in fact, a boy was a simple joke, but it got me smiling with ease.\\n\\n\r\nAnd even though Aki was a big meanie, that -dere side of hers was often worth such abrasiveness. Sadly, she didn\u2019t have enough moments in the way romance, and, even when she did, she was usually the one ruining them. So, as a mega-fan of romance \u2013 it\u2019s my number-one favorite genre \u2013 Aki was too much of a brute in this regard. Upper-cutting Masamune-kun as he went in for a kiss that she herself asked for? Lame.\\n\\n\r\nI get it. She can\u2019t change her tune instantly, and she can\u2019t fall for him fully. Doing either would eliminate the crux of the conflict, leaving no story to tell. Still, I wish Aki would have been affected a bit more than she was. Her progress simply never felt all that satisfying.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in the end, my favorite character was the secretary lady, Midori Yukisaki. Beautiful, mature, and she likes to sing death metal songs during karaoke? Yes, please.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge has its plans backfired. A consistent set of characters and a very strong original soundtrack do what they can. However, the story does more wrong than right, the art and animation are plain, and it can be too frustrating to watch at times. It\u2019s not spooky; it\u2019s simply unfortunate.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, fun comedy, mixed drama, and weak romance support a vicarious premise that ends up unfinished and unresponsive\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: Fine, a plain visual offering does little else besides give the audience something to look at, but the character designs no doubt have their appealing qualities\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Good, a consistent ulterior-motives motif connects the characters, Neko\u2019s lies make her the most interesting of the bunch, Aki doesn\u2019t have much substance, Gasou isn\u2019t a conventional antagonist, and everyone affects Masamune-kun in their own way\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: Fine, a strong OST and some nice VA performances offset the boring OP and ED, but the stomach gurgling sound-effect is weird no matter what\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Bad, Masamune-kun, Neko, and Yoshino are fun, Midori rocks, but lacking romance scenes and the infuriating last arc doesn\u2019t do any favors\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

It's already established itself as a romantic comedy in the first episode so don't expect revenging plot in this whole anime (even the anime title says that \"Masamune-kun NO Revenge\"). But, if you look at it from a romcom perspective, it's quite a decent romcom anime. Maybe it's because I'm a huge fan of romcom genre but this anime did't disappoint me, it has it's own cringing moments but it also has some really funny moments as well sprinkle some romantic moment. The characters in this anime ain't quite relatable and I wouldsay it's quite a \"meh\" to me but I still able to bear with it. It's a really quite enjoyable anime to fill in the gaps waiting for a new episode of your favorite animes or to those who just want to watch anime to let the time past by fast. Overall I've give it a 7/10, it's a good anime but nothing really surprising.",

That was until kanetsugu gasou was introduced and wow. He genuinely just ruined it. It was episode 10 or 11 and I was considering dropping it just because it was so awful. So many plot holes. While watching the openings that led up to the introduction of him I thought he would've beenone of masamunes bullies that realized who he was. I feel like this would've been a much better path to approach but hey we will let it slide. This could've easily been a one season 12 episode anime but of course they had to drag it out for that $$. I'm also not quite sure what sort of a ending that was. When I finished watching it I had to go back and make sure I wasn't missing and episode or something because I just watched 12 episodes for that... What.

I think all the characters are really well developed and I never felt like any of them didn't belong. I only hate one and its gasuo kun or w/e his name was. He's supposed to be bethrothed to Aki Chan and we don't learn so much about him. But there is a quick little hint of him actually being fake, as he semi discloses that he's notthe real masame kun(obviously if any of you watching missed that he wasn't to begin with your oblivious xD). There is definitely a problem here though. This is another one of those anime's \"oh it was so great!\" but the ending sucked............. It was just a weird episode in a karaoke bar where they sang and w/e. I mean, I don't really get it. The only thing is that they would have left the show open for a second season. There is definitely still a lot of manga written left about a paris trip and then dates with aki so. There could actually be a second season. But unfortunately its another one of those \"No Second Season, No Closure!\" shows. We'll just have to wait and see if a second season pops up at all. If it doesn't thats a real shame, because there really is no ending. It just straight up cuts off. I really enjoyed it too, I felt super engaged and admittedly even turned on at some points lol... Hope this show gets a greenlight to finish it off. I don't mind if its even just 6 episodes instead of the typical 12. I would like a real solid ending.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nHave you ever seen that anime that started out good, but then throws it all away by the end well that's what this was which is unfortunate for me to say.\r\nThe story is about Masamune Makabe who was bullied and rejected by the person he loved Aki Adagaki because he was fat, now in high school he has become a ripped and Narcissistic guy and has vowed revenge on Aki for what she did.\r\nThe story when it started was actually pretty good it felt nice and refreshing to see a different turn on the Romance genre instead of the usual boy meets girland fall in love this time we get a revenge story that becomes something else overtime then becomes garbage by the end. I enjoyed seeing Makabe plan out his plot to make Aki his girlfriend then break up with her in the worst possible way it was actually entertaining, but the more he did this he was rethinking about whether what he was doing was worth it or not at times, then when the story gets closer towards the end it decides say fuck all that and bring in an element that pretty much ruined the show for me, it took away the fun feeling I had throughout most of the show and then just defecated on it for tricking me into thinking this was a great show.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were sort of mixed really, the MC Makabe was a really good character it's not often you see an MC trying to get revenge on an old crush for making him feel bad in the past plus the way his personality was very intriguing because at times he would be mischievous and other times he would be either whining or shocked which showed he wasn't entirely perfect even though he thinks he is, then there is the female MC Aki who I can add to the annoying Tsundere pile well kinda I mean she isn't the worst, but she annoyed me more over the course of the show, but she was clumsy at times which whenever it happened made her a bit likeable, though she was mostly dislikeable.\\n\r\n The supporting characters were actually ok Yoshino who looked like a shy and helpless maid or servant was actually and even more mischievous and plot making person than Makabe was which did surprise me and her monotone attitude sometimes made a scene very funny, Neko was very mixed sometimes I liked her sometimes I didn't mainly because you don't really understand her motive until just after the halfway point, the trap character Kojuurou was really just a basic trap character to me there wasn't much to set him apart from other trap characters apart from that they actually tried to get him with one of the female characters which was interesting and Tae Futaba is that energetic and positive female character that always pushes the right buttons with me.\\n\r\nThere's also one other character that was introduced near the end, but he pretty ruined the whole show for me by making the situation stupid and this made me lose interest very quickly.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle looked pretty basic for an anime like this although some of the characters eye colours like Yoshino's and Kojuurou's actually looked quite nice mainly because they were colours I haven't seen often in other anime characters. The comedy was actually pretty good it was funny seeing the major differences with Makabe and his family, Aki's food eating habit isn't really something new in anime, but at least this time it's a condition she has and not just a random power a character has which made seem a little bit more realistic.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the Harem tag being among the genres this didn't feel like a Harem, yes some of the girls had crushes on makabe, but most didn't really take action on those feeling's the only one's who acted were Aki and Neko and two characters doesn't fill the requirements for a Harem.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime started out good, got better and then just decided to throw it away in the end and there is a possibility for a season 2, though I'm not really sure if I'll watch it because of how disappointing the final episodes were, but if you're someone who is looking for a different take the Romance aspect then be my guest just don't expect a lot by the end.",

            "content": "\"Masamune-kun no Revenge\" (or \"Masamune's Revenge\") is an anime that had good potential, but the way that the main character acts to get his goal is something that left me upset.\r\nStory: 6/10\r\nThe story revolves around a first-year student named Masamune who spent 8 years of his life getting in shape and improving his attractiveness. Why? To win the heart of his childhood friend, Aki, who dumped him 8 years prior and to break her heart. The only thing is, he comes to this high school with her with a different name in order to throw her off. The story basically is him trying to winher over by befriending her and getting her to open up. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nThe art style was alright, with the eyes looking bright and nice, the body proportions were pretty good as well. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nThe OP was okay, although not memorable, as well as the ED. Nothing was bad out of the soundtrack throughout the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThis anime had two characters that generally made me upset, mainly because of their personalities. Masamune is basically an asshole who wins over the hearts of many girls but is too hellbent to even consider them since he's after Aki. Aki is another character who made me laugh at points, but I honestly didn't like her for her bitchy attitude and her cruel rejections (But I guess that's how they have to portray the character). Yoshino is Aki's servant who on the outside is clumsy and stotic (Stotic like Setsuna from School Days or Koneko from High School DxD), but is really cold and deceptive, which made me interested in her fa\u00e7ade. Neko is a kind girl who is frail due to a medical condition and is honestly my favorite character due to her personality and her kindness with the characters. There are other characters that are alright, but they're not so noteworthy as in terms of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nDespite the crude and ruthless intentions of Masamune, I did enjoy scenes where he tries to think his way through issues without blowing his cover, not to mention a few comedic scenes with him. I did enjoy some of the interactions with the characters, but the one thing I did enjoy was the cliffhangers some of the episodes had. They would just make me want more and more of the show and it did have me coming back for more. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nMasamune's Revenge is a good anime that has its pros and cons, but don't expect anything amazing or \"revolutionary\" for an anime series. If you want something from recent times that's good enjoy to enjoy or with a different plot compared to animes that take place in school, I recommend this anime.",

Give the artists a raise because they sure as well deserve it.\r\n- Relaxing and definitely had various highlights of comedic moments throughout the show. A semi-chill anime that you can enjoy when you are inthe mood to enjoy some typical MC in a harem type setting.\\n\\n\r\n- The mentality, vibe and the feels of the show. Arranging appropriately between serious to funny scenes, giving it a slight sense of realism to a certain degree with an added value of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nWHAT I DISLIKED\\n\r\n- The progression of the show. For those who are actually interested in the plot, this might be too slow as there are various unnecessary fillers designed to fanservice the audience.\\n\\n\r\n- How the MC thinks. The fact that he had the best girl already clearly right beside him while pursuing someone who isn't even potentially interested in him gives me, the audience, an incredible amount of frustration and a clear case of face-palm.\\n\\n\r\n- The ending. It's one of those anime shows that you should just spare yourself from the ending because you know it's going to disappoint you in a variety of ways. Not to mention there's no absolute for season 2, hence a redundant cliffhanger.\\n\\n\r\n\u3010=\u25c8\ufe3f\u25c8=\u3011LEVEL OF FEELS: 3/10 \u3010=\u25c8\ufe3f\u25c8=\u3011\\n\r\n- In terms of feels, it's hard to relate to MC on his poor decision-making skills when he is caught up on \"revenge\". A narrow-sighted MC is definitely one that is hard to have feels for.\\n\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun no Revenge is definitely another of those boy-meets-girl anime. I have to give enormous props to the art, music and character design. I suggest viewing this without any expectations and you shall be somewhat to mostly satisfied.

            "content": "STORY: The title speaks for itself as Masamune tries to get his revenge against Aki-chan. For 12 episodes, there is a lot of hype and momentum where it seems Masamune will win. Overtime, it looks like his revenge may take him into another direction. There is also some funny moments, a bit of fan service, and origins of the characters past and reason for wanting revenge.\r\nCHARACTERS:\r\nMASAMUNE MAKABE: He is part of a wealthy family, and lives with his mom (who looks like could possibly be seen as his younger sister). Plus, he actually has a little sister too. His reputation is being the good looking,hot guy at his high school. His motto in life involves being healthy and maintaining that lifestyle. His personality traits: funny, dense, clueless at times, (possibly narcissistic) but he is also caring.\\n\r\nAKI ADAGAKI: (aka the Cruel Princess). She is a SAVAGE and has her own group (sounds like Mean Girls). She is also part of a rich family. Growing up, she is also very mean. Whenever guys tries to ask her out or make a move on her... She bullies them by getting a permanent marker and write it down on their shirt or body parts (i.e.: fore head or stomach). But there is also another side to her, she can be very sweet and kind.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: After watching the first episode, I had a feeling that Masamune would not be getting his revenge by the end of the series. Hopefully there is a season 2 that will give some kind of indication of revenge. I feel really bad for Masamune. It's great that he's very healthy and maintains that lifestyle, but the anime really shows the psychology and his state of mind of how he truly feels. Adagaki-san is a savage as (bleep). She is very merciless and I would love to see her in her vulnerable state (as Masamune) when she is extremely hurt. Later on in the series, there is a part with one character in the anime that did not go in-depth (as much, ohh okay maybe a lot). I still pray for a season 2 because the ending was kind of a let down.",

            "content": "As a sucker for romance anime, I walked into this anime expecting something extremely unique based off the description of the story. It's almost like a typical romance anime with a little twist so I thought that it would actually be that unique. As I got further and further into the anime I realized it was going to be similar to a lot of other bland romance anime that plague the genre. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy it because there are some characters and moments that are charming and cute. \r\nMINOR SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory - 6\r\nAs far as stories go I was actually interestedin the beginning and in the first episode especially. Things progressed fairly decently right until around episode 4 where the plot basically remains in a standstill until one scene in the final episode, but after the one scene Masamune falls into absolute shambles in the rest of the episode. The story is just a repetitive series of failures for the protagonist to try and make this girl fall in love with him. There are some cute moments here and there where he thinks he might begin to fall for her, but then something dumb happens and everything is right back to square one. No matter what happens in the last episode in regards to advancing the relationship of the protagonist, it's as though everything resets when the episode ends. The promise of a unique story is quickly ruined as nothing besides the protagonist messing up is of any relevance. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 8\\n\r\nThe art is actually something I really enjoyed. It isn't something that blows you away, but it isn't ugly by any means and you always get a sense of how a character is feeling or what the mood should be by the art style and what is added, so the art part of the anime I actually enjoyed. \\n\\n\r\nSound - 8 \\n\r\nAlong the same lines as art, the sound is never obnoxious but it is never that spectacular either. It does help to add to the intensity of some romantic moments or the silliness of a scene. The music does its job and never overstays its welcome for too long. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 6\\n\r\nThe characters on this show are really hit and miss. Some characters you'll grow to love and other characters are the absolute epitome of abominations. Some of these characters and their stories made me want to rip out my hair at the sheer absurdity and lack of contribution to making the story better. The most likeable characters are the protagonist's friends as they are the only constant stream of likeable and comedy throughout each episode. The backstories of most every character is pretty shallow and seems like a quick way to explain their pointless existence. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 6\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime at the beginning a lot and it really capture my interest and I thought it was quite funny, but as the episodes dragged along I realized there wasn't going to be any payoff or decent plot progression. I still found a way to enjoy moments in episodes when the characters were being serious or when they actually looked like something romantic or genuine was going to happen. So there are moments and scenes worth watching throughout these repetitive episodes. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nDespite some harsh critiques and thoughts, I find myself rooting for this anime and I want it to so badly have these cute moments and scenes that I know it's capable of. Most of what we got in these episodes were small tastes of something that could be truly be unique and special. I loved the intimate scenes of romance that were teased and I enjoyed the anime taking a premise that we don't see very often and trying to make it work. I don't think Masamune is a bad anime. I think it has some major flaws that holds it back from being great, but it is overall an enjoyable anime for someone who wants to enjoy an unlikely budding romance between two characters.",

After watching all episodes I quite enjoyed it but understand where some issues are. \r\nStory: 7\r\nGood: The idea of getting revenge from breaking someone's heart is an unpleasant thing to do. I was expecting not to like the main protagonist for this reason but after watching his backstory I could understand his character better and grew to sympathise with him. The main love interest would be normally a character I could not stand but they show though glimpses that she is actually a nice person who has areason why she is like the way she is. All other characters I did enjoy and had some funny moments with. Every episode I enjoyed watching and did laugh occasionally. \\n\\n\r\nBad: The last three episodes are not very good. The characters that cause the final events to occur are not well thought out and just annoyed me watching them. The back stories for their motives are also weak with some massive plot holes. Also the overall motive of the MC seems to die down and his motives are unclear to the audience. The karaoke scene at the end seems to be filler, along with a lot of the last episode. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also NO conclusion to ANYTHING as they obviously were trying to get a second series. So if you want an anime with a conclusion, this is not one for you. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nPretty anime but nothing spectacular. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nGood, but not anything that stands out. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nMC was good but sometimes spoke internally to much.\\n\r\nLove Interest had her moments and was a very different love interest from normal anime.\\n\r\nThe friendship circle was good but some characters had no connection to others.\\n\r\nThe 'Antagonists' of the MC were not good, not thought out and were by far the worst part of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nHad some laughs, enjoyed the idea of the story and always wanted to see what happened next.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime as a basic romantic comedy. I would have watched a second season to see what happened but also believe they could have concluded everything with one season. \\n",

I was very happy to see a different approach at a romance anime, until I realized that it was ultimately as basic as it could be, with little development.\r\nAs I said before, the premise really intrigued me. A romance which takes a different route than your average anime, with 'revenge' being the main drive of the plot, or so it is advertised. In reality however, there doesn't really happen anything at all.\r\nThis is mostly because of our main character. He has a goal, but he seems to forget it at every important moment. He wants revenge,oh wait no; He wants to help because- oh never mind, he wants revenge again. I can deal with a little confusion, concerning the fact whether or not he's 'in-love'. But our main character seems to suffer from dementia every time an event has happened. Every time a plot point has finished, it's as if we start all over again. It's frustrating.\\n\\n\r\nOverall though, the anime does seem to have good points. The art is impressive, though not outstanding, and there are genuinely funny moments in here. As long as the anime doesn't take itself too seriously it seems to do just fine. It's just as if it can't decide what to do with the story, and therefore does nothing at all.\\n",

They're arrogant and often act nonsensically, with the titular Masamune relying on manga and magazines to figure out how-to romance. Hell, there seemed to be actual development at the tail end of Fujinomiya's arc (episode 9), but then that gets reversed by the start of episode 10. And there's no solid ending with the subplotthat started in episode 10 not being resolved. It's just left open with a \"to be continued\" sign at the end, yet no promises of a second season or OVAs or a movie. I get that it's adapted from an ongoing manga, but that's no reason to leave gaping plot holes. It will be a better show if it gets an ending. A real ending. Watch at your own risk.",

Also the lastepisode was a huge disappointment and kind of lack luster. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all the ending, lack luster last episodes, strange choices and dropped this plane down.

Masamune is like the most stupid and superficial character i've ever seen, literally it made me felt bad watching him, i kinda felt sorry for him like how can someone be so pathethic??? all of his reasons to get \"revenge\" were stupid af and the whole showwas stupid af.

Starting with episode one was what I expected out of a \"RomCom\", so I wasn't bored nor interested since normally for me It is really hard to capture what the show will be like from the first episode. Moving on through episodes, I really did start to enjoy it, I enjoyed the humor, Characters, and just the story in general, but then it started to become a chore to watch after episode 9, I was just dragging myself to finishthis show since I already invested a couple hours. Now finishing it, I feel like I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, like having lunch with your friend and everything is going well and then they just punch you in the one-eyed snake. being shown something with a lot of promise and a bit of originality is really hard to find now with new anime coming out. There was also a lot of promise with the characters of this show and it made me really want to know about them, but very few characters really had extensive backstories while others, it's just a small comment about what they do, there is very little character development, and some characters I just got sick of. This show is by far not great, but there were things I enjoyed about, it being a \"RomCom\", harem, high school, etc... I enjoyed that aspect of it like I do with Most. I recommend this show to people who just want to watch a humorous show with romance glazed all over it like a doughnut. Just don't have high expectations while watching because they will just make you disappointed. \\n\r\noverall 6/10",

Let's talk bout the main character, Masamune is a teenage high school-er who cares about nothing else than staying skinny. Here's my problem, this show makes it sound like your not handsome or good looking if your not skinny. That is not really a good message. I can't remember any of the other characters name's. Which shows how poor they're. \r\nThe story is about Masamune getting revenge on a girl that called him a pig's foot when he was a kid. He gets revenge by trying to get thegirl to fall in love with him and then Masamune is going to dump her and make her feel bad. The story is not good at all because even the main character forgets what he is doing. Overall the results are cliche.\\n\\n\r\nThe art I'll admit is wonderful. Not the best character design I have seen but the art style is both pleasing to the eye and gorgeous. Probably the only good thing about this show.\\n\\n\r\nJust don't watch this show. Story is cliche, its very unmemorable and the characters are just terrible. No sense of progression throughout the story. There are better shows out there.\\n\\n",

            "content": "No Revenge, Masamune-kun\r\nThat\u2019s how the title of the anime should be. There may or may not be spoilers ahead of this rant review. (Well not like it matters since the last episode was close to being redundant if not for the first 10 minutes or so.)\r\nMasamune-kun no revenge, an anime that hyped people up, including me, since the PV of the video was released. You could say many people were in fact \u201cjumping out of their chairs\u201d  to see how this adaptation would play out(?). As the anime was released in the first week, it certainly managed to live up to its hype, ranking3rd in Anime Trending charts. However, it dropped down to rank 8 in week 4. Why is that? Well, if you did watch this anime, you\u2019ll probably know why, so I won\u2019t being go into detail. (Best girl showed up at the wrong moment, thus ruining the show entirely.) And that\u2019s not the only reason why this show manages to disappoint itself, but I will save that for later.\\n\\n\r\nMasamune-kun is a decent and entertaining anime to watch. The plot revolves around the issue of \u201cRevenge\u201d, which is quite different from the stereotypical \u201cBoy meets girl. Boy falls in love with said girl. Boy tries to chase the girl. Girl then falls in love with the boy and they become a... Whoops, i meant, anime ends in an inconclusive ending.\u201d But then again, it did use some of the clich\u00e9s, especially the last one, but all for a different purpose. The purpose for revenge. I was constantly clicking the \u201cNext\u201d button after each episode, and hence managed to finish the anime in one sitting. \u201cHow is he going to take revenge? How is he going to prove that he is the one that Adagaki-san used to be close friends with? How is Adagaki-san going to react?\u201d These were the thoughts that were constantly running through my mind, which thus led me to hoping that the last episode would bring a conclusive ending to everything. (Although it actually seems quite restricted within the span of 20 minutes.) \\n\\n\r\nAt last, my prayers were answered, we got what we wanted in the last episode. A KAROKE SESSION! I mean, who wouldn\u2019t want it in the last episode instead of Masamune-kun confessing everything to Adagaki, am I right? \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af  . I dare say the anime actually did a good job on the plot in the first few episodes, until they started introducing more side characters whose backgrounds were so minor that it didn\u2019t even make any sense why they were there besides to create drama. Yes, I\u2019m talking about Gasou. As much as I hated him, the anime just threw him in there as a new obstacle Masamune-kun has to overcome, and once it was done, they just left him in the corner to rot, not considering how he felt after the incident. Whereas, Neko-san was introduced to inflict jealousy on Adagaki-san, which worked in one way or another. To be honest, I didn\u2019t feel sad at all when Neko-san was rejected, and that\u2019s because they didn\u2019t develop her character enough the make the scene feel impactful. As I mentioned, she was introduced to be thrown away later on. You could say it\u2019s quite obvious it will happen so people won\u2019t be surprised by that. But something clich\u00e9 isn\u2019t necessarily bad, especially when they are done right. Look at Toradora for instance, that\u2019s how romances are supposed to be done despite the fact that everyone knew Taiga will end up with Ryuuji. There are even some tear-jerking moments in Toradora, and why is that? It\u2019s because of how they portrayed it. \\n\r\nMasamune-kun is by far not a BAD anime. It just feels lacklustre. But this is not the reason why you should completely skip or drop this anime. Different people have different tastes and opinions. Who knows, this might be your cup of tea if you\u2019re into animes that doesn\u2019t have a conclusive ending. If the author didn\u2019t lose focus on the theme \u201crevenge\u201d perhaps this anime would have played out much better. The journey that I went through while watching Masamune-kun no Revenge was bitter yet sweet. (Mostly bitter because of the last episode but oh well.) If you really want to watch this, then just go for the manga instead as it is still ongoing, which would probably not leave you hanging. I hope. \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: 6/10\\n\r\nTo be frank, I enjoyed this show, but it still disappointed me nonetheless. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "TL;DR Section at the end of the review. Please note that this review may contain minor spoilers. Enjoy!\r\n\tStory: Masamune-kun no Revenge entails the story of young Masamune Makabe and Aki Adagaki. What makes this stand out from standard romcoms is that Masamune aims to break her heart as she did to him long ago, instead of aiming to be a true couple. However, Aki\u2019s pristine looks and ice cold nature of turning down any who dare ask her out while also giving them a humiliating nickname has earned her the moniker \u201cCruel Princess.\u201d Will Masamune have his revenge, or will Aki crush him like everyoneprior to him?\\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters: Overall, the characters in this show each have their own charm and quirks to make them likeable and possibly relatable in a way. While our grand MC is sometimes as dumb as a brick and can\u2019t take a hint, he still works earnestly towards his goal. Aki\u2019s tsundere-type actions and thoughts are surprisingly not boring and can still be entertaining to see how she reacts to his advances. Fujinomiya Neko plays the girl that loves Masamune since the moment the met, and acts extremely flirty, forward, amongst other things whilst keeping her reason for her love a secret. The supporting characters in the show add some spice and variety (specifically Koiwai Yoshino aka \u201cMaster\u201d), but are limited in how much they participate at times.\\n\\n\r\n\tMain Point: Masamune-kun no Revenge was a fairly well received show this season, landing in the 7.5 and up zone (as of writing this review) and for the most part, this is a fairly above how I felt the show should be rated overall as well (with my score being a 6 out of 10). What makes this show enjoyable from a viewer\u2019s standpoint is that while it is from the romcom / harem genre, it doesn\u2019t overdo it like *some* shows. Granted, the story isn\u2019t too original and is quite honestly bland at some points (i.e. the test of courage scene). Other than cute girls, some fanservice, and a rather mediocre soundtrack, Masamune-kun no Revenge relies more so on keeping it a lighthearted-fun show while trying to keep you interested with how Masamune learns to make Aki fall in love with him. You can easily drop in and out of watching with full attention just to catch the main points per episode and still understand what\u2019s going on.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR \u2013 All in all, Masamune-kun no Revenge is a fairly standard romcom / harem show that you can easily jump in and out of, but you shouldn\u2019t expect any insane twists or huge character developments. This show isn\u2019t a bad place to start if you\u2019re looking to get into this type of genre, and just as easily enjoyable if you\u2019re a veteran watcher. Good for lighthearted fun and discussing \u201cbest girl\u201d of the show, though it's not for everyone.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT!!! (just in case)\r\nSTORY (3/10): For an anime about revenge, there seemed to be less and less revenge/plotting revenge happening as the anime progressed. The revenge plot seemed to be the main focus for about 5 or 6 episodes and then the story just went off in its own direction. And as far as the ending goes, it was probably the most lackluster ending I've seen in an anime. Why would you have your main climactic point be in the middle of the last episode and then have the last half of the episode feel more like filler than actual story progression? The last3 minutes didn't even feel like the ending even though it was played off as \"story progression\". This had a very definite \"We're planning on a season 2!\" or \"Go read the manga!\" ending. Also, throwing a major plot twist into the tenth episode really confused me, especially since they didn't really resolve that whole situation.  \\n\\n\r\nART (5/10): Nothing special about the animation on this one. It looked very much like your average high school anime. It wasn't bad by any means, but it didn't stand out from the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (5/10): Same as the art. Nothing special. The OP was okay, but I wouldn't rank it among my favorites. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (3/10): I didn't feel any kind of connection to any of these characters. If I'm into the story and the characters, I'll get this kind of excitement/nervousness for the ending, no matter how predictable it is. I didn't get that with this. Makabe was a jerk most of the time, only occasionally showing that he could be a decent human being. His mother looking like a 12 year old lolly and Makabe actually calling her Lolly Hag was just very strange. Aki seemed like your average tsundere, but I didn't find myself liking or hating her at any given time -- she was just kind of there. The character development in this was absolutely zero, which can usually be expected from this type of anime, but when the characters feel very flat from the beginning, there should be SOME kind of change in them by the end. I just didn't feel emotionally invested in them.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (3/10): Honestly, the episodes went by pretty quickly for me. I didn't find myself constantly checking to see how much longer I had to watch each episode. However, I did find myself questioning what the heck I'd just watched at the end of every episode starting at around episode 6 or 7. The ending really killed this for me.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL (4/10): Everything combined averages out to a 3.8, but I'll round that up to a 4. It was honestly not the worst anime I've ever seen, but it certainly wasn't the best. If they do end up continuing this, I'm not sure that I'll be willing to keep watching.",

            "content": "Masamune-kun\u2019s Revenge seems like the ideal deconstruction of the high school harem but it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just another high school harem comedy with a dubious premise. On one hand, Masamune\u2019s motivation is just. Aki-sama is a bitch, needlessly so and deserves a taste of her own medicine. On the other hand Masamune is being petty to the nth degree. There are plenty of other girls in this harem he could choose and just live a happy high school life. But he\u2019s so hell bent on revenge that he doesn\u2019t bother. That wouldn\u2019t be a problem if the series didn\u2019t make it obvious that he\u2019s gonnadevelop feelings for her. And that\u2019s not a spoiler because the revenge motivation seems insufficient for all the effort and drama Masamune endures. At one point, an actual person (rather than a cartoon character) would see their own self worth and the fact they could have virtually any other girl in this school as a win (and a better revenge) and move on with their life.\\n\r\nBut, there\u2019s a break even point with Aki. The fact that she has her own motivations for behaving in this manner is a positive. If she were just a bitch for the sake of being a bitch the show would have no depth and Masamune would be wasting his time and effort. Also the show portrays that Aki actually has feelings too. something that anyone who absolutely relates to Masamune probably wouldn't know or care to know. Since she\u2019s not mean just for the sake of being mean, neither come across as one dimensional characters. It\u2019s a nice little rom com, but it\u2019s only average. Some are better than this; some are worse. I\u2019d say watch if you're a big fan of the genre.\\n",

            "content": "First of all I'd like to say, if you haven't started watching the anime yet, I'd suggest waiting for the second season to come out. Why? Because the studio clearly lost their sense of direction 70% through the anime. \r\nThe anime had a promising story, we knew it was going to be the generic high school anime with the main character eventually getting the main heroine, but the premise was different than other romantic comedies and personally it was enough to get me hooked. You are genuinely curious on how the story will develop, what kind of plot twists it will have. I for onecertainly looked forward to the episodes every week, and it was fun until late in the anime when a new arc emerged, shitty one I might add, in which we didn't get any closure on it until the end of the anime. On top of leaving the anime on an unsatisfactory finale, in the end we didn't get to see any noticeable character development between the main characters to at least give us a taste of next season, if any.\\n\\n\r\nI love the characters in this movie, they are beautifully drawn and the art is amazing. You have the always hungry tsundere, a frail rich girl who likes to go commando and a badass female loli sensei. The sound and music is your typical moe moe kyun opening and ending which isn't my cup of tea, but it does its job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a 6 for me. Mostly because I had high hopes for this anime and was ultimately disappointed. If they do decide to create a season 2 without any dumb ass fillers and just pure character development and smart directing, then it would certainly be a huge rise on ratings for S2. We're not 6 year olds who can't figure out what will eventually happen, but that doesn't mean we don't want to see it happen, WE DO, SO GIVE IT TO US without all the money milking fillers... and what was that shitty ending anyways? Don't pull a Nisekoi!\\n\\n\r\nI'm only this mad because I love the anime that much and I don't want to see it not live to its potential. Fingers effin' crossed.",

            "content": "What an incredibly disappointing anime.  It started off really well with an interesting plot.  A former fatty who gets in shape and seeks to lure in the girl who rejected him so he could reject her back.  It started off with good comedy,  a few dramatic moments and a very likeable character in \"Master\".  But, about 3/4ths of the way through, it just totally cratered.   \r\nSPOILERS AHEAD: DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ENDING SPOILED!  \r\nThe ending of this anime was amazingly unsatisfactory.  Instead of resolving ANY of the plotlines, it just goes intoa silly \"Snow White\" Drama Contest followed by a Karaoke Contest.  Not only do these contests prove to be totally meaningless as the \"bets\" never even get paid off, but they actually totally take the place of ending the anime.  You get this, instead of the protagonist revealing who he really is to the girl.  There was a fat rival that emerged for him at the end, and the whole situation was just cut off at the end with no resolution for this \"Fat Prince\".  There was no confession of love, or execution of the revenge plan.  Just a stupid bench scene where instead of kissing, she shoves a yam in his mouth.   It sucked on every level.   This went beyond a \"cop out\" ending to a \"We're just not going to do anything to finish this story at all.\" ending.  Terrible.",

            "content": "OKAY, I will say sorry but I could not for the life of me finish the series near the end. I'll explain why so you can kind of get what I am worked up about. Also, fair warning I will say a bit of cuss words as it suits what I am saying with emotion. \r\n   The art was the most horrible animation I have seen in recent years of watching anime. There are some areas where it looks good but then the faces are completely messed up and horrible. I am artist myself I felt that animators didn't know what they weredoing. I can't stress enough that even poorly written animes such as this one; it would of been better if they try to make the faces appealing in majority of the anime. Do they do this? NO, they don't fucking do this. A lot of the screentime they don't look good especially at certain angles. It felt like they put them in photoshop and press CTRL+T and tried to make them look like they belonged in those dramatic angles. It didn't work, nothing about the way they drew the animation worked. The backgrounds are pretty generic,  nothing stands out as new but those were better than animation of the characters. \\n\r\n-\\n\r\nI actually liked the soundtrack and felt this was the best part of the series. The director did good on this area and I am happy with the results in every scene which made this easier to watch as long as I did. \\n\r\n-\\n\r\nNow onto the real issue I had with it: The Story and characters.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\n   To start with this anime claims it's about revenge when in reality it is not even about it. I can't even wrap my head around it but it just turned into harem after harem. The whole anime is set up on the fuel Masamune uses to want revenge on a girl. Well, it could of been as simple as they explained the reasoning in the beginning about being hurt over other's cruelness in the past. Which the idea in itself is interesting to see because you know two things already with a few minutes into the series. One, the characters are flawed and will need change. Two, the characters are different from one another. They didn't use any of the two things I mentioned. The story is flat and it could of went other routes that would of made it interesting and new. It ended up being the same old story about harem romance. Had some good pacing and first few episodes weren't bad but then episode 4 comes along then throws another girl into the mix. Just when I thought the harem is over they bring another character into the mix. UGHHHH//// The thing that can make or break harem animes is the conflict and solution part. Toradora is good example of how to do a harem right, it isn't unrealistic as majority of animes. This anime is with the majority. The revenge isn't in the story anymore after 8 episodes. Just becomes an anime that is about people fighting over one character's love. To sum up the route the anime took: Harem is not over yet just you wait until we add another character in, don't worry it's not a character flaw it's a misunderstanding. Eye for an eye would of been more filled with climaxes, solutions, conflicts, and deep story. This anime is what could of  been a better story but destroys all of it. The whole story is filled with a build up that leads to nothing at all. It just keeps building up and falling down never hitting the right amount of conflict or climax the story needed. The only conflict is played out to be a mistunderstanding in the end so they can have a chance at true love.\\n\\n\r\n   The characters are okay but some of them are just bad. The male lead \"Makabe, Masamune\", he is superficial and popular among his school mates. He use to be fat so this is used as fuel for him becoming thin and trying to use his new appearance to manipulate others. He is the alright character in the series, near the end his personality and flaws that made the character were destroyed. He became this generic anime guy that we see in so much animes already. All the interesting things about him are gone.\\n\\n\r\n   The canon \"Adagaki, Aki\", she is cold princess and bosses everyone around because people fear and like her. Her rejections of so many males doesn't have any back lash. The show only gives one scene with a guy trying to cut her hair which is not for the sake of cause and affect. That is it, nothing after that no rumors or people talking poorly of her actions. There is no back lash for any of the character's actions especially Aki. It breaks the very rule of reactions cause reactions. Meaning if one character does something then another character can react. The anime doesn't have any depth to her character other than she is cruel because she was heart broken as a child. Really? They would of made this character have better reason for rejecting guys that could of made her happy. Her character is hollow and lacks any true strong flaws. Her personality goes from shy to nice to rude to I don't care to I do care.  \\n\\n\r\n   \"Cinderella, Shishou\" her character made no sense and really was only there to move the poor story along. Her personality is to airhead to sharp then to moe to robotic. At this point I think you get all the characters are poorly written. Her whole reasoning is because she wants to make her own life easier and that's it. Most of the stuff this character does through is not even cruel other than the few remarks about being slow. That is about it. \\n\\n\r\n  Finally,\" Neko Fujinomiya\" She is the only character that was decent in the whole series. She didn't have the ever changing personality and her actions had reasoning behind it. She even lies in the sake to help the person she loves get what they want. I ended up liking her more than the canon since she was just better written. When I say written I don't  mean she is 100% likable, she has flaws that stay the same through most of her time on screen. Only character that actually follows the cause and effect in the whole anime. Writing on this character should of been applied to other characters it would of made the series better.\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nTo end everything\\n\\n\r\nI will  never finish this series and I will not watch the second season as these type of shows make me mad and uninterested in quickly. I don't wanna even go into the design of the uniforms since I don't wanna do a whole essay ranting about how horrible and shit they are.",

            "content": "This one really sucked me in with its concepts of a jilted lover seeking revenge, but it lost momentum and left me very unsatisfied at the end of the season.\r\nSpoilers ahead:\r\nI get that there was humor in Aki's constant rejections of Masamune, and Masamune's inept attempts at seduction. But, they overused this dynamic to the point where it becomes difficult to suspend disbelief. They obviously plan to carry the same tired dynamic into the next season, so they gave us no climax and no conclusions.\r\nIt's hard to empathize with most of the characters in this show. The plot revolves around secrecy and generally mean-spirited behavior,so naturally the release would come with someone getting what's coming to them, but that is withheld in every way.\\n\\n\r\nAn important plot point is that Masamune is concealing his identity in his revenge plot. But, Aki feels abandoned by the young Masamune, and still loves him. Late in the season a new character was introduced who was apparently impersonating Masamune in order to marry Aki for her money, but the series already has plenty of unlikable characters. It's convoluted. Aki becomes demure and agreeable to the impersonator without any event to catalyze it. Again, it's difficult to suspend disbelief.\\n\\n\r\nI wish they would have given us the success of Masamune's plan, and ended the season with Aki's confusion and depression. Season 2 could have been a redemption story for Aki as she processes the grief into positive change, learns the truth of Masamune, and becomes a sympathetic character. Instead, we're going to get more of the same tired tropes and more unlikable characters for who know's how many seasons.",
