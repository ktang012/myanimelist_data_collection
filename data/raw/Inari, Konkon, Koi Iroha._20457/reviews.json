            "content": "Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha is the type of show where you\u2019d come in expecting what you\u2019ll get. The thought of \u2018typical romance with a cute middle school girl\u2019 is what most people will come into mind. And you would be right because this show is about a middle school girl named Inari Fushimi, a clumsy character with an innocent personality and heartwarming crush on her fellow classmate, Koji Tanabashi. In essence, this show is what a classic shoujo would offer \u2013 a spirited series of cuteness, fun, charms, and shape shifting. Wait, stop there. Shape shifting? Now, that\u2019s something to take notice. Of course, Inaridoesn\u2019t obtain that ability after she recuses the spirit fox Kon from falling into the river. She has no idea that her life is about to change forever.\\n\\n\r\nBased off the manga of the same name, Morohe Yoshida crafts a work with traditional shoujo tropes but adds in additional elements. These elements ranges from the spiritual God Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami (aka. Uka), dealing with personal issues, and other life conflicts that can be relatable. By this standard, we can learn from Inari as a girl who is bound for discovery. This is because her ability now allows her to transform into the physical form of any human being as she wishes at will. With an ability like that, there\u2019s no limit to how much she can discover into another person\u2019s life. Perhaps more importantly may also be Inari\u2019s curious mind to discover herself with these new powers. Indeed, a shoujo series taking the concept of an identity license to not formulate it into a crisis but rather as a device should be something to think about.\\n\\n\r\nTo take this series to heart will take some patience as we get to know our main character, Inari. Because the show only adapts 10 episodes from the manga, the story may not expand to a point where complex plot holes will come together in packages. Rather, take the story like an anthology where each episode depicts a story involving Inari and her friends. This comes with the supernatural elements such as her ability to transform into the physical forms of others. It\u2019s a fun gag to think about considering the possibilities you can do with it. For Inari, it might be a dream come true because of her crush on Koji. What better way than become the most beautiful girl at the school that almost everyone wants to be friends with? Despite having these possibilities, she quickly learns that her powers has limits and is not as simple as it seems. Throughout each episode, we learn that Inari uses her power not for personal gains but rather as a way to help others. This is evident in particular episodes to protect certain people from danger. We see her maturity from a clumsy girl to a young woman capable of taking responsibilities. Despite her initial self-doubt, she also begins to learn how to utilize her powers with success and praise. In retrospective, Inari\u2019s powers gave her more than just the ability to shapeshift but also a way of discovering people both inside and outside. The show captures moments where this is explicitly well done with its performance with other characters that Inari forms relationships with. It explores various human emotions that fulfills themes such as jealousy, doubt, regret, insecurity among others. With great power comes great responsibility and Inari becomes the centerpiece of that.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show that focuses on romance, expect that abstraction to take on a more innocent form. Inari is a shy young girl that causes a rather embarrassing scene with her crush in the gym through her clumsiness in the first episode. It\u2019s funny how this can be relatable since love can be blind and make people do silly things. For Inari, it\u2019s can be more than just silly because her powers allows her to make possibilities and dreams into a reality. In fact, her dream is want to become someone special, a person of admiration, or as in the classic Yamato Nadeshiko. The character that would most closely resemble such an icon would be Akemi Sumizome. She has a pretty face, kind personality, and marvelous figure. In essence, she is both a character of admiration and envy for Inari. Yet, deep down, she has her own insecurities including her attraction to someone that makes her very insecure about herself. Despite seemingly existing in the opposite side a world, the duo forms a close relationship through discovery. Relationships are important in this show whether it\u2019d be romantic, platonic, parental, or between siblings. It\u2019s valuable to notice how relatable the show can be despite its fantasy elements as we see realism between certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nTaking on the fantasy trope comes forth spirits, apparitions, and Gods. Uka stands out on the fantasy side with her abilities to grant wishes including giving Inari the will to transform. Possessing a kind spirit, she blurs a bit between fantasy and reality with her characteristics. She holds wisdom but is also curious about the real world with her fascinations. This is evident by her interest in otaku game (otome genres seems to be her favorites), manga, and cultural norms that often pertain with the younger people. Her relationship with Inari\u2019s brother Toka is also quite amusing as the duo is incompatible but seems to get along through curiosity. Unfortunately, despite the insight that Uka brings into the show, she suffers a bit of characterization. We only know a little about her past and most of it is connected with Toka rather than with Inari or the others. Seemingly, she acts more like a character to test others (humans) because of her origins. Other supporting characters with fantasy attributes such as Miya and Kon suffers from personification of their selves. Most of the humans gets more insight to their relationship dynamics while the Gods features less emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nBeing labeled as a romantic comedy means the show should have a mixture of both. The romance aspect actually covers more than just Inari. It expands to characters including Sumizome, Koji, and even Toka. It brings a charm to this show that is innocent. There\u2019s no extreme jealousy or complex love triangles that spans out of control. Rather, it\u2019s simplistic and feels natural. However, some of the results of these romance angles might not satisfy fans. Bring a show together with a composition of only 10 episodes also means a suffering from development. Most of the relationships are only explored on a basic level with perhaps Inari getting the most spotlight. A more complex problem involves Sumizome as her feelings seems to rush out too quick that shows a lack of development. There\u2019s also less emphasis on the way drama are resolved. It feels more like soap opera at some points rather than a fantasy love story. There\u2019s less focus on dynamics but more on the drama, some which makes little sense. The strength of the comedy though does make up for this. Dialogues may feel cheesy but holds values of interest. We know that the characters are serious about their feelings and it\u2019s easy to understand where they come from. It mixtures it in with humorous scenes such as delusions, symbolisms, and fantasy elements. It comes together in a tolerable way with fun laughs. The show also doesn\u2019t rely on fan service to deliver its message. Instead, it\u2019s out in the open and straight forward on most parts. Oh and how can we forget when Inari transforms into someone else to fool others?\\n\\n\r\nThe first word that comes to my mind to describe this show\u2019s artwork is fantastic. It\u2019s fantastic no just in the way of being beautiful but rather as a credible way of portraying its settings. The background reflects a charming atmosphere with the temples and shrines. Transformation scenes matches well with consistency. Additionally, the Gods all have their unique designs with their hair styles, outfits, and distinctive features. Inari\u2019s design also captures her character as a clumsy girl who is walking steps to adolescence. Sumizome reflects exactly as a pretty girl with her figure. Even Toka is noticeable with his face expressions that defines him as a concerned brother. Elegance decorates this show on various levels and artwork fits with that title.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack mixes on a traditional scale with its fantasy vibes. More noticeable however is the character voices as some of them adapts a kansai accent. Main characters such as Inari and Sumizome speaks in Kansai-ben, rather than traditional Japanese. It\u2019s a distinctive trait that is quite noticeable yet can take time to get used to. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good mixture of voice mannerisms in the show such as Inari\u2019s spontaneous energy or Uka\u2019s curiosity in the human world. The OP & ED songs are decorated with colorful features that depicts exactly how a fantasy setting can be when mixed with modern values. \\n\\n\r\nTaken for granted, Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha is a charming show with innocence, values, and elegance. The story itself will feel a bit predictable and lack depth in characterization. However, its attributes in presenting human relationships between Gods and mortals is something hard to take eyes off of. Inari\u2019s life of discovery is fascinating that leads to various results between many characters. Its straightforward humor isn\u2019t rocket science but instead has its elements that will bring a keen sense to laugh. On the other hand, the romance aspect can feel a little childish. Yet, it defines innocence in not a strategic but effortless way. Sometimes, not everything needs to be complex even if you can take on the form of anyone you want. This show is simple just like how it should be.\\n",

            "content": "Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha is a sort of feel good anime. After every episode I watched, I just had this feeling of content that felt very relaxing. But of course, that doesn't mean this anime doesn't have any exciting moments. It very much does. \r\nInari is a normal middle school girl that lives in Koyoto's Fushimi ward. Like many girls her age, she has a tough time liking herself, which leads to her envying her good looking and friendly classmate Sumizome. Inari has a crush on her other classmate Funbabashi, but she can't seem to work up the nerve to talk to him, as comparedto Sumizome who has no problem with that. The plot picks up when, after seeing Sumizome give Funbabashi a love letter, Inari finds herself at the Inari shrine, a shrine for the god Inari. \\n\\n\r\nThere, she meets Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami (or simply Uka-sama for short). As thanks for saving a fox earlier, Uka-sama grants just one wish for Inari. Her wish is to be Sumizome, which leads to her acquiring powers to change her form at will. \\n\\n\r\nThe story sounds weak, and even starts out a bit weak, but with each episode the story grows stronger with the series of morals and life lessons it presents with each segment. The show itself sounds like it's a shoujo, but love and romance isn't heavy, contrary to what the synopsis says. It may seem like the main part of the story in the first few episodes, but the romance takes a back seat to the rest of the plot once the show gets going. Plus, it's middle schoolers primarily, so the romance shouldn't be too overbearing to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people seem to think the art is decent or average at best, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. The character designs were slightly plain when it came to the human characters, but the designs for the gods were unique and quite nice, even beautiful when it came to Uka-sama. The art is rather easy on the eyes, as in it's soft and colorful. The backgrounds were pretty and had amazing detail put into them. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I don't remember much of the OST, so it's pretty easy to forget and doesn't leave that much of an impression. The OP was nice, but also forgetful and lacking when compared to the ED. The ED, on the other hand, was a beautiful song. I think it's the best ED of the 2014 winter anime season. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, Inari acts just how she's supposed to act for her age: prone to crying and whiny all around. It's easy to see how many would become annoyed with her in the first few episodes. But, her character development is truly remarkable! At first she starts off as an insecure girl that wants to be like her classmate, but at the end she's learned to appreciate herself for who she is. It was very sweet seeing her go through this transformation. Even a few of Inari's friends went through some character development, as well as her older brother Touka. This series had a surprising amount of character development for only having 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha was an interesting take on the deity concept. It didn't need romance as the main idea, unlike a lot of other deity themed anime. I would even argue that the love between Inari and Uka-sama was the main relationship. They formed a loving friendship that was very pleasant to see and experience. The characters were all fun to watch, and I truly enjoyed all of them. The moral behind the series was refreshing as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for an extremely pleasant anime that also has exciting moments in it, then this is for you. If you're looking for an anime with a nice amount of character development, then this is also for you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I like to compare \"Inari Konkon\" with a person's first love, it's beautiful but really awkward. \r\nStory- 6/10 Inari is your typical slice of life RomCom with a dash of supernatural tossed in. The biggest problem with the story is it tries to have too many themes, is it a romance? A comedy? About friendship? Who really knows, and most of these themes don't really play out other than friendship. The romance element was very lacking, and for a series that I supposed to be centered around romance they didn't spend much time on the relationships at all. If you're looking for a slice oflife or romance, you're better off looking elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 the artwork was one of the only reasons I kept watching this series, it is very well done. All the shrine work and landscapes are absolutely beautiful. Character designs aren't anything special, but they're unique enough to be something special, especially since the story is so generic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10 lots of traditional japanese music played throughout the series and a very catchy op. Sometimes the sound tracks did get a bit repetitive but I like then enough it didn't bother me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -6/10 the characters of thinks series are kind of over dramatic, I really like Uka, but most of the other characters were simple and pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall - 7/10 Inari Konkon was a little too short, and a little too shallow to be truly great. It's quite unfortunate because it's artwork it's so phenomenal that it almost hurts that it's wasted on such a mediocre plot. If you skipped this one you wouldn't be missing out on much, but if you're looking for a decently quick story about friendship with great art, give it a shot!",

            "content": "Most anime of today mainly put the focus on appealing to our desires to see someone rise to power, capture us in a romantic struggle, riddle us with epic plots, or fuel our desire to crack a good laugh. However, this tale\u2019s focus is on something entirely different. Instead of focusing on any of these elements, it simply captures one\u2019s heart and never lets up. Adapted from Morohe Yoshida\u2019s manga, Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha (Inari Kon Kon for English) is a heart-warming series that will have you intrigued with its innocence and charm. We all like to believe that there is some spiritual presence guidingand watching over us, but Inari Kon Kon encourages its viewers to believe in themselves and create possibilities with our own power rather than depending on others. It\u2019s a modern, old-fashioned shoujo story with supernatural elements and does a fine job at balancing the silliness, heart, and slice-of-life drama that flows well without being forced at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup for Inari Kon Kon does sound like your typical generic show. When high-schooler and the main protagonist in Inari Fushimi, saves what she thinks is a fox pup from danger, she's rewarded by a visit from the goddess Uka. Uka has a sweet, big-sisterly demeanour, and also a large soft spot for human beings as a whole\u2014something underscored by her affinity for things like dating sims. To further show her gratitude to Inari, she blesses the girl with a smidgeon of her own power\u2014enough to allow Inari to transform into anyone else she chooses. Thus, the stage is set for what is apparently going to be a low-brow comedy of impersonation, where Inari pretends to be her friends, her brother, or her parents and the messes that result from this require a goddess to disentangle. Surprisingly enough, there is more to it than meets the eye. It's also about how Inari finds, over time, that using her power is more trouble than it's worth\u2014that you get a lot more mileage out of simply dealing with other people as people, and not as problems to be solved with the right degree of cleverness.\\n\\n\r\nUka, too, gets handled in a way that's out of phase with expectations. Her powers only go so far, for one, and her own desires and interests work against how they ought to be applied a good deal of the time. When she develops what could be described as a crush on Inari's older brother, Touka Fushimi, it's not a case of a dumbfounded human enjoying the pampering of a divine force. Instead, it's more about how Touka distrusts Uka deeply from the start and resents the way divine interference has made life difficult for both him and Inari. Gods belong with gods, and humans belong with humans\u2014something Uka also gets scold about from her own fellow gods. Over time, the show becomes more about the responsibilities both Inari and Uka have to themselves and each other, and less about what specific situations can be cooked up. Sometimes, giving other people what they ask for, even if they really want it, even if you believe it would make them happy\u2014only makes things worse. This last part hits home especially hard during a summer-camp sequence, normally one of those banal \u201cSine qua nons\u201d of anime, but handled here with more smarts and sensitivity than I was expecting. \\n\\n\r\nIn a later segment, it underscores this point even further. When Inari is asked by a friend in Akemi Sumizome to deliver a love letter to Kouji Tanbabashi, she herself as an affection for, she doesn't deliver the letter\u2014instead, she transforms into Akemi and tells Kouji herself, just so she can have the luxury of being able to say to him \"I really like you!\" But it means nothing for her to say that when it's not actually herself saying it. Inari didn't mean any harm by doing so which makes it feel meaningless. It's what happens, not what you intend, that matters in this world. As Shel Silverstein put it, it's that \"some kind of help is the kind of help, that helping's all about, and some kind of help is the kind of help, we can all do without.\" The same goes for Uka. All she ever wanted to do was enjoy the company of humans, and conferring some small quantity of her power upon Inari was meant to be a way for her to express that affection. Like Inari, she has a great deal of enthusiasm and good spirits; like Inari, she has little idea of how short-sighted and dangerous her actions are. It all comes home to roost when Inari discovers to her horror that the use of her power comes at the expense of Uka's very existence. Inari realises that she lacks control over her newfound power as problems arise and her schoolmates become distant towards her. Even when all hopes are gone, it is Inari\u2019s innocence and determination to make things right is what captivates the audience\u2019s hearts in the end. \\n\\n\r\nProduction IMS really made Inari Kon Kon\u2019s visuals look and feel like a Hayao Miyazaki film through their proficiency in capturing the essence of Japan\u2019s beautiful scenery, architecture and culture. The beautiful artwork on the ancient temples and authentic landscapes is so defining that you can\u2019t help but become immersed in its serenity and surrealism, it takes on a journey between two uniquely beautiful worlds. The human world is vibrant, lush, alluring and full of life, whereas the stylistic Celestial Plains is shrouded with a divine and magical atmosphere and heavenly elements and colour. The character designs are uniquely distinctive with a wide variety of flavours, especially the divine beings. The animation is smooth and fluid enough to bring out the best in the artwork. The soundtrack is more traditional with Japanese culture and had some nice orchestral ballads, in saying that, there were a few tracks overused and it is noticeable. Opening and Ending are lovely, fits the themes of the show and voice acting was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nMany anime, especially those aimed for a wide audience, prefer sincerity over profundity\u2014the idea that a simple notion expressed with great emotional weight is as good as, or better than, a deep idea expressed elaborately. Inari Kon Kon is simply a sweet, heart-warming tale of self-discovery, relationships and bonds, and dipping a little into the world of the gods. It is family-friendly and only 10 episodes, although, I wish there were more, there is enough content here for an enjoyable viewing. It\u2019s another example that It's always the simple that produces the marvellous and while you won\u2019t find any complex story or crazy action, there\u2019s still a clean and entertaining tale to be experienced.",

            "content": "At first, this anime wasn't in my \"To Watch\" list, in fact when I watch it, I was hoping to see some Uka fanservice, instead, I was taken away by this anime's story. This was probably one anime where its story and plot has a moral lesson, where it tells use to be careful of what you wish for or you might just get it. It also tell us that in sometimes when we  do something we have to be careful or otherwise we would have made it much worse than before, frankly this is where this anime's premise revolved around as we seeInari inspite of having Uka's divine powers she still end's up bungling around where another moral lesson comes around which that its better to come clean than hide from a mistake. So how do I rate this anime? Here's how.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nExplanation already provide above.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't have anything much to say about this anime's art at all, and quite frankly, there isn't much of any fanservice at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the opening theme, I kinda like Uka's VA,Kuwashima, Houko since she sounded like Inoue Kikuko, except that she sounded like the younger version of the latter. Inari.....not much, Touka's VA, yep I like the guy who did his voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, Inari, for me is somewhat annoying but then again lovable, for her to have Uka's powers proved to be more of a journey for her than an asset. Thought, I did said she is annoying, well, that's because she came to rely more on her divide powers instead of being direct and facing such challenges, however for her to realize the things she have done is what makes her a lovable.\\n\\n\r\nUka- hummm, ok, here we have a deity who seems to wanna mingle with humans, just like Inari, she too was guilty of making things much worse than before, that instead of educating Inari she basically when with her flow, however I kinda like that romance element that she has with Touka.\\n\\n\r\nTouka- he is probably one of few male character's isn't having any brocon situation with Inari, thought, I kinda like the part where he knocks some sense into Inari and Uka. If this anime could have an intense romance genre both he and Uka would be a good pair. \\n\\n\r\nOthoshi-  I guess he is more on the comedy side of this anime and his character did it well, then again he also represent the usual incest thing where it is prevalent in most Japanese anime/ manga.\\n\\n\r\nAkemi, Chika, and Keiko- they maybe just trio of support character's but they're the support characters that has contributed a lot on this anime's overall. But, I kinda hate that yuri element where Akemi is in love with Keiko.\\n\\n\r\nKouji- on the other hand I kinda felt sorry that in this story his character was very minimal, though a romance with Inari would also have added more to this anime's story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nI'd probably say that this is probably the only one that has sense and value at the start of this year, so really it is outstanding. I got to hand to the writer of this thing, he really did took such inspiration from a movie with similar plot and yes I'm referring to the movie \"Bruce Almighty\" where it it both revolves in the same theme of a mortal having the powers of a god only to misused it without realizing the damage he/she has done, except this anime was more on the subtle side.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "I rated \"Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha\" higher than I've ever rated any anime before. Why?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n-I absolutely loved the story in this anime. It's very sweet and really tugs at your heart, sometimes pretty hard. It's really easy to relate to how the main character, Inari Fushimi, feels. Who hasn't experienced the desire to change for someone you love? Being jealous of others who have a better chance with them, even if you don't want to be? \"Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha\" expresses these things to the viewer in a way that's not obnoxious. The story is great, but it really wouldn't be where it wasif not for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n-The art in this anime is gorgeous, and it boasts that. Animation is smooth, and visuals are always key on expressing the mood of a scene. Color is very well expressed, and they're all very vibrant. Character designs are all very unique from each other as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n-The sound does its job well. The music is the biggest plus in this category; there's plenty of classical Japanese music filling the series. The opening is beautiful. But while the other sounds are nice, they don't particularly stand out to me. But, like I said, they do their job well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n-In my opinion, the characters are the strongest points in this anime, with the exception of very few. I found them all to be fairly memorable. Inari and Uka have very real emotions that the vast majority of viewers can relate to. Inari's brother, Touka, has a lot of growth throughout the show. Inari's friends: Chika, Akemi, and Keiko are fairly diverse. The most notable thing of those three is that even though Chika is overweight, she's still made out to be a lovable character, which isn't something we get to see in a lot of anime. I'd have liked those three to show up more. Characters I don't think were developed well would be Inari's love interest and Uka's brother. Inari's love interest, Kouji, didn't really have a lot of expression in the show. He felt almost one-dimensional. He's better in the manga. Uka's brother felt like a typically necessary siscon trope that had to be thrown in. I could go on all day about other characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n-The reason I rated this an 8 instead of a 9 is because of the show's length. It's really hard for many viewers to fall in love with a show that only has 10 episodes, and I understand that feeling. Otherwise, I can't express the enjoyment I felt during this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n-I really loved this show, and the characters are largely what made everything else for me. I haven't had this much love for an anime for awhile, so I'll always treasure this show. I highly recommend checking out the manga if you enjoyed the anime!",

            "content": "TL;DR\r\n+ cute story/characters\r\n+ heart-warming\r\n- dragged ending\r\n- short\r\nStory\r\nRevolves around girl called Inari and a god Uka. One day Inari wishes at shrine to become someone else, good-willed Uka wants to help her, so she transforms her. Inari soon regrets this, Uka feels guilty, magic happens and now Inari can transform to anyone she wants. This is main story in nutshell, with cute little romance growing in the background. Not amazing, but still decent.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that ending warries a bit from manga, in a sense that it felt dragged out.\r\nArt\r\nCharacters and vistas pretty average overall, animation maybe little above but still nothing to drool over.Bonus point for nice design though.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile opening and ending songs were nothing special, soundtract itself is nice and pleasant to listen to. Pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAll characters are good. Even when someone is bad for 5 minutes, they apologize and become best friends. Inari is one of those too-good kind of character, Uka just wants to play games with friends, Inari's brother is tsundere.\\n\r\nAnime is pretty short and relationships between characters develop fairly quickly, as Inari makes friends easily. Personally I'd love to see more development between Inari's bro and Uka, but guess I'll have to read manga for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis may be a little biased. I realy like japanese mythology, therefore I enjoyed watching this a lot. Also Inari's way of dealing with problems kept pleasing my heart. Only things I didn't like were Uka's brother and slightly dragged ending. (which sounds weird considering it was pretty short anime)\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGreat show if you like japanese mythology and heart-warming and relaxing story.",

            "content": "Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha Is a interesting show to be honest. It doesn't do any of the stuff you would expect from show with a human getting god like powers and able to change into anyone and i mean even the fun stuff from these types of show's.\r\nI came in expecting the MC to be more goofy and mess around more. But in this she just does nothing of interest with these powers. The characters reactions tend to be lackluster and the story feels very ham-fisted. \r\n~~SPOILERS~~\r\nAny drama that happens feels artificial. Such as both Uka and Inari not wanting to tell each other causethey don't want to worry each other. The entire story could not happen if they didn't act like actual people. Near the end the ruler of the gods ( Or whatever she is meant to be ) Locks Uka in a cave and she ends up almost killing herself cause of that. It just feels very blah to me.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the Uka god slowly dyeing cause she put her powers in Inari. Her reasoning is that she want to be able to see Inari so she is willing to kill her self. Let alone how eh i think it is that a god ( That for all we know is invincible) Can die by such a way. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also Inari who doesn't do anything fun or of interest with her powers. There is a scene where they are both in a log cabin and i was really wanting her to leave at night and turn into a bear or some other weird giant creature. But that doesn't even happen and i can't help but feel ripped off by this.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on the things that bug me but i don't want this to be an entire essay. But there is some stuff i liked such as :\\n\\n\r\nHow the gods are portrayed as powerful but not all eye seeing and knowing everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also very nice along with the music .\\n\\n\r\nI would give this around a 7.6 or 7.7 But i'm gonna just round it to 8.",

            "content": "I was pleasently surprised when I watched this anime, here's why:\r\nStory 9/10\r\nWelcome to the life of Inari, a girl with three friends and who is quite clumsy. She lives nearby a shrine that called the Inari Shrine. When she is in a hurry to go to school, she sees a little fox and helps it out of trouble. Then she may have a wish fullfilled by the diety of the shrine. Her wish: to turn into somebody else. Of course this will bring trouble and all that kind of stuff along. You could say this story isn't original, but I it is, go and watchit, you'll see why.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was well done, it looked good. It remembered I saw the same kind of art in another anime but I can't remember which one.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI don't have really anything to say about it. It was good, and the opening was allright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nNot everybody will agree with me that I give the characters a 9. Here my explanation:\\n\\n\r\nInari is your tipical clumsy girl who is in love with Tanbabashi. When she gets the power to transform she doesn't alway know how to deal with it. She is someone who makes friends pretty easily. She is a pretty optimistic girl who cares about others. And she cries pretty fast. But I liked her.\\n\\n\r\nUkanomitama-no-kami, her name is way to long so let's just call her Uka just like in the anime. She is the diety of the shrine who gives a part of her power away. She is a first-rank diety and doesn't want to get married with some random god. She likes playing games and sometimes goes to Inari's brother, Touka, to play games with.\\n\\n\r\nTanbabashi, now why should I tell anything about him? It's just a short discription: A boy who's never been in love before and plays basketball. He helps people out with stuff.\\n\\n\r\nTouka, Touka is Inari's brother. He gets angry pretty easily. But maybe I just like that kind of character.. For some reason he is able to see Uka. This is something normal people can't. He plays games with Uka. And well, just thinking they get some feelings for each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this anime. I liked the story. It's mostly about friendship and romance and has of course the supernatural part. I cried at times, and that's when Inari cried too.\\n\r\nIt's also funny at times and sometimes the story goes deeper. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nWell, I liked the anime, I do recommend it. To be honest, a lot happened in this anime, and it didn't feel rushed. Something I did feel when watching Itazura na Kiss for example. This was an anime with an ending that I liked and also disliked a little. It was what you could expect to happen. Well, never mind, I liked it :)",

            "content": "During the year 2014, Studio TROYCA gained sufficient popularity from its collaboration with Gen Urobuchi, birthing a hub of controversy\u30fcAldnoah.Zero, unbeknownst to many during that time, TROYCA released another series during that year that went under the radar because it wasn\u2019t co-written by the guy who was primarily known for Madoka Magica and partially for gory, tentacle lolis (Saya no Uta).\r\n\t\u2022 I didn\u2019t think that I would like Inari Kon Kon after watching the first episode, because the female protagonist is pretty much a mouth-breathing creep that envies a pretty girl that her crush likes\u30fcso much so that she wishes for a shrine God toturn her into that girl.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Luckily, the series doesn\u2019t permanently stay in that stasis of continuity for very long, but there is a lot of main character privilege in the first half of the series. A Shrine God evens appoints the lead girl as a demi-God, why? Because she bandages the leg of an injured kitsune.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I guess, by that logic, if you save an animal, a Shinto God may bequeath you with OP abilities, because you\u2019re a special snowflake. The more the series progresses though, the more that it becomes likable. You find out that OP demi-God girl is granted abilities and later realize that she hurts other people with being careless with them.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There are really good messages about superficiality, bullying, and LGBTQ themes intertwined in this fairly short, ten episode series. Some of the romances escalate too quickly, in my opinion, but the show is extremely short and the producers probably needed to wrap up the story in a conclusive way. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Despite a series that\u2019s designed like a shoujo, there is a lot of cleavage shots of Uta, but Studio TROYCA does seem to like to incorporate fanservice for males and females in all of their shows that I\u2019ve seen\u30fclike Aldnoah.Zero and Re:Creators. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 If I could compare the atmosphere and the humor of this to anything, I would say that it\u2019s very bubbly and feminine, like Kamisama Kiss and Jellyfish Princess. Despite the issues that I mentioned, the series is very enjoyable and pretty to look at. If you have free time, I would suggest watching, since it\u2019s only ten episodes and very cute/feel-goodsy. I give Inari Kon Kon a 5/10.",

            "content": "Overall, I really enjoyed this. I do wish it had been a few episodes longer, though. Even one more episode could have tied up the ending in what would have been, I believe, a more satisfactory ending. I think this is a great adaptation of the manga. It stayed pretty true to the story, though it was much faster paced. I really love this story for a lot of reasons, but mostly I think it has really positive role models for girls (which can be hard to find). I appreciate the inclusion of the Sumizome/Keiko, even though it didn't really develop at all. One thingI was really impressed with, though, was the background noises, such as the sound of the geta on the tiles. It was a small detail, but it was so well done that it deserved a mention.\\n\\n\r\nIn sum, I don't necessarily think that there is anything about Inari konkon that makes it stand out amongst other shoujou anime, but it is short enough that you won't feel like you wasted your time, and it won't leave you feeling unsatisfied.",

It won my heart by the second episode, with interesting characters and a beautiful plot.\r\n The anime is about a sweet shy girl named Inari who has a hard time conveying her feelings. One day Inari witnesses her crush handing a love letter to a beautiful girl. Depressed Inari runs off to her family shrine and cries out \"I wish I could be her\". A fox deity who lives at the shrine appears and gives Inari a \"divine power\" that allows her to shape shift. The anime mainly focuses on how Inari uses this power.\r\nThis isthe perfect anime for me. I'm a sucker for cute love stories with some supernatural elements. My favorite things about this anime are the character development, setting, and art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. I have nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was lovely, suited the anime perfectly. Sweet and nostalgic, gives me this feeling like I'm floating. The OP was cute but not anything memorable.

It switches between the two themes frequently, so romance elements tend to lack and almost end up being dropped. That being said however, it's still enjoyable and easy to follow.\r\nArt: 10/10 I adored the artwork. It is very well done. From the shrines to the landscapes of basic surroundings, it was really beautiful. The characters were average and nothing special, kinda basic, but it's not like they're an imitation of other anime characters.\r\nCharacters: 7/10 Although the characters were kinda generic,I still found them enjoyable. I really enjoyed Uka being a main character and all the others added in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall: 7/10 Overall, it was kinda too short. In 10 episodes they tried to wrap up two themes that probably needed to be elaborated on a bit more. Half way through it felt like the story was still developing and the ending left me unsatisfied. I felt that it was dropped and restricted, but that's a personal opinion on it. I would recommend it, after all it's only 10 episodes.",

I have to admit I got here cause I googled \"animes to watch when you are depressed\" [to chear you up, not to get even worse], and I feel very lucky that this anime was in that recommendation.\r\nAnd now I can just recommend it too, because its a great show!\r\nInari is a normal girl with dreams and wishes like any ordinary girl, but with an unusual big heart, and she gets to meet Uka-sama, a godness that prefers to be on Earth watching us humans goingthorugh the cycle of life -while she plays otome games- instead of living with the other Gods.\\n\\n\r\nInari Konkon has drama, comedy, action, shintoism, and lots of love and hapiness. I rarely I found myself loving *all* the characters, chearing up all the couples and wishing they would all be happy, cause they are all just so lovely and human-like, they are the back bone of the show. Inari Konkon is about friendship, something that we are loosing more and more everyday, right? \\n\\n\r\nSo my recommendation is, if you feel down [sometimes I even feel down cause I was watching another anime that was too depressing!], if you want to see pure love and friendship, if you want to be part of a beautiful story, you have to watch this show. It's not an average romance anime, the relationships are handled with a lot of maturity, which I apreciate everyday more and more. Finally, if you loved the show I *really* advice to read the manga, it's seriously worth it. [The Inari shrine it's now on my list of places I will visit if get the chance to go to Japan!]",

        {
            "content": "Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha is the type of show where you\u2019d come in expecting what you\u2019ll get. The thought of \u2018typical romance with a cute middle school girl\u2019 is what most people will come into mind. And you would be right because this show is about a middle school girl named Inari Fushimi, a clumsy character with an innocent personality and heartwarming crush on her fellow classmate, Koji Tanabashi. In essence, this show is what a classic shoujo would offer \u2013 a spirited series of cuteness, fun, charms, and shape shifting. Wait, stop there. Shape shifting? Now, that\u2019s something to take notice. Of course, Inaridoesn\u2019t obtain that ability after she recuses the spirit fox Kon from falling into the river. She has no idea that her life is about to change forever.\\n\\n\r\nBased off the manga of the same name, Morohe Yoshida crafts a work with traditional shoujo tropes but adds in additional elements. These elements ranges from the spiritual God Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami (aka. Uka), dealing with personal issues, and other life conflicts that can be relatable. By this standard, we can learn from Inari as a girl who is bound for discovery. This is because her ability now allows her to transform into the physical form of any human being as she wishes at will. With an ability like that, there\u2019s no limit to how much she can discover into another person\u2019s life. Perhaps more importantly may also be Inari\u2019s curious mind to discover herself with these new powers. Indeed, a shoujo series taking the concept of an identity license to not formulate it into a crisis but rather as a device should be something to think about.\\n\\n\r\nTo take this series to heart will take some patience as we get to know our main character, Inari. Because the show only adapts 10 episodes from the manga, the story may not expand to a point where complex plot holes will come together in packages. Rather, take the story like an anthology where each episode depicts a story involving Inari and her friends. This comes with the supernatural elements such as her ability to transform into the physical forms of others. It\u2019s a fun gag to think about considering the possibilities you can do with it. For Inari, it might be a dream come true because of her crush on Koji. What better way than become the most beautiful girl at the school that almost everyone wants to be friends with? Despite having these possibilities, she quickly learns that her powers has limits and is not as simple as it seems. Throughout each episode, we learn that Inari uses her power not for personal gains but rather as a way to help others. This is evident in particular episodes to protect certain people from danger. We see her maturity from a clumsy girl to a young woman capable of taking responsibilities. Despite her initial self-doubt, she also begins to learn how to utilize her powers with success and praise. In retrospective, Inari\u2019s powers gave her more than just the ability to shapeshift but also a way of discovering people both inside and outside. The show captures moments where this is explicitly well done with its performance with other characters that Inari forms relationships with. It explores various human emotions that fulfills themes such as jealousy, doubt, regret, insecurity among others. With great power comes great responsibility and Inari becomes the centerpiece of that.\\n\\n\r\nAs a show that focuses on romance, expect that abstraction to take on a more innocent form. Inari is a shy young girl that causes a rather embarrassing scene with her crush in the gym through her clumsiness in the first episode. It\u2019s funny how this can be relatable since love can be blind and make people do silly things. For Inari, it\u2019s can be more than just silly because her powers allows her to make possibilities and dreams into a reality. In fact, her dream is want to become someone special, a person of admiration, or as in the classic Yamato Nadeshiko. The character that would most closely resemble such an icon would be Akemi Sumizome. She has a pretty face, kind personality, and marvelous figure. In essence, she is both a character of admiration and envy for Inari. Yet, deep down, she has her own insecurities including her attraction to someone that makes her very insecure about herself. Despite seemingly existing in the opposite side a world, the duo forms a close relationship through discovery. Relationships are important in this show whether it\u2019d be romantic, platonic, parental, or between siblings. It\u2019s valuable to notice how relatable the show can be despite its fantasy elements as we see realism between certain characters.\\n\\n\r\nTaking on the fantasy trope comes forth spirits, apparitions, and Gods. Uka stands out on the fantasy side with her abilities to grant wishes including giving Inari the will to transform. Possessing a kind spirit, she blurs a bit between fantasy and reality with her characteristics. She holds wisdom but is also curious about the real world with her fascinations. This is evident by her interest in otaku game (otome genres seems to be her favorites), manga, and cultural norms that often pertain with the younger people. Her relationship with Inari\u2019s brother Toka is also quite amusing as the duo is incompatible but seems to get along through curiosity. Unfortunately, despite the insight that Uka brings into the show, she suffers a bit of characterization. We only know a little about her past and most of it is connected with Toka rather than with Inari or the others. Seemingly, she acts more like a character to test others (humans) because of her origins. Other supporting characters with fantasy attributes such as Miya and Kon suffers from personification of their selves. Most of the humans gets more insight to their relationship dynamics while the Gods features less emphasis.\\n\\n\r\nBeing labeled as a romantic comedy means the show should have a mixture of both. The romance aspect actually covers more than just Inari. It expands to characters including Sumizome, Koji, and even Toka. It brings a charm to this show that is innocent. There\u2019s no extreme jealousy or complex love triangles that spans out of control. Rather, it\u2019s simplistic and feels natural. However, some of the results of these romance angles might not satisfy fans. Bring a show together with a composition of only 10 episodes also means a suffering from development. Most of the relationships are only explored on a basic level with perhaps Inari getting the most spotlight. A more complex problem involves Sumizome as her feelings seems to rush out too quick that shows a lack of development. There\u2019s also less emphasis on the way drama are resolved. It feels more like soap opera at some points rather than a fantasy love story. There\u2019s less focus on dynamics but more on the drama, some which makes little sense. The strength of the comedy though does make up for this. Dialogues may feel cheesy but holds values of interest. We know that the characters are serious about their feelings and it\u2019s easy to understand where they come from. It mixtures it in with humorous scenes such as delusions, symbolisms, and fantasy elements. It comes together in a tolerable way with fun laughs. The show also doesn\u2019t rely on fan service to deliver its message. Instead, it\u2019s out in the open and straight forward on most parts. Oh and how can we forget when Inari transforms into someone else to fool others?\\n\\n\r\nThe first word that comes to my mind to describe this show\u2019s artwork is fantastic. It\u2019s fantastic no just in the way of being beautiful but rather as a credible way of portraying its settings. The background reflects a charming atmosphere with the temples and shrines. Transformation scenes matches well with consistency. Additionally, the Gods all have their unique designs with their hair styles, outfits, and distinctive features. Inari\u2019s design also captures her character as a clumsy girl who is walking steps to adolescence. Sumizome reflects exactly as a pretty girl with her figure. Even Toka is noticeable with his face expressions that defines him as a concerned brother. Elegance decorates this show on various levels and artwork fits with that title.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack mixes on a traditional scale with its fantasy vibes. More noticeable however is the character voices as some of them adapts a kansai accent. Main characters such as Inari and Sumizome speaks in Kansai-ben, rather than traditional Japanese. It\u2019s a distinctive trait that is quite noticeable yet can take time to get used to. Otherwise, there\u2019s a good mixture of voice mannerisms in the show such as Inari\u2019s spontaneous energy or Uka\u2019s curiosity in the human world. The OP & ED songs are decorated with colorful features that depicts exactly how a fantasy setting can be when mixed with modern values. \\n\\n\r\nTaken for granted, Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha is a charming show with innocence, values, and elegance. The story itself will feel a bit predictable and lack depth in characterization. However, its attributes in presenting human relationships between Gods and mortals is something hard to take eyes off of. Inari\u2019s life of discovery is fascinating that leads to various results between many characters. Its straightforward humor isn\u2019t rocket science but instead has its elements that will bring a keen sense to laugh. On the other hand, the romance aspect can feel a little childish. Yet, it defines innocence in not a strategic but effortless way. Sometimes, not everything needs to be complex even if you can take on the form of anyone you want. This show is simple just like how it should be.\\n",

            "content": "Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha is a sort of feel good anime. After every episode I watched, I just had this feeling of content that felt very relaxing. But of course, that doesn't mean this anime doesn't have any exciting moments. It very much does. \r\nInari is a normal middle school girl that lives in Koyoto's Fushimi ward. Like many girls her age, she has a tough time liking herself, which leads to her envying her good looking and friendly classmate Sumizome. Inari has a crush on her other classmate Funbabashi, but she can't seem to work up the nerve to talk to him, as comparedto Sumizome who has no problem with that. The plot picks up when, after seeing Sumizome give Funbabashi a love letter, Inari finds herself at the Inari shrine, a shrine for the god Inari. \\n\\n\r\nThere, she meets Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami (or simply Uka-sama for short). As thanks for saving a fox earlier, Uka-sama grants just one wish for Inari. Her wish is to be Sumizome, which leads to her acquiring powers to change her form at will. \\n\\n\r\nThe story sounds weak, and even starts out a bit weak, but with each episode the story grows stronger with the series of morals and life lessons it presents with each segment. The show itself sounds like it's a shoujo, but love and romance isn't heavy, contrary to what the synopsis says. It may seem like the main part of the story in the first few episodes, but the romance takes a back seat to the rest of the plot once the show gets going. Plus, it's middle schoolers primarily, so the romance shouldn't be too overbearing to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of people seem to think the art is decent or average at best, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. The character designs were slightly plain when it came to the human characters, but the designs for the gods were unique and quite nice, even beautiful when it came to Uka-sama. The art is rather easy on the eyes, as in it's soft and colorful. The backgrounds were pretty and had amazing detail put into them. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound, I don't remember much of the OST, so it's pretty easy to forget and doesn't leave that much of an impression. The OP was nice, but also forgetful and lacking when compared to the ED. The ED, on the other hand, was a beautiful song. I think it's the best ED of the 2014 winter anime season. \\n\\n\r\nAt first, Inari acts just how she's supposed to act for her age: prone to crying and whiny all around. It's easy to see how many would become annoyed with her in the first few episodes. But, her character development is truly remarkable! At first she starts off as an insecure girl that wants to be like her classmate, but at the end she's learned to appreciate herself for who she is. It was very sweet seeing her go through this transformation. Even a few of Inari's friends went through some character development, as well as her older brother Touka. This series had a surprising amount of character development for only having 10 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha was an interesting take on the deity concept. It didn't need romance as the main idea, unlike a lot of other deity themed anime. I would even argue that the love between Inari and Uka-sama was the main relationship. They formed a loving friendship that was very pleasant to see and experience. The characters were all fun to watch, and I truly enjoyed all of them. The moral behind the series was refreshing as well.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for an extremely pleasant anime that also has exciting moments in it, then this is for you. If you're looking for an anime with a nice amount of character development, then this is also for you. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I like to compare \"Inari Konkon\" with a person's first love, it's beautiful but really awkward. \r\nStory- 6/10 Inari is your typical slice of life RomCom with a dash of supernatural tossed in. The biggest problem with the story is it tries to have too many themes, is it a romance? A comedy? About friendship? Who really knows, and most of these themes don't really play out other than friendship. The romance element was very lacking, and for a series that I supposed to be centered around romance they didn't spend much time on the relationships at all. If you're looking for a slice oflife or romance, you're better off looking elsewhere.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10 the artwork was one of the only reasons I kept watching this series, it is very well done. All the shrine work and landscapes are absolutely beautiful. Character designs aren't anything special, but they're unique enough to be something special, especially since the story is so generic.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10 lots of traditional japanese music played throughout the series and a very catchy op. Sometimes the sound tracks did get a bit repetitive but I like then enough it didn't bother me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters -6/10 the characters of thinks series are kind of over dramatic, I really like Uka, but most of the other characters were simple and pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall - 7/10 Inari Konkon was a little too short, and a little too shallow to be truly great. It's quite unfortunate because it's artwork it's so phenomenal that it almost hurts that it's wasted on such a mediocre plot. If you skipped this one you wouldn't be missing out on much, but if you're looking for a decently quick story about friendship with great art, give it a shot!",

            "content": "Most anime of today mainly put the focus on appealing to our desires to see someone rise to power, capture us in a romantic struggle, riddle us with epic plots, or fuel our desire to crack a good laugh. However, this tale\u2019s focus is on something entirely different. Instead of focusing on any of these elements, it simply captures one\u2019s heart and never lets up. Adapted from Morohe Yoshida\u2019s manga, Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha (Inari Kon Kon for English) is a heart-warming series that will have you intrigued with its innocence and charm. We all like to believe that there is some spiritual presence guidingand watching over us, but Inari Kon Kon encourages its viewers to believe in themselves and create possibilities with our own power rather than depending on others. It\u2019s a modern, old-fashioned shoujo story with supernatural elements and does a fine job at balancing the silliness, heart, and slice-of-life drama that flows well without being forced at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe setup for Inari Kon Kon does sound like your typical generic show. When high-schooler and the main protagonist in Inari Fushimi, saves what she thinks is a fox pup from danger, she's rewarded by a visit from the goddess Uka. Uka has a sweet, big-sisterly demeanour, and also a large soft spot for human beings as a whole\u2014something underscored by her affinity for things like dating sims. To further show her gratitude to Inari, she blesses the girl with a smidgeon of her own power\u2014enough to allow Inari to transform into anyone else she chooses. Thus, the stage is set for what is apparently going to be a low-brow comedy of impersonation, where Inari pretends to be her friends, her brother, or her parents and the messes that result from this require a goddess to disentangle. Surprisingly enough, there is more to it than meets the eye. It's also about how Inari finds, over time, that using her power is more trouble than it's worth\u2014that you get a lot more mileage out of simply dealing with other people as people, and not as problems to be solved with the right degree of cleverness.\\n\\n\r\nUka, too, gets handled in a way that's out of phase with expectations. Her powers only go so far, for one, and her own desires and interests work against how they ought to be applied a good deal of the time. When she develops what could be described as a crush on Inari's older brother, Touka Fushimi, it's not a case of a dumbfounded human enjoying the pampering of a divine force. Instead, it's more about how Touka distrusts Uka deeply from the start and resents the way divine interference has made life difficult for both him and Inari. Gods belong with gods, and humans belong with humans\u2014something Uka also gets scold about from her own fellow gods. Over time, the show becomes more about the responsibilities both Inari and Uka have to themselves and each other, and less about what specific situations can be cooked up. Sometimes, giving other people what they ask for, even if they really want it, even if you believe it would make them happy\u2014only makes things worse. This last part hits home especially hard during a summer-camp sequence, normally one of those banal \u201cSine qua nons\u201d of anime, but handled here with more smarts and sensitivity than I was expecting. \\n\\n\r\nIn a later segment, it underscores this point even further. When Inari is asked by a friend in Akemi Sumizome to deliver a love letter to Kouji Tanbabashi, she herself as an affection for, she doesn't deliver the letter\u2014instead, she transforms into Akemi and tells Kouji herself, just so she can have the luxury of being able to say to him \"I really like you!\" But it means nothing for her to say that when it's not actually herself saying it. Inari didn't mean any harm by doing so which makes it feel meaningless. It's what happens, not what you intend, that matters in this world. As Shel Silverstein put it, it's that \"some kind of help is the kind of help, that helping's all about, and some kind of help is the kind of help, we can all do without.\" The same goes for Uka. All she ever wanted to do was enjoy the company of humans, and conferring some small quantity of her power upon Inari was meant to be a way for her to express that affection. Like Inari, she has a great deal of enthusiasm and good spirits; like Inari, she has little idea of how short-sighted and dangerous her actions are. It all comes home to roost when Inari discovers to her horror that the use of her power comes at the expense of Uka's very existence. Inari realises that she lacks control over her newfound power as problems arise and her schoolmates become distant towards her. Even when all hopes are gone, it is Inari\u2019s innocence and determination to make things right is what captivates the audience\u2019s hearts in the end. \\n\\n\r\nProduction IMS really made Inari Kon Kon\u2019s visuals look and feel like a Hayao Miyazaki film through their proficiency in capturing the essence of Japan\u2019s beautiful scenery, architecture and culture. The beautiful artwork on the ancient temples and authentic landscapes is so defining that you can\u2019t help but become immersed in its serenity and surrealism, it takes on a journey between two uniquely beautiful worlds. The human world is vibrant, lush, alluring and full of life, whereas the stylistic Celestial Plains is shrouded with a divine and magical atmosphere and heavenly elements and colour. The character designs are uniquely distinctive with a wide variety of flavours, especially the divine beings. The animation is smooth and fluid enough to bring out the best in the artwork. The soundtrack is more traditional with Japanese culture and had some nice orchestral ballads, in saying that, there were a few tracks overused and it is noticeable. Opening and Ending are lovely, fits the themes of the show and voice acting was fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nMany anime, especially those aimed for a wide audience, prefer sincerity over profundity\u2014the idea that a simple notion expressed with great emotional weight is as good as, or better than, a deep idea expressed elaborately. Inari Kon Kon is simply a sweet, heart-warming tale of self-discovery, relationships and bonds, and dipping a little into the world of the gods. It is family-friendly and only 10 episodes, although, I wish there were more, there is enough content here for an enjoyable viewing. It\u2019s another example that It's always the simple that produces the marvellous and while you won\u2019t find any complex story or crazy action, there\u2019s still a clean and entertaining tale to be experienced.",

            "content": "At first, this anime wasn't in my \"To Watch\" list, in fact when I watch it, I was hoping to see some Uka fanservice, instead, I was taken away by this anime's story. This was probably one anime where its story and plot has a moral lesson, where it tells use to be careful of what you wish for or you might just get it. It also tell us that in sometimes when we  do something we have to be careful or otherwise we would have made it much worse than before, frankly this is where this anime's premise revolved around as we seeInari inspite of having Uka's divine powers she still end's up bungling around where another moral lesson comes around which that its better to come clean than hide from a mistake. So how do I rate this anime? Here's how.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nExplanation already provide above.  \\n\\n\r\nArt: Mediocre 5.\\n\\n\r\nI just don't have anything much to say about this anime's art at all, and quite frankly, there isn't much of any fanservice at all.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good 7.\\n\\n\r\nAside from the opening theme, I kinda like Uka's VA,Kuwashima, Houko since she sounded like Inoue Kikuko, except that she sounded like the younger version of the latter. Inari.....not much, Touka's VA, yep I like the guy who did his voice.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Very Good 8.\\n\\n\r\nOk, Inari, for me is somewhat annoying but then again lovable, for her to have Uka's powers proved to be more of a journey for her than an asset. Thought, I did said she is annoying, well, that's because she came to rely more on her divide powers instead of being direct and facing such challenges, however for her to realize the things she have done is what makes her a lovable.\\n\\n\r\nUka- hummm, ok, here we have a deity who seems to wanna mingle with humans, just like Inari, she too was guilty of making things much worse than before, that instead of educating Inari she basically when with her flow, however I kinda like that romance element that she has with Touka.\\n\\n\r\nTouka- he is probably one of few male character's isn't having any brocon situation with Inari, thought, I kinda like the part where he knocks some sense into Inari and Uka. If this anime could have an intense romance genre both he and Uka would be a good pair. \\n\\n\r\nOthoshi-  I guess he is more on the comedy side of this anime and his character did it well, then again he also represent the usual incest thing where it is prevalent in most Japanese anime/ manga.\\n\\n\r\nAkemi, Chika, and Keiko- they maybe just trio of support character's but they're the support characters that has contributed a lot on this anime's overall. But, I kinda hate that yuri element where Akemi is in love with Keiko.\\n\\n\r\nKouji- on the other hand I kinda felt sorry that in this story his character was very minimal, though a romance with Inari would also have added more to this anime's story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: Outstanding 10.\\n\\n\r\nI'd probably say that this is probably the only one that has sense and value at the start of this year, so really it is outstanding. I got to hand to the writer of this thing, he really did took such inspiration from a movie with similar plot and yes I'm referring to the movie \"Bruce Almighty\" where it it both revolves in the same theme of a mortal having the powers of a god only to misused it without realizing the damage he/she has done, except this anime was more on the subtle side.   \\n\\n",

            "content": "I rated \"Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha\" higher than I've ever rated any anime before. Why?\r\nStory: 8/10\r\n-I absolutely loved the story in this anime. It's very sweet and really tugs at your heart, sometimes pretty hard. It's really easy to relate to how the main character, Inari Fushimi, feels. Who hasn't experienced the desire to change for someone you love? Being jealous of others who have a better chance with them, even if you don't want to be? \"Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha\" expresses these things to the viewer in a way that's not obnoxious. The story is great, but it really wouldn't be where it wasif not for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\n-The art in this anime is gorgeous, and it boasts that. Animation is smooth, and visuals are always key on expressing the mood of a scene. Color is very well expressed, and they're all very vibrant. Character designs are all very unique from each other as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10\\n\r\n-The sound does its job well. The music is the biggest plus in this category; there's plenty of classical Japanese music filling the series. The opening is beautiful. But while the other sounds are nice, they don't particularly stand out to me. But, like I said, they do their job well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\n-In my opinion, the characters are the strongest points in this anime, with the exception of very few. I found them all to be fairly memorable. Inari and Uka have very real emotions that the vast majority of viewers can relate to. Inari's brother, Touka, has a lot of growth throughout the show. Inari's friends: Chika, Akemi, and Keiko are fairly diverse. The most notable thing of those three is that even though Chika is overweight, she's still made out to be a lovable character, which isn't something we get to see in a lot of anime. I'd have liked those three to show up more. Characters I don't think were developed well would be Inari's love interest and Uka's brother. Inari's love interest, Kouji, didn't really have a lot of expression in the show. He felt almost one-dimensional. He's better in the manga. Uka's brother felt like a typically necessary siscon trope that had to be thrown in. I could go on all day about other characters in the show.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\n-The reason I rated this an 8 instead of a 9 is because of the show's length. It's really hard for many viewers to fall in love with a show that only has 10 episodes, and I understand that feeling. Otherwise, I can't express the enjoyment I felt during this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\n-I really loved this show, and the characters are largely what made everything else for me. I haven't had this much love for an anime for awhile, so I'll always treasure this show. I highly recommend checking out the manga if you enjoyed the anime!",

One day Inari wishes at shrine to become someone else, good-willed Uka wants to help her, so she transforms her. Inari soon regrets this, Uka feels guilty, magic happens and now Inari can transform to anyone she wants. This is main story in nutshell, with cute little romance growing in the background. Not amazing, but still decent.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that ending warries a bit from manga, in a sense that it felt dragged out.\r\nArt\r\nCharacters and vistas pretty average overall, animation maybe little above but still nothing to drool over.Bonus point for nice design though.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nWhile opening and ending songs were nothing special, soundtract itself is nice and pleasant to listen to. Pretty good job.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nAll characters are good. Even when someone is bad for 5 minutes, they apologize and become best friends. Inari is one of those too-good kind of character, Uka just wants to play games with friends, Inari's brother is tsundere.\\n\r\nAnime is pretty short and relationships between characters develop fairly quickly, as Inari makes friends easily. Personally I'd love to see more development between Inari's bro and Uka, but guess I'll have to read manga for that.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nThis may be a little biased. I realy like japanese mythology, therefore I enjoyed watching this a lot. Also Inari's way of dealing with problems kept pleasing my heart. Only things I didn't like were Uka's brother and slightly dragged ending. (which sounds weird considering it was pretty short anime)\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nGreat show if you like japanese mythology and heart-warming and relaxing story.",

It doesn't do any of the stuff you would expect from show with a human getting god like powers and able to change into anyone and i mean even the fun stuff from these types of show's.\r\nI came in expecting the MC to be more goofy and mess around more. But in this she just does nothing of interest with these powers. The characters reactions tend to be lackluster and the story feels very ham-fisted. \r\n~~SPOILERS~~\r\nAny drama that happens feels artificial. Such as both Uka and Inari not wanting to tell each other causethey don't want to worry each other. The entire story could not happen if they didn't act like actual people. Near the end the ruler of the gods ( Or whatever she is meant to be ) Locks Uka in a cave and she ends up almost killing herself cause of that. It just feels very blah to me.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the Uka god slowly dyeing cause she put her powers in Inari. Her reasoning is that she want to be able to see Inari so she is willing to kill her self. Let alone how eh i think it is that a god ( That for all we know is invincible) Can die by such a way. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also Inari who doesn't do anything fun or of interest with her powers. There is a scene where they are both in a log cabin and i was really wanting her to leave at night and turn into a bear or some other weird giant creature. But that doesn't even happen and i can't help but feel ripped off by this.\\n\\n\r\nI could go on the things that bug me but i don't want this to be an entire essay. But there is some stuff i liked such as :\\n\\n\r\nHow the gods are portrayed as powerful but not all eye seeing and knowing everything.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is also very nice along with the music .\\n\\n\r\nI would give this around a 7.6 or 7.7 But i'm gonna just round it to 8.",

            "content": "I was pleasently surprised when I watched this anime, here's why:\r\nStory 9/10\r\nWelcome to the life of Inari, a girl with three friends and who is quite clumsy. She lives nearby a shrine that called the Inari Shrine. When she is in a hurry to go to school, she sees a little fox and helps it out of trouble. Then she may have a wish fullfilled by the diety of the shrine. Her wish: to turn into somebody else. Of course this will bring trouble and all that kind of stuff along. You could say this story isn't original, but I it is, go and watchit, you'll see why.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nThe art was well done, it looked good. It remembered I saw the same kind of art in another anime but I can't remember which one.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nI don't have really anything to say about it. It was good, and the opening was allright.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nNot everybody will agree with me that I give the characters a 9. Here my explanation:\\n\\n\r\nInari is your tipical clumsy girl who is in love with Tanbabashi. When she gets the power to transform she doesn't alway know how to deal with it. She is someone who makes friends pretty easily. She is a pretty optimistic girl who cares about others. And she cries pretty fast. But I liked her.\\n\\n\r\nUkanomitama-no-kami, her name is way to long so let's just call her Uka just like in the anime. She is the diety of the shrine who gives a part of her power away. She is a first-rank diety and doesn't want to get married with some random god. She likes playing games and sometimes goes to Inari's brother, Touka, to play games with.\\n\\n\r\nTanbabashi, now why should I tell anything about him? It's just a short discription: A boy who's never been in love before and plays basketball. He helps people out with stuff.\\n\\n\r\nTouka, Touka is Inari's brother. He gets angry pretty easily. But maybe I just like that kind of character.. For some reason he is able to see Uka. This is something normal people can't. He plays games with Uka. And well, just thinking they get some feelings for each other.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI definitely enjoyed this anime. I liked the story. It's mostly about friendship and romance and has of course the supernatural part. I cried at times, and that's when Inari cried too.\\n\r\nIt's also funny at times and sometimes the story goes deeper. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\r\nWell, I liked the anime, I do recommend it. To be honest, a lot happened in this anime, and it didn't feel rushed. Something I did feel when watching Itazura na Kiss for example. This was an anime with an ending that I liked and also disliked a little. It was what you could expect to happen. Well, never mind, I liked it :)",

A Shrine God evens appoints the lead girl as a demi-God, why? Because she bandages the leg of an injured kitsune.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I guess, by that logic, if you save an animal, a Shinto God may bequeath you with OP abilities, because you\u2019re a special snowflake. The more the series progresses though, the more that it becomes likable. You find out that OP demi-God girl is granted abilities and later realize that she hurts other people with being careless with them.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 There are really good messages about superficiality, bullying, and LGBTQ themes intertwined in this fairly short, ten episode series. Some of the romances escalate too quickly, in my opinion, but the show is extremely short and the producers probably needed to wrap up the story in a conclusive way. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Despite a series that\u2019s designed like a shoujo, there is a lot of cleavage shots of Uta, but Studio TROYCA does seem to like to incorporate fanservice for males and females in all of their shows that I\u2019ve seen\u30fclike Aldnoah.Zero and Re:Creators. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 If I could compare the atmosphere and the humor of this to anything, I would say that it\u2019s very bubbly and feminine, like Kamisama Kiss and Jellyfish Princess. Despite the issues that I mentioned, the series is very enjoyable and pretty to look at. If you have free time, I would suggest watching, since it\u2019s only ten episodes and very cute/feel-goodsy. I give Inari Kon Kon a 5/10.",

Even one more episode could have tied up the ending in what would have been, I believe, a more satisfactory ending. I think this is a great adaptation of the manga. It stayed pretty true to the story, though it was much faster paced. I really love this story for a lot of reasons, but mostly I think it has really positive role models for girls (which can be hard to find). I appreciate the inclusion of the Sumizome/Keiko, even though it didn't really develop at all. One thingI was really impressed with, though, was the background noises, such as the sound of the geta on the tiles. It was a small detail, but it was so well done that it deserved a mention.\\n\\n\r\nIn sum, I don't necessarily think that there is anything about Inari konkon that makes it stand out amongst other shoujou anime, but it is short enough that you won't feel like you wasted your time, and it won't leave you feeling unsatisfied.",

It won my heart by the second episode, with interesting characters and a beautiful plot.\r\n The anime is about a sweet shy girl named Inari who has a hard time conveying her feelings. One day Inari witnesses her crush handing a love letter to a beautiful girl. Depressed Inari runs off to her family shrine and cries out \"I wish I could be her\". A fox deity who lives at the shrine appears and gives Inari a \"divine power\" that allows her to shape shift. The anime mainly focuses on how Inari uses this power.\r\nThis isthe perfect anime for me. I'm a sucker for cute love stories with some supernatural elements. My favorite things about this anime are the character development, setting, and art.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is amazing. I have nothing more to say.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was lovely, suited the anime perfectly. Sweet and nostalgic, gives me this feeling like I'm floating. The OP was cute but not anything memorable.

            "content": "One of the best feel good anime that I have seen in a long time.\r\nThough it has only 10 episodes+1 OVA the characters manage to really capture your heart.\r\nAn extremely sweet and wonderful female lead. Such a refreshing honest story. It has romance but the romance is like the foundation for a story...almost like a back story.\r\nIt starts with her wanting the love of the boy she has had a crush on forever...but it actually is a story of love in a complete view. Love between friends and love for herself as well. (she starts off with low self confidence and with envy for ananother girl)\\n\\n\r\nThe story mixes comedy and perfect moments in such a beautiful way that I honestly cant believe it was just ten episodes...and I regret the fact the series is over. There were moments you sweatdrop and moments you laugh out loud..you will not be able to help your reaction. \\n\\n\r\nAn anime worth watching\\n",

            "content": "Story: 6/10 It's a typical romantic comedy-ish. It seems that it's supposed to focus on romantic plots, but twists and moves on to another theme,friendship. It switches between the two themes frequently, so romance elements tend to lack and almost end up being dropped. That being said however, it's still enjoyable and easy to follow.\r\nArt: 10/10 I adored the artwork. It is very well done. From the shrines to the landscapes of basic surroundings, it was really beautiful. The characters were average and nothing special, kinda basic, but it's not like they're an imitation of other anime characters.\r\nCharacters: 7/10 Although the characters were kinda generic,I still found them enjoyable. I really enjoyed Uka being a main character and all the others added in their own ways.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/overall: 7/10 Overall, it was kinda too short. In 10 episodes they tried to wrap up two themes that probably needed to be elaborated on a bit more. Half way through it felt like the story was still developing and the ending left me unsatisfied. I felt that it was dropped and restricted, but that's a personal opinion on it. I would recommend it, after all it's only 10 episodes.",

            "content": "If I have to pick two adjectives to describe Inari, Konkon, Koi Iroha it would be: heartwarming and underrated. I have to admit I got here cause I googled \"animes to watch when you are depressed\" [to chear you up, not to get even worse], and I feel very lucky that this anime was in that recommendation.\r\nAnd now I can just recommend it too, because its a great show!\r\nInari is a normal girl with dreams and wishes like any ordinary girl, but with an unusual big heart, and she gets to meet Uka-sama, a godness that prefers to be on Earth watching us humans goingthorugh the cycle of life -while she plays otome games- instead of living with the other Gods.\\n\\n\r\nInari Konkon has drama, comedy, action, shintoism, and lots of love and hapiness. I rarely I found myself loving *all* the characters, chearing up all the couples and wishing they would all be happy, cause they are all just so lovely and human-like, they are the back bone of the show. Inari Konkon is about friendship, something that we are loosing more and more everyday, right? \\n\\n\r\nSo my recommendation is, if you feel down [sometimes I even feel down cause I was watching another anime that was too depressing!], if you want to see pure love and friendship, if you want to be part of a beautiful story, you have to watch this show. It's not an average romance anime, the relationships are handled with a lot of maturity, which I apreciate everyday more and more. Finally, if you loved the show I *really* advice to read the manga, it's seriously worth it. [The Inari shrine it's now on my list of places I will visit if get the chance to go to Japan!]",
