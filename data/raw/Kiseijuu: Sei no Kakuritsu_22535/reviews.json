            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\nThe truth is... this show is overrated. Overrated does not mean bad, it simply means overrated. \"Oh you're just not intelligent enough to grasp all the deep concepts hidden within the philosophical plot!\" No. It's just not as deep as you might want to believe it is. The series definitely doesn't stay true to the \"meant-to-be\" dark-premise of the manga, especially towards the end. \r\nThe story starts off with what everyone believed was going to be a philosophical story between the meaning of life and death, and humanity vs reality with the introduction of a species higher up in the food pyramidthan humans, called Parasytes. Sure everyone wants to believe that what they're watching is deep, but truth be told it's really not. The story can't seem to decide what direction they want to go. Parasytes basically infect human beings, usually take over their brains and control them. And as you can guess, Parasytes eat humans making them the one species above human beings in the food chain. Shinichi, the protagonist only gets infected in his right hand, therefore he still has conscious control over his body (except for his right hand obviously). Where does it go from there? A psychological show? An action show? A horror? A romance? All of the above, while almost failing to reach it's potential in every aspect. The plot doesn't go in linear way, it cuts corners and adds in random interferences whilst not being able to intertwine and contain them all. One moment there's a fight then there's awkward school life-romance, then there's running away and talking pretentiously, then there's another fight randomly. A lot of things were taken too slowly, then rushed in the latter creating an unbalanced flow in the plot. It's almost like although the show wanted to be philosophical, it was just about one boy running away from a herd of parasytes trying to kill him for no rational reason other than him being the main character. Furthermore, in order to promote themes, the show portrayed a lot of things incorrectly, especially human beings (The police). Human beings are evil and corrupt. Okay... Now you have to contrast that in order to create a theme or idea, but the show doesn't succeed in showing two sides of a concept, although they try. The writers did everything in their power to somehow elevate Shinichi to a god-level in one moment then degrade him to a useless hippo the next moment in order to fit whatever they were farting out of their butts. The beginning was potential-filled, middle didn't live up to it's expectations although was decent, and the ending just made no sense what-so-ever. If you're going to be philosophical, you need to back it up with your story. Kiseijuu failed to do just that and instead just had a lot of childish bloodshed. Yes, the fighting was childish because honestly, it wasn't justified. Now with all that negative things said, the story really was pretty enjoyable to watch-listen to so don't think that the show sucks. On the positive side of the show, there were moments that though they may be pretentious, some comments reached deep into my heart and my mind. Tamura Reiko's \"For what purpose was I born in this world?\". People think about that all the time. Why are we actually born? Do we have a certain purpose to fulfill that's destined by fate? Then there was the mayor's entire speech on human evolution. I found those to be really intriguing topics to think about and half the fun in watching an anime is for it to make you think and grasp upon a new conception/philosophy. But overall, yeah story was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe character develop was really underwhelming in the show as well. I'll start with popular main characters, Migi and Shinichi. What the story started off doing was uniting two characters into one to intertwine the nature of humanity and other creatures. The show tries to connect the audience to the humanity side and the \"monster\" side and show the differing perspectives. Shinichi seemed to turning more into a monster while Migi was becoming more human. But the starting potential was all there was to that development. There are too many unresolved questions and everything that Migi does for Shinichi is beyond unrealistic. I mean I understand Parasytes existing is unrealistic in itself, but they're supposed to be a opposing metaphor for the concept of humanity, but there are some bullcrap moments that the writers seem to fart out of their butts to save Shinichi. Towards the last two episodes, Shinichi is beyond useless without Migi and he keeps saying more pretentious crap about his emotions, when there's nothing more to say but \"The writers wrote me so that I'm a human being that's marching straight towards the strongest parasyte in the midst of night because I feel like something good will happen\". And... of course something good does happen. Oh man how genius and clever of the writers right?! The other characters had their appearances, then two episodes later their exits. Development of any sort? I don't think so. Shinichi really could have developed more. His losses in life changes him to embrace his half-parasyte side, while his love for human life clings to his humanity. Okay, that's a great base start but where does it all go from there? Shinichi sure had a lot of emotions tied into his characters to the point where it was like, who is this person? Shinichi is this person one moment, then another the next. The only character that developed at all is Tamura Reiko and yes she is like the only character I actually liked. Her development into trying to understand human emotions, laboring her human child, trying to unite both humanity and parasytes together. The writers succeeded in creating her character as a symbol of hope and despair. The hope that humans and other creatures will one day understand each other. The despair that there will be bloodshed and corruption within the social hierarchy of species. Her one quote of \"arigato\" was probably the most powerful one word in the anime that pierced through my heavens. A bright light in in the anime for sure. As for the two girls, Murano and Kana... they happen to be in love with Shinichi but there's abolutely no chemistry between the characters. All Murano does for 90% of the story is \"Are you really Shinichi?\" and Kana just constantly throws herself at Shinichi whilst being aware of the dangers around her just because... the writers made her. I mean even in a fictional story there should be some human-emotion-realism right? Kana could have been a character like Tamura Reiko, a way of hope and despair in connection of the two species, but no. She became a nobody without really ever being a somebody. Also so many small characters that seemingly were going to play a role in the story just had one event then disappeared from the show entirely: Uda, Makiko, and his father? Like,  what even happened to them by the end?\\n\\n\r\nThe very ending of Parasyte makes no sense, there is almost no connection to the rest of the story. It's almost as if the series just cut off everything that the story built up to, to just end the show. Yet because Migi has a pretentious exchange with Shinichi, people who don't even grasp what they're even saying believe it to be a genius ending. All Migi basically says is Shinichi should wake up from his dreams (which is his reality) and forget everything that's happened to him and live a normal human life. Then Shinichi realizes that humanity is corrupt and that in human nature there is natural evil. But despite all the negative sides of human nature, human beings are beautiful creatures and they include the love of Earth into the whole pretentious mix. Migi then just disappears without anything being explained. I mean Migi just randomly leaves within his dreams which then translates to Migi disappearing from the show entirely. What the hell? Did he leave himself to Shinichi (for him to have an arm) and then kill his life-force so that he doesn't actually exist? in the end when Shinichi saves Murano, it's implied that Migi saves her. So, what the hell actually happened to Migi? Makes no sense to me, maybe someone else can make sense of the whole ending for me. This last episode sort of reminded me of Evangelion's ending where it doesn't connect all that well to the rest of the plot and doesn't explain a lot of things while including randomness to sound smart.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art in Parasyte, I'd say it was decent? I mean, the portrayal of the Parasytes was mediocre to me in comparison to the kagune of Ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul. The characters all looked like they had unusually long faces (though I don't bash them for that, just something I noticed). The actions scenes were mediocre as well, as all they portrayed were a bunch of arms moving around at a speed so fast the audience just sees lines dashing across the screen. I suppose the portrayal of weather (such as the snow when Tamura Reiko ...) was beautifully done. the music in Parasyte was good but there wasn't all that much variety in music. It was basically, opening-one other random Ost-Next to you-Ending every episode. \"Next to you\" is a really good piece though, I loved listening to it every time it played. Solid in the music category overall. Okay actually, listening to it's full soundtrack, Parasyte had some really nice music.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end of the show the only thing left is my head is: What was the point of the show? Was it to show that humanity is corrupt and that we're the reason other species can't move forward? That humanity should embrace other species and try harder to understand? Or that reality is a cruel place? What do other people see in this show that makes them think it's so genius? And of course, if you enjoyed the show then I respect that as well because despite my criticism I too enjoyed the show ... to an extent. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Parasyte is a show that's worth watching if you like psychological shows.",

            "content": "I'm the type of anime watcher that likes to wait for the anime to be completed before watching it; so I can either marathon it in one day or finish it in a few days - am I the only one who does this? Parasyte or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was one of those anime I've completed in a day. With the cliffhangers that leave you at the edge of your seat at the end of the episodes, to the humans that can morph into blades and mold their faces/ bodies for creating massacres; it's the perfect formula for binge watching. I would have beendying to wait for each episode each week if I watched this when it aired. \\n\\n\r\nWhen speaking with others online about Parasyte, the most common piece of criticism I hear that strays away those who don't want to watch is that it's \"not my genre,\" it's \"overrated\" or \"it makes my stomach turn while watching some scenes.\" Although I agree with most of these statements, it's because of these points that people should try watching - simply because it's a genre/ story that's not seen often in this generation. \\n\\n\r\nPutting that aside, the anime begins with a mini snake-like organism emerging from it's shell that fails to attempt to target a high schooler by the name of Izumi Shinichi, unable to attack Shinichi's brain to completely take over his body. However the organism develops it's own intellect in Shinichi's right arm and is named Migi (which is Japanese for right). The story is about magnitudes of these snake-like organisms taking over humans in Japan. If the brain has been successfully taken over, a parasyte is then born which then has the ability to morph body parts into blades and lengthen the human anatomy. To survive, these parastyes thrive on devouring the anterior portion of humans, killing with no second judgement. The main character Shinichi learns about this through his counter-part Migi and goes on a mission to kill any parasyte that poses a threat to society. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this and reflecting on it, it's clear that the anime was trying to illustrate the question of: \"can someone who does not display human-like qualities, be humanized?\" The answer to this question is, yes and it's heavily drawn out through the characters. We see that as the story progresses it's clear that parasytes are depicted as blood thirty creatures. However some of the parasytes like Tamiya Ryouko, who seemingly is out to kill, becomes more human as her storyline progresses. We also see this with Migi, Migi starts off as having no empathy for humans, Shinichi included, but gradually gains affection towards them as the episodes unfold. However when looking at Shinichi, the reverse occurs to him as he loses his some emotions and becomes less humanized. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is quite solid, and the sound stands out as one of my favourites. Although this anime is an adaptation from a manga in the 90s, I enjoyed that the art is drawn in a way that's up-to-date with the anime that's out now but yet still has that air from the art during the 90s as well. The animation is fluid but not that fluid in some regards as I hoped. For example, when we see the one-to-one combat between parastyes; the lightning speed combat with using lengthened limbs and blades are not that fluid. The OST is a stand out, one of the better ones out there against the others during the time this aired; which actually made me download the entire album. I presume everyone's favourite is probably \"next to you.\" If you haven't heard it, youtube it, download it, listen, and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was a great anime to watch. If you're looking for something that's out of your comfort zone or just looking for something new to watch, I would recommend this. I promise you that after the first episode, the cliffhangers will reel you in and possibly cause you to watch episode after episode until your done. If you made it this far reading my review.. thanks ! Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any comments about my review or want to discuss anything anime.",

            "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard of them in classic sci-fi stories before; the very idea of alien creatures who can snatch bodies to impersonate a human and walk among our society. Build on the foundation of a science fiction and body horror, Kiseijuu (also known as Parasyte) takes a full swing with its premise. It\u2019s simple actually. We have a case of alien invasion by mysterious beings who can infect us through parasitic means. By inserting themselves into a human\u2019s brain, the parasites can take full control and transform you into a monster. Not only does this kill the victim but now it can even add moreits body count by consuming more humans. Sounds terrifying right? That would have been a fate for a young man named Shinchi until one parasite goofs up and fails his mission. Now they share a single body but with separate personality. Let the adventure begin.\\n\\n\r\nWith such an engaging premise, Kiseijuu really sets the par high not just by its first episodes but also by some other technical aspects from behind the scenes. First we have the powerhouse studio Madhouse who are well renowned for their reputation. Then, there\u2019s the source material. This adaptation is based on the manga that came out over two decades ago but has earned praise. With just the forefront of these elements, the series has high expectations. Thankfully, it lives up to its hype.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t take a break even from the start by showing the grim reality of the show\u2019s horror. If you don\u2019t believe me, then the first few seconds may convince you. Needless to say, a series like this is not easy to the stomach. But given that fact, it makes itself look real by showing us the brutality of the parasites. The first few episodes establishes the fact that most parasites are heartless monsters who care only about themselves and their prey. The parasite that failed to take over Shinichi\u2019s body display similar traits by threatening to kill him and others if their secret is revealed. Migi (the name that Shinichi gives to it) often thinks strategically to survive while discarding all morality. For instance, he tries to kill any witnesses who see the symbiotic relationship between him and Shinchi. Then, there\u2019s the actual combat where Migi fights indiscriminately at times in order to survive. Outside of combat, the show becomes a bit of personal drama. This is because Shinchi has to constantly deal with keeping this secret and not revealing it to others for the fear that they may be killed. It\u2019s more than just responsibility but also creates the sensation of fear. For the both of them, it\u2019s about survival in a world run by atrocity.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this series\u2019 story stand out quite a bit is the ability to convey human nature and focus on more than just outlandish battles for survival. It shows the best and worst of what humans can do while also balancing out how parasites can behave. Sometimes, there\u2019s almost a similarity while others stands in sharp contrast. For Shinchi, he undergoes big changes as the story progresses with certain events that create tragic scars in his life. These changes are reflected both physically and mentally. Even his classmates like Murano notices this and is constantly worrying about his well-being. In the beginning, we can see him as a normal guy who just wants to be normal. Until he accepts the reality later on, Shinchi is just someone who wants friends, get an education, and perhaps even fall in love. The certain events of the parasites changes all of that as he can never go back to his normal life. His relationships with Murano often has shifting drifts because of the dangers he realizes she may be in if she gets too close to him. Then, there\u2019s the relationship between him and his parents. In particular, his mother represents as someone who sets by example of what a good parent should be. And case taken, the series doesn\u2019t neglect to show other relationships even among the parasites. Motherhood plays a role as well as one particular parasite becomes a guardian for her child. And although she shows little feelings towards it, there\u2019s a drastic change to her behavior later on as she begins to develop human traits. On the other hand, we can also see the worst of human nature. For instance, there\u2019s a serial criminal in the series whose behavior isn\u2019t far different from the parasites themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, there\u2019s also Shinchi who develops quite a bit throughout this show. Remember, a big part of this series relies is crafted by the way things change and how they work. Shinchi\u2019s experience of fighting alongside Migi turns him into a warrior beyond someone who just wishes to protect others. This is in particular true because of the tragic events in his life. His change is reflected physically and also at an interpersonal level as Shinchi becomes less and less human himself. From an ordinary kid with a timid personality in the beginning, Shinchi becomes a changed man who is serious, humorless, and pessimistic. It\u2019s also shown in the case where Shinchi begins to develop fighting skills of his own when he can\u2019t always rely on Migi. And furthermore, the show takes advantage of the choices he makes to further develop his character. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see how much the show can focus on its premise and understanding it. The show takes its turns with each episode to present thrillerish scenarios and events that connects with the characters. Its narrative also remains a strong aspect of the show by focusing on Shinchi\u2019s role and what his decisions are no matter how risky they may seem to be. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, be aware that the show has tragedy. More than just death, Shinchi\u2019s losses in life expands beyond just losing important people around him. It shows that he can\u2019t save everyone and when that happens, Shinchi feels regret because of his own lack of confidence. It\u2019s interesting at the same time to see how much Migi changes. From the irrational display of inhumanity he shows in the beginning, we can see some of his softer sides. It seems as the story goes on, there\u2019s attachment he feels about the human race and their behavior. While most of this is obstructed in the beginning, the development of his character reaches a point where Migi behaves like a human. On a lighter side, the show also adds some elements of comedy involving Migi and Shinchi\u2019s relationship. Migi\u2019s particular curiosity leads him to \u201cresearch\u201d on human sexuality which creates hilariously memorable moments. Kana\u2019s repetitive \u201cWhite Knight wet dreams\u201d are also something of a very peculiar comedy that adds more into the show. Similarly, we can also see different sides of other parasites ranging Reiko\u2019s care for her child to the political ways that some parasites tries to initiate into society. By presenting such events, it also shows that not all parasites are simply absent-minded for their lust to consume and kill. We even have a character that Shinchi can relate because of their own personal life circumstances. But for all its worth, the show can become a bit predictable at times. The death flags are inevitable not to mention the spoilerish opening song. While the transition of each episodes remain mainly strong, there are some minor changes between the manga and this adaptation. Furthermore, both the manga and anime has plot holes that are seemingly never answered. None of them really destroys the content of the story but some of it seems a bit odd such as the technology and Shinchi\u2019s original appearance prior to become Mr. Badass.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I have to say that my initial impressions of the artwork wasn\u2019t very great. The artwork has a more generic style rather than the mature atmosphere the manga delivered. After taking more careful glances though, there\u2019s also a feel of attachment anyone can make from the art. Starting with gruesome, the designs of the parasites are both horrific and fascinating. All of them show monstrous traits with their murderous-like intent. The eyes, blades, and disfigured faces are what makes them fearful. Certain parasites also develops more powerful traits that really makes them stand out above others physically by their body structure. In this case, the designs got the job done. Migi in particular has a very fascinating appearance with his unique case of being stuck in Shinchi\u2019s hand. For the human characters though, most of them are categorized by character design to fit with their personalities. From Shinchi\u2019s normal parents to the various delinquents, each of them gives off an impression of humanity. But the most fascinating part about the show is Shinchi\u2019s physical change. His tragic experiences transforms him into a more daring man and this is even reflected by his image. The sharp-edge hair, removal of his glasses, and firm body structure are just a few examples of this. And finally, the show is infamous for its graphic violence. Expect pouring blood, severed limbs, and gore that really entitles this show as horror. The action scenes are also, fast, crisp, and decorated with high production values thanks to Madhouse. Oh and that absence of censorship is a great please to the fans like myself.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music plays a rather interesting role. In particular, the dubstep becomes a controversial addition added to the series. Sometimes, the usage feels right while other times really feel out of place. The first episode wastes no time with the usage of dubstep so viewers will have to get used to it. It took me a couple of episodes to adapt with the OST and in retrospect, it does work out once you feel attached to it. In other respects, the characters\u2019 voices show a good deal of focus especially with Shinichi and his change. This is reflected in his more calm and confident voice later on in the story in contrast to his quiet and timid personality in the beginning. Kana Hanazawa also plays the role of Shinchi\u2019s love interest with a sense of innocence in her voice. But most interestingly, we have the voices of the parasites. All of them has a disturbing and distorted voice compared to their former human hosts when transformed. I give credit for this sci-fi style of portrayal to bring out the realism of their presence. But when in human form, there\u2019s some a lack of empathy in the voice mannerisms of the parasites. Other times, there are parasitic characters who shows more of a human tone such as with Reiko and Uda. Then, there\u2019s also the character Migi. Voice actress Aya Hirano effectively brings this character into life with her voice. Finally, there\u2019s also the OP and ED songs. Unlike most 2 cour series, there are no changes the whole time with the hardcore OP song or the gentler atmosphere of the ED.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of sci-fi horror, then this series should no doubt be something of a must-see. This remarkable work is reflected not just in the story but by the characterization of its cast \u2013 both human and parasitic. The show\u2019s focus on its various themes crafts great amounts of moments that are memorable for its nature. Shinchi\u2019s development over the course of the series along with Migi are like experimental journeys that really makes their point. And with all this going on, we can also see how far the show can make for itself when it can make you feel attached to its premise. There will be some predictable plot elements in regards to the romance sub-plots or tragedy. However, this shouldn\u2019t be a set-back especially when its main story is thought provoking. Hell, even the action scenes tells a story each episode. Kiseijuu is a wonder that is sometimes fun, sometimes horrific, sometimes mysterious but always entertaining.",

            "content": "Based off of the award winning manga series written by Iwaaki Hitoshi, coming from the highly praised Madhouse studio, with all excitement and intense story, Kiseijuu constantly finished this season with its fineness.\r\nThe story set-up in a realistic world where an unknown organism invaded earth and take over human bodies, accidentally one of that organism is trying to enter into someone's body, a body of a sleeping boy named Shinichi Izumi, but the organism can only take over Shinichi hand only. The incident created a bizarre creature that lives eventually in Shinichi's right hand. Meanwhile, other organisms that successfully take over a human / animalbodies is starting to attack the Civilians secretly and eat them. With that fact, Shinichi decided to fight other ruthless parasites with Migi's help.\\n\\n\r\nIn the story section, Kiseijuu have some notable succession. A bizarre yet successful settings brings Kiseijuu a glimpse of uniqueness to its story. The story actually not so complex, the concept is understandable and easy to remember. The individual elements of the story runs pretty well too, it was thrilling, and so exciting. The anime have a fairly balanced pacing while throwing some excitement & surprises at the same time. Kiseijuu added many other genres and mixed up into one big unity. One of them is romance, There is some scenes that included romance Although sometimes the romance felt awkward because the lack of process.\\n\\n\r\nThe other good thing is Kiseijuu successfully illustrated the true nature of a living creature, especially us humans. Kiseijuu left some moral lessons for the audience: \"Life is a valuable thing, we have to respect of human and creature life\"\\n\\n\r\nThe animation actually quite standard, not bad but not the best. The character design is decent, while, in the other hand, I fully appreciate the parasites design, it is well-illustrated & quite memorable, it success in bringing a grim & scary feeling to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound settings, I personally adore the Opening song  \u201cLet Me Hear\u201d sung by Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas, it is really a great upbeat song with a real mixture of Electric & Rock. As for the background music, Kiseijuu did an excellent job in bringing such music, the music fluidly mixed up with the story in a great way, it is really fit & fresh in brain. There is nothing to say for the voice actors, it just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIn the character section, we have our main characters, the duo consist of Izumi Shinichi & the alien that live in his right arm named Migi. The character development centered in Izumi Shinichi, from the start of to the end, Shinichi\u2019s have various changes including his attitude & appearance. Just like other great characters , he developed from zero to hero. From a sniffing & coward boy, he grows into a more mature & reliable man. The development describe very well. While Migi, the parasite that live in Shinichi\u2019s hand have a meaningful role, a sense of friendship is also described between them as the story progress. While various villain with a different motive also did well in their roles.  The other supporting characters do their roles pretty well. It is really good indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it\u2019s just another great series. It is fully recommended if you a fan of the individual elements that included in the story, and if you seek an anime with full of excitement, proper character development, & intense storyline then Parasite is your menu.",

            "content": "If Tokyo Ghoul is fast food then Parasyte is fine dining.\r\nStories that adhere to the \"invasion of humanity\" narrative is nothing groundbreaking by any means. It's been done many times over on the silver screen, from large-scale takeovers like 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers to more up close and personal ones like 2003's Dreamcatcher. The fear of an unknown sentient being that can challenge us intellectually is something that has always piqued the interest of moviegoers for decades. They're stories that could service a multitude of directions, and while not always intentional, they tend to bring up themes centered around the human condition andDarwinism. And for those that tackled these ideas on purpose, it has the benefit of becoming a decent popcorn flick or even better, an engrossing social commentary, depending on the pedigree of writing and how it's presented. Being thought-provoking, while at the same time entertaining for a broader viewing audience is no small feat to pull off. There's a balance that needs to be struck that may require compromise to avoid being too heady, but at the same time, having the know-all to make it intellectually stimulating. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Parasyte does just that. It draws you in with its uncanny imagery and copious amount of violence, all the while adhering to the underpinnings of subtextual content that peels back the layer to reveal something much more meaningful. Of course, like any show that grapples with these ideas, it had its fair share of issues as well, but as a whole, Parasyte was a title that manages to escape with only a few blemishes where others made in a similar fashion couldn't stick the landing. Today, we'll discuss its highlights and missteps, both great and small. \\n\\n\r\nTo avoid regurgitating info you could simply read in the synopsis, we'll dive right into discussing the focal points.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the implications of the story presented are universal, the manner that it chooses to take it on with is more of a personal one. Following the life of our protagonist, Shinichi, we see the conflict unfold through his eyes and the effects it had on his personal life. With this more intimate approach, we get to better understand the individual impact a shift in society's status quo could have on a micro-scale. All of a sudden, something other than humans had authoritarian control over Earth. It's a power struggle that's fully realized when accounting for the fact that not only could these invaders match our intellect but they are also physically stronger as well. Parasyte shows that the only thing separating us from being on the rear end of the hierarchical food chain is simply our ability to think beyond standard means of self-preservation. It's this innate understanding that gives stakes to this conflict, as we see our protagonist and most other people that encounter the invading parasitic entity, fail to properly combat against them on a one-on-one basis. While we do get a macro overview of the effects and how it manages to disrupt society, the story always kept its main focus on Shinichi's dilemma. \\n\\n\r\nThe brisk pacing really helped to sell the situation as well. Key events that would go on to shape our protagonist's ever-morphing psyche was given enough time to sink in but the show never forcefully came to a full stop just to let it be digested, which allowed the gravity of the circumstance to remain poignant while keeping the show in motion. Traumatic events were given their time and so we as an audience were allowed time to invest in the turmoil that came as a direct result. But what ultimately made these traumatic events work is that they occurred during moments where our protagonist wasn't given ample time to process it all. \\n\\n\r\nThis, fellow readers, is how you build proper suspense and anticipation. Something many titles have a hard time getting the formula right for. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, there were some issues, most of which were a result of retrofitting this 80s manga adaptation to fit a contemporary modern-day setting, while not accounting for the overexposure of current technology. The intention the creators had to modernize the material was understandable, however, the foresight to see the downside to doing that was a bit short of the mark. For example, there would be specific incidents that would go on unnoticed to society, despite the chances of them being recorded via cell phone or surveillance camera becoming a high probability, as the events themselves occurred in public settings. This also accounts for just how prolonged the time was that the parasites were able to stay in hiding in a digital age that spreads information like wildfire. The story isn't as plausible as it could have been had they kept it set in the time period it was written for. This isn't to discredit the show, as most viewers wouldn't even be bothered by it, but it's something that needs to be brought to light for those that do key in on the issue. \\n\\n\r\nThe constant comparisons between Tokyo Ghoul and Parayste are one that's warranted since they both made their anime debut around the same time period and approached similar constructed themes and setups. However, unlike Tokyo Ghoul, Parayste actually explores the societal implications of dealing with a foreign body in-depth. The parasites were used as allegorical proxies to many of the show's concepts and not just a reason to have excessive angst and shounen cock fights. Like I pointed out in my opening line, this is what separates the two and makes a clear divide between entertainment with substance and one that barely scraped by thematically. One provided proper social commentary, while the other simply had it as an idea for flavoring.\\n\\n\r\nBy finding a way to obtain equilibrium between thematic relevance and fun theatrics, Parasyte became one of those rare titles that could appeal to the majority, while also appeasing the interest of critics as well. This isn't to say that Parasyte dives as deeply as it could have with the topics it addresses but that it demonstrated foresight for the concepts that would usually manifest by default when dealing with these kinds of premises, to begin with. It's not a \"2deep4u\" title nor is it brain-dead one, it's a thoughtful action/thriller that knows just when to hit the right notes and when to let the content on screen do all the talking in its place. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation weren't anything to jump out of your seat for but there was definitely a sense of quality control there. The character designs were fairly simple and help to give an idea of the character's traits before we even hear them talk. The biggest standout in the show was, of course, the fight scenes and the detailed anthropomorphic body imagery that both served to creep you out and draw on that obtuse fascination we all get for things unfamiliar to us. The color palette was eye-catching enough on a regular basis, occasionally switching to a more acid washed texture or murky-based one for whenever it tried to heighten the mood of key events (school hallway scene anyone?). While nothing that'll win any awards anytime soon, the art and animation did enough to stand on its own and that's all most viewers are concerned with anyways.\\n\\n\r\nNow where there will be a divide in viewers would be the music section.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte's music selection is a hit or miss depending on your personal preference. It's like if one of the producers snuck into their teenage kid's room and emulated the songs straight off of their playlist. \"This is what the kids are listening to these days\" seem to be the thought process they went with. If anything, it really helped to distinguish Parasyte from the rest of the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very topical, largely composed of EDM (electronic dance music) tracks. The EDM tracks come in a few selection of different sub-genres that can range from techno, dubstep, drum 'n' bass, hardstyle, house, trap, downtempo, trance and every variant in between. Of course, that's not all it has, as there are a few new-school orchestric tracks and soft electronic piano ballads that are thrown in for good measure. But EDM is the dominating song choice, most noticeably dubstep for those unfamiliar with the sub-genres. Needless to say, if EDM is your cup of tea then you'll be in for a treat, but music is subjective and enjoyment will vary for each individual.\\n\r\nThe opening is a heavy hitting post-hardcore synth track reminiscent of bands like Pierce The Veil, The Fall of Troy and Sleeping with Sirens, if those bands were to ever go \"T-Pain\" on us, that is. It's a \"teen angst x 100\" kind of song that won't register with everyone, and like the EDM OST, it's a preferential thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects also deserve special mention, more specifically when parasites morph or move around. It adds to the overall creep factor the show is going for, sounding almost like a pliable substance; like playing with silly potty or deflating a balloon. It's hard to pinpoint the exact sound but it was certainly unique. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show was unapologetic about its sound selection and made a bold move in an industry where j-pop and j-rock are enough to get you by. It may not be up to snuff with people that don't care for the genre but it shouldn't be discredited because of that. It added variety to the monotonous sound expected from OSTs in the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters was a mixed bag. On one hand, a few characters were wonderfully handled, showing layered characterization to their personality with flaws that made them relatable and easy to sympathize with, but on the other, we had characters that teeter on the border of 2-dimensional to becoming caricatures. You know it's bad when Migi, an apathetic parasitic hand, showed better characterization than that of some of the side characters. But that isn't to say it bombed in this department, as the few focused characters help to carry the show. Watching Shinichi slow metamorphosis and development as a person was well-handled from beginning to end. When a traumatizing event occurred, they aren't simply used for quick blips of shock factor but go on to further influence and add dimension to his personality. May that be a loss that triggers a lack of empathy or one that helps him rekindle it. Where some of the characters lapsed in proper portrayal, they more than made up with their interactions with each other, most notably, that of Shinichi and Migi, as well as the relationship he had with the show's main love interest, Satomi Murano.\\n\\n\r\nShinichi and Migi's relationship can be seen as the bridge between both species. They stand in the crossfire and both adapt and grow accustomed to each other, and because they were the focal point of the story, seeing their interaction and partnership flourish was a nice treat. But perhaps more surprising than that was just how well Shinichi and Satomi were handled together. The relationship between them was very organic, none of this \"omg a boob touched my shoulder, time to blush\" bullshit, but teenagers acting in mannerisms that anyone growing up can relate to. The back and forth spats between them can become tedious at times but to be fair, given the circumstances they're involved in, it was always understandable. The show's primary focus was never a romance but when it addressed it, it ended up outclassing some romance titles that only get to 1st base by its finale, which is something worth applauding the show for.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noteworthy character was Ryouko Tamiya but I'll keep details about her involvement to a minimum. She was a parasite that helped to further explore some of the show's themes and provided better insight into the turmoil at hand. Her involvement brought up very interesting questions and plays a huge role in providing another perspective to the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters fell short and others could have been cut out entirely, the cast as a whole was fine and served their purpose.\\n\\n\r\nWe can sit here crediting the thoughtful decisions the show made or criticizing the misguided ones all day but when it call boils down to the essentials, as a piece of entertainment, Parasyte was a show that constantly delivered. And after all, isn't that what we all came for? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nParasyte was one of those titles that kept me hooked from beginning to end. It was action packed, had nice tension, great character dynamics and always left me wanting more. It made for great binge-watching material and certainly delivered in the entertainment department. While I didn't care much for the soundtrack and could do without the inclusion of certain plot details and characters, when it was all said and done, I enjoyed the 24-episode journey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile many titles have tried this type of setup before, Parasyte stepped in to help set the benchmark for how to do it right. It balanced its themes well while still being entertaining, showing that it's possible to do both. It's a show that had a few missteps but never to the point of failure. It may not be for everyone but those generally fascinated with these kinds of \"man vs nature\" parables would probably enjoy what the show has to offer.",

            "content": "I remember hearing a lot of hype for Parasyte when it was first announced for an anime adaptation. Apparently, it was a really popular manga in the 90s about some kid who got his hand infected by an alien parasite \u2013 hence the name I suppose, although I\u2019m not sure why the \u201ci\u201d was changed into a \u201cy\u201d \u2013 and must now learn to live with it whilst warding off other similar infected people who had the misfortune of being killed by these beings before having their entire existence taken over. Seemed like good body horror stuff as is, but then came the influx ofpeople I knew who read the manga that declared it to be the second coming of Christ and my hype for it was decent whilst not being astounding because it was being done by a Madhouse team whose only credits were to their Marvel stuff and isn\u2019t that just another clue that they\u2019re not the powerhouse they used to be? Well it turns out that I was right to be cautious, because not only does Parasyte not live up to the hype, but it\u2019s knee-deep in pretty much everything I despise about Marvel stuff to boot.\\n\\n\r\nYou know your show with dick hands and uncensored decapitations has problems when I can think of five shows from Fall 2014 I\u2019d rather watch over it and one of them is from KyoAni. But before I get into thrashing this show, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m glad Parasyte was made, if only because its popularity will hopefully lead to more classic manga getting adapted, thus lessening the huge surplus of LN adaptations we\u2019ve been getting as of late. In an age where self-awareness is replacing actual humor, we really do need more manga adaptations that take themselves seriously, and this along with Attack on Titan are prime candidates for ushering in that age. So thank you Parasyte for representing a spark the animation industry desperately needs now that Kickstarter has shat the bed, but that\u2019s not going to stop me from beating you to death with a croquet bat that has spikes nailed into it.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte, or Parasyte-the maxim if you want to be an asshole about it, is an adaptation of a 90s manga about a kid named Shinichi whose normal life is shattered when aliens land on his world and one of them infects his right hand in the process of trying to kill him, causing him to have a \u201cmature relationship\u201d with it, if you get what I mean. The story basically follows him and his desire to live a normal life whilst dealing with the changes going on in his life caused by his new situation like dating girls, helping his family, and fighting off others like him who had the misfortune of getting killed and controlled by their own infected diseases. I might as well be calling him Asian Peter due to how much he resembles Peter Parker from Spiderman in terms of situation and personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, many things about Parasyte are pretty much copied wholesale from Spiderman, like the alien infections, uninteresting supervillains, incompetent police force, large sections of the plot, and even the fact that the symbiotes\u2026er, I mean parasytes are weak to fire. The only thing it didn\u2019t rip off was everything that made Spiderman fun like the web swinging. How cool would it have been for Asian Peter to use his right hand to swing across buildings whilst wise-cracking like a\u2026um, actually if it means less snarky remarks, I think I\u2019ll accept that sacrifice whilst still snarling at the twenty other things you could have included. Because as emo as Peter got at times, at least he traded in the angst for some f*cking awesome dance moves.\\n\\n\r\nAsian Peter on the other hand can\u2019t even do awesome fight moves. For something that\u2019s supposed to be one of the major draws of the show, why does every single fight scene look like it was choreographed by Yuen-Woo Ping on the set of Cradle 2 the Grave? Whenever an action scene occurred, it would always consist of boring blade spam or five minutes of Asian Peter conversing with his hand followed by five seconds of actual action at best and two seconds of embarrassment that would make Kill la Kill laugh out loud at worst, which isn\u2019t exciting in the least. It also doesn\u2019t help that the music in this show is so f*cking mismatched to what\u2019s going on that the supposed horror vibe this show coasts on is about as existent as an American-made Silent Hill game with a heavy metal soundtrack. For all that work put into having the violence uncensored and having good animation, you sure didn\u2019t do a good job of putting some actual flair on-screen, did you Marvel director? Although considering your credits and the state of the action we get in those films, it\u2019s kind of apropos.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest flaw that Parasyte - along with said Marvel films \u2013 has is that it doesn\u2019t seem to have a story at all, always heading in one direction before bailing halfway through to focus on another in a round robin that would make Spiderman 3 confused. We start off with Asian Peter basically imitating what makes Spiderman great by getting going through puberty whilst dealing with the consequences of his new-found powers, so I figured that Parasyte was going to be a coming-of-age story. But after he gets turned into a superhuman, that story is put to the side to have him turn into a monster and deal with a love triangle between Asian Mary Jane and Asian Gwen Stacy that ends with the latter\u2019s tragic death to showcase his change. So Parasyte is a story about how having powers turns you into a jerk that will hurt your loved ones?\\n\\n\r\nNope. After said tragedy, Asian Peter suddenly stops acting like a monster and instead angsts about how he can\u2019t protect anyone whilst other humans start getting involved, culminating in a sort-of-sympathetic character getting killed off in order to teach us about discrimination and how there are good people amongst the parasites just as there are bad people amongst the humans and thus they\u2019re no different from each other when you get down to it. So your story is about how overcoming discrimination is hard, especially when you factor in the different natures of humans and non-humans, but it\u2019s not impossible? Wrong! The real story is that \u201chumanity is a flawed species who will always fight for themselves at the end of the day\u201d. And even that\u2019s mishandled badly, as leaving aside that they showcase this fact by having a bunch of stupid soldiers shoot up a building, culminating in Asian Peter killing off a super-strong experimental parasyte that\u2019s basically the love child of Doc Ock and Venom in order to prevent more deaths, it tries to compromise by delivering the same environmental stuff that made Princess Mononoke so good. Y\u2019know, how humans and animals are just fighting for themselves and the only reason they protect the environment at the end of the day is because they\u2019ll die if they don\u2019t?\\n\\n\r\nBut it completely falls flat because it can\u2019t seem to make up its mind regarding whether parasytes should be compared more to humans or lions, and it fails at providing a strong case for either side. The show makes a big point about how parasytes were sent to Earth in order to cleanse humanity for its crimes, so if they are comparable to humans, it\u2019d be one of those PETA nuts channeling Jeffrey Dahmer. And if they\u2019re supposed to be compared to lions, that fails too because last I checked, lions can\u2019t blend in with humans much less eat at Burger King without having eyes and shotguns pointed in its direction. Not to mention, if lions really are living amongst us, killing people in secret like the parasytes have done, I say we make those motherf*ckers extinct.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte\u2019s core message regarding humanity and its relationship with the world is a good idea on paper, but the way it comments on it really leaves a lot to be desired. If the show had focused on centering Asian Peter and his right hand as an ironic victim akin to the protagonist in District 9 or as the failed mediator between two species akin to Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot, this might have worked. But instead, it meanders with repetitive philosophy that anyone out of middle school would know, can\u2019t make up its mind regarding whether Asian Peter is growing and how he\u2019s growing, indulges in really shitty shonen action cliches, and it doesn\u2019t help that the ending doesn\u2019t make any goddamn sense. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people talk up how perfect it is, but all it did was have Asian Symbiote-less Carnage kidnapping Asian Mary Jane in order to confirm what we already knew, which is about as mundane an ending as you can possibly get in a philosophical narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAm I being too hard on an anime whose source material dates back to before the environmental trend was really a thing? Maybe, but that didn\u2019t stop the original Persona game from getting thrashed when it got re-released, so why shouldn\u2019t I criticize Parasyte for basically arriving way too late to have any impact on me? Plus, if it was really as good as people said, time would be kinder to it than this. But that\u2019s irrelevant, because I\u2019m judging the anime on its own. And on its own, Parasyte is just not a good show. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say it\u2019s a bad one, but I can\u2019t really say I\u2019ll be watching it again anytime soon.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhat's the first image that comes to mind when you hear the word \"animal?\" Is it a lion roaming the plains of Africa? Perhaps it's a shark swimming menacingly throughout the deep, dark ocean? Or maybe it's even a cardinal resting on a tree branch, contrasting starkly with a snow-laden field? Whatever the answer may be, something people often forget is that they, too, are an animal. And not just in the definition of the word; our actions can sometimes be rather animalistic in nature. Which leads to an even better question: are we really so different fromthe species around us? This is the philosophical inquiry Parasyte -- The Maxim brings forth. But sadly, it falters quite tremendously.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nParasyte (what it will be called from here on out) focuses on Shinichi Izumi, a normal high-school boy. One day, a parasite of unknown origin enters his body, creating quite the unorthodox, symbiotic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with what Parasyte does right, the first third or so of the anime focuses on Shinichi and him getting accustomed with Migi -- the name of the parasite that now hosts his right hand -- and building the world's components. This includes a multitude of things: introducing important cast members (for future events and developments), demonstrating Shinichi's mentality (his complete refusal of the parasites), and showcasing the aliens' habits (how they eat, blend in with the environment, etc.). There's nothing really wrong with this section of the show; it sets itself up nicely for tackling whatever events it will inevitably generate. And it all culminates in Shinichi's near death at the hands of his \"parent.\"\\n\\n\r\nBut that is where it begins to crumble.\\n\\n\r\nLike Shinichi's mommy, the show dies, with its figurative head being separated from the rest of its body. It's at this point that the anime begins to become this weird amalgamation of plot contrivances, aggressive violence, and weak writing that prevent the show from keeping everything connected. Beginning at the top of the list, many of the happenings within the anime are quite nonsensical and are borderline unfair within such a \"realistic\" world. Some easy examples include: Yuuko's awkward encounter with the student parasite, Reiko allowing the private investigator to walk away, how Gotou was created, allowing Uragami the known serial killer be without handcuffs, watching Goutou literally leaving after his first showing of power, Shinichi miraculously being fast enough to get even remotely close enough to stab Gotou, Migi breaking the genetic barrier, and the Darwinian evolution of the parasites over the course of a year. There are many \"convenient\" situations that hold no justification for what ultimately occurs, deterring from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nSay someone were to ignore a good chunk of these; that's a plausibility, and may even be warranted for the show to get to the \"meat\" of what it is attempting to convey. However, moving down the list, the show continues to trip up. Blood and gore is a staple of this show, without a doubt. People are regularly cut up, severed, or otherwise stabbed, with no part of the body being left unscathed. But while the first third used such atrocities as more of a plot point -- such as with \"A\" or with Shinichi's \"heart attack\" -- the rest of the show tends to use them more for entertainment as opposed to using them for a singular purpose. The fights become more grotesque and involved the further along the series progresses, wanting to impress the audience rather than having them be the least bit meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the actual writing within the anime gravitates towards vagueness. Once again, barring any mention of the quite egregious and amazingly annoying \"Are you really Shinichi?\" spouted by Murano (even right up until the very end), the show tries extremely hard to be intelligent. It throws around many ideas about life and the way people live it, but never truly expounds upon them. Such topics include: over-population, the application of altruism, and the necessity for various species to coexist. Very biological, and quite the interesting themes at play. Yet Parasyte never delves into any of them seriously. There might be a smart-sounding lecture or a few sentences of insight here and there, but it refuses to take what it says beyond a precursory glance. That is, it constantly flits back and forth between each of the subjects it raises in an attempt to be more resounding. Instead, the whole package comes off as too ostentatious.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Parasyte tends to stick to its aforementioned, \"realistic\" roots. The show mostly contains houses, cities, and forests for the backdrops, relying more on keeping things simple as opposed to making them snazzy. They serve their purpose of providing the characters with a setting to play in but are largely unimpressive to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, likewise, maintain the already-established sense of realism that permeates the show. Shinichi undergoes a nice range of appearances and outfits and Reiko treads the fine line between human and parasite perfectly. The rest of the parasites, be it Goutou or some random, expendable character, are also given a good amount of detail while in their \"monster\" forms, giving them a good sense of not only looking alien, but feeling alien, too. And in Goutou's case, very intimidating.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation for the show is usually above average in whatever it sets out to do. Some examples include detailed facial expressions or Migi's \"normal\" actions. And from parasite fights to Shinichi running and jumping in a literal, inhuman way, the anime consistently demonstrates its capability to keep up movement at all times.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are really only four characters of importance to focus on: Murano, Migi, Reiko, and Shinichi.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with possibly one of the worst characters to have graced this medium, is Murano. As the love interest and purportedly the person who understands Shinichi the most, she somehow cannot. While watching the show, her grating behavior around him became increasingly agitating, to the point that the show seemed to pretty much ignore her in order to prevent her from negatively impacting it further. But when she did manage to sneak back in, she received one of two treatments: the exact same confusion or some of the most inane interactions. Sometimes, it even combined both tactics to form a behemoth of stupidity. The park scene first comes to mind, where she stumbles oddly into the scenario without contributing anything (not before being visited by the naked ghost of Kana); she discusses Shinichi's involvement with the police chief in this weirdly passionate plea; the sex scene she has with Shinichi holds no value since her relationship with him has been grossly neglected; and her final speech about how \"human\" some people can be is merely a vain attempt to make her seem thematically relevant. The level of attention she receives and her overall involvement is too much to be tossed aside. She is a laughably terrible character, with her inclusion in the anime being nothing more than a detriment.\\n\\n\r\nAnything's better than Murano within Parasyte. So what better than to jump to an intellectual, rational, and foreign life form? Migi is Shinichi's literal right-hand man...or at least, right-hand friend. While he is viewed mostly as Shinichi's guardian angel (having descended \"from the heavens\"), he serves a greater role within the anime. And that is both contrasting and synchronizing with his host in a fluctuating manner. In the beginning, Shinichi's stance on Migi's kind causes Migi to appear cold where he is being logical. Halfway through, he starts to become more \"friendly\" due to their similar structure. And by the end, he sits somewhere in between, wanting both to better himself and give his best buddy the kind of life -- the human life -- that he deserves. Migi doesn't particularly grow as a character, despite his ever changing forms, until the near-conclusion; in which another plot contrivance gives him the potential for it. As such, while he acts as Shinichi's barometer, he fails to do anything more than hold his best friend's hand from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the hero, Shinichi shows the first signs of life among the cast. It's almost impossible to describe him, because he sees such large swings in his personality and demeanor throughout the entire anime. He begins quite timid and fearful of the monsters that now surround him, wanting nothing more than to eradicate their evil existence. But upon gaining a mixed mindset, he becomes almost indifferent, remaining unnervingly calm during nearly every situation he tackles. This cannot be overstated enough: he makes a complete about-face from his previous, impulsive-based self. And this side of him is no better either, for where he alienated the parasites before, he now begins alienating the humans he's always defended. Thus, the remainder of his character's focus is in striking a balance, in finding that sweet spot between humans and parasites. For the most part, he does reach it; through Reiko's compassion, Goutou's anger, and Migi's understanding -- each of whom are purposefully the most important of the invaders -- Shinichi learns to accept those around him, from the smallest ant to the largest elephant, while simultaneously knowing that humans are not the most infallible creatures on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nThe most intriguing character from Parasyte, and coincidentally the strongest, is Reiko. She's the most interesting not so much by how she is able to survive so naturally within the world of the humans, but why she is able to do so. And that's because, despite her instinctual habits, she tries to comprehend the world around her. She takes the time to investigate DNA transfer, social cues, and relevant information. She isn't afraid to be a mother in every sense of the word. And most of all, she respects both sides of the ecosystem, placing neither the humans nor the parasites above one another, seeing the value in a purely platonic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings about what the characters were attempting to portray. Despite how poor many of them are, they are connected by a \"string of fate:\" the different \"aspects\" to being human. Murano is afraid of the unknown; Migi is merely tolerant of those around him; Shinichi is trying to cope with his place on Earth; and Reiko loves life for what it is. And this can be applied to many of the other characters still -- Goutou demonstrates anger, Uragami symbolizes depravity, etc. -- to give the nicely executed message: humanity isn't just some simple creature. We're a complex system of feelings, emotions, and ideas that is almost impossible to capture in a solitary way. We do mess up but we also perform feats of extraordinary proportion. And while we may be intricate, funny, weird, amazing, or downright deplorable at times, there is no mistaking that humans, people, are an ever-growing, never-boring species of unbelievable value.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's not only wicked, but fun to listen to. It's a catchy piece, with the auto-tuned singer working well with the tapping drags, throat singing, and rocking guitar. The track is metal, mixed with \"higher\" singing at times, but ends as hardcore as it can get. It captures the feeling of the show nicely, and is a good song overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhether the ED is better than its OP counterpart is a tough call. It contrasts with the opening as heavily as it can, especially when listened to one after the other. The slow singing and beautiful piano work in harmony, calming the senses and bringing about a good sense of hope. By the halfway point, the background chorus joins in and the piece heads towards the end with rather catchy lyrics. It concludes on a happy-yet-sad note, the same kind of feeling one has after listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a mixed bag of good and experimental tracks. It can fit the mood when utilizing the somewhat singsong, ambient instruments, but can be wholly distracting when some out-of-place dubstep kicks in. The tracks are more suited to being listened to solely within the anime and not outside of it, unlike the OP and ED that surrounds it.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice-acting sees above-average work for most of the cast. Special shout-outs to Nobunaga Shimizaki as Shinichi with his various range of emotions and Aya Mirano as the voice of Migi, alongside Rinka as the beat-boxing sound effects for him, with their combined efforts providing a unique set sounds that only an alien could make.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this one, I never really liked any of the fighting or the drama that was taking place. It could be cool at times, but it was never much of a contest -- for either the humans or parasites -- unless Shinichi was involved in the ordeal. And my emotions never left anywhere past leveled: I wasn't laughing, distressed, or moved by anything that this show was serving.\\n\\n\r\nI would have enjoyed it more had it not devolved into mindless violence and instead stuck with what the first third or so built so nicely. The only section of the show I particularly found more \"enthralling\" was Kana's arc, if only because it was rather hysterical in the absurdity and silliness of it all. Otherwise, I wasn't looking forward to what the anime had to offer on a weekly basis and was along just to see how it'd all turn out.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, Parasyte -- The Maxim ends in a rather unfortunate way. With a strong start but a lackluster majority, the nice music tracks are not enough to save the weak narrative and hodgepodge cast. And while the anime implores us to have a loving relationship with the world around us, the same can't be said for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, good first third, but the rest is mired in contrivances, coarse violence, and unfocused themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, okay art style, good character designs, above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Murano is awful, Migi is okay, Shinichi and Reiko are good, with everyone connected by humanity\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above-average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, okay fight scenes here and there, not very emotional, sometimes silly\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "As someone who is very intrigued by human-monster stories, parasyte caught my attention immediately as soon as I heard of its existence. With the 1989 manga being a highly praised classic, it\u2019s no wonder the community was excited to see how this adaptation will unfold. Landing in the hands of the illustrious studio madhouse and receiving two cours worth of content, parasyte looked in very good hands. There is no other studio that can capture a gritty sensation full of tension as well as madhouse as they have proved they can create works of that calibre with Monster and Kaiji being the two best examples.And for the most part it certainly delivered on the promised hype. Instead of opting to focus on one or two specific elements parasyte wanted to be a jack of all trades with high stakes action, intellectually stimulating themes, a dash of psychological elements and even some romance. Its balance between so many tones provided the show with something for everyone to enjoy and is one of the core reasons why it exploded with popularity when it aired back in 2014. Though it is without a doubt unquestionable that the anime did have some very obvious defects along the way that detracted from it reaching greater heights despite doing a moderately good job juggling so many balls. \\n\\n\r\nThe first ball is the action and I would say is the dominant one. Before it\u2019s a romance, or a psychological show, parasyte is a high-intensity action thriller. Most of its plot is driven primarily through its action sequences. The action scenes on their own are breathtaking. Throughout its entire run parasyte\u2019s animation was fairly consistent and that kept the action from falling into mediocrity in the latter half, something that happens to a lot of shows in their 2nd half. Along with the animation, parasyte was heightened by its thrilling EDM OST. It\u2019s quite rare to see an anime in this era with an OST of this nature, and I am not personally a fan of the music but parasyte nailed its use completely. Before action sequences were about to begin, the show opted to use more mysterious and slower paced soundtracks to build up the tension and heighten the level of danger. Once the action scenes themselves initiated, the soundtrack switched to a more fast-paced beat to capture the feeling of intensity that comes with parasyte\u2019s action. Packaged in a great exterior by the animation and OST, the action scenes were further enhanced by the high stakes that came with them. There was no room for error, no room for breathing. With every mistake Shinichi made, he got punished for it, and even making one mistake in a deadlock battle with his enemies could have been the end for him. With every grating strike; the stakes only increased, and this is what ultimately makes parasyte\u2019s action scenes great to sit through. When shit hit the fan; the adrenaline and tension were unreal.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ball is the character relationships. This wasn\u2019t handled rather too well, with the cast being hit or miss as a whole. What was the highlight of this section is the dynamic relationship between Shinichi and Migi. Having completely different morals and ways of living that were consistently clashing is what made them such a joy to watch. Their character interactions were meaningful to the story, engaging and throughout the show they both grew as characters by understanding each other\u2019s viewpoints. Furthermore, as individual characters their character progression was interesting, instead of progressing in a cookie-cutter manner, Shinichi and Migi slowly started to develop traits that were present in the opposites personality, with Shinichi becoming more like a parasite and Migi showing more human traits as the story moved along. Migi\u2019s growth came as a result of furthering his understanding of human society and the social norms that comes with them. Shinichi\u2019s case is unfortunately not as natural but nevertheless it was still engaging to watch his character progression as the plot unfolded. Both of the Main characters beliefs were challenged as the series progresses, but their ideals are never truly changed. This action plays positively into parasyte\u2019s hands as it highlights one of the shows biggest messages; to never try and understand the mindset of a different species from your own, as it\u2019s impossible to judge them using your own species standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe third ball is the romantic relationship between the two female leads. This is by far the weakest section of the show. Kanna and Murano were both very weak as characters and i would go as far as to call them useless. Their contribution to the story can be summed up in two lines. \u201cARE YOU REALLY SHINICHI-KUN?\u201d and, \u201cSHINICHI YOU ARE THE ONE\u201d. Yes. That\u2019s it. Murano is a classic anime plot device that only exists to forcefully let the audience know that Shinichi is not the person he once was like a propaganda tower preaching some third-rate ideology. Additionally, she was always a damsel in distress. She found herself on more occasions that one in sticky situations so Shinichi can have a girl to save. Other than that, she was only there to comfort Shinichi. Realistically speaking their romantic relationship makes sense as they knew each other for a long time, but the role that Murano plays in the story is stupid and trite. On the other hand, Kanna was completely retarded. Having being introduced quite early on in the story Kanna fell in love with Shinichi only a few episodes after they met and it was for the most stupid reason you could imagine; because she could sense his presence using some stupid unexplained sensing technique where she can feel a parasyte\u2019s aura if one was nearby. First of all, why does that sensing technique exist? Second of all, why was she attracted to him for such a petty reason? And last but not least, which human being is stupid enough to risk their life to meet someone even after being warned? Serving zero purpose to the overall plot and proving to be more retarded than a 5-year old, Kanna only existed in the show to once again ham-fist us the point that Shinichi is not the same he once was. \\n\\n\r\nThe fourth and final ball parasyte tried to juggle was tackling a wide range of themes including identity, ecology, human nature and more all mixed into its story and characters. I will refrain from talking about its themes too much as it will get into spoiler territory, but the hot topic that was present from the very start and is the essence of parasyte is a study of ecology. Primarily about how different species interact with one another, both physically and mentally. Throughout its entire run, parasyte raises questions about whether different species should attempt to understand each other, the purpose of a species existence, the fundamental reasons on why a species behaves the way in which they do. Parasyte is filled with interesting ideas and concepts not present in many anime from this decade. Some of the themes explored are disconnected from each other, but that doesn\u2019t stop parasyte from being an intellectually energizing work that will certainly leave an impression. \\n\r\nThe character who drove the ecological developments of the show forward was Tamura Reiko. Her role in the story proved to be one of the most important as she was the main focal point for Parasyte\u2019s themes. Her character progression was joyful to watch as she questioned the reason for her species existence as well as trying to empathize with human behaviour, particularly the significance of the maternal bond in later episodes. Identity was also explored through Tamura\u2019s significance to the story. But not an identity crisis in the same sense as Shinichi, but rather the identity of an entire species as she searched for a reason that validated her breed's existence.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable character is the main antagonist of the show; Goto. While not as interesting as Tamura Reiko Goto still has a role to play, and that is being a representation of the untainted beauty of nature. He in himself is an illustration of a wild animal simply on the hunt and following his instincts. Not influenced by outside sources or societal constructs. In a way, Goto is also an answer to one of Parasyte\u2019s biggest questions; what are the parasites? Goto shows that no matter how strong a creature may appear on the exterior, internally they are just another life-form frightened by the mere fact of losing their life. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime preferred to only touch upon these themes rather than viewing them as a whole under the magnifying glass and can at times be a little forced due to the over dramatic nature of its cast, but what was impressive is that parasyte wasn\u2019t sugar-coating its ideas or being idealistic in its thematic approach. It presented its themes through an unbiased lens, showing the darker sides to humanity when it could have easily played them out to be the heroes, and giving the audience an understanding of the parasite\u2019s actions while it could have easily played them out to be the villains. It\u2019s an accurate representation of the law of nature and the ecosystem that governs all the species that live on planet Earth, all while mixing in fast-paced action sequences. It is plagued by obvious drawbacks but it achieves a good balance between popcorn entertainment and insightful commentary on the nature of humanity and ecology as a whole. It could have very easily crumbled under the pressure of mixing so many elements at once or being too overly-ambitious in its thematic approach and as a result coming off as convoluted or over-bloated with unnecessary dialogue. But the show kept its composure and is all around a nice piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the technical side of things goes, Parasyte was solid for the most part.The show could have benefitted from a grittier art style to match the sense of unease that the show was going for, but nonetheless the artwork and art style were nothing to write home about but worked well enough for its contemporary setting with both the character designs and backgrounds satisfactory. The animation during the action sequences was also quite fluid with only a few noticeable derps. However the show is bogged down visually with some immersion-breaking CGI on background characters multiple times. \\n\r\nThere are also a few problems present in the plot that do make it a little difficult to take Parasyte a little seriously. Most of these problems do arise because the director is tasked with trying to adapt material that is set in a different time period. Keep in mind that this manga began serialization in 1989. As a result of the director\u2019s poor translation of the material into a modern setting, the writing did come off as stupid at some points in the show. Another setback were some contrivances in the final two episodes which influenced the outcomes of the Shinichi vs Goto fight and the ending of the series which made it feel rather cheesy, a bit of a blunder for a show that was asking its audience to take the ride seriously.\\n\\n\r\nBut ultimately those drawbacks didn\u2019t matter too much to what the show conveyed and achieved. Whether you are a diehard anime fan, a casual, a pleb, a critic, an elitist, a cat or a dog. It\u2019s an anime i encourage everyone to try as it\u2019s one of the only recent anime that is capable of providing something for everyone to enjoy. Romance, action, commentary, social criticisms and a grim reminder of what it feels like to not be on top of the food chain. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "With a show like this, it's easy to see how much time and care has gone into making it succeed. Kiseijuu has so many genres and elements to it, however rather than it becoming a huge mess, it executes every single one perfectly. \r\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu is about Parasytes that have invaded earth, whose main priority is to take over human bodies and use them as hosts, controlling their body and minds. Parasytes are fierce creatures who kill and feed on humans. The MC is a teenage boy name Shinichi whom one night is invading by a parasyte, but this attack somewhat fails asthe parasyte named Migi, takes over his right hand rather than his consciousness. Thus allowing Shinichi to keep his humanity. They must work together to protect Shinichi's loved ones, and ultimately survive themselves against other parasytes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation factor of Kiseijuu was done well throughout the 24 episodes. It did however vary between scenes, which by no means is due to lazy animators or time related issues, but rather is done to enhance the mood. For example, battle scenes as apposed to ordinary scenes simply had differences between them. Backgrounds and scenery had quite an amount of detail, and character designs hit the mark throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are extremely well developed. \\n\r\nThe companionship shown between Shinichi and Migi is fascinating in a way. They are both dependent on each other to survive. In the beginning it shows how they simply want to be free of each other, but their bond is so natural that it is difficult to pinpoint when the label of an annoyance is replaced by friendship. The background and emotional attachment each character has was done exceptionally well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Kiseijuu is quite possibly one of my favorites. There is a lot of diversity in this department, ranging everywhere from dub-step to instrumental. The OP and ED's suited the show perfectly. I usually have a habit of skipping the Openings with 99% of shows that i watch, however every episode i found myself pleasantly enjoying it. I couldn't find anything in this department of the show to fault. I was surprised with how honest the voice acting was. Not only the main characters, but the supporting were so convincing. It truly seems as though the creators designed the characters to suit the voice actors, not vise versa.\\n\\n\r\nPrior to starting Kiseijuu, I had a preconceived idea of what it would entitle. A somewhat childish concept became a true work of art. It has been a pleasure finishing this anime for the past 24 weeks. It has the ability to appeal to such a wide audience. Whatever genre you prefer, i would advice you give this show a try as it has all the elements of a masterpiece.",

            "content": "What makes a human? What makes a monster? Each of us have a bit of both in us, and it's up to you which one you want to be.\r\nParasyte The Maxim runs along many similar themes of many species-war animes, but it stands out from other man-eating titles because of its excellent discourse and exploration on the role, purpose and meaning of humanity, in light of our world and environment. Parasyte boasts a dramatic, thrilling and gripping plot, revolving around a solid male lead and the people around him, but in the end suffers from an entire host of underdeveloped supporting characters.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nCharacter:6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (rounded up from 7.5)\\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\n+ Great main male lead character\\n\r\n+ Gripping and interesting plot\\n\r\n+ Meaningful plot twists along the way\\n\r\n+ Lengthy and deep thematic discourse\\n\r\n+ Great action and fighting scenes\\n\r\n+ Great drama, tension and emotion\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Many underdeveloped supporting characters\\n\r\n- Not very outstanding OP or ED\\n\r\n- Shallow characterization of main antagonist\\n\r\n- Some plot holes that the anime itself acknowledges\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very well divided into 8 different story arcs, most of them revolving around certain characters in the anime. They are, in order: Introductory Migi Arc, Mother Arc, Hideo Arc, Kana Arc, Tamura Reiko Arc, Extermination Arc and the Gotou Arc, followed by a 1-episode epilogue. I will go through each of the arcs in order.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off by laying down its foundations, first introducing our main character Izumi, who immediately gets attacked by a parasite which burrows into his right arm, which he later names Migi. For the entirety of the first arc, Migi takes on more of the role of a narrator and does a lot of explanation for the audience as to how parasites function, kill, communicate, survive and also their general abilities. Parasites are characterized as completely rational organisms with no sense of emotion whatsoever, seeking only self-preservation. (+1 for general believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nIzumi constantly finds himself in increasing danger of getting killed by other parasites, while Migi continues to protect him each time, saying that his host must survive to ensure his own survival. They encounter other parasites of increasing power throughout the anime, but things start to get interesting when they encounter Tamiya Ryoko, a parasite whose aim is to blend into human society and study them. (+1 for plot depth)\\n\\n\r\nEverything seems fine until we hit the Mother Arc, where Izumi's mother has been taken over by a wandering parasite in need of a female host. Izumi's father barely survives and makes it to a nearby hospital. Back at the house, Izumi goes into denial mode as he encounters his mother who has obviously turned into a parasite. Unable to attack his own mother, Izumi gets stabbed in the heart, after which Migi must perform a heart reconstructive surgery on the spot to revive his beating heart.\\n\\n\r\nA newly revived and powered-up Izumi now reawakens and vows to protect his father from his parasite-infested mother. Along the way, he encounters Uda, who is the only other character mentioned in the entire anime who is also half-parasite half-human. They end up working together to defeat his parasite mother, now with the new superhuman speed, senses and strength that Izumi has acquired from having Migi's parasite cells mixed into him.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we get to the Hideo Arc, where Hideo, a parasite, was initially sent to Izumi's school to keep tabs on him. This eventually spirals into chaos when a student, Yuko, finds out Hideo's identity and forces him to kill her. Yuko manages to get away by splashing harmful chemicals on Hideo and causing him to go on a killing rampage around the school. Izumi is then forced to first rescue his girlfriend Murano, who is at this point terrified, and also defeat Hideo. (+1 for gripping plot)\\n\\n\r\nWe are then introduced to Kana, who is a female student with the innate ability to sense the wavelengths emitted by parasites. In the Kana Arc, she obsesses over Izumi, thinking that this ability to sense him means that they are fated to be together. However, Izumi quickly realizes that her ability only sense parasites, and that she could be in danger if she keeps getting into close proximity with parasites. Kana eventually dies by her own fault and Izumi in his rage, kills the parasite that killed her.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we move onto the Tamura Reiko arc, which is probably the most interesting arc of the lot. Tamiya Ryoko has since changed her name to Tamura Reiko after leaving Izumi's school, and this time she hires a private investigator, Kuramori, to keep tabs on Izumi. Izumi realizes this and confronts Kuramori who is told the truth behind Reiko's identity. Kuramori, crazed over the mystery, then kidnaps Reiko's human baby and faces off with her at a park.\\n\\n\r\nReiko, faced with the possible death of her own human baby, stabs Kuramori and retrieves her own baby, showing some form of human emotion that she herself didn't think was possible. (+1 for interest) Later on, Reiko gives her life up to protect the baby and doesn't even retaliate against the police who were shooting at her. Izumi, touched by this act of human kindness, then sheds tears for the first time in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing this incident, a task force is set up to eliminate a group of parasites led by Hirokawa found to be operating within a particular building, and we are thrown into a rather bloody Extermination Arc. Here, we are introduced to essentially the polar opposite of Tamura Reiko, Uragami, who is basically a serial killer who has killed so many people that he can differentiate humans from parasites easily, just by looking at them. While Reiko was the monster being human, Uragami is the human being a monster. (+1 for complexity in plot development)\\n\\n\r\nThe task force makes all the humans go through a scanning system to tell apart the parasites from the humans, then using shotgun rounds to blow apart the confirmed parasites. Things go rather well until the parasites try to counter attack, leading to some collateral damage in terms of civilian life whilst the remaining two fugitives Hirokawa and Gotou hide in the upper floors of the building. The anime at this point starts to question whether it is right to sacrifice lives in order to save others, amidst claims by the task force that such damage was \"necessary\" to weed out the parasites.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, in the upper floors, Gotou manages to single-handedly take down an entire squad and escapes, whilst Hirokawa is surrounded by a SWAT team. Hirokawa attempts to save his life by talking about saving the environment by reducing human numbers, but is immediately shot dead. Then, there is a big reveal that Hirokawa was in fact a human working amongst parasites whom he knew were parasites, but believed in their cause in order to maintain \"balance in the ecosystem\" by reducing the human population, seen as a \"poison\" on the earth. (+1 for plot twist)\\n\\n\r\nFinally we move onto the last and final arc, the Gotou Arc, where it's basically Izumi and Migi facing off against Gotou, the enemy whom Reiko earlier said was invincible because he was basically 5 parasites merged into one, giving him immense power and strength. Over the course of the extended battle though, we see Izumi basically resorting to every high-risk maneuver possible to try and defeat Gotou, all of which somehow manage to work. Eventually, they defeat Gotou but are left questioning themselves whether they should finish him off.\\n\\n\r\nMigi, whom at this point has acquired some \"human emotions\", decides that he doesn't want to kill his own kind, whilst Izumi also would rather let fate decide whether Gotou lives, despite the numbers of people that Gotou has killed. (+1 for plot depth) In the end, self-preservation and conservation of human life prevails and they finish off Gotou. (+1 for logical sense)\\n\\n\r\nIn the epilogue that follows, we fast forward many months after all that has happened and Murano and Izumi are back together again. Uragami, the serial killer who has escaped in the earlier extermination arc, comes back to kidnap Murano and then questions Izumi one last time about who exactly is the human and who is the monster in the world they are living in. Izumi ultimately manages to defeat him and save Murano at the same time, thanks to Migi's help.\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot holes, there were a total of 9 that I found, some of them being quite major, so I can't give any bonus points for that.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 7, Uda's story of becoming half-parasite is pretty amusing, save for one small problem that if Uda really fell down the cliff into the water, his body wouldn't sink as quickly as it showed in the anime. In fact, his body should in fact immediately float up within 2 seconds of hitting the water surface, and Uda should not be in any immediate danger of drowning. You could basically see that in the area where Uda was going to jump, the water was deep enough so he wouldn't die from impact on the rocks either. Also, this proves that Uda actually chose a really stupid place to commit suicide that would never have succeeded as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 9, Yuko decides to \"talk to Shimada first\" after having 2 first-hand encounters of his face-changing. Even if Yuko was lovestruck before, after these 2 encounters she should definitely be afraid of Shimada Hideo and would consider him a danger especially after hearing from her brother. It makes absolutely no sense for Yuko to talk to Shimada Hideo first \"just in case\" he's not dangerous. This is clearly a case of a character acting unnaturally in order to create drama in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, two of the rugby students, who had just seen Yuko fall from the top floor of a building, did not even mention this happening to a teacher passing by, and they only chose to tell him about \"something\" in the Fine Arts room. In fact, if they've just seen a girl fall from so many storeys, the should be panicking and at least hurrying to the Fine Arts room to find out what happened, but instead they are pictured calmly walking through the halls. Also, the rugby students say nothing about the severity of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe teacher also is too accepting of the vague report that \"something\" is in the Fine Arts room, and he fails to ask further about what this \"something\" is, or looks like. Perhaps, it's so common in Japan to have students climbing and falling out of the windows of school buildings that people are already desensitized? Give me a break.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 20, Hirokawa says, \"How dare you point your guns at civilians?\" But the soldiers around him are clearly holding their guns at high port arms, hence none of the guns are pointing at anybody.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, two soldiers see a bunch of obviously-too-calm humans walking away amidst the chaos, and decide to let them go? Aren't they on like strict orders to shoot anyone who might seem suspicious on sight, or at least stop them? If this was supposed to be an extermination, these soldiers really aren't doing their jobs at all.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the extermination, the corridors suddenly goes dark in the building they are in. Did all the lights suddenly get turned off in this building for no good reason, or was there a blackout that the audience is supposed to have presumed happened? If anything, during an extermination these lights should all be manually turned out for better targeted acquisition and shooting accuracy. The lights being turned off hence makes no sense and is just a convenient way to make the gory scenes of dead bodies more tense. Even if it's possible that the parasites turned off the lights on the upper floors, this was never actually mentioned so it's still a plot hole.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, when Gotou tells the soldiers who encountered him to follow him, those stupid soldiers actually do so? Uragami, the man who was in charge of identifying the parasites, just ran away with fear at the first sight of Gotou. Wasn't it obvious enough that Gotou was like even more dangerous than all those they encountered before? Even if Uragami wasn't there, when every other normal human is downstairs scared to death for their lives, and suddenly you see a random guy unnaturally calmly loitering around one of the upper floors in total darkness, that's just suspicious on so many levels! Any soldier acting naturally would have immediately gunned Gotou down relentlessly with shotgun rounds without hesitation.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the anime says absolutely nothing about the origin of parasites, and even admits this. This is a major plot hole regardless of how much it is meant to symbolize how our human origins are, too, \"unknown\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot was pretty solid and well done, save for a couple of unnatural character reactions to situations and the plot holes as listed above. Still, compared to many animes out there that I've watched, this anime has really stood out in its plot and thematic development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence 1: 2/2 - Pretty good\\n\r\nED Sequence 2: 1/2 - Simple and artistic\\n\r\nAesthetic: 2/3 - Perhaps it's meant to be a bit disturbing but I didn't like the way that the parasites were drawn. Migi was cute, but many bad ones were all kind of just the same monstrosity, it would have been better if they'd put more variants of the parasites.\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3 - The action scenes were definitely really nice, although definitely there was an obvious lack of special effects put into all the slashing and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 1: 1/2 - Everything is pretty good except that the voice has this really annoying \"autotune\"-like sound\\n\r\nED Theme 1: 1/2 - A beautiful piece of music, but I thought it could have been better chosen, seeing as how they like to end every episode in a cliff-hanger.\\n\r\nBackground Music: 3/4 - I generally enjoyed it, save for certain suspenseful parts where I thought the music was rather toned down and kind of drew away from the mood\\n\r\nAdditional Themes: 0/2 - There were none, so no points here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably where the anime suffers a bit, even though the main character is pretty solid, so we'll start with him.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi is the most complex main character in the anime, and with good reason, because he has a parasite in him that's completely affecting his thought processes and even emotions. We even get a glimpse of a backstory of his family, where his mother got the burn mark, but it's fair to say that he develops his backstory as the story progresses, through the loss of his mother to a parasite (+1 for a backstory). Izumi starts off weak and fearful but he is gradually strengthened by Migi's cells inside of him, making him not only stronger physically but also in mental conditioning (+1 for character growth). Also, Izumi is constantly at odds between his \"parasite\" and \"human\" parts of him. Torn between the two, Izumi eventually manages to find some middle ground towards the end of the anime, being able to be rational and still experience emotion at the same time. (+1 for character development). Definitely my favourite character as his combat skills are also pretty impressive after the second arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe other very interesting character is of course Migi, Izumi's companion who starts off completely rational and straightforward with things. He initially cannot understand human thinking and constantly mocks human emotion, but eventually, after mixing with Izumi's heart, begins to comprehend how human emotions work, and at the end, even decides to spare Gotou's life on grounds of not killing one's own kind (+1 for character growth). Though his ability to develop as a character is limited, since he is a parasite and is non-human, the fact that he shows this growth is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same way, Tamura Reiko also experiences this human emotional change. Going from just a parasite who is interested in learning about humans, to becoming the epitome of human love - giving up her own life for her child, is no mean feat at all (+1 for character growth). Throughout the anime, she is also very peculiar, even by parasite standards, as her obsession with her baby and her long-term insight into the survival of the parasite species seems to be very rare (+1 for character development).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have to mention the useless Murano here, who is Izumi's girlfriend in the show. Murano's only role in this anime was honestly to try and help Izumi realize that he was become less and less \"human\", and Murano constantly struggles as she comes to terms with how Izumi \"has changed\". Throughout the anime, she incessantly bickers and whines about how Izumi is not the same as before and is completely fickle-minded when she decides to stay or not to stay with Izumi. She has no backstory and it's sad that her entire existence of a character is meaningless without Izumi. Plus the fact that she basically bears no relevance to the overall plot makes her sub-par as a main character. Though she eventually grows to accept Izumi as a human for who he is, this is hardly expanded upon.\\n\\n\r\nKana is the other Izumi-obsessed girl who basically fails to achieve anything from the start and all the way up to the end. She only causes trouble for Izumi, either by getting into a trouble with parasites, or by getting in the way of Izumi and Murano's relationship. She's honestly a pest and it was almost a relief to see her brutally killed by a parasite, no kidding. She has no backstory, and even less development than Murano. The only thing keeping me from hating her is that she is probably the prettiest girl in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are even less memorable. Gotou, the main antagonist, is strong, but other than that, he has zero character, and hardly any motives worth mentioning anyway. Other key, interesting figures like Hirokawa, Uragami, Kuramori and Hirama all fail completely in terms of character development, and are basically just there so the plot can keep moving.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, only a few characters actually stood out, and most of the characters were easily forgotten and many who died didn't mean much at all to the plot or to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nExcitement: 3/3\\n\r\nThe action scenes really hit it where it mattered, and it was a real treat to see parasites battling out, and even better when we see Izumi kicking ass with his superhuman-like strength. All the blood and gore also helped a bit to make the scenes more dark and serious.\\n\\n\r\nEmotion: 2/3\\n\r\nQuite a lot of emotion was put into the anime, notably the relationship between Murano and Izumi, which was really back and forth throughout the whole anime, and it seemed like an endless struggle of push-and-pull (Izumi trying to pull and Murano pushing him away). Also, the Tamura Reiko arc was simply brimming with emotion, putting me close to tears at the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nHumour: 1/3\\n\r\nAlthough not known for its humour, the anime also pulls several slapstick stunts off using Uda, as well as Migi when he makes blunt remarks and morphs into very funny things.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: 3/3 \\n\r\nThe story does very well in creating suspense by making many of their episodes end in cliff-hangers so that you essentially never stop watching the show. Also, it had a satisfactory resolution which wrapped up most of the loose ends it introduced, leading to a happy ending. It was also gripping and exciting straight from the beginning, as well as at the start of every episode where they also show random people getting killed by parasites to add tension and drama.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes! (+1) It's honestly been awhile since I've given a 10 for enjoyment, and I'm glad this anime managed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5 / 10 (rounded up to 8)\\n\\n\r\nI chose to round this anime up to an 8 by sheer merit of the delivery of its themes and plot. It was an exciting, thrill ride, as well as a lengthy discourse on humanity and the human condition. It grips you, challenges you to think and asks questions that pierce to the very heart of the human soul, and it may not be for everyone, given the maturity of such themes.",

            "content": "Parasyte the Maxim is a story that handles questions about what makes us human, taking us on an unforgettable horror-adventure in the process.\r\nRight from the start the show has clear and compelling conflicts, with our main character Shinichi facing both external and internal battles, be it the violent parasites he fights or his gradual and scary decent into becoming less human. With good pacing and a story that kept leading in directions that made sense, usually, Parasyte keeps you immersed in its story.\r\nWhere the show shines the most is its main character, one of the most fleshed out and developed examples I\u2019ve seen in sometime. From beginning to end we keep seeing new sides to him that make you both cheer and worry for him, all while entertaining you with the interesting dynamic he has with his parasitic hand.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does bring the show down somewhat is that the rest of the cast-members aren\u2019t written as interestingly, particularly the female characters. We have girls putting themselves at risk despite being warned and knowing better, as well as a romantic interest that keeps ignoring obvious clues around her. But the women are not the only ones, humans in general seem to be intentionally written dumber, making the main character and the parasites seem more logical and threatening in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I appreciate about the series more than anything is that it didn\u2019t fall into one of my pet-peeves, which would be to have a message that raises a lot of questions without giving any answers to them. Without spoiling too much the series has an environmental message toward the end, a less than subtle one. I cannot stress how many times I\u2019ve felt like stories with this message tend to just paint humanity as the villains, never offering any particular ideas on how we can improve. The way Parasyte includes more positive notes to balance things out ellavates it to a more thought out story, managing to avoid coming off as pretentious when it very easily could have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, with the occasional bump on the road, Parasyte is among the best character-pieces in recent memory. It is hard not to recommend for anyone that enjoys some thoughtful horror and adventure.",

            "content": "There are a few categories of anime that tend to gain mass appeal simply because of what they are. Examples include run-of-the-mill Shounens, Key adaptations, \u201cOh no I\u2019m trapped in a video game!!\u201d series, and action-horror anime that are filled with gore for good measure. Due to the recent disaster known as Tokyo Ghoul, I initially brushed Parasyte to the side dismissing it as another horror clone. For the first 12 episodes or so, I held my pinky in the air and avoided Parasyte like the plague. However, I finally caved to the hype. After marathoning the first halfof the series, I realized oh how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story of Parasyte is fairly simple. One night, a bunch of parasites float down from the sky and attempt to enter a multitude of human bodies by taking over human brains. They do this in order to control a host because without a host the parasites themselves cannot survive. Enter our main protagonist Shinichi Izumi, a young high school boy who lives a hilariously average life. Do you remember the nerdy guy from the movie The Breakfast Club? Well that\u2019s pretty much Shinichi in a nutshell. This all changes when a parasite attempts to enter his body one night; however, Shinichi holds off the parasite and contains it to only his right hand. Enter Migi, the parasite who now lives in Shinichi\u2019s right hand and allows Shinichi\u2019s hand to morph into a whole slew of weapons *insert obligatory masturbation joke here*. Now that parasites have begun to invade the human race they have to feed by eating other humans. Shinichi, being the Good Samaritan that he is, takes it upon himself to protect the human race from becoming human happy meals while still hiding the fact that he himself is a partial parasite.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn my honest opinion, the story itself wasn\u2019t really all that intriguing. However, what are intriguing are all the different themes that the story sheds light on. Instead of focusing completely on villain after villain and attempting to create a premise without any depth, Parasyte poses some very interesting questions. What does it really mean to be human? Are the parasites really wrong for acting on instincts? Who are the true parasites of Earth?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tParasyte really only has two \u201cmain\u201d characters; however, they have a few supporting characters that, in my personal opinion, really shine and add depth to an otherwise standard cast. Obviously we have Shinichi, our main hero who wants to save world! He has really generic motivations but he\u2019s still a well-written character. He develops throughout and goes through experiences that alter his view of the situation at hand. Is he really that interesting? Not to me personally, but I didn\u2019t hate him so that\u2019s a win. Then we have Migi, a character who shows a lot more development and growth than Shinichi ever does. I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil how our tale with Migi concludes, but I did feel he was the more interesting of our two leads.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe supporting roles of Parasyte were very hit or miss. Satomi is about as bland of a love interest that ever existed. Her sole purpose is to constantly nag Shinichi over how he has \u201cchanged.\u201d She adds absolutely nothing to the story and only serves to act as a damsel in distress for Shinichi to save and then nag and cry to him later about how Shinichi has just changed so much recently. Satomi is clearly one of Parasyte\u2019s misses; however, for every miss they have a couple successes. The two other characters I want to briefly mention are Ryouko, the parasite soccer mom, and Kuramori, the residential detective. Ryouko is interesting because of how well she develops and grows. She poses many of the overlying questions in the story and really forces both Shinichi and Migi to question what the meaning of humanity is. Kuramori seems like a bland and boring character that is in far over his head. It almost seems ridiculous that someone would actually try to be involved in such a horrific case until we see his motivations. The scene where it flashes his bedroom filled with detective books gives a true sense of character motivations without saying a single word. At that moment everything comes rushing to you. All of his dreams as a child, where he would read the stories of these great heroes and long to achieve what they did, come forward. Its characterization that adds meaning and it was extraordinarily well displayed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tAs for animation there really isn\u2019t much to say. The animation is spectacular with well animated action sequences and a dark color pallet to fit the dark tone of the anime. This well-done animation is something I\u2019ve really come to expect from Madhouse studios.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tSound is highly dependent on taste. The opening theme is different. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m fond of the full version, but the cut version used for the opening was two thumbs up. The ending theme was the polar opposite in terms of presentation. The opening theme is very loud, electronic, and scream-y, while the ending theme is very relaxing and tranquil. Both the opening and ending are songs I would download so that\u2019s always a good sign. The background music didn\u2019t really do much for me. Nothing I would go out of my way to download but nothing that distracted from the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tParasyte sure seems to do a lot right; however, I do think that it\u2019s important to note that after my 12 episode binge I never quite got the same feel from Parasyte while watching it week to week. Whether this is because I missed some of Parasyte\u2019s shortcomings in the beginning or because the show took an overall dip halfway through is up in the air, but I definitely preferred Parasyte\u2019s earlier episodes to its later ones. Another important note about the latter half of Parasyte is that the themes of the show will begin to feel like they\u2019re being shoved down your throat and up your ass simultaneously. Usually, I don\u2019t have a problem with a writer being obvious with the themes because I\u2019m not a huge fan of vagueness as vagueness usually leads to pretentiousness. But damn, this writer really and I mean REALLY wanted you to know what he was going for. Eventually, it did get a tad annoying and by the end it definitely felt like the horse had long been beaten.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Parasyte is a show that I feel most everyone would enjoy. It has all the qualities of a binge-able show: stellar action, cliffhangers, and intriguing questions. It also has many qualities for critics to enjoy: strong themes, some interesting characterization, and unique twists. Some people might argue that the show begins to be a bit preachy and takes itself too seriously by the end, but I felt this didn\u2019t detract from the story that strongly.  The ending itself could have been stronger, but it certainly wasn\u2019t awful. \\n\\n\r\nParasyte was certainly a fun watch and deserves a full recommendation to check it out!\\n",

It follows through and there aren't many faults in the storyline. It also touches on political and philosophical issues like comparing humans to animals, our ecosystem, global warming, and such.\r\nMadhouse did a great job with the art. They made the characters more modern looking compared to the manga. The fight scenes are great. They're intense, fluid, and they don't censor anything.\r\nThe sound is alright. Nothing special, but fitting. I can't believe the opening is mostly in english, still.\r\nThe characters were pretty likable,and they felt like real people. RIP Kana. why did u have to die... T_T\\n\\n\r\nThe character development was natural, and fit with the events in the story. Particularly, Migi and Shinichi. Comparing them from the beginning of the story to the end, they definitely changed over time.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Parasyte is one of the better animes out there. \\n\r\n- Solid storytelling\\n\r\n- Fluid artwork\\n\r\n- Realistic characters\\n\r\n- Great development\\n\\n\r\n10/10.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Parasyte: the maxim is an intriguing anime. It questions the viewer on what it means to be human, what makes humans different than other species, and slaps the truth of human cruelty onto the face of viewers. \r\nWhile writing this review, I will be using references from the lyrics of the OP \u201cLet Me Hear\u201d, performed by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. \r\nDo you know the food chain theory? We, humans stand high and firm at the top of it, we are the absolute predators, with no enemies which can pose a threat to us. Our main means of dying are either from oldage, a disease, an accident, or being murdered. All in all, it is quite a rare case (of course this doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t) that our life will be ended by another species. Yet, it is much easier for humans to end the life of another living being, various examples include domestication, hunting, and urbanization etc. That\u2019s right, you are probably the most comfortable species on Earth, where you can be sitting so comfortably in front of your laptop while the other species live in fear of being killed any time. \\n\\n\r\nIn Parasyte, alien beings emerge and pose a threat to humanity, people fear of being killed, people keep calling the parasites \u201cmonsters\u201d, as their emergence had shaken the firm foundations humans had built on top of the food chain. You see, being long time winners of the Earth and suddenly have that taken from you really scares the shit out of everyone, myself included. \\n\\n\r\nI know, Parasyte is merely a science fiction anime, but time and time again Parasyte reminded of the true nature of our world we live in, and we must not ignore nor run away from the truth: humans are the true devils. The ones with the power to destroy nature, to subdue other species, to create rules for the world, all for the benefit and selfishness of ourselves. \\n\\n\r\nAm I being cynical here? Perhaps. But this was what Parasyte had left in me after finishing it: a powerful, probably long lasting effect which would change my viewpoint in the world we live in.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name which ended 20 years ago, Parasyte: the maxim has its story fully laid out and the producers have all the privilege to dictate the pacing of the show, which is pretty well done in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation wise, it was handled by studio Madhouse, famous for their top-notch quality, as such, there aren't any big issues at this department, the sceneries are well drawn and fitted well; the animations are fluid; and the expressions of the \u201cnormal\u201d human beings are quite brilliantly presented here. One thing that I admire from this section is how Madhouse did some redesigns on the characters, making them more distinguishable than their manga counterparts, and raised the charm of these characters to new heights. Censoring is present, but is done a lot better than some of the animes I\u2019ve seen (Tokyo Ghoul S1 and Pupa, just to name some). \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, Ken Arai did most of the BGM, and most of them fit well in the scenes they were inserted in. Both the OP and ED are great songs, where the OP, an electro-metal song, had lyrics written specifically for the show; ED is a slow and soothing ballad which provides comfort to the overall gruesome and emotional experience the show provides. As for our seiyuus, many of them are well experienced in the industry, and it was truly a delight to have them running the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters, with the story written by a Japanese and the setting set in Japan, being an Asian myself, I can understand the way the characters act. I\u2019ve seen complaints about how annoying this particular character is, his/her actions are unfathomable etc etc, this is because of the differences in culture, and the different environments we all are raised in. In other words, do factor in the various backgrounds of a person before you judge one\u2019s actions. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, we can observe the nature of parasytes, and how they gradually evolve, which is very interesting and fascinating. Some of the parasytes have more intellect and even went further than just being a predator of humans, some wanted to learn more about themselves, learn more about humans, and also learn more about the world. Their developments serve as the main talking points about the true nature of humans. \\n\\n\r\nThe ride of watching Parasyte was indeed a thrilling one, I laughed, I cried, and I screamed to various events happening in the show. It truly got me hooked. I had this finished within 3 days, which is a good indicator to see how much I enjoy this myself. \\n\\n\r\nRegrettably, there are questions left unanswered as the show ends, and the viewers will have to connect the missing dots together. Also, the show utilized way too many coincidences in order to drive the story or to provide some character development. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Parasyte is a great anime which will provide you tons of food for thought about our world in a very broad sense. Of course, powerless as we are as an individual, in the end, most likely nothing will ever change, and our lives will just go on as normal. But hey, with some questions for you to think while in the shower, that\u2019s not so bad sometimes, eh? Prove that you are different from monkeys! (laugh)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\n++ Intriguing story.\\n\r\n+ Smooth pacing.\\n\r\n+ Great animation quality.\\n\r\n+ Nice cast of characters\\n\r\n- Too many coincidences.\\n\r\n- Many questions left unanswered.  \\n",

            "content": "Parasyte, a really hyped about anime when it started airing. Is the hype worth it? or is it just another exaggerated anime? I can't say. But as far as my biased opinion about this anime is concerned, I think this is a pretty good anime as far as story, setting and a new idea is concerned. Horror, there isn't much of it, just some people getting sliced up.\r\nWhen I saw it's promotional video, I thought it would be really cool and indeed it was, for the first half of the series but after that it mellowed down to something that's mostly drama with a bitof action and gore thrown in. \\n\r\nAnyway, let's get with the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\r\nA parasyte takes control over a human by controlling the brain. For Izumi, fortunately, the parasyte gets stuck in his arm and so instead of his whole body, Izumi's right hand (migi in Japanese) is taken over by the Parasyte (named Migi). There are quite many other parasytes about and the dynamic duo works together to beat them because of the circumstances they are put in. At first, Izumi is a cry baby but as the series progresses, he also develops into a calm, composed and a bit inhuman being.\\n\r\nMost of the events taking place are Izumi encountering other Parasytes, some who play a major role in the series, some who are just to run away from and some who become friends. \\n\r\nIt progresses slowly and steadily, which might get boring after a while.\\n\r\nDead people, dead parasytes, few action scenes and drama go along in almost every episode. So that's the whole deal of the story, Izumi's life with Migi. No trying to stop other parasytes, no finding secrets of how they came and no fighting bad guys. He just battles the parasytes that come after him and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe art is good for this anime since this anime is not an action, horror anime but a drama, psychological horror anime. Though the artwork of the parasytes leaves a lot to be desired because when I started this anime I though the parasytes would be freakin' cool but in the end, only one of them came up to the mark.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Let Me Hear\" is pretty good. It reminded me of \"Unravel\" on Tokyo Ghoul since both anime have a similar atmosphere. As for the ending, I listened to it once, and never gave it much attention. \"It's the Right Time\" is just ok. Nothing good enough that you'd want to download a full version.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nOur main character, Izumi is your average high school student who is scared from scary stuff. But after meeting Migi and due to certain circumstances, he toughens up and gets a massive change of character.\\n\r\nMigi is a \"numerical\" sort of character. He cannot comprehend emotion like other Parasytes. So, an intelligent being with no emotions and who judges the situation quantitatively and brings his own and Izumi's safety above all else. No moral values, no respect for others. You kinda understand what he's like now. But despite his personality, he also develops across the series and the human emotions start rubbing off on him. \\n\r\nAs for the other characters, there is Murano who is just like any other girlfriend but doesn't know about Izumi's parasyte.\\n\r\nIn the parasyte department, there are a few important and some side characters. Some play an important role in the series and the rest of the parasytes are just there to create a situation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nI did enjoy it. But it's my own fault for getting ahead and expecting a lot of action from this anime. This is, as the genre states, a drama, horror, psychological, action, seinen anime. And that's what it always will be.\\n\r\nNo one is right and no one is wrong, everything has his/her/its own perspective of this world. If the parasytes shouldn't kill humans, then why do humans kill cows, fish etc. That's the kind of things you can expect of this anime. It does a pretty good job at it too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to anyone looking for some serious stuff. Not action based. But mostly story and ideas. Action, horror are thrown in just so stuff doesn't get dull. \\n\r\nIt's a slow paced anime and you'll probably tire after watching 2-3 episodes. At some places, it goes well but later on, it's just slow. It doesn't have that potential to keep you glued to the screen and end it in one go.\\n\r\nSometimes you'll like the drama and sometimes you won't but this anime is definitely a good one to watch.\\n\r\nAnd those who are looking for horror with a lot of action and fighting, they might be disappointed a bit from this anime. But nonetheless, it's best to get on the bandwagon and watch the series along with everyone else.",

            "content": "Parasyte: The Maxim or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu is about the invasion of an alien species that survive through burrowing themselves inside humans and taking over the brain. It follows a high school student named Izumi Shinichi after he becomes a host of one of these creatures that actually fails to seize his brain and is able to avoid complete domination. The two soon learn to coexist and the story is about them not only trying to survive but to also eliminate the other parasites.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\nThe plot itself is seemingly unique and an interesting concept. It has a couple of good arcs that bring greatcharacter development and is one of the most consistently paced anime I\u2019ve seen. The story is well planned and provides good explanations for most queries inside the show. Overall, there isn\u2019t much to complain about the actual plot of Parasyte as it is intriguing and will keep you hooked from episode to episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is actually somewhat typical and does not stand out too much. Some of the fight scenes were poorly made and it was pretty obvious that the producers became quite lazy after a couple times of doing the same thing. It was especially noticeable when Migi was fighting A in the school building and for almost five whole seconds straight, it was just a flurry and repetition of the same movements. The colours used were also very dull and dark. This being said, the anime does not stand out in its art but it also does not lack anything major in this aspect, it was just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs of Parasyte aren\u2019t that great. The auto tune in the opening is annoying but the actual rhythm and melody are alright. Background music wasn\u2019t very distinct and didn\u2019t add much to the atmosphere. The sound of this anime is nothing close to being outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the beginning of the anime were all very bland and ordinary. Specifically the parasites, all of them were almost the exact same, not only physically but also mentally. They are all extremely one-track minded and only care for their own existence, which is kind of forgivable because they are aliens. However, character development is what Parasyte truly excels at. At the start, Izumi Shinichi is a useless, almost pathetic teenager that is bullied easily. But as the story progresses, so does Shinichi as he learns how to fight and survive with Migi, he no longer stays helpless but turns into a much stronger and reliable character. This was done especially well because it was developed gradually and consistently throughout the show. Another major positive change in character was in two parasites, Tamiya Ryouko (previously known as Tamura Reiko) and Migi. I will not go in detail for these two as it may spoil parts of the story for readers who have yet to watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Parasyte is an excellent watch. However, there are also some minor flaws such as its simplistic art style and music. If you\u2019re into action, psychological or sci-fi anime, you should definitely check this one out.",

            "content": "There could not have been a more fitting end. Shinichi and Migi's dream in the final episode, along with the internal monologue life preaching that followed immediately after (consisting of HALF the sodding episode!), aptly summarised everything wrong with an anime that may as well have been titled 'Parasyte: Maximum Chatter Within'. It was telling that, with the chance to have AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION outside of Shinichi's head, instead the last exchange between the two characters played out internally. Migi said it was because he (genderless, but forever a bro) wanted Shinichi to forget. And I most certainly agreed with Migi's sentiment. \r\nOne of thegreatest challenges in adapting manga is transferring static thoughts to a medium with motion. Madhouse's solution? To simply transfer EVERYTHING not involving internet modernisation 'Google snake + hand' awkwardness, instead of attempting to rework it into conversations... or maybe just having faith that the target audience do not need to be spoon-fed the obvious. Throughout the entire series, even the most basic of thoughts, such as \"Oh no, I am going to die!\" was shoved down my throat. Towards the end, it got to the point where - as if in response to the series spamming me with simplistic obviousness - I was internally screaming 'SHOW; DON'T TELL... WHY!?'\\n\\n\r\nIn a psychological series, it is important for the lead's thought process to be broken down into comprehensible chunks. But in the case of Shinichi, it was like I was listening to my West Highland Terrier's thoughts as she hunts her mortal enemy, the local squirrel. For example, in episode 23 Shinichi marches off to certain doom to do battle with THE ultimate enemy. Only when finding this last boss that he previously ran from - crying, I might add - does it occur to him a plan would be quite handy. Beforehand, he even monologues about how the situation will surely work itself out, as if certain the author will save him. Predictably, Shinichi found himself thinking \"WHAT DO I DO!?' as my eyes rolled into my head. Then, in a moment of  'I will stand here ominously while you think' inspiration, he remembers the old woman he met a few days ago. \"Never give up!\", she says in his head (not meaning don't give up in the context of a 1 vs. 1 battle with a monster, but I digress). Only then does Shinichi - still in his head - miraculously remember a weak-spot based on plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nThe internal monologues are more of a superficial problem. Irksome but perhaps ignorable for those demented by anime. The real issue? Madhouse adding emphasis to the flaws of something decades old and not fixing ANY of them. At the start of the show, Migi - in his loveable matter of factly way - pointed out that humans are the true parasites on Earth / eat cows. At the end of the show, after it somehow stumbles into politics, a politician says THE EXACT SAME THING, as if it is a revelation. He even gives a dramatic speech. And that is all Parasyte has to offer: what it offered at the very beginning. The rest of the 'plot' simply had Shinichi fight parasites hiding in human skin as Migi told him what to do and/or saved him, whilst I had to plug my ears whenever Kana Havawank's character appeared to avoid punching her face on my screen; especially when the 'romance' became horribly overwrought with THAT damnable piece of music. Never before did I realise adding a voice could make me go from indifference to hatred. Her most noteworthy contribution was supportive sex--a modern day Japanese comfort girl, if you will. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what else does the series offer? Well, unlike in the manga, Shinichi starts out as a scrawny four-eyed representation of the what anime has taught me to be the average Japanese high school student. Most of the time, he sounds like he is on the verge of tears. Naturally, three girls still gathered to talk about him, without the bitchy detest reality requires. But before even being halfway done, Shinichi finds himself some hair gel and contact lenses; becoming a new boy, as it were. And then... CIRCLES. The annoying wannabe girlfriend of the piece runs around questioning whether Shinichi is still human after he put a dog in a bin, whilst I simply questioned if he is just an outright moron. Then another girl - with moe earphones added in the anime - decides to also run around after Shinichi due to the 'red string of fate'. Cringe. At this point all I remember is episodes upon episodes of meandering as girls chased Shinichi as he got lost in thought over his inability to cry. Then, towards the end, he discovers he can cry, loses all composure and reverts back to how he started, making me question the point of life/this story. After that, the series randomly just ends on a bizarrely abrupt and 'parasites are hiding now, OH WELL; bye, Migi!' note. \\n\\n\r\nThe single most disappointing aspect? Madhouse's (lack of) budget. Over 20 years late, and the only impressive visuals come in an opening that screams 'TEENAGERS: WATCH ME!' so loudly I feel almost old, an exciting intro though it is. So poor is the art consistency that eyes did not even line up correctly in key episodes. And the parasites quickly took a nosedive towards blob animation, so lacking was the detail. It was so limited I started to believe that the mid-battle internal monologues existed to save even more money by avoiding fluidity. And the colours were on the bland side of dull throughout. I just do not understand: why wait all these years to half-arse something?...\\n\\n\r\nI do like some things. Not many, but some. Migi, for one. The brains AND  personality of the series... in spite of being emotionless and machine-like by nature. Easily one of the most unique characters ever created and, despite not being human, more relatable than the rest of the the human cast combined. His intentionally unintentional deadpan \"That would be a problem\" moments of comedy gold are my favourite parts of the series, along with the bizarre grotesque broship bond he shares with Shinichi. And Parasyte does have an undeniably cool concept. There is something genuinely disturbing about a head turning into a mouth and eating people. Some of the music is uniquely excellent, also: 'hypnotik' being my favourite, if only for the previews. But the rest of the show?... the lack of a plot, or any kind of answers given by its tacked-on 'ending', were issues all those years ago. All the anime added is internal monologue emphasis emphasis suffering and... Aya Hirano as a talking hand. An uninspired adaptation of a manga lacking direction and without any closure does not satisfy me, and nor should it satisfy anyone else.",

            "content": "When this anime was airing, I had over 10 different animes that I was watching, and during that time this anime was my most favorite one. Even for a harem genre lover such as myself, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it as I watched despite the lack of nosebleeds.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI rarely ever give a story a 10, but there were several factors that gave this anime the god score. First, the originality in the overall plot was a thumbs up as most stories nowdays unfortunately have similars to some other type of story, whether intentional or not, but this animehad a plot that (at least for me) I haven't seen before. Second, the pacing was good, and while some of you may not like the 24 episodes, it helped keep the pace good and steady as this would have not been as enjoyable if it was crammed into a 12 episode format. Third, no offplot events, or in other words, no random episodes thrown in to be fillers. Pay attention as there is plot development in all the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI give it a 9 because (besides a personal opinion of there is no such thing as perfection) of the overall good fight scenes, however the detailed art may make you queasy, especially if you plan to get a uncensored version when the dvds come out. If your used to the gore, then pay no heed as the art is going to be to your liking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI personally can't say that I'm an expert at judging music, but as far as I notice all the music and sounds fitted right into the places where they belonged, as well as the opening and closing tracks were pleasing to the ears. The background sound overall was excellent and well placed by the makers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI give the characters a 9 for that many of the characters are fresh, besides the girl the protaganist likes. The majority of the characters are just overall not well seen around anime as the plot, as stated as before, is pretty original allowing for new kind of characters to be seen. (Forwarning, if you are a kind of person who wants everyone to live and nobody to have died, you might want to toss that aside as there are 1 or 2 deaths that will cause at least a tear)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDespite the fact that I'm a harem, ecchi type lover as shown through my anime list, this anime will forever be on the top animes that I would recommend to anyone of a serious, slightly humorous, gore anime. With the action, drama, and the various aspects of this anime,  I'm sure you will love it as much as I have.",

            "content": "In depth review #7 - Parasyte: The Maxim\r\nParasyte, without a doubt, was an amazing experience. Anyone who had watched the anime can agree with me in saying that this show was very entertaining. The brief but appropriate action scenes, the frequent cliffhangers at the end of every.....episode, and the amazing character development  kept me coming back for more every week. However, the way the anime concluded left me a little disappointed. A show literally oozing with potential in the beginning of the show, felt rushed towards the last 7 episodes. Its also worth mentioning the scope of the story was very isolated. They couldof done so much more with this story, and answer so many more unanswered questions, but what can you do. It was good for what it was. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.75 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nA story about alien organisms taking over to the bodies of humans sounds awesome, but how exactly did this anime execute this premise? Well, to put it simply, it was ok. Yes, the journey, our main character, Shinichi, experiences was great, and the struggles between the duo and  other parasytes where also well executed, but the scope of the story was just too small. The story is about Shinichi, but the anime is essentially about an invasion of organisms taking over humans in a modern society. The story could of had been so much more expansive and robust. Also, it's worth mentioning that the anime was heavily rushed around episode 18. One minute there's a fight, then the next minute there's scene with the  government , then there's a sex scene. The pacing during this part of the show was just too haphazard for my liking. If i hadn't bashed the story enough, the ending was kind of lackluster. Not because the ending didn't make sense, or that it was bad or anything. What i didn't like about it was that there wasn't enough closure. One of the biggest questions i have about this anime was where did the parasytes originate from? I would of had thought that would be an obvious topic to cover in this show, but apparently i was wrong. At this point, you may think i hated the story, but i didn't. It was interesting, and a breathe a fresh air. I just had unrealistic goals for this anime since it was just so good in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.75 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this show was also average. Nothing more and nothing less. Most of the animation wasn't memorable but there were a couple of scenes where they used some interesting facial expressions to convey serious emotions, and drastic tension. These scenes either had me lean back a bit in my chair and say WTF is wrong with your face, or made me widen my eyes a bit and say Shit's getting real. The fight scenes between parasytes where also animated nicely. The blades clashing into one another, and the slight blood splatter was realistic and pleasing to the eye. Besides these entities however, nothing really stood out. I'm currently trying to think of a couple of scenes that i can put in this section but nothing is coming to mind. I guess this fact explains what i am trying to get at more accurately. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nI admit it, i am a sucker for dubstep in anime. I personally listen the liquid dubstep and other dubstep variations, so i am extremely biased on this subject, but the music was amazing. The fact that i tried to find certain tracks after i watched to anime should give you a sense of how good the music was. If you don't like this type of music, this aspect of the show probably wont mean as much to you as it does to me, but regardless the music fit well with the anime. It was subtle, but it complemented the action, and stressful scenes very nicely. I honestly couldn't imaging certain scenes without the dubstep in the background.  This anime is proof the edm can be properly implemented in anime successfully, and won't completely suck like most failed attempts did in the past. Other than the music, the voice acting was on point. I loved Migi's melodramatic tone of voice throughout the anime. Shinichi, Murano, and the other supporting characters voice actors also did a great job of realistically portraying their characters voices. I came to this conclusion after hearing there characters speak during the emotional scenes. Hearing there broken speech while crying, or while scared adds the element of realism which isn't always present in certain anime. The same can be said while characters where arguing with each other. There tone and the intensity of there voices made things seem as if i was watching an argument in real life. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has the best character development i have ever seen in an anime to date, hands down. It's almost shocking seeing how much a character can gradually change, and grow in only 24 episodes. All of the characters in the cast experience some magnitude of character development in the show,  but the stars in my book go to Shinichi and Migi. The show introduces an interesting bleeding effect between these two characters. Since Migi and Shinichi are living in the same body, certain aspects of each other is inherited between each other. What this means is that as the show went on, Shinichi started acting more like a parasyte, and Migi started inheriting emotions like humans do. The way they introduced this and how the changes got more noticeable every episode was perfect. This was definitely the best thing that this show accomplished during its run. Something that annoyed me though was how Murano didn't stfu about Shinichi's changes for about 15 episodes straight. She was so annoying in the beginning omfg, but she did a 180 towards the end which was an improvement. Besides the main characters, there was clear character development between both species in the show (human, parasyte) which had unique changes for both. Quick examples could be seen in Shinichi's dad, and in Tomea Reiko. Overall great cast, a lot of variety, and unique character development techniques. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great) \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime. It wouldn't be a stretch in saying that this was one of the best anime to come out during the winter 2014 season. A lot of people can agree with me on this to. Just go on any forum or video are read the posts explaining how Parasyte > Tokyo Ghoul. What got me hooked on this show was that it kept me on the edge of my seat literally every episode. No, i don't think you fully understand. There was a cliffhanger every episode. Sometimes i was left there huffing and puffing since i came to the realization i had to wait an entire week to watch what would happen next. I really enjoyed watching this anime. The only thing that was wrong with it was that it wasn't ambitious enough, which really isn't a flaw, just my imagination running rampant. Either way, MUST WATCH anime right here. It was a roller coaster, i would recommend anyone who enjoys good anime to ride it. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.4/10 (Very Good) - Must Watch \\n",

            "content": "\"Flies know how to fly without being taught. Spiders know how to spin webs without being taught. Why is that? Here's what I think: Flies and spiders are simply following an order. I believe all lives on Earth have received orders of some kind. Don't humans have any directive? When I took over this human's brain, I received a directive. It said, Devour this species.\" - Tamura Ryoko\r\nWhat does it mean to be human? Is it our DNA that sets us apart from the other creatures that inhabit the earth? From a scientific standpoint, the answer to that question would be \"Yes\". However, we arenot scientists, so we must answer that question in a different manner. For as long as we can remember, humans have been the champions of survival, conquering all obstacles in our path due to the sheer amount of knowledge that we can possess. But what if humans were no longer the champions? What if some other species showed up one day with the likeness of human beings and treated us as their prey? Would it be us that really deserve to survive -- or would it be the newer, more perfect human race? That is the common question brought up in the world of Parasyte: The Maxim.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the 1989 manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki, Parasyte whisks viewers away to a world where a parasitic alien race is attempting to attach itself to and consume the life-force of human hosts. These parasites, however, are just acting on basic instinct. With that being said, it is no surprise that our main character (Shinichi Izumi) in Parasyte becomes \"Infected\" by one right at the very start of the show. Shinichi, however, notices the parasite as it burrows into his arm and cuts off any path that said parasite has to make it to the brain. The result of this lies in the parasite (Who we will come to know as Migi) controlling his right arm instead of his entire body.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte works off of a strong pilot episode that serves as an intense attention-grabber and coerces viewers into delving deeper into the series. Through the utilization of suspenseful endings and TONS of gore, Parasyte has become perhaps the most successful anime of 2014. But this doesn't necessarily mean that it is the best. It has flaws, just as 99% of shows do. But are those flaws enough to degrade the score of the show to a state in which it is not worth watching? Not really, no. But lets look into it further anyway as I break the show apart into a few key elements to better illustrate it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nI'm going to cut right to the chase here in the music section and state that Parasyte had the single best background song of 2014. That song (Hypnotik) was a powerful blend of techno and orchestra that made each and every fight scene in Parasyte literally ten times better than they would have been on their own. And the great thing is that the soundtrack isn't only extremely interesting, but incredibly dynamic, memorable, and packed to the brim with intensity and drama. The one complain I do have about it though, is that there just wasn't enough. There were only about three or four songs that just kept getting cycled through. And even though I really REALLY liked those songs, there just wasn't enough diversity. Regardless, the music was pretty astonishing and, thanks to Hypnotik, my favorite part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nParasyte has a pretty heft cast of characters, and almost every one of them is equally important and serves as a stepping-stone in the development of Shinichi. Whether he be coping with loss or learning how the parasites work, his mind is never at rest. And for 22 hours of the day, neither is his right arm. Migi, though extremely annoying at first, quickly grows on you. No pun intended. Shinichi, on the other hand, stays pretty annoying throughout the whole damn show. He was developed well, don't get me wrong. In fact, it was some of the best development of the year. But there was just a certain unlikability to him that pissed me off almost every episode. Plus, this show killed off the only character I actually liked, so I have vendetta against it. Even though the cast is well-varied, none of them are really that all-that likable, and that's a big problem. Characters, being debatably the most important part of an anime series, need to be strong or interesting or funny or anything like that. But almost none of the characters in Parasyte really are. However, because of their development actually being good, this isn't something that should sway your opinion in watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nBeing the adaptation of a manga from the 80's, Parasyte handles the gap between old-school anime and new-school anime very well. It feels more like something that came out of the early 2000's than something from the past few years. This brings a certain endearing charm to it for those that actually read the manga version, while still allowing new fans like myself to grow fond of it. However, there is a slight lack-in-detail in the art department. The most visually interesting aspects of the show fall upon the parasites while they are fighting, and any time they aren't, the show just looks kind of plain and boring. There is just such a noticeable artistic gap between those two things that the art can't be called perfect. It's good, yes, but good enough to be considered great? Mehhhhh, not really. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe idea of humans being taken over by parasites isn't necessarily the most original idea. BUT, it's still a good one, which means there is a high-chance of success in the story department. And for the most part, Parasyte does succeed. Eventually though (Specifically in the last couple episodes), the plot gets a little too convoluted. I started to feel like the show was basically saying \"Okay kids, what have we learned today?\" instead of actually coming to a fitting resolution. This really spoiled things for me. Minutes ago, I was in an alternate reality where humans were at risk of dying out, and now I'm basically being told to recycle and not kill bugs. It ruined what was earlier a great plot by literally trying to teach you a lesson instead of letting the story do that on its own. Hell, there is at least five minutes of actual dialogue in the last episode where Shinichi is talking about the moral of the story. AND THEN, they literally take a complete 180 and basically say, \"LOL NEVERMIND\". It wasn't fair. It was like, for a brief moment, the director wanted to play a cruel joke on all the people who so diligently followed the show -- and it really ruined what could have been great.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is pretty much the \"Attack On Titan\" of 2014. It received a lot of early praise for its ability to set the tone of a dark story, but was consequently blown out of proportion by all those people that thought they discovered the next Evangelion. Don't misinterpret that last sentence either, because I really like both Parasyte and AOT. But there are so many better shows out there than both of them, and they really don't deserve to consume the entirety of their respective year's spotlight. Give this show a watch -- I'm almost certain you will enjoy it to a certain extent. But I would sooner recommend a multitude of shows with interesting characters and a story that lets you determine the moral on your own.",

            "content": "[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]\r\nThe truth is... this show is overrated. Overrated does not mean bad, it simply means overrated. \"Oh you're just not intelligent enough to grasp all the deep concepts hidden within the philosophical plot!\" No. It's just not as deep as you might want to believe it is. The series definitely doesn't stay true to the \"meant-to-be\" dark-premise of the manga, especially towards the end. \r\nThe story starts off with what everyone believed was going to be a philosophical story between the meaning of life and death, and humanity vs reality with the introduction of a species higher up in the food pyramidthan humans, called Parasytes. Sure everyone wants to believe that what they're watching is deep, but truth be told it's really not. The story can't seem to decide what direction they want to go. Parasytes basically infect human beings, usually take over their brains and control them. And as you can guess, Parasytes eat humans making them the one species above human beings in the food chain. Shinichi, the protagonist only gets infected in his right hand, therefore he still has conscious control over his body (except for his right hand obviously). Where does it go from there? A psychological show? An action show? A horror? A romance? All of the above, while almost failing to reach it's potential in every aspect. The plot doesn't go in linear way, it cuts corners and adds in random interferences whilst not being able to intertwine and contain them all. One moment there's a fight then there's awkward school life-romance, then there's running away and talking pretentiously, then there's another fight randomly. A lot of things were taken too slowly, then rushed in the latter creating an unbalanced flow in the plot. It's almost like although the show wanted to be philosophical, it was just about one boy running away from a herd of parasytes trying to kill him for no rational reason other than him being the main character. Furthermore, in order to promote themes, the show portrayed a lot of things incorrectly, especially human beings (The police). Human beings are evil and corrupt. Okay... Now you have to contrast that in order to create a theme or idea, but the show doesn't succeed in showing two sides of a concept, although they try. The writers did everything in their power to somehow elevate Shinichi to a god-level in one moment then degrade him to a useless hippo the next moment in order to fit whatever they were farting out of their butts. The beginning was potential-filled, middle didn't live up to it's expectations although was decent, and the ending just made no sense what-so-ever. If you're going to be philosophical, you need to back it up with your story. Kiseijuu failed to do just that and instead just had a lot of childish bloodshed. Yes, the fighting was childish because honestly, it wasn't justified. Now with all that negative things said, the story really was pretty enjoyable to watch-listen to so don't think that the show sucks. On the positive side of the show, there were moments that though they may be pretentious, some comments reached deep into my heart and my mind. Tamura Reiko's \"For what purpose was I born in this world?\". People think about that all the time. Why are we actually born? Do we have a certain purpose to fulfill that's destined by fate? Then there was the mayor's entire speech on human evolution. I found those to be really intriguing topics to think about and half the fun in watching an anime is for it to make you think and grasp upon a new conception/philosophy. But overall, yeah story was disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nThe character develop was really underwhelming in the show as well. I'll start with popular main characters, Migi and Shinichi. What the story started off doing was uniting two characters into one to intertwine the nature of humanity and other creatures. The show tries to connect the audience to the humanity side and the \"monster\" side and show the differing perspectives. Shinichi seemed to turning more into a monster while Migi was becoming more human. But the starting potential was all there was to that development. There are too many unresolved questions and everything that Migi does for Shinichi is beyond unrealistic. I mean I understand Parasytes existing is unrealistic in itself, but they're supposed to be a opposing metaphor for the concept of humanity, but there are some bullcrap moments that the writers seem to fart out of their butts to save Shinichi. Towards the last two episodes, Shinichi is beyond useless without Migi and he keeps saying more pretentious crap about his emotions, when there's nothing more to say but \"The writers wrote me so that I'm a human being that's marching straight towards the strongest parasyte in the midst of night because I feel like something good will happen\". And... of course something good does happen. Oh man how genius and clever of the writers right?! The other characters had their appearances, then two episodes later their exits. Development of any sort? I don't think so. Shinichi really could have developed more. His losses in life changes him to embrace his half-parasyte side, while his love for human life clings to his humanity. Okay, that's a great base start but where does it all go from there? Shinichi sure had a lot of emotions tied into his characters to the point where it was like, who is this person? Shinichi is this person one moment, then another the next. The only character that developed at all is Tamura Reiko and yes she is like the only character I actually liked. Her development into trying to understand human emotions, laboring her human child, trying to unite both humanity and parasytes together. The writers succeeded in creating her character as a symbol of hope and despair. The hope that humans and other creatures will one day understand each other. The despair that there will be bloodshed and corruption within the social hierarchy of species. Her one quote of \"arigato\" was probably the most powerful one word in the anime that pierced through my heavens. A bright light in in the anime for sure. As for the two girls, Murano and Kana... they happen to be in love with Shinichi but there's abolutely no chemistry between the characters. All Murano does for 90% of the story is \"Are you really Shinichi?\" and Kana just constantly throws herself at Shinichi whilst being aware of the dangers around her just because... the writers made her. I mean even in a fictional story there should be some human-emotion-realism right? Kana could have been a character like Tamura Reiko, a way of hope and despair in connection of the two species, but no. She became a nobody without really ever being a somebody. Also so many small characters that seemingly were going to play a role in the story just had one event then disappeared from the show entirely: Uda, Makiko, and his father? Like,  what even happened to them by the end?\\n\\n\r\nThe very ending of Parasyte makes no sense, there is almost no connection to the rest of the story. It's almost as if the series just cut off everything that the story built up to, to just end the show. Yet because Migi has a pretentious exchange with Shinichi, people who don't even grasp what they're even saying believe it to be a genius ending. All Migi basically says is Shinichi should wake up from his dreams (which is his reality) and forget everything that's happened to him and live a normal human life. Then Shinichi realizes that humanity is corrupt and that in human nature there is natural evil. But despite all the negative sides of human nature, human beings are beautiful creatures and they include the love of Earth into the whole pretentious mix. Migi then just disappears without anything being explained. I mean Migi just randomly leaves within his dreams which then translates to Migi disappearing from the show entirely. What the hell? Did he leave himself to Shinichi (for him to have an arm) and then kill his life-force so that he doesn't actually exist? in the end when Shinichi saves Murano, it's implied that Migi saves her. So, what the hell actually happened to Migi? Makes no sense to me, maybe someone else can make sense of the whole ending for me. This last episode sort of reminded me of Evangelion's ending where it doesn't connect all that well to the rest of the plot and doesn't explain a lot of things while including randomness to sound smart.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the art in Parasyte, I'd say it was decent? I mean, the portrayal of the Parasytes was mediocre to me in comparison to the kagune of Ghouls in Tokyo Ghoul. The characters all looked like they had unusually long faces (though I don't bash them for that, just something I noticed). The actions scenes were mediocre as well, as all they portrayed were a bunch of arms moving around at a speed so fast the audience just sees lines dashing across the screen. I suppose the portrayal of weather (such as the snow when Tamura Reiko ...) was beautifully done. the music in Parasyte was good but there wasn't all that much variety in music. It was basically, opening-one other random Ost-Next to you-Ending every episode. \"Next to you\" is a really good piece though, I loved listening to it every time it played. Solid in the music category overall. Okay actually, listening to it's full soundtrack, Parasyte had some really nice music.\\n\\n\r\nAt the very end of the show the only thing left is my head is: What was the point of the show? Was it to show that humanity is corrupt and that we're the reason other species can't move forward? That humanity should embrace other species and try harder to understand? Or that reality is a cruel place? What do other people see in this show that makes them think it's so genius? And of course, if you enjoyed the show then I respect that as well because despite my criticism I too enjoyed the show ... to an extent. \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Parasyte is a show that's worth watching if you like psychological shows.",

            "content": "I'm the type of anime watcher that likes to wait for the anime to be completed before watching it; so I can either marathon it in one day or finish it in a few days - am I the only one who does this? Parasyte or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was one of those anime I've completed in a day. With the cliffhangers that leave you at the edge of your seat at the end of the episodes, to the humans that can morph into blades and mold their faces/ bodies for creating massacres; it's the perfect formula for binge watching. I would have beendying to wait for each episode each week if I watched this when it aired. \\n\\n\r\nWhen speaking with others online about Parasyte, the most common piece of criticism I hear that strays away those who don't want to watch is that it's \"not my genre,\" it's \"overrated\" or \"it makes my stomach turn while watching some scenes.\" Although I agree with most of these statements, it's because of these points that people should try watching - simply because it's a genre/ story that's not seen often in this generation. \\n\\n\r\nPutting that aside, the anime begins with a mini snake-like organism emerging from it's shell that fails to attempt to target a high schooler by the name of Izumi Shinichi, unable to attack Shinichi's brain to completely take over his body. However the organism develops it's own intellect in Shinichi's right arm and is named Migi (which is Japanese for right). The story is about magnitudes of these snake-like organisms taking over humans in Japan. If the brain has been successfully taken over, a parasyte is then born which then has the ability to morph body parts into blades and lengthen the human anatomy. To survive, these parastyes thrive on devouring the anterior portion of humans, killing with no second judgement. The main character Shinichi learns about this through his counter-part Migi and goes on a mission to kill any parasyte that poses a threat to society. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching this and reflecting on it, it's clear that the anime was trying to illustrate the question of: \"can someone who does not display human-like qualities, be humanized?\" The answer to this question is, yes and it's heavily drawn out through the characters. We see that as the story progresses it's clear that parasytes are depicted as blood thirty creatures. However some of the parasytes like Tamiya Ryouko, who seemingly is out to kill, becomes more human as her storyline progresses. We also see this with Migi, Migi starts off as having no empathy for humans, Shinichi included, but gradually gains affection towards them as the episodes unfold. However when looking at Shinichi, the reverse occurs to him as he loses his some emotions and becomes less humanized. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is quite solid, and the sound stands out as one of my favourites. Although this anime is an adaptation from a manga in the 90s, I enjoyed that the art is drawn in a way that's up-to-date with the anime that's out now but yet still has that air from the art during the 90s as well. The animation is fluid but not that fluid in some regards as I hoped. For example, when we see the one-to-one combat between parastyes; the lightning speed combat with using lengthened limbs and blades are not that fluid. The OST is a stand out, one of the better ones out there against the others during the time this aired; which actually made me download the entire album. I presume everyone's favourite is probably \"next to you.\" If you haven't heard it, youtube it, download it, listen, and enjoy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was a great anime to watch. If you're looking for something that's out of your comfort zone or just looking for something new to watch, I would recommend this. I promise you that after the first episode, the cliffhangers will reel you in and possibly cause you to watch episode after episode until your done. If you made it this far reading my review.. thanks ! Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any comments about my review or want to discuss anything anime.",

            "content": "You\u2019ve probably heard of them in classic sci-fi stories before; the very idea of alien creatures who can snatch bodies to impersonate a human and walk among our society. Build on the foundation of a science fiction and body horror, Kiseijuu (also known as Parasyte) takes a full swing with its premise. It\u2019s simple actually. We have a case of alien invasion by mysterious beings who can infect us through parasitic means. By inserting themselves into a human\u2019s brain, the parasites can take full control and transform you into a monster. Not only does this kill the victim but now it can even add moreits body count by consuming more humans. Sounds terrifying right? That would have been a fate for a young man named Shinchi until one parasite goofs up and fails his mission. Now they share a single body but with separate personality. Let the adventure begin.\\n\\n\r\nWith such an engaging premise, Kiseijuu really sets the par high not just by its first episodes but also by some other technical aspects from behind the scenes. First we have the powerhouse studio Madhouse who are well renowned for their reputation. Then, there\u2019s the source material. This adaptation is based on the manga that came out over two decades ago but has earned praise. With just the forefront of these elements, the series has high expectations. Thankfully, it lives up to its hype.\\n\\n\r\nThe show doesn\u2019t take a break even from the start by showing the grim reality of the show\u2019s horror. If you don\u2019t believe me, then the first few seconds may convince you. Needless to say, a series like this is not easy to the stomach. But given that fact, it makes itself look real by showing us the brutality of the parasites. The first few episodes establishes the fact that most parasites are heartless monsters who care only about themselves and their prey. The parasite that failed to take over Shinichi\u2019s body display similar traits by threatening to kill him and others if their secret is revealed. Migi (the name that Shinichi gives to it) often thinks strategically to survive while discarding all morality. For instance, he tries to kill any witnesses who see the symbiotic relationship between him and Shinchi. Then, there\u2019s the actual combat where Migi fights indiscriminately at times in order to survive. Outside of combat, the show becomes a bit of personal drama. This is because Shinchi has to constantly deal with keeping this secret and not revealing it to others for the fear that they may be killed. It\u2019s more than just responsibility but also creates the sensation of fear. For the both of them, it\u2019s about survival in a world run by atrocity.\\n\\n\r\nWhat makes this series\u2019 story stand out quite a bit is the ability to convey human nature and focus on more than just outlandish battles for survival. It shows the best and worst of what humans can do while also balancing out how parasites can behave. Sometimes, there\u2019s almost a similarity while others stands in sharp contrast. For Shinchi, he undergoes big changes as the story progresses with certain events that create tragic scars in his life. These changes are reflected both physically and mentally. Even his classmates like Murano notices this and is constantly worrying about his well-being. In the beginning, we can see him as a normal guy who just wants to be normal. Until he accepts the reality later on, Shinchi is just someone who wants friends, get an education, and perhaps even fall in love. The certain events of the parasites changes all of that as he can never go back to his normal life. His relationships with Murano often has shifting drifts because of the dangers he realizes she may be in if she gets too close to him. Then, there\u2019s the relationship between him and his parents. In particular, his mother represents as someone who sets by example of what a good parent should be. And case taken, the series doesn\u2019t neglect to show other relationships even among the parasites. Motherhood plays a role as well as one particular parasite becomes a guardian for her child. And although she shows little feelings towards it, there\u2019s a drastic change to her behavior later on as she begins to develop human traits. On the other hand, we can also see the worst of human nature. For instance, there\u2019s a serial criminal in the series whose behavior isn\u2019t far different from the parasites themselves.\\n\\n\r\nIn contrast, there\u2019s also Shinchi who develops quite a bit throughout this show. Remember, a big part of this series relies is crafted by the way things change and how they work. Shinchi\u2019s experience of fighting alongside Migi turns him into a warrior beyond someone who just wishes to protect others. This is in particular true because of the tragic events in his life. His change is reflected physically and also at an interpersonal level as Shinchi becomes less and less human himself. From an ordinary kid with a timid personality in the beginning, Shinchi becomes a changed man who is serious, humorless, and pessimistic. It\u2019s also shown in the case where Shinchi begins to develop fighting skills of his own when he can\u2019t always rely on Migi. And furthermore, the show takes advantage of the choices he makes to further develop his character. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to see how much the show can focus on its premise and understanding it. The show takes its turns with each episode to present thrillerish scenarios and events that connects with the characters. Its narrative also remains a strong aspect of the show by focusing on Shinchi\u2019s role and what his decisions are no matter how risky they may seem to be. \\n\\n\r\nAlso, be aware that the show has tragedy. More than just death, Shinchi\u2019s losses in life expands beyond just losing important people around him. It shows that he can\u2019t save everyone and when that happens, Shinchi feels regret because of his own lack of confidence. It\u2019s interesting at the same time to see how much Migi changes. From the irrational display of inhumanity he shows in the beginning, we can see some of his softer sides. It seems as the story goes on, there\u2019s attachment he feels about the human race and their behavior. While most of this is obstructed in the beginning, the development of his character reaches a point where Migi behaves like a human. On a lighter side, the show also adds some elements of comedy involving Migi and Shinchi\u2019s relationship. Migi\u2019s particular curiosity leads him to \u201cresearch\u201d on human sexuality which creates hilariously memorable moments. Kana\u2019s repetitive \u201cWhite Knight wet dreams\u201d are also something of a very peculiar comedy that adds more into the show. Similarly, we can also see different sides of other parasites ranging Reiko\u2019s care for her child to the political ways that some parasites tries to initiate into society. By presenting such events, it also shows that not all parasites are simply absent-minded for their lust to consume and kill. We even have a character that Shinchi can relate because of their own personal life circumstances. But for all its worth, the show can become a bit predictable at times. The death flags are inevitable not to mention the spoilerish opening song. While the transition of each episodes remain mainly strong, there are some minor changes between the manga and this adaptation. Furthermore, both the manga and anime has plot holes that are seemingly never answered. None of them really destroys the content of the story but some of it seems a bit odd such as the technology and Shinchi\u2019s original appearance prior to become Mr. Badass.\\n\\n\r\nAs a fan of the manga, I have to say that my initial impressions of the artwork wasn\u2019t very great. The artwork has a more generic style rather than the mature atmosphere the manga delivered. After taking more careful glances though, there\u2019s also a feel of attachment anyone can make from the art. Starting with gruesome, the designs of the parasites are both horrific and fascinating. All of them show monstrous traits with their murderous-like intent. The eyes, blades, and disfigured faces are what makes them fearful. Certain parasites also develops more powerful traits that really makes them stand out above others physically by their body structure. In this case, the designs got the job done. Migi in particular has a very fascinating appearance with his unique case of being stuck in Shinchi\u2019s hand. For the human characters though, most of them are categorized by character design to fit with their personalities. From Shinchi\u2019s normal parents to the various delinquents, each of them gives off an impression of humanity. But the most fascinating part about the show is Shinchi\u2019s physical change. His tragic experiences transforms him into a more daring man and this is even reflected by his image. The sharp-edge hair, removal of his glasses, and firm body structure are just a few examples of this. And finally, the show is infamous for its graphic violence. Expect pouring blood, severed limbs, and gore that really entitles this show as horror. The action scenes are also, fast, crisp, and decorated with high production values thanks to Madhouse. Oh and that absence of censorship is a great please to the fans like myself.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack and music plays a rather interesting role. In particular, the dubstep becomes a controversial addition added to the series. Sometimes, the usage feels right while other times really feel out of place. The first episode wastes no time with the usage of dubstep so viewers will have to get used to it. It took me a couple of episodes to adapt with the OST and in retrospect, it does work out once you feel attached to it. In other respects, the characters\u2019 voices show a good deal of focus especially with Shinichi and his change. This is reflected in his more calm and confident voice later on in the story in contrast to his quiet and timid personality in the beginning. Kana Hanazawa also plays the role of Shinchi\u2019s love interest with a sense of innocence in her voice. But most interestingly, we have the voices of the parasites. All of them has a disturbing and distorted voice compared to their former human hosts when transformed. I give credit for this sci-fi style of portrayal to bring out the realism of their presence. But when in human form, there\u2019s some a lack of empathy in the voice mannerisms of the parasites. Other times, there are parasitic characters who shows more of a human tone such as with Reiko and Uda. Then, there\u2019s also the character Migi. Voice actress Aya Hirano effectively brings this character into life with her voice. Finally, there\u2019s also the OP and ED songs. Unlike most 2 cour series, there are no changes the whole time with the hardcore OP song or the gentler atmosphere of the ED.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of sci-fi horror, then this series should no doubt be something of a must-see. This remarkable work is reflected not just in the story but by the characterization of its cast \u2013 both human and parasitic. The show\u2019s focus on its various themes crafts great amounts of moments that are memorable for its nature. Shinchi\u2019s development over the course of the series along with Migi are like experimental journeys that really makes their point. And with all this going on, we can also see how far the show can make for itself when it can make you feel attached to its premise. There will be some predictable plot elements in regards to the romance sub-plots or tragedy. However, this shouldn\u2019t be a set-back especially when its main story is thought provoking. Hell, even the action scenes tells a story each episode. Kiseijuu is a wonder that is sometimes fun, sometimes horrific, sometimes mysterious but always entertaining.",

            "content": "Based off of the award winning manga series written by Iwaaki Hitoshi, coming from the highly praised Madhouse studio, with all excitement and intense story, Kiseijuu constantly finished this season with its fineness.\r\nThe story set-up in a realistic world where an unknown organism invaded earth and take over human bodies, accidentally one of that organism is trying to enter into someone's body, a body of a sleeping boy named Shinichi Izumi, but the organism can only take over Shinichi hand only. The incident created a bizarre creature that lives eventually in Shinichi's right hand. Meanwhile, other organisms that successfully take over a human / animalbodies is starting to attack the Civilians secretly and eat them. With that fact, Shinichi decided to fight other ruthless parasites with Migi's help.\\n\\n\r\nIn the story section, Kiseijuu have some notable succession. A bizarre yet successful settings brings Kiseijuu a glimpse of uniqueness to its story. The story actually not so complex, the concept is understandable and easy to remember. The individual elements of the story runs pretty well too, it was thrilling, and so exciting. The anime have a fairly balanced pacing while throwing some excitement & surprises at the same time. Kiseijuu added many other genres and mixed up into one big unity. One of them is romance, There is some scenes that included romance Although sometimes the romance felt awkward because the lack of process.\\n\\n\r\nThe other good thing is Kiseijuu successfully illustrated the true nature of a living creature, especially us humans. Kiseijuu left some moral lessons for the audience: \"Life is a valuable thing, we have to respect of human and creature life\"\\n\\n\r\nThe animation actually quite standard, not bad but not the best. The character design is decent, while, in the other hand, I fully appreciate the parasites design, it is well-illustrated & quite memorable, it success in bringing a grim & scary feeling to the screen.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound settings, I personally adore the Opening song  \u201cLet Me Hear\u201d sung by Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas, it is really a great upbeat song with a real mixture of Electric & Rock. As for the background music, Kiseijuu did an excellent job in bringing such music, the music fluidly mixed up with the story in a great way, it is really fit & fresh in brain. There is nothing to say for the voice actors, it just awesome.\\n\\n\r\nIn the character section, we have our main characters, the duo consist of Izumi Shinichi & the alien that live in his right arm named Migi. The character development centered in Izumi Shinichi, from the start of to the end, Shinichi\u2019s have various changes including his attitude & appearance. Just like other great characters , he developed from zero to hero. From a sniffing & coward boy, he grows into a more mature & reliable man. The development describe very well. While Migi, the parasite that live in Shinichi\u2019s hand have a meaningful role, a sense of friendship is also described between them as the story progress. While various villain with a different motive also did well in their roles.  The other supporting characters do their roles pretty well. It is really good indeed.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it\u2019s just another great series. It is fully recommended if you a fan of the individual elements that included in the story, and if you seek an anime with full of excitement, proper character development, & intense storyline then Parasite is your menu.",

            "content": "If Tokyo Ghoul is fast food then Parasyte is fine dining.\r\nStories that adhere to the \"invasion of humanity\" narrative is nothing groundbreaking by any means. It's been done many times over on the silver screen, from large-scale takeovers like 1978's Invasion of the Body Snatchers to more up close and personal ones like 2003's Dreamcatcher. The fear of an unknown sentient being that can challenge us intellectually is something that has always piqued the interest of moviegoers for decades. They're stories that could service a multitude of directions, and while not always intentional, they tend to bring up themes centered around the human condition andDarwinism. And for those that tackled these ideas on purpose, it has the benefit of becoming a decent popcorn flick or even better, an engrossing social commentary, depending on the pedigree of writing and how it's presented. Being thought-provoking, while at the same time entertaining for a broader viewing audience is no small feat to pull off. There's a balance that needs to be struck that may require compromise to avoid being too heady, but at the same time, having the know-all to make it intellectually stimulating. \\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Parasyte does just that. It draws you in with its uncanny imagery and copious amount of violence, all the while adhering to the underpinnings of subtextual content that peels back the layer to reveal something much more meaningful. Of course, like any show that grapples with these ideas, it had its fair share of issues as well, but as a whole, Parasyte was a title that manages to escape with only a few blemishes where others made in a similar fashion couldn't stick the landing. Today, we'll discuss its highlights and missteps, both great and small. \\n\\n\r\nTo avoid regurgitating info you could simply read in the synopsis, we'll dive right into discussing the focal points.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the implications of the story presented are universal, the manner that it chooses to take it on with is more of a personal one. Following the life of our protagonist, Shinichi, we see the conflict unfold through his eyes and the effects it had on his personal life. With this more intimate approach, we get to better understand the individual impact a shift in society's status quo could have on a micro-scale. All of a sudden, something other than humans had authoritarian control over Earth. It's a power struggle that's fully realized when accounting for the fact that not only could these invaders match our intellect but they are also physically stronger as well. Parasyte shows that the only thing separating us from being on the rear end of the hierarchical food chain is simply our ability to think beyond standard means of self-preservation. It's this innate understanding that gives stakes to this conflict, as we see our protagonist and most other people that encounter the invading parasitic entity, fail to properly combat against them on a one-on-one basis. While we do get a macro overview of the effects and how it manages to disrupt society, the story always kept its main focus on Shinichi's dilemma. \\n\\n\r\nThe brisk pacing really helped to sell the situation as well. Key events that would go on to shape our protagonist's ever-morphing psyche was given enough time to sink in but the show never forcefully came to a full stop just to let it be digested, which allowed the gravity of the circumstance to remain poignant while keeping the show in motion. Traumatic events were given their time and so we as an audience were allowed time to invest in the turmoil that came as a direct result. But what ultimately made these traumatic events work is that they occurred during moments where our protagonist wasn't given ample time to process it all. \\n\\n\r\nThis, fellow readers, is how you build proper suspense and anticipation. Something many titles have a hard time getting the formula right for. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, there were some issues, most of which were a result of retrofitting this 80s manga adaptation to fit a contemporary modern-day setting, while not accounting for the overexposure of current technology. The intention the creators had to modernize the material was understandable, however, the foresight to see the downside to doing that was a bit short of the mark. For example, there would be specific incidents that would go on unnoticed to society, despite the chances of them being recorded via cell phone or surveillance camera becoming a high probability, as the events themselves occurred in public settings. This also accounts for just how prolonged the time was that the parasites were able to stay in hiding in a digital age that spreads information like wildfire. The story isn't as plausible as it could have been had they kept it set in the time period it was written for. This isn't to discredit the show, as most viewers wouldn't even be bothered by it, but it's something that needs to be brought to light for those that do key in on the issue. \\n\\n\r\nThe constant comparisons between Tokyo Ghoul and Parayste are one that's warranted since they both made their anime debut around the same time period and approached similar constructed themes and setups. However, unlike Tokyo Ghoul, Parayste actually explores the societal implications of dealing with a foreign body in-depth. The parasites were used as allegorical proxies to many of the show's concepts and not just a reason to have excessive angst and shounen cock fights. Like I pointed out in my opening line, this is what separates the two and makes a clear divide between entertainment with substance and one that barely scraped by thematically. One provided proper social commentary, while the other simply had it as an idea for flavoring.\\n\\n\r\nBy finding a way to obtain equilibrium between thematic relevance and fun theatrics, Parasyte became one of those rare titles that could appeal to the majority, while also appeasing the interest of critics as well. This isn't to say that Parasyte dives as deeply as it could have with the topics it addresses but that it demonstrated foresight for the concepts that would usually manifest by default when dealing with these kinds of premises, to begin with. It's not a \"2deep4u\" title nor is it brain-dead one, it's a thoughtful action/thriller that knows just when to hit the right notes and when to let the content on screen do all the talking in its place. \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation weren't anything to jump out of your seat for but there was definitely a sense of quality control there. The character designs were fairly simple and help to give an idea of the character's traits before we even hear them talk. The biggest standout in the show was, of course, the fight scenes and the detailed anthropomorphic body imagery that both served to creep you out and draw on that obtuse fascination we all get for things unfamiliar to us. The color palette was eye-catching enough on a regular basis, occasionally switching to a more acid washed texture or murky-based one for whenever it tried to heighten the mood of key events (school hallway scene anyone?). While nothing that'll win any awards anytime soon, the art and animation did enough to stand on its own and that's all most viewers are concerned with anyways.\\n\\n\r\nNow where there will be a divide in viewers would be the music section.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte's music selection is a hit or miss depending on your personal preference. It's like if one of the producers snuck into their teenage kid's room and emulated the songs straight off of their playlist. \"This is what the kids are listening to these days\" seem to be the thought process they went with. If anything, it really helped to distinguish Parasyte from the rest of the crowd.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is very topical, largely composed of EDM (electronic dance music) tracks. The EDM tracks come in a few selection of different sub-genres that can range from techno, dubstep, drum 'n' bass, hardstyle, house, trap, downtempo, trance and every variant in between. Of course, that's not all it has, as there are a few new-school orchestric tracks and soft electronic piano ballads that are thrown in for good measure. But EDM is the dominating song choice, most noticeably dubstep for those unfamiliar with the sub-genres. Needless to say, if EDM is your cup of tea then you'll be in for a treat, but music is subjective and enjoyment will vary for each individual.\\n\r\nThe opening is a heavy hitting post-hardcore synth track reminiscent of bands like Pierce The Veil, The Fall of Troy and Sleeping with Sirens, if those bands were to ever go \"T-Pain\" on us, that is. It's a \"teen angst x 100\" kind of song that won't register with everyone, and like the EDM OST, it's a preferential thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound effects also deserve special mention, more specifically when parasites morph or move around. It adds to the overall creep factor the show is going for, sounding almost like a pliable substance; like playing with silly potty or deflating a balloon. It's hard to pinpoint the exact sound but it was certainly unique. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, the show was unapologetic about its sound selection and made a bold move in an industry where j-pop and j-rock are enough to get you by. It may not be up to snuff with people that don't care for the genre but it shouldn't be discredited because of that. It added variety to the monotonous sound expected from OSTs in the anime industry.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of characters was a mixed bag. On one hand, a few characters were wonderfully handled, showing layered characterization to their personality with flaws that made them relatable and easy to sympathize with, but on the other, we had characters that teeter on the border of 2-dimensional to becoming caricatures. You know it's bad when Migi, an apathetic parasitic hand, showed better characterization than that of some of the side characters. But that isn't to say it bombed in this department, as the few focused characters help to carry the show. Watching Shinichi slow metamorphosis and development as a person was well-handled from beginning to end. When a traumatizing event occurred, they aren't simply used for quick blips of shock factor but go on to further influence and add dimension to his personality. May that be a loss that triggers a lack of empathy or one that helps him rekindle it. Where some of the characters lapsed in proper portrayal, they more than made up with their interactions with each other, most notably, that of Shinichi and Migi, as well as the relationship he had with the show's main love interest, Satomi Murano.\\n\\n\r\nShinichi and Migi's relationship can be seen as the bridge between both species. They stand in the crossfire and both adapt and grow accustomed to each other, and because they were the focal point of the story, seeing their interaction and partnership flourish was a nice treat. But perhaps more surprising than that was just how well Shinichi and Satomi were handled together. The relationship between them was very organic, none of this \"omg a boob touched my shoulder, time to blush\" bullshit, but teenagers acting in mannerisms that anyone growing up can relate to. The back and forth spats between them can become tedious at times but to be fair, given the circumstances they're involved in, it was always understandable. The show's primary focus was never a romance but when it addressed it, it ended up outclassing some romance titles that only get to 1st base by its finale, which is something worth applauding the show for.\\n\\n\r\nAnother noteworthy character was Ryouko Tamiya but I'll keep details about her involvement to a minimum. She was a parasite that helped to further explore some of the show's themes and provided better insight into the turmoil at hand. Her involvement brought up very interesting questions and plays a huge role in providing another perspective to the story. \\n\\n\r\nWhile some characters fell short and others could have been cut out entirely, the cast as a whole was fine and served their purpose.\\n\\n\r\nWe can sit here crediting the thoughtful decisions the show made or criticizing the misguided ones all day but when it call boils down to the essentials, as a piece of entertainment, Parasyte was a show that constantly delivered. And after all, isn't that what we all came for? \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nParasyte was one of those titles that kept me hooked from beginning to end. It was action packed, had nice tension, great character dynamics and always left me wanting more. It made for great binge-watching material and certainly delivered in the entertainment department. While I didn't care much for the soundtrack and could do without the inclusion of certain plot details and characters, when it was all said and done, I enjoyed the 24-episode journey.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWhile many titles have tried this type of setup before, Parasyte stepped in to help set the benchmark for how to do it right. It balanced its themes well while still being entertaining, showing that it's possible to do both. It's a show that had a few missteps but never to the point of failure. It may not be for everyone but those generally fascinated with these kinds of \"man vs nature\" parables would probably enjoy what the show has to offer.",

            "content": "I remember hearing a lot of hype for Parasyte when it was first announced for an anime adaptation. Apparently, it was a really popular manga in the 90s about some kid who got his hand infected by an alien parasite \u2013 hence the name I suppose, although I\u2019m not sure why the \u201ci\u201d was changed into a \u201cy\u201d \u2013 and must now learn to live with it whilst warding off other similar infected people who had the misfortune of being killed by these beings before having their entire existence taken over. Seemed like good body horror stuff as is, but then came the influx ofpeople I knew who read the manga that declared it to be the second coming of Christ and my hype for it was decent whilst not being astounding because it was being done by a Madhouse team whose only credits were to their Marvel stuff and isn\u2019t that just another clue that they\u2019re not the powerhouse they used to be? Well it turns out that I was right to be cautious, because not only does Parasyte not live up to the hype, but it\u2019s knee-deep in pretty much everything I despise about Marvel stuff to boot.\\n\\n\r\nYou know your show with dick hands and uncensored decapitations has problems when I can think of five shows from Fall 2014 I\u2019d rather watch over it and one of them is from KyoAni. But before I get into thrashing this show, I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m glad Parasyte was made, if only because its popularity will hopefully lead to more classic manga getting adapted, thus lessening the huge surplus of LN adaptations we\u2019ve been getting as of late. In an age where self-awareness is replacing actual humor, we really do need more manga adaptations that take themselves seriously, and this along with Attack on Titan are prime candidates for ushering in that age. So thank you Parasyte for representing a spark the animation industry desperately needs now that Kickstarter has shat the bed, but that\u2019s not going to stop me from beating you to death with a croquet bat that has spikes nailed into it.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte, or Parasyte-the maxim if you want to be an asshole about it, is an adaptation of a 90s manga about a kid named Shinichi whose normal life is shattered when aliens land on his world and one of them infects his right hand in the process of trying to kill him, causing him to have a \u201cmature relationship\u201d with it, if you get what I mean. The story basically follows him and his desire to live a normal life whilst dealing with the changes going on in his life caused by his new situation like dating girls, helping his family, and fighting off others like him who had the misfortune of getting killed and controlled by their own infected diseases. I might as well be calling him Asian Peter due to how much he resembles Peter Parker from Spiderman in terms of situation and personality.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, many things about Parasyte are pretty much copied wholesale from Spiderman, like the alien infections, uninteresting supervillains, incompetent police force, large sections of the plot, and even the fact that the symbiotes\u2026er, I mean parasytes are weak to fire. The only thing it didn\u2019t rip off was everything that made Spiderman fun like the web swinging. How cool would it have been for Asian Peter to use his right hand to swing across buildings whilst wise-cracking like a\u2026um, actually if it means less snarky remarks, I think I\u2019ll accept that sacrifice whilst still snarling at the twenty other things you could have included. Because as emo as Peter got at times, at least he traded in the angst for some f*cking awesome dance moves.\\n\\n\r\nAsian Peter on the other hand can\u2019t even do awesome fight moves. For something that\u2019s supposed to be one of the major draws of the show, why does every single fight scene look like it was choreographed by Yuen-Woo Ping on the set of Cradle 2 the Grave? Whenever an action scene occurred, it would always consist of boring blade spam or five minutes of Asian Peter conversing with his hand followed by five seconds of actual action at best and two seconds of embarrassment that would make Kill la Kill laugh out loud at worst, which isn\u2019t exciting in the least. It also doesn\u2019t help that the music in this show is so f*cking mismatched to what\u2019s going on that the supposed horror vibe this show coasts on is about as existent as an American-made Silent Hill game with a heavy metal soundtrack. For all that work put into having the violence uncensored and having good animation, you sure didn\u2019t do a good job of putting some actual flair on-screen, did you Marvel director? Although considering your credits and the state of the action we get in those films, it\u2019s kind of apropos.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the biggest flaw that Parasyte - along with said Marvel films \u2013 has is that it doesn\u2019t seem to have a story at all, always heading in one direction before bailing halfway through to focus on another in a round robin that would make Spiderman 3 confused. We start off with Asian Peter basically imitating what makes Spiderman great by getting going through puberty whilst dealing with the consequences of his new-found powers, so I figured that Parasyte was going to be a coming-of-age story. But after he gets turned into a superhuman, that story is put to the side to have him turn into a monster and deal with a love triangle between Asian Mary Jane and Asian Gwen Stacy that ends with the latter\u2019s tragic death to showcase his change. So Parasyte is a story about how having powers turns you into a jerk that will hurt your loved ones?\\n\\n\r\nNope. After said tragedy, Asian Peter suddenly stops acting like a monster and instead angsts about how he can\u2019t protect anyone whilst other humans start getting involved, culminating in a sort-of-sympathetic character getting killed off in order to teach us about discrimination and how there are good people amongst the parasites just as there are bad people amongst the humans and thus they\u2019re no different from each other when you get down to it. So your story is about how overcoming discrimination is hard, especially when you factor in the different natures of humans and non-humans, but it\u2019s not impossible? Wrong! The real story is that \u201chumanity is a flawed species who will always fight for themselves at the end of the day\u201d. And even that\u2019s mishandled badly, as leaving aside that they showcase this fact by having a bunch of stupid soldiers shoot up a building, culminating in Asian Peter killing off a super-strong experimental parasyte that\u2019s basically the love child of Doc Ock and Venom in order to prevent more deaths, it tries to compromise by delivering the same environmental stuff that made Princess Mononoke so good. Y\u2019know, how humans and animals are just fighting for themselves and the only reason they protect the environment at the end of the day is because they\u2019ll die if they don\u2019t?\\n\\n\r\nBut it completely falls flat because it can\u2019t seem to make up its mind regarding whether parasytes should be compared more to humans or lions, and it fails at providing a strong case for either side. The show makes a big point about how parasytes were sent to Earth in order to cleanse humanity for its crimes, so if they are comparable to humans, it\u2019d be one of those PETA nuts channeling Jeffrey Dahmer. And if they\u2019re supposed to be compared to lions, that fails too because last I checked, lions can\u2019t blend in with humans much less eat at Burger King without having eyes and shotguns pointed in its direction. Not to mention, if lions really are living amongst us, killing people in secret like the parasytes have done, I say we make those motherf*ckers extinct.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte\u2019s core message regarding humanity and its relationship with the world is a good idea on paper, but the way it comments on it really leaves a lot to be desired. If the show had focused on centering Asian Peter and his right hand as an ironic victim akin to the protagonist in District 9 or as the failed mediator between two species akin to Caesar in the Planet of the Apes reboot, this might have worked. But instead, it meanders with repetitive philosophy that anyone out of middle school would know, can\u2019t make up its mind regarding whether Asian Peter is growing and how he\u2019s growing, indulges in really shitty shonen action cliches, and it doesn\u2019t help that the ending doesn\u2019t make any goddamn sense. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people talk up how perfect it is, but all it did was have Asian Symbiote-less Carnage kidnapping Asian Mary Jane in order to confirm what we already knew, which is about as mundane an ending as you can possibly get in a philosophical narrative.\\n\\n\r\nAm I being too hard on an anime whose source material dates back to before the environmental trend was really a thing? Maybe, but that didn\u2019t stop the original Persona game from getting thrashed when it got re-released, so why shouldn\u2019t I criticize Parasyte for basically arriving way too late to have any impact on me? Plus, if it was really as good as people said, time would be kinder to it than this. But that\u2019s irrelevant, because I\u2019m judging the anime on its own. And on its own, Parasyte is just not a good show. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say it\u2019s a bad one, but I can\u2019t really say I\u2019ll be watching it again anytime soon.",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)\r\nWhat's the first image that comes to mind when you hear the word \"animal?\" Is it a lion roaming the plains of Africa? Perhaps it's a shark swimming menacingly throughout the deep, dark ocean? Or maybe it's even a cardinal resting on a tree branch, contrasting starkly with a snow-laden field? Whatever the answer may be, something people often forget is that they, too, are an animal. And not just in the definition of the word; our actions can sometimes be rather animalistic in nature. Which leads to an even better question: are we really so different fromthe species around us? This is the philosophical inquiry Parasyte -- The Maxim brings forth. But sadly, it falters quite tremendously.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nParasyte (what it will be called from here on out) focuses on Shinichi Izumi, a normal high-school boy. One day, a parasite of unknown origin enters his body, creating quite the unorthodox, symbiotic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nStarting off with what Parasyte does right, the first third or so of the anime focuses on Shinichi and him getting accustomed with Migi -- the name of the parasite that now hosts his right hand -- and building the world's components. This includes a multitude of things: introducing important cast members (for future events and developments), demonstrating Shinichi's mentality (his complete refusal of the parasites), and showcasing the aliens' habits (how they eat, blend in with the environment, etc.). There's nothing really wrong with this section of the show; it sets itself up nicely for tackling whatever events it will inevitably generate. And it all culminates in Shinichi's near death at the hands of his \"parent.\"\\n\\n\r\nBut that is where it begins to crumble.\\n\\n\r\nLike Shinichi's mommy, the show dies, with its figurative head being separated from the rest of its body. It's at this point that the anime begins to become this weird amalgamation of plot contrivances, aggressive violence, and weak writing that prevent the show from keeping everything connected. Beginning at the top of the list, many of the happenings within the anime are quite nonsensical and are borderline unfair within such a \"realistic\" world. Some easy examples include: Yuuko's awkward encounter with the student parasite, Reiko allowing the private investigator to walk away, how Gotou was created, allowing Uragami the known serial killer be without handcuffs, watching Goutou literally leaving after his first showing of power, Shinichi miraculously being fast enough to get even remotely close enough to stab Gotou, Migi breaking the genetic barrier, and the Darwinian evolution of the parasites over the course of a year. There are many \"convenient\" situations that hold no justification for what ultimately occurs, deterring from the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nSay someone were to ignore a good chunk of these; that's a plausibility, and may even be warranted for the show to get to the \"meat\" of what it is attempting to convey. However, moving down the list, the show continues to trip up. Blood and gore is a staple of this show, without a doubt. People are regularly cut up, severed, or otherwise stabbed, with no part of the body being left unscathed. But while the first third used such atrocities as more of a plot point -- such as with \"A\" or with Shinichi's \"heart attack\" -- the rest of the show tends to use them more for entertainment as opposed to using them for a singular purpose. The fights become more grotesque and involved the further along the series progresses, wanting to impress the audience rather than having them be the least bit meaningful.\\n\\n\r\nThis is because the actual writing within the anime gravitates towards vagueness. Once again, barring any mention of the quite egregious and amazingly annoying \"Are you really Shinichi?\" spouted by Murano (even right up until the very end), the show tries extremely hard to be intelligent. It throws around many ideas about life and the way people live it, but never truly expounds upon them. Such topics include: over-population, the application of altruism, and the necessity for various species to coexist. Very biological, and quite the interesting themes at play. Yet Parasyte never delves into any of them seriously. There might be a smart-sounding lecture or a few sentences of insight here and there, but it refuses to take what it says beyond a precursory glance. That is, it constantly flits back and forth between each of the subjects it raises in an attempt to be more resounding. Instead, the whole package comes off as too ostentatious.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nThe art style for Parasyte tends to stick to its aforementioned, \"realistic\" roots. The show mostly contains houses, cities, and forests for the backdrops, relying more on keeping things simple as opposed to making them snazzy. They serve their purpose of providing the characters with a setting to play in but are largely unimpressive to look at.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs, likewise, maintain the already-established sense of realism that permeates the show. Shinichi undergoes a nice range of appearances and outfits and Reiko treads the fine line between human and parasite perfectly. The rest of the parasites, be it Goutou or some random, expendable character, are also given a good amount of detail while in their \"monster\" forms, giving them a good sense of not only looking alien, but feeling alien, too. And in Goutou's case, very intimidating.\\n\\n\r\nThe actual animation for the show is usually above average in whatever it sets out to do. Some examples include detailed facial expressions or Migi's \"normal\" actions. And from parasite fights to Shinichi running and jumping in a literal, inhuman way, the anime consistently demonstrates its capability to keep up movement at all times.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThere are really only four characters of importance to focus on: Murano, Migi, Reiko, and Shinichi.\\n\\n\r\nStarting with possibly one of the worst characters to have graced this medium, is Murano. As the love interest and purportedly the person who understands Shinichi the most, she somehow cannot. While watching the show, her grating behavior around him became increasingly agitating, to the point that the show seemed to pretty much ignore her in order to prevent her from negatively impacting it further. But when she did manage to sneak back in, she received one of two treatments: the exact same confusion or some of the most inane interactions. Sometimes, it even combined both tactics to form a behemoth of stupidity. The park scene first comes to mind, where she stumbles oddly into the scenario without contributing anything (not before being visited by the naked ghost of Kana); she discusses Shinichi's involvement with the police chief in this weirdly passionate plea; the sex scene she has with Shinichi holds no value since her relationship with him has been grossly neglected; and her final speech about how \"human\" some people can be is merely a vain attempt to make her seem thematically relevant. The level of attention she receives and her overall involvement is too much to be tossed aside. She is a laughably terrible character, with her inclusion in the anime being nothing more than a detriment.\\n\\n\r\nAnything's better than Murano within Parasyte. So what better than to jump to an intellectual, rational, and foreign life form? Migi is Shinichi's literal right-hand man...or at least, right-hand friend. While he is viewed mostly as Shinichi's guardian angel (having descended \"from the heavens\"), he serves a greater role within the anime. And that is both contrasting and synchronizing with his host in a fluctuating manner. In the beginning, Shinichi's stance on Migi's kind causes Migi to appear cold where he is being logical. Halfway through, he starts to become more \"friendly\" due to their similar structure. And by the end, he sits somewhere in between, wanting both to better himself and give his best buddy the kind of life -- the human life -- that he deserves. Migi doesn't particularly grow as a character, despite his ever changing forms, until the near-conclusion; in which another plot contrivance gives him the potential for it. As such, while he acts as Shinichi's barometer, he fails to do anything more than hold his best friend's hand from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the hero, Shinichi shows the first signs of life among the cast. It's almost impossible to describe him, because he sees such large swings in his personality and demeanor throughout the entire anime. He begins quite timid and fearful of the monsters that now surround him, wanting nothing more than to eradicate their evil existence. But upon gaining a mixed mindset, he becomes almost indifferent, remaining unnervingly calm during nearly every situation he tackles. This cannot be overstated enough: he makes a complete about-face from his previous, impulsive-based self. And this side of him is no better either, for where he alienated the parasites before, he now begins alienating the humans he's always defended. Thus, the remainder of his character's focus is in striking a balance, in finding that sweet spot between humans and parasites. For the most part, he does reach it; through Reiko's compassion, Goutou's anger, and Migi's understanding -- each of whom are purposefully the most important of the invaders -- Shinichi learns to accept those around him, from the smallest ant to the largest elephant, while simultaneously knowing that humans are not the most infallible creatures on the planet.\\n\\n\r\nThe most intriguing character from Parasyte, and coincidentally the strongest, is Reiko. She's the most interesting not so much by how she is able to survive so naturally within the world of the humans, but why she is able to do so. And that's because, despite her instinctual habits, she tries to comprehend the world around her. She takes the time to investigate DNA transfer, social cues, and relevant information. She isn't afraid to be a mother in every sense of the word. And most of all, she respects both sides of the ecosystem, placing neither the humans nor the parasites above one another, seeing the value in a purely platonic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings about what the characters were attempting to portray. Despite how poor many of them are, they are connected by a \"string of fate:\" the different \"aspects\" to being human. Murano is afraid of the unknown; Migi is merely tolerant of those around him; Shinichi is trying to cope with his place on Earth; and Reiko loves life for what it is. And this can be applied to many of the other characters still -- Goutou demonstrates anger, Uragami symbolizes depravity, etc. -- to give the nicely executed message: humanity isn't just some simple creature. We're a complex system of feelings, emotions, and ideas that is almost impossible to capture in a solitary way. We do mess up but we also perform feats of extraordinary proportion. And while we may be intricate, funny, weird, amazing, or downright deplorable at times, there is no mistaking that humans, people, are an ever-growing, never-boring species of unbelievable value.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe OP's not only wicked, but fun to listen to. It's a catchy piece, with the auto-tuned singer working well with the tapping drags, throat singing, and rocking guitar. The track is metal, mixed with \"higher\" singing at times, but ends as hardcore as it can get. It captures the feeling of the show nicely, and is a good song overall.\\n\\n\r\nWhether the ED is better than its OP counterpart is a tough call. It contrasts with the opening as heavily as it can, especially when listened to one after the other. The slow singing and beautiful piano work in harmony, calming the senses and bringing about a good sense of hope. By the halfway point, the background chorus joins in and the piece heads towards the end with rather catchy lyrics. It concludes on a happy-yet-sad note, the same kind of feeling one has after listening to it.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is a mixed bag of good and experimental tracks. It can fit the mood when utilizing the somewhat singsong, ambient instruments, but can be wholly distracting when some out-of-place dubstep kicks in. The tracks are more suited to being listened to solely within the anime and not outside of it, unlike the OP and ED that surrounds it.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, voice-acting sees above-average work for most of the cast. Special shout-outs to Nobunaga Shimizaki as Shinichi with his various range of emotions and Aya Mirano as the voice of Migi, alongside Rinka as the beat-boxing sound effects for him, with their combined efforts providing a unique set sounds that only an alien could make.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this one, I never really liked any of the fighting or the drama that was taking place. It could be cool at times, but it was never much of a contest -- for either the humans or parasites -- unless Shinichi was involved in the ordeal. And my emotions never left anywhere past leveled: I wasn't laughing, distressed, or moved by anything that this show was serving.\\n\\n\r\nI would have enjoyed it more had it not devolved into mindless violence and instead stuck with what the first third or so built so nicely. The only section of the show I particularly found more \"enthralling\" was Kana's arc, if only because it was rather hysterical in the absurdity and silliness of it all. Otherwise, I wasn't looking forward to what the anime had to offer on a weekly basis and was along just to see how it'd all turn out.\\n\\n\r\nAnd on that note, Parasyte -- The Maxim ends in a rather unfortunate way. With a strong start but a lackluster majority, the nice music tracks are not enough to save the weak narrative and hodgepodge cast. And while the anime implores us to have a loving relationship with the world around us, the same can't be said for this one.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, good first third, but the rest is mired in contrivances, coarse violence, and unfocused themes\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, okay art style, good character designs, above-average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Murano is awful, Migi is okay, Shinichi and Reiko are good, with everyone connected by humanity\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, good OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above-average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, okay fight scenes here and there, not very emotional, sometimes silly\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

            "content": "As someone who is very intrigued by human-monster stories, parasyte caught my attention immediately as soon as I heard of its existence. With the 1989 manga being a highly praised classic, it\u2019s no wonder the community was excited to see how this adaptation will unfold. Landing in the hands of the illustrious studio madhouse and receiving two cours worth of content, parasyte looked in very good hands. There is no other studio that can capture a gritty sensation full of tension as well as madhouse as they have proved they can create works of that calibre with Monster and Kaiji being the two best examples.And for the most part it certainly delivered on the promised hype. Instead of opting to focus on one or two specific elements parasyte wanted to be a jack of all trades with high stakes action, intellectually stimulating themes, a dash of psychological elements and even some romance. Its balance between so many tones provided the show with something for everyone to enjoy and is one of the core reasons why it exploded with popularity when it aired back in 2014. Though it is without a doubt unquestionable that the anime did have some very obvious defects along the way that detracted from it reaching greater heights despite doing a moderately good job juggling so many balls. \\n\\n\r\nThe first ball is the action and I would say is the dominant one. Before it\u2019s a romance, or a psychological show, parasyte is a high-intensity action thriller. Most of its plot is driven primarily through its action sequences. The action scenes on their own are breathtaking. Throughout its entire run parasyte\u2019s animation was fairly consistent and that kept the action from falling into mediocrity in the latter half, something that happens to a lot of shows in their 2nd half. Along with the animation, parasyte was heightened by its thrilling EDM OST. It\u2019s quite rare to see an anime in this era with an OST of this nature, and I am not personally a fan of the music but parasyte nailed its use completely. Before action sequences were about to begin, the show opted to use more mysterious and slower paced soundtracks to build up the tension and heighten the level of danger. Once the action scenes themselves initiated, the soundtrack switched to a more fast-paced beat to capture the feeling of intensity that comes with parasyte\u2019s action. Packaged in a great exterior by the animation and OST, the action scenes were further enhanced by the high stakes that came with them. There was no room for error, no room for breathing. With every mistake Shinichi made, he got punished for it, and even making one mistake in a deadlock battle with his enemies could have been the end for him. With every grating strike; the stakes only increased, and this is what ultimately makes parasyte\u2019s action scenes great to sit through. When shit hit the fan; the adrenaline and tension were unreal.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ball is the character relationships. This wasn\u2019t handled rather too well, with the cast being hit or miss as a whole. What was the highlight of this section is the dynamic relationship between Shinichi and Migi. Having completely different morals and ways of living that were consistently clashing is what made them such a joy to watch. Their character interactions were meaningful to the story, engaging and throughout the show they both grew as characters by understanding each other\u2019s viewpoints. Furthermore, as individual characters their character progression was interesting, instead of progressing in a cookie-cutter manner, Shinichi and Migi slowly started to develop traits that were present in the opposites personality, with Shinichi becoming more like a parasite and Migi showing more human traits as the story moved along. Migi\u2019s growth came as a result of furthering his understanding of human society and the social norms that comes with them. Shinichi\u2019s case is unfortunately not as natural but nevertheless it was still engaging to watch his character progression as the plot unfolded. Both of the Main characters beliefs were challenged as the series progresses, but their ideals are never truly changed. This action plays positively into parasyte\u2019s hands as it highlights one of the shows biggest messages; to never try and understand the mindset of a different species from your own, as it\u2019s impossible to judge them using your own species standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe third ball is the romantic relationship between the two female leads. This is by far the weakest section of the show. Kanna and Murano were both very weak as characters and i would go as far as to call them useless. Their contribution to the story can be summed up in two lines. \u201cARE YOU REALLY SHINICHI-KUN?\u201d and, \u201cSHINICHI YOU ARE THE ONE\u201d. Yes. That\u2019s it. Murano is a classic anime plot device that only exists to forcefully let the audience know that Shinichi is not the person he once was like a propaganda tower preaching some third-rate ideology. Additionally, she was always a damsel in distress. She found herself on more occasions that one in sticky situations so Shinichi can have a girl to save. Other than that, she was only there to comfort Shinichi. Realistically speaking their romantic relationship makes sense as they knew each other for a long time, but the role that Murano plays in the story is stupid and trite. On the other hand, Kanna was completely retarded. Having being introduced quite early on in the story Kanna fell in love with Shinichi only a few episodes after they met and it was for the most stupid reason you could imagine; because she could sense his presence using some stupid unexplained sensing technique where she can feel a parasyte\u2019s aura if one was nearby. First of all, why does that sensing technique exist? Second of all, why was she attracted to him for such a petty reason? And last but not least, which human being is stupid enough to risk their life to meet someone even after being warned? Serving zero purpose to the overall plot and proving to be more retarded than a 5-year old, Kanna only existed in the show to once again ham-fist us the point that Shinichi is not the same he once was. \\n\\n\r\nThe fourth and final ball parasyte tried to juggle was tackling a wide range of themes including identity, ecology, human nature and more all mixed into its story and characters. I will refrain from talking about its themes too much as it will get into spoiler territory, but the hot topic that was present from the very start and is the essence of parasyte is a study of ecology. Primarily about how different species interact with one another, both physically and mentally. Throughout its entire run, parasyte raises questions about whether different species should attempt to understand each other, the purpose of a species existence, the fundamental reasons on why a species behaves the way in which they do. Parasyte is filled with interesting ideas and concepts not present in many anime from this decade. Some of the themes explored are disconnected from each other, but that doesn\u2019t stop parasyte from being an intellectually energizing work that will certainly leave an impression. \\n\r\nThe character who drove the ecological developments of the show forward was Tamura Reiko. Her role in the story proved to be one of the most important as she was the main focal point for Parasyte\u2019s themes. Her character progression was joyful to watch as she questioned the reason for her species existence as well as trying to empathize with human behaviour, particularly the significance of the maternal bond in later episodes. Identity was also explored through Tamura\u2019s significance to the story. But not an identity crisis in the same sense as Shinichi, but rather the identity of an entire species as she searched for a reason that validated her breed's existence.\\n\\n\r\nAnother notable character is the main antagonist of the show; Goto. While not as interesting as Tamura Reiko Goto still has a role to play, and that is being a representation of the untainted beauty of nature. He in himself is an illustration of a wild animal simply on the hunt and following his instincts. Not influenced by outside sources or societal constructs. In a way, Goto is also an answer to one of Parasyte\u2019s biggest questions; what are the parasites? Goto shows that no matter how strong a creature may appear on the exterior, internally they are just another life-form frightened by the mere fact of losing their life. \\n\\n\r\nThe anime preferred to only touch upon these themes rather than viewing them as a whole under the magnifying glass and can at times be a little forced due to the over dramatic nature of its cast, but what was impressive is that parasyte wasn\u2019t sugar-coating its ideas or being idealistic in its thematic approach. It presented its themes through an unbiased lens, showing the darker sides to humanity when it could have easily played them out to be the heroes, and giving the audience an understanding of the parasite\u2019s actions while it could have easily played them out to be the villains. It\u2019s an accurate representation of the law of nature and the ecosystem that governs all the species that live on planet Earth, all while mixing in fast-paced action sequences. It is plagued by obvious drawbacks but it achieves a good balance between popcorn entertainment and insightful commentary on the nature of humanity and ecology as a whole. It could have very easily crumbled under the pressure of mixing so many elements at once or being too overly-ambitious in its thematic approach and as a result coming off as convoluted or over-bloated with unnecessary dialogue. But the show kept its composure and is all around a nice piece of work.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the technical side of things goes, Parasyte was solid for the most part.The show could have benefitted from a grittier art style to match the sense of unease that the show was going for, but nonetheless the artwork and art style were nothing to write home about but worked well enough for its contemporary setting with both the character designs and backgrounds satisfactory. The animation during the action sequences was also quite fluid with only a few noticeable derps. However the show is bogged down visually with some immersion-breaking CGI on background characters multiple times. \\n\r\nThere are also a few problems present in the plot that do make it a little difficult to take Parasyte a little seriously. Most of these problems do arise because the director is tasked with trying to adapt material that is set in a different time period. Keep in mind that this manga began serialization in 1989. As a result of the director\u2019s poor translation of the material into a modern setting, the writing did come off as stupid at some points in the show. Another setback were some contrivances in the final two episodes which influenced the outcomes of the Shinichi vs Goto fight and the ending of the series which made it feel rather cheesy, a bit of a blunder for a show that was asking its audience to take the ride seriously.\\n\\n\r\nBut ultimately those drawbacks didn\u2019t matter too much to what the show conveyed and achieved. Whether you are a diehard anime fan, a casual, a pleb, a critic, an elitist, a cat or a dog. It\u2019s an anime i encourage everyone to try as it\u2019s one of the only recent anime that is capable of providing something for everyone to enjoy. Romance, action, commentary, social criticisms and a grim reminder of what it feels like to not be on top of the food chain. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "With a show like this, it's easy to see how much time and care has gone into making it succeed. Kiseijuu has so many genres and elements to it, however rather than it becoming a huge mess, it executes every single one perfectly. \r\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu is about Parasytes that have invaded earth, whose main priority is to take over human bodies and use them as hosts, controlling their body and minds. Parasytes are fierce creatures who kill and feed on humans. The MC is a teenage boy name Shinichi whom one night is invading by a parasyte, but this attack somewhat fails asthe parasyte named Migi, takes over his right hand rather than his consciousness. Thus allowing Shinichi to keep his humanity. They must work together to protect Shinichi's loved ones, and ultimately survive themselves against other parasytes.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation factor of Kiseijuu was done well throughout the 24 episodes. It did however vary between scenes, which by no means is due to lazy animators or time related issues, but rather is done to enhance the mood. For example, battle scenes as apposed to ordinary scenes simply had differences between them. Backgrounds and scenery had quite an amount of detail, and character designs hit the mark throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are extremely well developed. \\n\r\nThe companionship shown between Shinichi and Migi is fascinating in a way. They are both dependent on each other to survive. In the beginning it shows how they simply want to be free of each other, but their bond is so natural that it is difficult to pinpoint when the label of an annoyance is replaced by friendship. The background and emotional attachment each character has was done exceptionally well. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of Kiseijuu is quite possibly one of my favorites. There is a lot of diversity in this department, ranging everywhere from dub-step to instrumental. The OP and ED's suited the show perfectly. I usually have a habit of skipping the Openings with 99% of shows that i watch, however every episode i found myself pleasantly enjoying it. I couldn't find anything in this department of the show to fault. I was surprised with how honest the voice acting was. Not only the main characters, but the supporting were so convincing. It truly seems as though the creators designed the characters to suit the voice actors, not vise versa.\\n\\n\r\nPrior to starting Kiseijuu, I had a preconceived idea of what it would entitle. A somewhat childish concept became a true work of art. It has been a pleasure finishing this anime for the past 24 weeks. It has the ability to appeal to such a wide audience. Whatever genre you prefer, i would advice you give this show a try as it has all the elements of a masterpiece.",

Each of us have a bit of both in us, and it's up to you which one you want to be.\r\nParasyte The Maxim runs along many similar themes of many species-war animes, but it stands out from other man-eating titles because of its excellent discourse and exploration on the role, purpose and meaning of humanity, in light of our world and environment. Parasyte boasts a dramatic, thrilling and gripping plot, revolving around a solid male lead and the people around him, but in the end suffers from an entire host of underdeveloped supporting characters.\r\nTL;DR\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nArt: 7/10\r\nSound: 5/10\r\nCharacter:6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10 (rounded up from 7.5)\\n\\n\r\nGood points:\\n\r\n+ Great main male lead character\\n\r\n+ Gripping and interesting plot\\n\r\n+ Meaningful plot twists along the way\\n\r\n+ Lengthy and deep thematic discourse\\n\r\n+ Great action and fighting scenes\\n\r\n+ Great drama, tension and emotion\\n\\n\r\nBad points:\\n\r\n- Many underdeveloped supporting characters\\n\r\n- Not very outstanding OP or ED\\n\r\n- Shallow characterization of main antagonist\\n\r\n- Some plot holes that the anime itself acknowledges\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is very well divided into 8 different story arcs, most of them revolving around certain characters in the anime. They are, in order: Introductory Migi Arc, Mother Arc, Hideo Arc, Kana Arc, Tamura Reiko Arc, Extermination Arc and the Gotou Arc, followed by a 1-episode epilogue. I will go through each of the arcs in order.\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off by laying down its foundations, first introducing our main character Izumi, who immediately gets attacked by a parasite which burrows into his right arm, which he later names Migi. For the entirety of the first arc, Migi takes on more of the role of a narrator and does a lot of explanation for the audience as to how parasites function, kill, communicate, survive and also their general abilities. Parasites are characterized as completely rational organisms with no sense of emotion whatsoever, seeking only self-preservation. (+1 for general believable assumptions)\\n\\n\r\nIzumi constantly finds himself in increasing danger of getting killed by other parasites, while Migi continues to protect him each time, saying that his host must survive to ensure his own survival. They encounter other parasites of increasing power throughout the anime, but things start to get interesting when they encounter Tamiya Ryoko, a parasite whose aim is to blend into human society and study them. (+1 for plot depth)\\n\\n\r\nEverything seems fine until we hit the Mother Arc, where Izumi's mother has been taken over by a wandering parasite in need of a female host. Izumi's father barely survives and makes it to a nearby hospital. Back at the house, Izumi goes into denial mode as he encounters his mother who has obviously turned into a parasite. Unable to attack his own mother, Izumi gets stabbed in the heart, after which Migi must perform a heart reconstructive surgery on the spot to revive his beating heart.\\n\\n\r\nA newly revived and powered-up Izumi now reawakens and vows to protect his father from his parasite-infested mother. Along the way, he encounters Uda, who is the only other character mentioned in the entire anime who is also half-parasite half-human. They end up working together to defeat his parasite mother, now with the new superhuman speed, senses and strength that Izumi has acquired from having Migi's parasite cells mixed into him.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we get to the Hideo Arc, where Hideo, a parasite, was initially sent to Izumi's school to keep tabs on him. This eventually spirals into chaos when a student, Yuko, finds out Hideo's identity and forces him to kill her. Yuko manages to get away by splashing harmful chemicals on Hideo and causing him to go on a killing rampage around the school. Izumi is then forced to first rescue his girlfriend Murano, who is at this point terrified, and also defeat Hideo. (+1 for gripping plot)\\n\\n\r\nWe are then introduced to Kana, who is a female student with the innate ability to sense the wavelengths emitted by parasites. In the Kana Arc, she obsesses over Izumi, thinking that this ability to sense him means that they are fated to be together. However, Izumi quickly realizes that her ability only sense parasites, and that she could be in danger if she keeps getting into close proximity with parasites. Kana eventually dies by her own fault and Izumi in his rage, kills the parasite that killed her.\\n\\n\r\nThen, we move onto the Tamura Reiko arc, which is probably the most interesting arc of the lot. Tamiya Ryoko has since changed her name to Tamura Reiko after leaving Izumi's school, and this time she hires a private investigator, Kuramori, to keep tabs on Izumi. Izumi realizes this and confronts Kuramori who is told the truth behind Reiko's identity. Kuramori, crazed over the mystery, then kidnaps Reiko's human baby and faces off with her at a park.\\n\\n\r\nReiko, faced with the possible death of her own human baby, stabs Kuramori and retrieves her own baby, showing some form of human emotion that she herself didn't think was possible. (+1 for interest) Later on, Reiko gives her life up to protect the baby and doesn't even retaliate against the police who were shooting at her. Izumi, touched by this act of human kindness, then sheds tears for the first time in a long while.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing this incident, a task force is set up to eliminate a group of parasites led by Hirokawa found to be operating within a particular building, and we are thrown into a rather bloody Extermination Arc. Here, we are introduced to essentially the polar opposite of Tamura Reiko, Uragami, who is basically a serial killer who has killed so many people that he can differentiate humans from parasites easily, just by looking at them. While Reiko was the monster being human, Uragami is the human being a monster. (+1 for complexity in plot development)\\n\\n\r\nThe task force makes all the humans go through a scanning system to tell apart the parasites from the humans, then using shotgun rounds to blow apart the confirmed parasites. Things go rather well until the parasites try to counter attack, leading to some collateral damage in terms of civilian life whilst the remaining two fugitives Hirokawa and Gotou hide in the upper floors of the building. The anime at this point starts to question whether it is right to sacrifice lives in order to save others, amidst claims by the task force that such damage was \"necessary\" to weed out the parasites.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, in the upper floors, Gotou manages to single-handedly take down an entire squad and escapes, whilst Hirokawa is surrounded by a SWAT team. Hirokawa attempts to save his life by talking about saving the environment by reducing human numbers, but is immediately shot dead. Then, there is a big reveal that Hirokawa was in fact a human working amongst parasites whom he knew were parasites, but believed in their cause in order to maintain \"balance in the ecosystem\" by reducing the human population, seen as a \"poison\" on the earth. (+1 for plot twist)\\n\\n\r\nFinally we move onto the last and final arc, the Gotou Arc, where it's basically Izumi and Migi facing off against Gotou, the enemy whom Reiko earlier said was invincible because he was basically 5 parasites merged into one, giving him immense power and strength. Over the course of the extended battle though, we see Izumi basically resorting to every high-risk maneuver possible to try and defeat Gotou, all of which somehow manage to work. Eventually, they defeat Gotou but are left questioning themselves whether they should finish him off.\\n\\n\r\nMigi, whom at this point has acquired some \"human emotions\", decides that he doesn't want to kill his own kind, whilst Izumi also would rather let fate decide whether Gotou lives, despite the numbers of people that Gotou has killed. (+1 for plot depth) In the end, self-preservation and conservation of human life prevails and they finish off Gotou. (+1 for logical sense)\\n\\n\r\nIn the epilogue that follows, we fast forward many months after all that has happened and Murano and Izumi are back together again. Uragami, the serial killer who has escaped in the earlier extermination arc, comes back to kidnap Murano and then questions Izumi one last time about who exactly is the human and who is the monster in the world they are living in. Izumi ultimately manages to defeat him and save Murano at the same time, thanks to Migi's help.\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot holes, there were a total of 9 that I found, some of them being quite major, so I can't give any bonus points for that.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 7, Uda's story of becoming half-parasite is pretty amusing, save for one small problem that if Uda really fell down the cliff into the water, his body wouldn't sink as quickly as it showed in the anime. In fact, his body should in fact immediately float up within 2 seconds of hitting the water surface, and Uda should not be in any immediate danger of drowning. You could basically see that in the area where Uda was going to jump, the water was deep enough so he wouldn't die from impact on the rocks either. Also, this proves that Uda actually chose a really stupid place to commit suicide that would never have succeeded as well.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 9, Yuko decides to \"talk to Shimada first\" after having 2 first-hand encounters of his face-changing. Even if Yuko was lovestruck before, after these 2 encounters she should definitely be afraid of Shimada Hideo and would consider him a danger especially after hearing from her brother. It makes absolutely no sense for Yuko to talk to Shimada Hideo first \"just in case\" he's not dangerous. This is clearly a case of a character acting unnaturally in order to create drama in the plot.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, two of the rugby students, who had just seen Yuko fall from the top floor of a building, did not even mention this happening to a teacher passing by, and they only chose to tell him about \"something\" in the Fine Arts room. In fact, if they've just seen a girl fall from so many storeys, the should be panicking and at least hurrying to the Fine Arts room to find out what happened, but instead they are pictured calmly walking through the halls. Also, the rugby students say nothing about the severity of the situation. \\n\\n\r\nThe teacher also is too accepting of the vague report that \"something\" is in the Fine Arts room, and he fails to ask further about what this \"something\" is, or looks like. Perhaps, it's so common in Japan to have students climbing and falling out of the windows of school buildings that people are already desensitized? Give me a break.\\n\\n\r\nIn episode 20, Hirokawa says, \"How dare you point your guns at civilians?\" But the soldiers around him are clearly holding their guns at high port arms, hence none of the guns are pointing at anybody.\\n\\n\r\nLater on, two soldiers see a bunch of obviously-too-calm humans walking away amidst the chaos, and decide to let them go? Aren't they on like strict orders to shoot anyone who might seem suspicious on sight, or at least stop them? If this was supposed to be an extermination, these soldiers really aren't doing their jobs at all.\\n\\n\r\nHalfway through the extermination, the corridors suddenly goes dark in the building they are in. Did all the lights suddenly get turned off in this building for no good reason, or was there a blackout that the audience is supposed to have presumed happened? If anything, during an extermination these lights should all be manually turned out for better targeted acquisition and shooting accuracy. The lights being turned off hence makes no sense and is just a convenient way to make the gory scenes of dead bodies more tense. Even if it's possible that the parasites turned off the lights on the upper floors, this was never actually mentioned so it's still a plot hole.\\n\\n\r\nTowards the end, when Gotou tells the soldiers who encountered him to follow him, those stupid soldiers actually do so? Uragami, the man who was in charge of identifying the parasites, just ran away with fear at the first sight of Gotou. Wasn't it obvious enough that Gotou was like even more dangerous than all those they encountered before? Even if Uragami wasn't there, when every other normal human is downstairs scared to death for their lives, and suddenly you see a random guy unnaturally calmly loitering around one of the upper floors in total darkness, that's just suspicious on so many levels! Any soldier acting naturally would have immediately gunned Gotou down relentlessly with shotgun rounds without hesitation.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, the anime says absolutely nothing about the origin of parasites, and even admits this. This is a major plot hole regardless of how much it is meant to symbolize how our human origins are, too, \"unknown\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the plot was pretty solid and well done, save for a couple of unnatural character reactions to situations and the plot holes as listed above. Still, compared to many animes out there that I've watched, this anime has really stood out in its plot and thematic development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Sequence 1: 2/2 - Pretty good\\n\r\nED Sequence 2: 1/2 - Simple and artistic\\n\r\nAesthetic: 2/3 - Perhaps it's meant to be a bit disturbing but I didn't like the way that the parasites were drawn. Migi was cute, but many bad ones were all kind of just the same monstrosity, it would have been better if they'd put more variants of the parasites.\\n\r\nAnimation: 2/3 - The action scenes were definitely really nice, although definitely there was an obvious lack of special effects put into all the slashing and stuff.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOP Theme 1: 1/2 - Everything is pretty good except that the voice has this really annoying \"autotune\"-like sound\\n\r\nED Theme 1: 1/2 - A beautiful piece of music, but I thought it could have been better chosen, seeing as how they like to end every episode in a cliff-hanger.\\n\r\nBackground Music: 3/4 - I generally enjoyed it, save for certain suspenseful parts where I thought the music was rather toned down and kind of drew away from the mood\\n\r\nAdditional Themes: 0/2 - There were none, so no points here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably where the anime suffers a bit, even though the main character is pretty solid, so we'll start with him.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi is the most complex main character in the anime, and with good reason, because he has a parasite in him that's completely affecting his thought processes and even emotions. We even get a glimpse of a backstory of his family, where his mother got the burn mark, but it's fair to say that he develops his backstory as the story progresses, through the loss of his mother to a parasite (+1 for a backstory). Izumi starts off weak and fearful but he is gradually strengthened by Migi's cells inside of him, making him not only stronger physically but also in mental conditioning (+1 for character growth). Also, Izumi is constantly at odds between his \"parasite\" and \"human\" parts of him. Torn between the two, Izumi eventually manages to find some middle ground towards the end of the anime, being able to be rational and still experience emotion at the same time. (+1 for character development). Definitely my favourite character as his combat skills are also pretty impressive after the second arc.\\n\\n\r\nThe other very interesting character is of course Migi, Izumi's companion who starts off completely rational and straightforward with things. He initially cannot understand human thinking and constantly mocks human emotion, but eventually, after mixing with Izumi's heart, begins to comprehend how human emotions work, and at the end, even decides to spare Gotou's life on grounds of not killing one's own kind (+1 for character growth). Though his ability to develop as a character is limited, since he is a parasite and is non-human, the fact that he shows this growth is interesting.\\n\\n\r\nIn the same way, Tamura Reiko also experiences this human emotional change. Going from just a parasite who is interested in learning about humans, to becoming the epitome of human love - giving up her own life for her child, is no mean feat at all (+1 for character growth). Throughout the anime, she is also very peculiar, even by parasite standards, as her obsession with her baby and her long-term insight into the survival of the parasite species seems to be very rare (+1 for character development).\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, we have to mention the useless Murano here, who is Izumi's girlfriend in the show. Murano's only role in this anime was honestly to try and help Izumi realize that he was become less and less \"human\", and Murano constantly struggles as she comes to terms with how Izumi \"has changed\". Throughout the anime, she incessantly bickers and whines about how Izumi is not the same as before and is completely fickle-minded when she decides to stay or not to stay with Izumi. She has no backstory and it's sad that her entire existence of a character is meaningless without Izumi. Plus the fact that she basically bears no relevance to the overall plot makes her sub-par as a main character. Though she eventually grows to accept Izumi as a human for who he is, this is hardly expanded upon.\\n\\n\r\nKana is the other Izumi-obsessed girl who basically fails to achieve anything from the start and all the way up to the end. She only causes trouble for Izumi, either by getting into a trouble with parasites, or by getting in the way of Izumi and Murano's relationship. She's honestly a pest and it was almost a relief to see her brutally killed by a parasite, no kidding. She has no backstory, and even less development than Murano. The only thing keeping me from hating her is that she is probably the prettiest girl in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters are even less memorable. Gotou, the main antagonist, is strong, but other than that, he has zero character, and hardly any motives worth mentioning anyway. Other key, interesting figures like Hirokawa, Uragami, Kuramori and Hirama all fail completely in terms of character development, and are basically just there so the plot can keep moving.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, only a few characters actually stood out, and most of the characters were easily forgotten and many who died didn't mean much at all to the plot or to the audience.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nExcitement: 3/3\\n\r\nThe action scenes really hit it where it mattered, and it was a real treat to see parasites battling out, and even better when we see Izumi kicking ass with his superhuman-like strength. All the blood and gore also helped a bit to make the scenes more dark and serious.\\n\\n\r\nEmotion: 2/3\\n\r\nQuite a lot of emotion was put into the anime, notably the relationship between Murano and Izumi, which was really back and forth throughout the whole anime, and it seemed like an endless struggle of push-and-pull (Izumi trying to pull and Murano pushing him away). Also, the Tamura Reiko arc was simply brimming with emotion, putting me close to tears at the end of it.\\n\\n\r\nHumour: 1/3\\n\r\nAlthough not known for its humour, the anime also pulls several slapstick stunts off using Uda, as well as Migi when he makes blunt remarks and morphs into very funny things.\\n\\n\r\nPacing: 3/3 \\n\r\nThe story does very well in creating suspense by making many of their episodes end in cliff-hangers so that you essentially never stop watching the show. Also, it had a satisfactory resolution which wrapped up most of the loose ends it introduced, leading to a happy ending. It was also gripping and exciting straight from the beginning, as well as at the start of every episode where they also show random people getting killed by parasites to add tension and drama.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets 1 bonus point for having no filler episodes! (+1) It's honestly been awhile since I've given a 10 for enjoyment, and I'm glad this anime managed to deliver.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7.5 / 10 (rounded up to 8)\\n\\n\r\nI chose to round this anime up to an 8 by sheer merit of the delivery of its themes and plot. It was an exciting, thrill ride, as well as a lengthy discourse on humanity and the human condition. It grips you, challenges you to think and asks questions that pierce to the very heart of the human soul, and it may not be for everyone, given the maturity of such themes.",

            "content": "Parasyte the Maxim is a story that handles questions about what makes us human, taking us on an unforgettable horror-adventure in the process.\r\nRight from the start the show has clear and compelling conflicts, with our main character Shinichi facing both external and internal battles, be it the violent parasites he fights or his gradual and scary decent into becoming less human. With good pacing and a story that kept leading in directions that made sense, usually, Parasyte keeps you immersed in its story.\r\nWhere the show shines the most is its main character, one of the most fleshed out and developed examples I\u2019ve seen in sometime. From beginning to end we keep seeing new sides to him that make you both cheer and worry for him, all while entertaining you with the interesting dynamic he has with his parasitic hand.\\n\\n\r\nWhat does bring the show down somewhat is that the rest of the cast-members aren\u2019t written as interestingly, particularly the female characters. We have girls putting themselves at risk despite being warned and knowing better, as well as a romantic interest that keeps ignoring obvious clues around her. But the women are not the only ones, humans in general seem to be intentionally written dumber, making the main character and the parasites seem more logical and threatening in comparison.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I appreciate about the series more than anything is that it didn\u2019t fall into one of my pet-peeves, which would be to have a message that raises a lot of questions without giving any answers to them. Without spoiling too much the series has an environmental message toward the end, a less than subtle one. I cannot stress how many times I\u2019ve felt like stories with this message tend to just paint humanity as the villains, never offering any particular ideas on how we can improve. The way Parasyte includes more positive notes to balance things out ellavates it to a more thought out story, managing to avoid coming off as pretentious when it very easily could have.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, with the occasional bump on the road, Parasyte is among the best character-pieces in recent memory. It is hard not to recommend for anyone that enjoys some thoughtful horror and adventure.",

            "content": "There are a few categories of anime that tend to gain mass appeal simply because of what they are. Examples include run-of-the-mill Shounens, Key adaptations, \u201cOh no I\u2019m trapped in a video game!!\u201d series, and action-horror anime that are filled with gore for good measure. Due to the recent disaster known as Tokyo Ghoul, I initially brushed Parasyte to the side dismissing it as another horror clone. For the first 12 episodes or so, I held my pinky in the air and avoided Parasyte like the plague. However, I finally caved to the hype. After marathoning the first halfof the series, I realized oh how wrong I was.\\n\\n\r\nStory (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tThe story of Parasyte is fairly simple. One night, a bunch of parasites float down from the sky and attempt to enter a multitude of human bodies by taking over human brains. They do this in order to control a host because without a host the parasites themselves cannot survive. Enter our main protagonist Shinichi Izumi, a young high school boy who lives a hilariously average life. Do you remember the nerdy guy from the movie The Breakfast Club? Well that\u2019s pretty much Shinichi in a nutshell. This all changes when a parasite attempts to enter his body one night; however, Shinichi holds off the parasite and contains it to only his right hand. Enter Migi, the parasite who now lives in Shinichi\u2019s right hand and allows Shinichi\u2019s hand to morph into a whole slew of weapons *insert obligatory masturbation joke here*. Now that parasites have begun to invade the human race they have to feed by eating other humans. Shinichi, being the Good Samaritan that he is, takes it upon himself to protect the human race from becoming human happy meals while still hiding the fact that he himself is a partial parasite.\\n\\n\r\n\tIn my honest opinion, the story itself wasn\u2019t really all that intriguing. However, what are intriguing are all the different themes that the story sheds light on. Instead of focusing completely on villain after villain and attempting to create a premise without any depth, Parasyte poses some very interesting questions. What does it really mean to be human? Are the parasites really wrong for acting on instincts? Who are the true parasites of Earth?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (6/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tParasyte really only has two \u201cmain\u201d characters; however, they have a few supporting characters that, in my personal opinion, really shine and add depth to an otherwise standard cast. Obviously we have Shinichi, our main hero who wants to save world! He has really generic motivations but he\u2019s still a well-written character. He develops throughout and goes through experiences that alter his view of the situation at hand. Is he really that interesting? Not to me personally, but I didn\u2019t hate him so that\u2019s a win. Then we have Migi, a character who shows a lot more development and growth than Shinichi ever does. I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil how our tale with Migi concludes, but I did feel he was the more interesting of our two leads.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe supporting roles of Parasyte were very hit or miss. Satomi is about as bland of a love interest that ever existed. Her sole purpose is to constantly nag Shinichi over how he has \u201cchanged.\u201d She adds absolutely nothing to the story and only serves to act as a damsel in distress for Shinichi to save and then nag and cry to him later about how Shinichi has just changed so much recently. Satomi is clearly one of Parasyte\u2019s misses; however, for every miss they have a couple successes. The two other characters I want to briefly mention are Ryouko, the parasite soccer mom, and Kuramori, the residential detective. Ryouko is interesting because of how well she develops and grows. She poses many of the overlying questions in the story and really forces both Shinichi and Migi to question what the meaning of humanity is. Kuramori seems like a bland and boring character that is in far over his head. It almost seems ridiculous that someone would actually try to be involved in such a horrific case until we see his motivations. The scene where it flashes his bedroom filled with detective books gives a true sense of character motivations without saying a single word. At that moment everything comes rushing to you. All of his dreams as a child, where he would read the stories of these great heroes and long to achieve what they did, come forward. Its characterization that adds meaning and it was extraordinarily well displayed.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tAs for animation there really isn\u2019t much to say. The animation is spectacular with well animated action sequences and a dark color pallet to fit the dark tone of the anime. This well-done animation is something I\u2019ve really come to expect from Madhouse studios.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tSound is highly dependent on taste. The opening theme is different. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m fond of the full version, but the cut version used for the opening was two thumbs up. The ending theme was the polar opposite in terms of presentation. The opening theme is very loud, electronic, and scream-y, while the ending theme is very relaxing and tranquil. Both the opening and ending are songs I would download so that\u2019s always a good sign. The background music didn\u2019t really do much for me. Nothing I would go out of my way to download but nothing that distracted from the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (7/10):\\n\\n\r\n\tParasyte sure seems to do a lot right; however, I do think that it\u2019s important to note that after my 12 episode binge I never quite got the same feel from Parasyte while watching it week to week. Whether this is because I missed some of Parasyte\u2019s shortcomings in the beginning or because the show took an overall dip halfway through is up in the air, but I definitely preferred Parasyte\u2019s earlier episodes to its later ones. Another important note about the latter half of Parasyte is that the themes of the show will begin to feel like they\u2019re being shoved down your throat and up your ass simultaneously. Usually, I don\u2019t have a problem with a writer being obvious with the themes because I\u2019m not a huge fan of vagueness as vagueness usually leads to pretentiousness. But damn, this writer really and I mean REALLY wanted you to know what he was going for. Eventually, it did get a tad annoying and by the end it definitely felt like the horse had long been beaten.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Parasyte is a show that I feel most everyone would enjoy. It has all the qualities of a binge-able show: stellar action, cliffhangers, and intriguing questions. It also has many qualities for critics to enjoy: strong themes, some interesting characterization, and unique twists. Some people might argue that the show begins to be a bit preachy and takes itself too seriously by the end, but I felt this didn\u2019t detract from the story that strongly.  The ending itself could have been stronger, but it certainly wasn\u2019t awful. \\n\\n\r\nParasyte was certainly a fun watch and deserves a full recommendation to check it out!\\n",

            "content": "Parasyte: the maxim is an intriguing anime. It questions the viewer on what it means to be human, what makes humans different than other species, and slaps the truth of human cruelty onto the face of viewers. \r\nWhile writing this review, I will be using references from the lyrics of the OP \u201cLet Me Hear\u201d, performed by Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. \r\nDo you know the food chain theory? We, humans stand high and firm at the top of it, we are the absolute predators, with no enemies which can pose a threat to us. Our main means of dying are either from oldage, a disease, an accident, or being murdered. All in all, it is quite a rare case (of course this doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t) that our life will be ended by another species. Yet, it is much easier for humans to end the life of another living being, various examples include domestication, hunting, and urbanization etc. That\u2019s right, you are probably the most comfortable species on Earth, where you can be sitting so comfortably in front of your laptop while the other species live in fear of being killed any time. \\n\\n\r\nIn Parasyte, alien beings emerge and pose a threat to humanity, people fear of being killed, people keep calling the parasites \u201cmonsters\u201d, as their emergence had shaken the firm foundations humans had built on top of the food chain. You see, being long time winners of the Earth and suddenly have that taken from you really scares the shit out of everyone, myself included. \\n\\n\r\nI know, Parasyte is merely a science fiction anime, but time and time again Parasyte reminded of the true nature of our world we live in, and we must not ignore nor run away from the truth: humans are the true devils. The ones with the power to destroy nature, to subdue other species, to create rules for the world, all for the benefit and selfishness of ourselves. \\n\\n\r\nAm I being cynical here? Perhaps. But this was what Parasyte had left in me after finishing it: a powerful, probably long lasting effect which would change my viewpoint in the world we live in.\\n\\n\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name which ended 20 years ago, Parasyte: the maxim has its story fully laid out and the producers have all the privilege to dictate the pacing of the show, which is pretty well done in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nArt and animation wise, it was handled by studio Madhouse, famous for their top-notch quality, as such, there aren't any big issues at this department, the sceneries are well drawn and fitted well; the animations are fluid; and the expressions of the \u201cnormal\u201d human beings are quite brilliantly presented here. One thing that I admire from this section is how Madhouse did some redesigns on the characters, making them more distinguishable than their manga counterparts, and raised the charm of these characters to new heights. Censoring is present, but is done a lot better than some of the animes I\u2019ve seen (Tokyo Ghoul S1 and Pupa, just to name some). \\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, Ken Arai did most of the BGM, and most of them fit well in the scenes they were inserted in. Both the OP and ED are great songs, where the OP, an electro-metal song, had lyrics written specifically for the show; ED is a slow and soothing ballad which provides comfort to the overall gruesome and emotional experience the show provides. As for our seiyuus, many of them are well experienced in the industry, and it was truly a delight to have them running the show. \\n\\n\r\nNow for the characters, with the story written by a Japanese and the setting set in Japan, being an Asian myself, I can understand the way the characters act. I\u2019ve seen complaints about how annoying this particular character is, his/her actions are unfathomable etc etc, this is because of the differences in culture, and the different environments we all are raised in. In other words, do factor in the various backgrounds of a person before you judge one\u2019s actions. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show, we can observe the nature of parasytes, and how they gradually evolve, which is very interesting and fascinating. Some of the parasytes have more intellect and even went further than just being a predator of humans, some wanted to learn more about themselves, learn more about humans, and also learn more about the world. Their developments serve as the main talking points about the true nature of humans. \\n\\n\r\nThe ride of watching Parasyte was indeed a thrilling one, I laughed, I cried, and I screamed to various events happening in the show. It truly got me hooked. I had this finished within 3 days, which is a good indicator to see how much I enjoy this myself. \\n\\n\r\nRegrettably, there are questions left unanswered as the show ends, and the viewers will have to connect the missing dots together. Also, the show utilized way too many coincidences in order to drive the story or to provide some character development. \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Parasyte is a great anime which will provide you tons of food for thought about our world in a very broad sense. Of course, powerless as we are as an individual, in the end, most likely nothing will ever change, and our lives will just go on as normal. But hey, with some questions for you to think while in the shower, that\u2019s not so bad sometimes, eh? Prove that you are different from monkeys! (laugh)\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:\\n\r\n++ Intriguing story.\\n\r\n+ Smooth pacing.\\n\r\n+ Great animation quality.\\n\r\n+ Nice cast of characters\\n\r\n- Too many coincidences.\\n\r\n- Many questions left unanswered.  \\n",

            "content": "Parasyte, a really hyped about anime when it started airing. Is the hype worth it? or is it just another exaggerated anime? I can't say. But as far as my biased opinion about this anime is concerned, I think this is a pretty good anime as far as story, setting and a new idea is concerned. Horror, there isn't much of it, just some people getting sliced up.\r\nWhen I saw it's promotional video, I thought it would be really cool and indeed it was, for the first half of the series but after that it mellowed down to something that's mostly drama with a bitof action and gore thrown in. \\n\r\nAnyway, let's get with the review:\\n\\n\r\nStory 9/10:\\n\r\nA parasyte takes control over a human by controlling the brain. For Izumi, fortunately, the parasyte gets stuck in his arm and so instead of his whole body, Izumi's right hand (migi in Japanese) is taken over by the Parasyte (named Migi). There are quite many other parasytes about and the dynamic duo works together to beat them because of the circumstances they are put in. At first, Izumi is a cry baby but as the series progresses, he also develops into a calm, composed and a bit inhuman being.\\n\r\nMost of the events taking place are Izumi encountering other Parasytes, some who play a major role in the series, some who are just to run away from and some who become friends. \\n\r\nIt progresses slowly and steadily, which might get boring after a while.\\n\r\nDead people, dead parasytes, few action scenes and drama go along in almost every episode. So that's the whole deal of the story, Izumi's life with Migi. No trying to stop other parasytes, no finding secrets of how they came and no fighting bad guys. He just battles the parasytes that come after him and stuff like that.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\r\nThe art is good for this anime since this anime is not an action, horror anime but a drama, psychological horror anime. Though the artwork of the parasytes leaves a lot to be desired because when I started this anime I though the parasytes would be freakin' cool but in the end, only one of them came up to the mark.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\r\nThe opening \"Let Me Hear\" is pretty good. It reminded me of \"Unravel\" on Tokyo Ghoul since both anime have a similar atmosphere. As for the ending, I listened to it once, and never gave it much attention. \"It's the Right Time\" is just ok. Nothing good enough that you'd want to download a full version.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10:\\n\r\nOur main character, Izumi is your average high school student who is scared from scary stuff. But after meeting Migi and due to certain circumstances, he toughens up and gets a massive change of character.\\n\r\nMigi is a \"numerical\" sort of character. He cannot comprehend emotion like other Parasytes. So, an intelligent being with no emotions and who judges the situation quantitatively and brings his own and Izumi's safety above all else. No moral values, no respect for others. You kinda understand what he's like now. But despite his personality, he also develops across the series and the human emotions start rubbing off on him. \\n\r\nAs for the other characters, there is Murano who is just like any other girlfriend but doesn't know about Izumi's parasyte.\\n\r\nIn the parasyte department, there are a few important and some side characters. Some play an important role in the series and the rest of the parasytes are just there to create a situation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:\\n\r\nI did enjoy it. But it's my own fault for getting ahead and expecting a lot of action from this anime. This is, as the genre states, a drama, horror, psychological, action, seinen anime. And that's what it always will be.\\n\r\nNo one is right and no one is wrong, everything has his/her/its own perspective of this world. If the parasytes shouldn't kill humans, then why do humans kill cows, fish etc. That's the kind of things you can expect of this anime. It does a pretty good job at it too. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I would recommend this anime to anyone looking for some serious stuff. Not action based. But mostly story and ideas. Action, horror are thrown in just so stuff doesn't get dull. \\n\r\nIt's a slow paced anime and you'll probably tire after watching 2-3 episodes. At some places, it goes well but later on, it's just slow. It doesn't have that potential to keep you glued to the screen and end it in one go.\\n\r\nSometimes you'll like the drama and sometimes you won't but this anime is definitely a good one to watch.\\n\r\nAnd those who are looking for horror with a lot of action and fighting, they might be disappointed a bit from this anime. But nonetheless, it's best to get on the bandwagon and watch the series along with everyone else.",

            "content": "Parasyte: The Maxim or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu is about the invasion of an alien species that survive through burrowing themselves inside humans and taking over the brain. It follows a high school student named Izumi Shinichi after he becomes a host of one of these creatures that actually fails to seize his brain and is able to avoid complete domination. The two soon learn to coexist and the story is about them not only trying to survive but to also eliminate the other parasites.\r\nStory [8/10]\r\nThe plot itself is seemingly unique and an interesting concept. It has a couple of good arcs that bring greatcharacter development and is one of the most consistently paced anime I\u2019ve seen. The story is well planned and provides good explanations for most queries inside the show. Overall, there isn\u2019t much to complain about the actual plot of Parasyte as it is intriguing and will keep you hooked from episode to episode.\\n\\n\r\nArt [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe art of this anime is actually somewhat typical and does not stand out too much. Some of the fight scenes were poorly made and it was pretty obvious that the producers became quite lazy after a couple times of doing the same thing. It was especially noticeable when Migi was fighting A in the school building and for almost five whole seconds straight, it was just a flurry and repetition of the same movements. The colours used were also very dull and dark. This being said, the anime does not stand out in its art but it also does not lack anything major in this aspect, it was just average.\\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs of Parasyte aren\u2019t that great. The auto tune in the opening is annoying but the actual rhythm and melody are alright. Background music wasn\u2019t very distinct and didn\u2019t add much to the atmosphere. The sound of this anime is nothing close to being outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the beginning of the anime were all very bland and ordinary. Specifically the parasites, all of them were almost the exact same, not only physically but also mentally. They are all extremely one-track minded and only care for their own existence, which is kind of forgivable because they are aliens. However, character development is what Parasyte truly excels at. At the start, Izumi Shinichi is a useless, almost pathetic teenager that is bullied easily. But as the story progresses, so does Shinichi as he learns how to fight and survive with Migi, he no longer stays helpless but turns into a much stronger and reliable character. This was done especially well because it was developed gradually and consistently throughout the show. Another major positive change in character was in two parasites, Tamiya Ryouko (previously known as Tamura Reiko) and Migi. I will not go in detail for these two as it may spoil parts of the story for readers who have yet to watch the anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [9/10]\\n\r\nOverall [8/10]\\n\\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Parasyte is an excellent watch. However, there are also some minor flaws such as its simplistic art style and music. If you\u2019re into action, psychological or sci-fi anime, you should definitely check this one out.",

            "content": "There could not have been a more fitting end. Shinichi and Migi's dream in the final episode, along with the internal monologue life preaching that followed immediately after (consisting of HALF the sodding episode!), aptly summarised everything wrong with an anime that may as well have been titled 'Parasyte: Maximum Chatter Within'. It was telling that, with the chance to have AN ACTUAL CONVERSATION outside of Shinichi's head, instead the last exchange between the two characters played out internally. Migi said it was because he (genderless, but forever a bro) wanted Shinichi to forget. And I most certainly agreed with Migi's sentiment. \r\nOne of thegreatest challenges in adapting manga is transferring static thoughts to a medium with motion. Madhouse's solution? To simply transfer EVERYTHING not involving internet modernisation 'Google snake + hand' awkwardness, instead of attempting to rework it into conversations... or maybe just having faith that the target audience do not need to be spoon-fed the obvious. Throughout the entire series, even the most basic of thoughts, such as \"Oh no, I am going to die!\" was shoved down my throat. Towards the end, it got to the point where - as if in response to the series spamming me with simplistic obviousness - I was internally screaming 'SHOW; DON'T TELL... WHY!?'\\n\\n\r\nIn a psychological series, it is important for the lead's thought process to be broken down into comprehensible chunks. But in the case of Shinichi, it was like I was listening to my West Highland Terrier's thoughts as she hunts her mortal enemy, the local squirrel. For example, in episode 23 Shinichi marches off to certain doom to do battle with THE ultimate enemy. Only when finding this last boss that he previously ran from - crying, I might add - does it occur to him a plan would be quite handy. Beforehand, he even monologues about how the situation will surely work itself out, as if certain the author will save him. Predictably, Shinichi found himself thinking \"WHAT DO I DO!?' as my eyes rolled into my head. Then, in a moment of  'I will stand here ominously while you think' inspiration, he remembers the old woman he met a few days ago. \"Never give up!\", she says in his head (not meaning don't give up in the context of a 1 vs. 1 battle with a monster, but I digress). Only then does Shinichi - still in his head - miraculously remember a weak-spot based on plot convenience.\\n\\n\r\nThe internal monologues are more of a superficial problem. Irksome but perhaps ignorable for those demented by anime. The real issue? Madhouse adding emphasis to the flaws of something decades old and not fixing ANY of them. At the start of the show, Migi - in his loveable matter of factly way - pointed out that humans are the true parasites on Earth / eat cows. At the end of the show, after it somehow stumbles into politics, a politician says THE EXACT SAME THING, as if it is a revelation. He even gives a dramatic speech. And that is all Parasyte has to offer: what it offered at the very beginning. The rest of the 'plot' simply had Shinichi fight parasites hiding in human skin as Migi told him what to do and/or saved him, whilst I had to plug my ears whenever Kana Havawank's character appeared to avoid punching her face on my screen; especially when the 'romance' became horribly overwrought with THAT damnable piece of music. Never before did I realise adding a voice could make me go from indifference to hatred. Her most noteworthy contribution was supportive sex--a modern day Japanese comfort girl, if you will. \\n\\n\r\nSo, what else does the series offer? Well, unlike in the manga, Shinichi starts out as a scrawny four-eyed representation of the what anime has taught me to be the average Japanese high school student. Most of the time, he sounds like he is on the verge of tears. Naturally, three girls still gathered to talk about him, without the bitchy detest reality requires. But before even being halfway done, Shinichi finds himself some hair gel and contact lenses; becoming a new boy, as it were. And then... CIRCLES. The annoying wannabe girlfriend of the piece runs around questioning whether Shinichi is still human after he put a dog in a bin, whilst I simply questioned if he is just an outright moron. Then another girl - with moe earphones added in the anime - decides to also run around after Shinichi due to the 'red string of fate'. Cringe. At this point all I remember is episodes upon episodes of meandering as girls chased Shinichi as he got lost in thought over his inability to cry. Then, towards the end, he discovers he can cry, loses all composure and reverts back to how he started, making me question the point of life/this story. After that, the series randomly just ends on a bizarrely abrupt and 'parasites are hiding now, OH WELL; bye, Migi!' note. \\n\\n\r\nThe single most disappointing aspect? Madhouse's (lack of) budget. Over 20 years late, and the only impressive visuals come in an opening that screams 'TEENAGERS: WATCH ME!' so loudly I feel almost old, an exciting intro though it is. So poor is the art consistency that eyes did not even line up correctly in key episodes. And the parasites quickly took a nosedive towards blob animation, so lacking was the detail. It was so limited I started to believe that the mid-battle internal monologues existed to save even more money by avoiding fluidity. And the colours were on the bland side of dull throughout. I just do not understand: why wait all these years to half-arse something?...\\n\\n\r\nI do like some things. Not many, but some. Migi, for one. The brains AND  personality of the series... in spite of being emotionless and machine-like by nature. Easily one of the most unique characters ever created and, despite not being human, more relatable than the rest of the the human cast combined. His intentionally unintentional deadpan \"That would be a problem\" moments of comedy gold are my favourite parts of the series, along with the bizarre grotesque broship bond he shares with Shinichi. And Parasyte does have an undeniably cool concept. There is something genuinely disturbing about a head turning into a mouth and eating people. Some of the music is uniquely excellent, also: 'hypnotik' being my favourite, if only for the previews. But the rest of the show?... the lack of a plot, or any kind of answers given by its tacked-on 'ending', were issues all those years ago. All the anime added is internal monologue emphasis emphasis suffering and... Aya Hirano as a talking hand. An uninspired adaptation of a manga lacking direction and without any closure does not satisfy me, and nor should it satisfy anyone else.",

Even for a harem genre lover such as myself, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it as I watched despite the lack of nosebleeds.\r\nStory: 10\r\nI rarely ever give a story a 10, but there were several factors that gave this anime the god score. First, the originality in the overall plot was a thumbs up as most stories nowdays unfortunately have similars to some other type of story, whether intentional or not, but this animehad a plot that (at least for me) I haven't seen before. Second, the pacing was good, and while some of you may not like the 24 episodes, it helped keep the pace good and steady as this would have not been as enjoyable if it was crammed into a 12 episode format. Third, no offplot events, or in other words, no random episodes thrown in to be fillers. Pay attention as there is plot development in all the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nI give it a 9 because (besides a personal opinion of there is no such thing as perfection) of the overall good fight scenes, however the detailed art may make you queasy, especially if you plan to get a uncensored version when the dvds come out. If your used to the gore, then pay no heed as the art is going to be to your liking.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nI personally can't say that I'm an expert at judging music, but as far as I notice all the music and sounds fitted right into the places where they belonged, as well as the opening and closing tracks were pleasing to the ears. The background sound overall was excellent and well placed by the makers.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 9\\n\r\nI give the characters a 9 for that many of the characters are fresh, besides the girl the protaganist likes. The majority of the characters are just overall not well seen around anime as the plot, as stated as before, is pretty original allowing for new kind of characters to be seen. (Forwarning, if you are a kind of person who wants everyone to live and nobody to have died, you might want to toss that aside as there are 1 or 2 deaths that will cause at least a tear)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nDespite the fact that I'm a harem, ecchi type lover as shown through my anime list, this anime will forever be on the top animes that I would recommend to anyone of a serious, slightly humorous, gore anime. With the action, drama, and the various aspects of this anime,  I'm sure you will love it as much as I have.",

            "content": "In depth review #7 - Parasyte: The Maxim\r\nParasyte, without a doubt, was an amazing experience. Anyone who had watched the anime can agree with me in saying that this show was very entertaining. The brief but appropriate action scenes, the frequent cliffhangers at the end of every.....episode, and the amazing character development  kept me coming back for more every week. However, the way the anime concluded left me a little disappointed. A show literally oozing with potential in the beginning of the show, felt rushed towards the last 7 episodes. Its also worth mentioning the scope of the story was very isolated. They couldof done so much more with this story, and answer so many more unanswered questions, but what can you do. It was good for what it was. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 7.75 (Good)\\n\\n\r\nA story about alien organisms taking over to the bodies of humans sounds awesome, but how exactly did this anime execute this premise? Well, to put it simply, it was ok. Yes, the journey, our main character, Shinichi, experiences was great, and the struggles between the duo and  other parasytes where also well executed, but the scope of the story was just too small. The story is about Shinichi, but the anime is essentially about an invasion of organisms taking over humans in a modern society. The story could of had been so much more expansive and robust. Also, it's worth mentioning that the anime was heavily rushed around episode 18. One minute there's a fight, then the next minute there's scene with the  government , then there's a sex scene. The pacing during this part of the show was just too haphazard for my liking. If i hadn't bashed the story enough, the ending was kind of lackluster. Not because the ending didn't make sense, or that it was bad or anything. What i didn't like about it was that there wasn't enough closure. One of the biggest questions i have about this anime was where did the parasytes originate from? I would of had thought that would be an obvious topic to cover in this show, but apparently i was wrong. At this point, you may think i hated the story, but i didn't. It was interesting, and a breathe a fresh air. I just had unrealistic goals for this anime since it was just so good in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.75 (Fair)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for this show was also average. Nothing more and nothing less. Most of the animation wasn't memorable but there were a couple of scenes where they used some interesting facial expressions to convey serious emotions, and drastic tension. These scenes either had me lean back a bit in my chair and say WTF is wrong with your face, or made me widen my eyes a bit and say Shit's getting real. The fight scenes between parasytes where also animated nicely. The blades clashing into one another, and the slight blood splatter was realistic and pleasing to the eye. Besides these entities however, nothing really stood out. I'm currently trying to think of a couple of scenes that i can put in this section but nothing is coming to mind. I guess this fact explains what i am trying to get at more accurately. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 8.5 (Very Good)\\n\\n\r\nI admit it, i am a sucker for dubstep in anime. I personally listen the liquid dubstep and other dubstep variations, so i am extremely biased on this subject, but the music was amazing. The fact that i tried to find certain tracks after i watched to anime should give you a sense of how good the music was. If you don't like this type of music, this aspect of the show probably wont mean as much to you as it does to me, but regardless the music fit well with the anime. It was subtle, but it complemented the action, and stressful scenes very nicely. I honestly couldn't imaging certain scenes without the dubstep in the background.  This anime is proof the edm can be properly implemented in anime successfully, and won't completely suck like most failed attempts did in the past. Other than the music, the voice acting was on point. I loved Migi's melodramatic tone of voice throughout the anime. Shinichi, Murano, and the other supporting characters voice actors also did a great job of realistically portraying their characters voices. I came to this conclusion after hearing there characters speak during the emotional scenes. Hearing there broken speech while crying, or while scared adds the element of realism which isn't always present in certain anime. The same can be said while characters where arguing with each other. There tone and the intensity of there voices made things seem as if i was watching an argument in real life. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10 (Outstanding)\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has the best character development i have ever seen in an anime to date, hands down. It's almost shocking seeing how much a character can gradually change, and grow in only 24 episodes. All of the characters in the cast experience some magnitude of character development in the show,  but the stars in my book go to Shinichi and Migi. The show introduces an interesting bleeding effect between these two characters. Since Migi and Shinichi are living in the same body, certain aspects of each other is inherited between each other. What this means is that as the show went on, Shinichi started acting more like a parasyte, and Migi started inheriting emotions like humans do. The way they introduced this and how the changes got more noticeable every episode was perfect. This was definitely the best thing that this show accomplished during its run. Something that annoyed me though was how Murano didn't stfu about Shinichi's changes for about 15 episodes straight. She was so annoying in the beginning omfg, but she did a 180 towards the end which was an improvement. Besides the main characters, there was clear character development between both species in the show (human, parasyte) which had unique changes for both. Quick examples could be seen in Shinichi's dad, and in Tomea Reiko. Overall great cast, a lot of variety, and unique character development techniques. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 (Great) \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed watching this anime. It wouldn't be a stretch in saying that this was one of the best anime to come out during the winter 2014 season. A lot of people can agree with me on this to. Just go on any forum or video are read the posts explaining how Parasyte > Tokyo Ghoul. What got me hooked on this show was that it kept me on the edge of my seat literally every episode. No, i don't think you fully understand. There was a cliffhanger every episode. Sometimes i was left there huffing and puffing since i came to the realization i had to wait an entire week to watch what would happen next. I really enjoyed watching this anime. The only thing that was wrong with it was that it wasn't ambitious enough, which really isn't a flaw, just my imagination running rampant. Either way, MUST WATCH anime right here. It was a roller coaster, i would recommend anyone who enjoys good anime to ride it. \\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.4/10 (Very Good) - Must Watch \\n",

            "content": "\"Flies know how to fly without being taught. Spiders know how to spin webs without being taught. Why is that? Here's what I think: Flies and spiders are simply following an order. I believe all lives on Earth have received orders of some kind. Don't humans have any directive? When I took over this human's brain, I received a directive. It said, Devour this species.\" - Tamura Ryoko\r\nWhat does it mean to be human? Is it our DNA that sets us apart from the other creatures that inhabit the earth? From a scientific standpoint, the answer to that question would be \"Yes\". However, we arenot scientists, so we must answer that question in a different manner. For as long as we can remember, humans have been the champions of survival, conquering all obstacles in our path due to the sheer amount of knowledge that we can possess. But what if humans were no longer the champions? What if some other species showed up one day with the likeness of human beings and treated us as their prey? Would it be us that really deserve to survive -- or would it be the newer, more perfect human race? That is the common question brought up in the world of Parasyte: The Maxim.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the 1989 manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki, Parasyte whisks viewers away to a world where a parasitic alien race is attempting to attach itself to and consume the life-force of human hosts. These parasites, however, are just acting on basic instinct. With that being said, it is no surprise that our main character (Shinichi Izumi) in Parasyte becomes \"Infected\" by one right at the very start of the show. Shinichi, however, notices the parasite as it burrows into his arm and cuts off any path that said parasite has to make it to the brain. The result of this lies in the parasite (Who we will come to know as Migi) controlling his right arm instead of his entire body.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte works off of a strong pilot episode that serves as an intense attention-grabber and coerces viewers into delving deeper into the series. Through the utilization of suspenseful endings and TONS of gore, Parasyte has become perhaps the most successful anime of 2014. But this doesn't necessarily mean that it is the best. It has flaws, just as 99% of shows do. But are those flaws enough to degrade the score of the show to a state in which it is not worth watching? Not really, no. But lets look into it further anyway as I break the show apart into a few key elements to better illustrate it.\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 9/10\\n\r\nI'm going to cut right to the chase here in the music section and state that Parasyte had the single best background song of 2014. That song (Hypnotik) was a powerful blend of techno and orchestra that made each and every fight scene in Parasyte literally ten times better than they would have been on their own. And the great thing is that the soundtrack isn't only extremely interesting, but incredibly dynamic, memorable, and packed to the brim with intensity and drama. The one complain I do have about it though, is that there just wasn't enough. There were only about three or four songs that just kept getting cycled through. And even though I really REALLY liked those songs, there just wasn't enough diversity. Regardless, the music was pretty astonishing and, thanks to Hypnotik, my favorite part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7/10\\n\r\nParasyte has a pretty heft cast of characters, and almost every one of them is equally important and serves as a stepping-stone in the development of Shinichi. Whether he be coping with loss or learning how the parasites work, his mind is never at rest. And for 22 hours of the day, neither is his right arm. Migi, though extremely annoying at first, quickly grows on you. No pun intended. Shinichi, on the other hand, stays pretty annoying throughout the whole damn show. He was developed well, don't get me wrong. In fact, it was some of the best development of the year. But there was just a certain unlikability to him that pissed me off almost every episode. Plus, this show killed off the only character I actually liked, so I have vendetta against it. Even though the cast is well-varied, none of them are really that all-that likable, and that's a big problem. Characters, being debatably the most important part of an anime series, need to be strong or interesting or funny or anything like that. But almost none of the characters in Parasyte really are. However, because of their development actually being good, this isn't something that should sway your opinion in watching the show.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nBeing the adaptation of a manga from the 80's, Parasyte handles the gap between old-school anime and new-school anime very well. It feels more like something that came out of the early 2000's than something from the past few years. This brings a certain endearing charm to it for those that actually read the manga version, while still allowing new fans like myself to grow fond of it. However, there is a slight lack-in-detail in the art department. The most visually interesting aspects of the show fall upon the parasites while they are fighting, and any time they aren't, the show just looks kind of plain and boring. There is just such a noticeable artistic gap between those two things that the art can't be called perfect. It's good, yes, but good enough to be considered great? Mehhhhh, not really. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nThe idea of humans being taken over by parasites isn't necessarily the most original idea. BUT, it's still a good one, which means there is a high-chance of success in the story department. And for the most part, Parasyte does succeed. Eventually though (Specifically in the last couple episodes), the plot gets a little too convoluted. I started to feel like the show was basically saying \"Okay kids, what have we learned today?\" instead of actually coming to a fitting resolution. This really spoiled things for me. Minutes ago, I was in an alternate reality where humans were at risk of dying out, and now I'm basically being told to recycle and not kill bugs. It ruined what was earlier a great plot by literally trying to teach you a lesson instead of letting the story do that on its own. Hell, there is at least five minutes of actual dialogue in the last episode where Shinichi is talking about the moral of the story. AND THEN, they literally take a complete 180 and basically say, \"LOL NEVERMIND\". It wasn't fair. It was like, for a brief moment, the director wanted to play a cruel joke on all the people who so diligently followed the show -- and it really ruined what could have been great.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is pretty much the \"Attack On Titan\" of 2014. It received a lot of early praise for its ability to set the tone of a dark story, but was consequently blown out of proportion by all those people that thought they discovered the next Evangelion. Don't misinterpret that last sentence either, because I really like both Parasyte and AOT. But there are so many better shows out there than both of them, and they really don't deserve to consume the entirety of their respective year's spotlight. Give this show a watch -- I'm almost certain you will enjoy it to a certain extent. But I would sooner recommend a multitude of shows with interesting characters and a story that lets you determine the moral on your own.",

            "content": "I watched the anime after having read the manga, so I tried to focus more on presentation rather than depth of plot or depth of character. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nHaving read the manga, I already knew the story--all its twists and turns, who would die, what characters would show up when and so for me--this anime was less about being surprised and even more about being immersed in the world. While being new to the plot would have definitely helped immersion, it isn't a necessity. The story was nothing amazing to me in the first place: another anime high school student  (who really doesn't go tohigh school though) grows up through a new character that throws his life into chaos--a generalization, but more or less the archetype that these sort of animes follow.  But the presentation was well done.\\n\r\nTo me, pacing means to control how long events have to sink in or how long a person dwells upon an emotion; how long a certain idea is thought about or how quickly a character changes and pulls the plot with him--this anime creates a plot that is neither a bland mishmash of insignificant ideas nor  a road trip where each event is another landmark along an otherwise boring journey. I may have known what was going to happen, but the plot moved at an enjoyable pace: traumatic events that happened in previous arcs were not forgotten about; no event felt unimportant and moreover, I never felt like the plot had become sluggish. By sluggish I mean that characters were not doing negligible acts. In doing so, the plot was merely an obstruse structure that allowed the characters actions, reactions, thoughts and emotions shine through. There were flaws, of course: certain events felt like they were still forced from the manga, such as both of the incidents at the school. This lowers the score and so the story-telling warrants a 8/10. If you're interested in the plot alone, as in the shockingness of certain events, then I'd gives it a 5/10. The presentation pushes the anime's story to a 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nHaving read the manga, my expectations were relatively low. However, just the first episode made it clear to me that I was wrong. The art is fine and there is a strong focus on detail on the background and many of Migi's transformations. I'm not a great art critic, so I can't say much, but the animation was definitely fluid and very little felt lazily done. It didn't wow me like any of Shaft's animes but I didn't cringe when I looked at it like ping pong the animation. So 7/10--good--seems about right.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nVoice acting was fine and the sound effects were fine. Both were helped immerse the watcher. However, inventive hardly begins to describe the music and its usage. I really wanted to give a lower score at first mainly because the dubstep track used \"I am\" in the beginning episodes of the series had the bass drop in the middle of conversations which always made me burst in laughter because of how out of place it was--breaking both the immersion and the fact that I was supposed to take the scene seriously. On the other hand, the other music tracks were lovingly made and supported each scene, usually without detracting from it. In fact, they added to it too. For example, Murano, the primary love interest, has a theme song called \"Bliss\" and surprisingly, it pays homage to \"Just the way you are\" by Bruno Mars. As the main character Shinichi changes, Murano rails against the change almost showing how she wants him to stay just the way he is. But near the end, she grows to fully love him the way he is--whether he changes or not.  Realizing this made every scene with her slightly more meaningful to me. Otherwise, the music was generally memorable and felt full of emotion, like \"next to you\". These strengths made up for the awkward flaws with utilizing dubstep. So to me, it's 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nAs expressed, I already knew the characters, their main flaws, strengths, motives and general thought processes. Sadly, this anime didn't fix some of the more useless characters that were not only one-dimensional, but seemed to show up specifically so that it wouldn't seem like an isolated world with just the main character and his newfound companion. I constantly questioned the existence of every other love interest and possibly even the primary one. In general, this anime focused so intently on characterizing probably three characters to the fullest that the rest had no real depth at all. I can't blame them too much, given their source material, but aside from the main character, his hand and one of the antagonists, I couldn't bring myself to care about anyone else--they felt less like people and more like images on the screen. However the 3 to 4 characters that were fully developed and helped exemplify the definition of \"dynamic character\"; their thoughts and emotions were clearly expressed and while some parts seemed a bit roughly glued together, the majority of it made a convincing case that these characters were \"real\". Compared to the manga, its presentation felt stronger. And to me, after 24 episodes, any anime that can convince you that the main two characters are somewhat real deserves a 6/10 at the very least. \\n\r\nI also want to explore another aspect of characters: character relationships. How characters talk/react to each other and how this action changes throughout the anime is important; it not only helps to highlight a character's changing personality or explore their depths, but also helps make the scenario real. This could easily be part of the Story section, but I feel it fits more here. In any case, Shinichi's initial relationship with Migi is great. It was exactly what I would have expected if we were given Shinichi and Migi's personalities to begin with. And as the series progressed, their interaction was excellent.  It was not only what I expected, but it was shown in a proper manner: their quibbles, their agreements and their compromises. It was a continual dance in conversation. This really gives the anime's character a more real feeling. A real Shinichi and a real Migi, living in a real world. I wanted to give at least an 9/10 for that.\\n\r\nAnd then there's Shinichi's relationship with many of the other characters. They are present, but to me, most felt purposeless. Some might argue that this helps fill up an otherwise necessary void. But to me, every horror genre type of art attempts to convince the reader that some part of the horror--the situation, the emotions, the thoughts--is real despite being clearly fictional. And these relationships that exist but feel pointless really undermines the immersion process. That drags down the score to a 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nI suppose this is where I admit to my bias. I like flashy things; I like non-repetitive fight scenes and innovation in battle. I like just enough exposition to get the ball rolling and just enough action for further action to remain meaningful. I like to see characters change, to see their motives and how they think. I like to see them follow behaviors that come from their motives and thought processes--and then change what they think (but showing the progression too) from time to time. Parasyte fits that bill. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIt averages to 8/10. But honestly, if you didn't already read the manga, it should be a 9/10. Moreover, the rewatchability of this show far outstrips many other horror anime that I've watched. Thanks for reading!",

However, unlike other anime with raw violence, Parasite doesn't use scenes as a tool to show blood, they feel almost necessary, hence the reason one might not mind them. They do not provoke, compared to other which simply want to show blood, you can say that Parasite has to.",

            "content": "Parasyte Review\r\nUpon the mentioning of Parasyte people are met with varied opinions, almost to the point where there is no clear distinction between the audience on whether parasyte is good or just okay.  Well I\u2019m here today to present to you my personal critiques for parasyte so without any further delay I hereby present my review of the anime Parasyte the Maxim.\r\nParasyte was produced by Madhouse studios and aired between the fall season of 2014 to the winter season of 2015 containing 24 episodes as a psychological action sci-fi seinen.\r\nThe Story\r\nOne night miniscule alien creatures possessing their own intellect called parasytes invade earth tofind people or hosts in order to gain control of their brain.  Enter our main protagonist Shinichi whose parasyte by the name of Migi burrows in his right arm instead of his brain and is in full control of his arm.  Both characters form a coexisting pact with each other as they attempt to survive and kill the hostile parasytes that roam the streets.  Throughout their journey however Shinichi\u2019s personality starts to alter and the world around him becomes more grey.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is a brutal allegorical interpretation of the typical coming of age story as Shinichi learns to stray away from parental dependency, attempts to find independence with oneself, and of course the development of one's own morality.  We witness Shinichi as he transforms from a fragile minded adolescent to learning the harsh cruel reality of the world around him through the parasytes.  The parasytes however have no clear distinction on what they represent but a couple of ideas flowed through my head that they could be an extreme unempathetic facade of humanity, or the core of human nature without total societal dictation and restriction.  The highlight of the show is the humanization of its characters and the overall message of what it means to be human.  Surprisingly, parasites, which are indeed not human have the capacity to become humanized and display humanlike traits mostly notably altruism which is the selfless concern for others.  With these themes it generates more moral ideas of coexistion, killing humans isnt different from killing an insect or are we as humans any different from the monsters?  However at points the themes did get clumsily handled, some are enforced too much or left shallow.\\n\\n\r\nThe story besides its themes is very engaging and has its macabre moments to show that the anime is not afraid to display brutality.  However with these impressive fights that occur the anime has a flaw with being anticlimactic, some skirmishes last less than 1-2 minutes which were built up for an entire episode or arc, especially in the first half.  Also, there are some plot conveniences where the main character finds the luckiest method destroy a parasite.  Another problem I had was the random clairvoyant powers some characters had to detect parasites which fit the theme of there is no differentiation between humans and monsters but at the same time never was explained.\\n\\n\r\nImplausibilities emerge due to the source material being produced in the late 1980s, the lack of surveillance and technology in that era as opposed to ours is vast and by modernizing the adaptation it feels generally weird that with all the technology nowadays the parasytes\u2019 existence is hidden for so long.  The pacing however for this series fits the show well, it allows for each of the events to unfold, get built up, and happen without overstaying their welcome while also helping the atmosphere of the show, the feeling of tenseness and mystery of the unknown generates a feeling of uneasiness in the audience with the fact that nobody is safe.\\n\\n\r\nThe conclusion however is the weakest part of Parasyte, the last episode did close all of the themes however the scenario felt very tacked on to the point where the last episode could have been an OVA.  A disappointing end to an engaging story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters\\n\r\nIf there is one thing Parasyte manages to capture it is the humanization of its characters with the use of subtlety throughout the show.\\n\\n\r\nShinichi our main lead starts out being characterized as nervous and wimpy but upon encountering Migi we not only see character development with him against all odds we actually witness a character regression in which he turns less human and lacks empathy and bases actions moreso on rationalism like a parasyte.  This subtle 180 brings out interesting and conflicting reactions with family, friends, loved ones and seeing this intense struggle in his mind enforced its themes about humanity.  Over the course of the anime we get a fantastic view on the various sides of Shinichi\u2019s personality and the psychological breakdown of his mind to really get a rich perspective on the core elements of his character.\\n\\n\r\nMigi is the parasyte and surprisingly becomes more humanized and characterized than most of the cast.  Migi lacks empathy but has strong curiosity about human nature, constantly dichotomizing Shinichi\u2019s altruistic morals by not fully understanding them.  Migi by the end of the show morphs into a completely different character than before, with more personality and human traits.  Overall, he\u2019s the perfect sidekick to Shinichi.\\n\\n\r\nMurano\u2019s role is the outsider looking in on Shinichi\u2019s dilemma and the romantic interest, but she can come off as useless and annoying at times with her constant \u201cAre you the real Shinichi\u201d.  Kana was there as a representation of vulnerability, and eventually through some events in the show she is clearly there to demonstrate to Shinichi that his selfless nature can\u2019t always help everyone but there was a lack of depth for her character.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters are a mixed bag ranging from very humanized like Ryouko the parasyte to evil just to be evil like Uragami.  What Parasyte\u2019s characters have is fantastically crafted humanization but lacks any sort of fortified side characters.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art/Animation\\n\r\nPersonally, Madhouse studios I feel did a good job on this department, it\u2019s not as aesthetically pleasing as Madhouse\u2019s prior works but it\u2019s suitable for the series.  There are some adequate shots, neatly refined backgrounds and cool lighting.  The character designs are simple but the parasytes are marvelously fabricated to appear unnerving and emphasize the uncanny valley effect.  The parasytes alien forms have a certain gruesome yet beautiful appearance that worked perfectly for the show even if sometimes they look like an incinerated Splatoon characters.  The main complaint I have though is the CGI people that they use looks atrocious and sometimes drew me out of the show.  The animation was satisfying, everything was very fluid, however I wish that when the parasytes attack it wasn\u2019t just tentacles flailing around like mindless drones.  Despite that there is some dexterous choreography to be found within some skirmishes that are rewarding as hell to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound\\n\r\nHere is where people are mostly divergent between detesting the soundtrack or liking it.  Personally I really dug the ost that first time producer Arai Ken created so don\u2019t lynch me for saying that.  The dubstep like in the song \u201cI am\u201d in my opinion amplified the tense atmosphere the show presents and enhances the buildup while emotional pieces highlighted the very melancholic scenes.  However, the pieces do sometimes get overused.  The opening and ending songs were both spectacular with Fear and Loathing Las Vegas doing a stellar job at capturing the essence of Parasyte in the intro.  The voice acting is exceptional with powerful performances by Shinichi and Migi while the rest of the cast is above average with no performances that are memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really liked Parasyte a lot, it was engaging with satisfactory theme exploration that in the midst of all the uninspired anime nowadays stood out as a gem, so teetering between very good and greatness I\u2019m just gonna flat it giving it my rating of greatness.  Despite its flaws I do believe that this anime is a great title that I highly recommend for you all to watch it but I could totally see someone giving this show around a 6 or a 7 depending on their preference.\\n",

            "content": "What I love the most about Parasyte is how it starts being awesome *immediately*. It's extraordinarily rare to find an anime with such a strong opening, and I almost felt like giving it a 10 after just a couple of episodes. It has this incredibly sense of immersion which draws you in as a viewer and constantly keeps you wanting to find out what happens next. As a result, this is one of the most addictive and marathonable anime I've seen in a very long time.\r\n--Story--\r\nBased on the classic manga by Iwaaki Hitoshi, Parasyte is a science-fiction horror story about 17-year-old Izumi Shinichi who oneday gets his right hand devoured by an unidentified, worm-like parasitic life form. The organism was actually trying to take over his brain, but failed and thus had to settle with taking over the place of his right hand instead. And thus begins the thrilling journey of a symbiotic relationship between a human and an alien sharing a single body, and their horrifying struggle against other Parasytes and society itself, as danger lurks around every corner when any given human might secretly have had their brains taken over on the inside by the enemy. When both human and non-human lives are weighted against each other, the story forcefully asks the question of just how much a human life is truly worth.\\n\\n\r\nThe Parasytes are highly metamorphic and can shapeshift to just about any form imaginable at an incredibly high velocity. This enables them to disguise themselves, extend their bodies dozens of meters, harden their skin and take the shape of sharp blades, or even split in two like amoebas. Because of this there's an effectively endless potential for creativity in this anime as almost nothing is impossible when Parasytes are involved.\\n\\n\r\nThe story kicks off with a bang and goes right into the action from pretty much the very first episode. It is interesting, original and amazingly well presented. he death count is extremely high which always keeps you on your toes as you can never take any character's survival for granted at any given moment. The pacing is superb, and on top of that the show also has a tendency to end all of its episodes in mini-cliffhangers which really makes you want to watch the next episode immediately thereafter. It reminds me a bit of Code Geass in that sense, and as a result I would highly recommend Parasyte to be marathoned rather than watched over time. I didn't watch it while it was airing myself, but in retroperspective I'm very glad that I didn't. Having to wait a whole week between every episode of this anime sounds like a nightmare.\\n\\n\r\n--Characters--\\n\r\nIf you want to talk about character development, then you'll be hard-pressed to find someone who changes more over time than Shinichi does. He doesn't just grow up, but effectively becomes a completely different person over the course of the anime as a result of the horrific events he's forced to experience. What I love the most about his character is how well it showcases his struggle for his own humanity. With his right hand belonging to an alien rather than himself, can he really call himself human anymore? What consequences does this have? His emotions (or lack of emotions) are extremely well expressed in this sense and really makes you feel for him and his situation.\\n\\n\r\nHis symbiotic partner, fittingly named Migi (which means \u2018Right' in Japanese) in reference to Shinichi's right hand, is perhaps even more interesting. The Parasyte race does not possess the concepts of emotions, empathy or sympathy. Migi is an entirely logical being more reminiscent of Kyuubey from Madoka Magica or even a computer if you will with the way he thinks and acts. Of course this mentality more often than not clashes directly with Shinichi's own opinions, especially when it involves other human lives as Migi only cares about his own survival. As a result they're both friend and foe at the same time to one another, but since they're both dependent on each other they have to find a way to cooperate as best as possible nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a rather large supporting cast both among humans and Parasytes in this show, some of which are more noteworthy than others but they all have their own roles in the story and feel relevant in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\n\r\n--Art--\\n\r\nParasyte is animated by Madhouse, and as you may expect from them at this point, there is essentially nothing to complain about as far as the visual aspect goes. Everything in this show looks detailed and polished, albeit not mind-blowing either. What is definitely worth mentioning however is the way the motions of the Parasytes themselves are animated. The way Migi and the other organisms constantly morph and distort in almost horrific fashion looks amazingly gruesome and intense. The fight scenes in-between Parasytes take place at superhuman speeds, where they transform themselves into numerous tentacle-like arms with large, sharpened blades at the tips, resulting in monstrous types of fencing scenes in mid-air. It looks revolting yet captivating at the same time, and it never ceases to amaze you with how jarring it feels.\\n\\n\r\n--Sound--\\n\r\nThe soundtrack mainly consists of electronic music and dubstep... yes dubstep in anime. Not something you hear every day. However this actually happens to fit the anime's intense segments surprisingly nicely, and helps to emphasize the intensity of it all very well. On top of that there are also some more tranquil piano tunes and similar, some of which are surprisingly beautiful. Bottom line being that it always feels fitting for each and every scene when it's presented.\\n\\n\r\nSadly I can't quite say the same for the OP which is somewhat of an average screemo song that I didn't really like, and also the ED was really out of place I felt. Sure it was quite beautiful, but it didn't really fit the intense and serious atmosphere of the show very often.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the voice acting goes, we have Shimazaki Nobunaga doing an exquisite performance in the role of Shinichi, as more or less every ounce of his character was drawn out almost perfectly. Also to my amazement, Migi is actually voiced by *Hirano Aya* herself out of all people. Even now I still feel a bit weird knowing that the same VA who voiced Suzumiya Haruhi and Izumi Konata among others is now doing the voice for a metamorphic alien lifeform in a horror anime, but honestly she pulls it off almost shockingly well, which once again is testament to just how talented of a voice actress she truly is. As a side note I must however say that Hanazawa Kana's role as Shinichi's classmate Satomi was not really her best one. Or rather I don't know why she of all people was chosen for that role as it really didn't fit her voice very well.\\n\\n\r\n--Enjoyment--\\n\r\nLet me put it this way; I started watching Parasyte two days before the final episode aired with the intention of catching up just in time for it to finish... and even that ended up being too early. Seriously I could easily have watched this entire anime in one sitting had I had the option to at the time. It's just that addictive. Once you've started watching it, it's effectively impossible to stop.\\n\\n\r\n--Overall--\\n\r\nI will honestly have to say that I severely underestimated this show prior to watching it. Horror is generally one of the least interesting genres in anime for the simple reason that... cartoons aren't scary. However Parasyte proves once and for all that when correctly combined with other genres and with some stellar writing, then it doesn't actually need to be scary in order to still be absolutely thrilling.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is easily one of the best shows of 2014, perhaps even *the* best depending on who you ask. It's a fantastically well-written show with great production value, lots of originality and above all an enormous amount of plain addictiveness. Granted, the ending is perhaps not the best one you'll ever see but it's still decent enough to not drag the show down as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're squeamish about blood and gore, or if you just don't like violence in general then you might want to take caution as Parasyte definitely has an abundance of that. Beyond that fact though, I would honestly recommend it to just about anyone. It's just that good.",

            "content": "This series opens with the time-tested anime narrative device of granting extraordinary power to an ordinary guy. Although it is an extremely common premise, that doesn\u2019t necessarily doom the series to the tired Shonen formula. I see it like moving a pawn as your opening move in Chess\u2014everyone from novice to master starts there. And so, to gauge the quality of an anime\u2019s storytelling one needs to watch how it plays out.\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThe story begins with Izumi, a geeky 12th grader, getting infested by an extraterrestrial parasite. This parasite, Migi, misses his intended target, the brain, and instead takes up residence in Izumi\u2019s right hand.Across the world similar, infestations are taking place with most of the parasites reaching their victim\u2019s brains, completely destroying the consciousness of the host and assuming control of their bodies. Unlike Migi, who survives on the nutrients within Izumi\u2019s blood stream, the other parasites sustain themselves by devouring human flesh. Out of a mutual desire to survive from the other hostile parasites, Izumi and Migi form a mutualistic alliance while trying to live a normal human life.\\n\\n\r\nThe first half of this anime straddles the line between plot-driven and monster-of-the-week. I don\u2019t have a problem with this as it essentially allows for the main characters and plot to develop separately, saving their intersection until later. The second half is when we start to run into trouble. When that \u2018intersection\u2019 finally arrives it is somewhat underwhelming. Many (but not all) of the plot elements that were painstakingly set up in the first 12 episodes are either unceremoniously negated or forgotten about later on. By the 2/3 mark, Parasyte becomes a different anime, with the plot losing a large portion of its scale and sense of urgency. It is still a great watch.\\n\\n\r\nI found the story to be far more mature and introspective than pretty much anything I\u2019ve seen since the first Psycho Pass. This anime generally succeeds in everything it sets out to do.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nDespite a few exceptions, only Migi and Izumi receive significant character development. Non-main characters are generally simplistic and sometimes appallingly forgetful of or indifferent to previously witnessed atrocities. They make it look easy to snap back from watching a bloodbath to resuming life \u2018business as usual\u2019. I found that part distracting and inconsistent with the story\u2019s more serious tone. Even the notable \u2018fleshed out\u2019 exceptions did feel somewhat engineered\u2014strategically set up to be killed off for the sake of advancing a narrow plot point. To be fair, isolation is a major theme in this anime and thus there really wasn\u2019t a place for Izumi to interact too substantively with others. However, there are several interesting characters who, at least in my opinion, received too light a dusting of personality or longevity to fulfill a deep purpose.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi: The concepts of change, evolution and hybridism are central themes in the storyline and are embodied in the main character Izumi. He starts out as a wussy high school kid but after fusing with Migi he begins to change in every way possible. There is a fascinating interplay between the biological effects of sustaining Migi, the psychological repercussions the duo\u2019s violent encounters and the natural process of maturing into adulthood. Izumi\u2019s metamorphosis happens steadily, inevitably and irreversibly. To some, Izumi\u2019s character development will seem rushed or disjointed but I disagree. As anime viewers, we have been force-fed the clich\u00e9, shonen character development formula--loser gets superpower, struggles with power, finds inner badass after an internal monologue, uses the power of angry emotions to power up and defeat the villain, rescues girl. While Parasyte begins with Izumi fusing with Migi\u2014an undeniable \u2018super power\u2019, the series is too ambitious to settle for such a simple, linear tale. Instead, the \u201crushed\u201d development simply cuts out the filler and makes room for a more mature story later on.\\n\\n\r\nMigi is one of those characters who almost everyone will love. If I have any problem with him it\u2019s that he\u2019s too likeable and distinct from the other sadistic and nightmarish parasytes. He\u2019s cute, deadly, witty and very very handy :). I say this half in jest but their companionship does mitigate some of the terror and solitude that a horror-tagged anime might suggest. This isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing though, and the literal and figurative synergy between Izumi and Migi is really fun to watch. Their versatility and teamwork makes me wish I too had a co-pilot in my body.\\n\\n\r\nMurano: She is Izumi\u2019s love interest. She\u2019s a boring, well-adjusted Japanese high school student.  I wouldn\u2019t call her a cardboard character but she\u2019s definitely put in the story to serve a well-defined role in the narrative. That being said, her purpose goes well beyond just propping up a romance subplot; she serves as a barometer of, and anchor for, Izumi\u2019s humanity. Everyone in the series changes to some degree but some much faster and divergently than others. This will make much more sense as you watch the series but I thought she was a very important--albeit somewhat uncharismatic\u2014piece of the story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork: 9/10\\n\r\nMasterfully done, a 9/10 easy. The backgrounds were beautifully constructed and the character faces were very finely drawn. I was particularly impressed by artists\u2019 ability to convincingly depict a wide variety of emotional states. At different points in the anime, the features of anguish, hope, coquettishness, anemia, fatigue, confidence, pensiveness, terror etc. were expertly captured with a rare, subtle elegance. The parasites were also very well drawn, especially the way they were shown to distort human faces and bodies in a way that was eerie rather than purely gratuitous. The fight scenes\u2014though often brief\u2014were superb, with the parasites executing an eerie, T-1000esque fluidity. My one complaint with the art is that Murano and Izumi\u2019s mother looked uncannily similar. I found it weird, distracting and altogether too Freudian for my liking. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nI liked the intro and found it ipod worthy however it may be to angsty for some. The 9/10 comes from the music in the episodes which were very memorable. I felt like it accentuated emotional or dramatic scenes very nicely. There is this really haunting and delicate piece that is played during introspective and tragic sequences. It\u2019s like xylophone music but it sends chills down my spine.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall it was an a great, high-quality and thought-provoking anime. The bizarre premise, insectoid motifs and strong theme of isolation remind me of Franz Kafka\u2019s Metamorphosis.",

            "content": "Parasyte is unlike many horror and Seinens we see today, its both of those done right. I really don't need to review this. To sum up this review, GO FUCKING WATCH THIS SHOW NOW!!!!!!! Now for the people who have time to read this, this show has been praised to the sun, it deserves the praise it gets, a well written plot, some really well developed characters, one of the best OPs like of all time, smart censoring and a goddamn blast to watch. Thats a second summarisation of this review...\r\nParasyte's story is truly unique from start to finish, it pulls you in with theidea of its alien like creatures known as 'parasites' it explains to you everything you need to know in its first ep. and then slaps you on your butt gently and then you're good to go. It really explores human society and how its one fucked up society. The problems would probably include how the pacing can sometimes be, slow, we see something happen but in a way where the show needs half a damn episode to explain, get to the point already! Also it can suffer from its story can be a little dull, we get focused on one parasite in the beggining of the story, which isn't really that important and later on we get some dull things to get you hyped for bigger things to come which really does ruin the show's mood.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are really well done. At first we have Izumi Shinichi, the main protagonist in this show, he seems like you're typical average student, but migi comes along and spices his life up (the second MC) and seeing how 2 different beings work together is pulled off well. We see how both grow as characters and slowly become badass. There's Murano, which many people hate, I liked her, she cared for Shinichi, she dosen't wanna see him go through bad things, she's there to help him with problems, in the manga she's way more of a bitch to how people talk about her, so no hate.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation is pretty good for the most part, its solid and some techniques of censorship is done really well, it leaves your imagination and thats really the true gore of it. The music is decent, the OP is goddamn amazing and upbeat while the ED dosen't really fit the show, its nice yet seems more fitting to a Slice of Life than a horror. The OSTs are good even though they're dubstep, but are creative for some scenes. The voice acting is done well and deserves bonus points for realism.\\n\\n\r\nThe show is a blast to watch, with tense ass action scenes and scenes that really get you on the edge of your seat, No dialouge is useless and it takes no time to waste your time unlike as I said earlier where some dialouge does seem to drag on. There was one episode in particular that made me bored but besides these little technical problems, you'll find not very much boredom.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9.3\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nCharacter: 9.5\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9.7\\n\\n\r\nParasyte stays true to its manga which is fucking 26 years old! Yes something that old can still be good. And as people say it 'Retro will always win'. Madhouse did a splendid job adapting and i give kootos to them and hope their future projects are as good as this, especially with a One Punch Man adaption on its way by themselves!

            "content": "Humans are bad. They ruin the beautiful planet earth. No, wait, humans are actually good and all bad people aren\u2019t humans. Eating meat is evil, or it\u2019s a part of nature. Killers kill because they\u2019re unrestrained and society is the only thing that keeps us from killing all that surrounds us. Planet earth is beautiful, and the fate of the world is in the hands of a teenage sex bomb and his, well, talking hand. Also, bass occasionally drops.\r\nThe concept isn\u2019t bad. A talking hand gains automatic Cool Points and it doesn\u2019t prevent the story from exploring deeper things. Having a sex bomb for amain character isn\u2019t a death sentence. It\u2019s when the anime juggles 90\u2019s Sci-Fi weirdness with no insight or boldness. The parasites are cool at first, but not for 24 episodes. Shinichi is a good-natured sex bomb and people are evil because they\u2019re evil, so where\u2019s the shock value?\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Parasyte isn\u2019t that it\u2019s stupid. The problem is that it wants to be smart. Too many times it points to a bigger idea, something about human nature and eating meat. Then it undoes every insight it has by having sex bomb characters, pornographic violence and cheap emotional manipulation. The techniques don\u2019t match the aim of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte ends up joining the ranks of pretentious grimdark anime who think violence equals depth. The violence is fun for a while. Limbs are torn off without a second thought. The Parasytes distort the human body in Cronenberg\u2019s favorite ways. You can\u2019t carry an entire show based on that though. The creators quickly run out of visual ideas. Besides the blades, muscle tissue and eyeballs everywhere the Parasytes don\u2019t have much to offer. Blood stops being shocking after a few gallons. The action scenes are hardly action scenes. A lot of fighting is simply blades clanging in the speed of light.\\n\\n\r\nClearly, the series wants to be more than a silly Sci-Fi story about bodysnatchers. It\u2019s hard to take it seriously when the lead character is a sex bomb and nobody points out how weird it is. Every female character with a speaking role expresses interest in him. The teenage ones\u2019 affection are clearly towards romantic. Does that sound like a harem premise to you?\\n\\n\r\nThe difference between this anime and other harems is that it\u2019s serious. It never addresses the fact all the females somehow love Shinichi. Yes, it should considering it happens so much. There\u2019s even beating up of another girl\u2019s asshole boyfriend. From a distance, the abundance of female characters is nice since stories like these are often criticized for the lack of female presence. Then again, if the main thing they do is to stroke the main character\u2019s ego what\u2019s the point?\\n\\n\r\nHaving sex bombs for characters in such serious shows is always funny. While the anime preaches to us about how horrible the world is, how horrible humans are and how dare we eat meat it forgets losers and winners are everywhere. Sexuality isn\u2019t some antidote to our violent nature. Sexuality and violence go hand-in-hand. Both have winners and losers, defeaters and defeated. The difference is, violence is more fair. Unless you disabled, you can use your fist. I guess the creators are all sex bombs too.\\n\\n\r\nIs calling Shinichi \u2018privileged\u2019 making me look insensitive? He loses people left and right, and yet he still comes off as a boring, privileged dude. External and internal troubles are not the same thing. Although a lot of terrible things happen to Shinichi, he has no internal struggle. He has no lens through which to view the horror.\\n\\n\r\nAttack on Titan is an obvious comparison. Both deal with an epic battle of humanity against another being, and in the center is a teenage superhero. Eren also loses loved ones and is knee deep in the abyss. Unlike Shinichi, he has a clear personality through which the suffering is filtered. Eren doesn\u2019t just feel bad over his troubles. He views them in his idealistic, hero-delusional lens. In contrast, Yukki (Future Diary) and Shinji (Neon Genesis Evangelion) react to the danger with fear and avoidance. Shinichi has no such lens. He gets sad and screams in sorrow for a while.\\n\\n\r\nNothing actually drives him. Survival doesn\u2019t count, since all organism are driven by survival (or well-being). He\u2019s barely active in the story. Things happen to him and that\u2019s it. The only decision he makes are whether to fight or flee. It almost sounds clever, since the anime wants to say something about how humans are still animals. Only it\u2019s not true, of course. Humans are the only organism who are aware of their own death, of their consciousness. You need such cognitive abilities to start thinking about existence. The Parasytes start going existential, too.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters die all the time. The light/dark contrast is clever and will never lose its shine. Here it ends up being a cheap trick. Nearly every character that\u2019s introduced will die. Some die in the same episode they\u2019re introduced. Others are lucky to survive a few more episodes. The game of \u2018who will die next?\u2019 may entertain some, but that\u2019s just gruesome RealiTV. It\u2019s easy to recognize who will die and how. Many characters die so Shinichi can grieve over them, feel bad and then not change. He doesn\u2019t have a personality that can change. The result is cheap manipulation of the viewer. Introduce a character, makes us relate to them and then rip their heads off.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a little spark, a little energy here. The anime is based on an old manga, and you can see it. The tropes and storytelling style all belongs in an older time, of moral heroes and sci-fi paranoia. It\u2019s another thing that\u2019s almost clever. They could\u2019ve mixed the moral heroism/optimism of Shinichi with the 90\u2019s techno-paranoia that gave us \u201cSpaceman\u201d. There\u2019s no attempt to bridge these two, though. Shinichi is moral for convenience and the darkness is here to shock. He would\u2019ve probably been one of Reznor\u2019s \u2018pigs\u2019 with how bland he is, or one of Manson\u2019s Beautiful People.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s nice the soundtrack keeps up with the times and gives us Bass Music of all kinds. I love Skrillex and Zomboy and Knife Party and all these. The soundtrack is so good, in fact, that I hope it will make its way to Excision\u2019s Shambhala mixes. Sadly, the few bass drops don\u2019t make up for a shitty story. They make it slightly more bearable.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is crap. There\u2019s no way around it. What starts off as fairly bizarre loses its shine quickly. It\u2019s another grimdark anime where people die violently and this is somehow reflective of how terrible life is. Parasyte plays a little more with light and dark, but in the end it all leads back to the abyss. Don\u2019t expect the depths you can get by going to suicide communities though. It\u2019s so much of an abyss as it is a black wall.\\n\\n\r\n1.5 bad Cronenberg movies out of 5",

            "content": "Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu or \"Parasyte\" was very interesting and kept me on edge almost the whole way through.\r\nI'm sure others will review this anime to the 'T' so this will be short and simple if you don't know if you'd like it.\r\nI'll break it down into the categories that we have to grade the anime on. I'll will try to avoid any insider spoilers other than common knowledge about the anime. I'll also try my best to explain (short n sweet style) why I gave it the score I did.\r\nStory- (9/10): The story, as you probably know is all about that 'Humanity' and havingit on the verge of being destroyed. That by itself is something I'm extremely interested in (Attack on Titan sort of anime) so I'm all ears at this point. I have to say, it does deliver. Its not the impact left after watching attack on titan (obviously) but it had its own twist that I'm sure anyone would love to watch. It's an experience that pulls the heart strings, gets your blood pumping and makes you want the next episode immediately. I was very happy with it.\\n\\n\r\nArt- (9/10): I love them gory anime, know what I mean? This anime looks pretty without a doubt from the very first episode. Once you see the 'Monsters' attack and eat, it's crazy. I rate art usually on how nice it is to watch and how smooth everything happens. They did a very good job in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound- (8/10): There isn't anything wrong with this soundtrack so I bounced between 7 and 8 for this score. Its nothing amazing but it went with the show. In a situation where everything's going to hit the fan, its kicks up some dubstep. Made my battles scenes all the better to watch.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- (9/10): The characters were mostly parasites, mostly. With that being said, they had their own attitude and general mind set for domination. It was really something. With the exceptions of a few parasites that didn't make a host of the human, which made matters even more interesting. It was a pleasure to watch everyone develop and the plot thicken over time. I'm positive that the characters make this show what it is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall- (9/10): This is a solid 9 in my book and other fans of the show probably agree. It had me hooked to the point that when I started an episode, it was over instantly. I can't say many shows do that for me. Watching someone get their head chopped off or the main protagonist figure out if this right hard is a friend or foe is just a great watch. If you want a show that delivers a good story, no ecchi, and plenty of gore then this is your show. It's nuts.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kiseijuu (I'm just going to call it \"Parasyte\" from now on) is an adaptation from an over 20 year old manga by Hitoshi Iwaaki. The premise of Parasyte is nothing new by today's standards of anime or science fiction in general, but considering the source material's age, it's quite impressive and I think Madhouse did a pretty good job bringing it into animation form. One of Parasyte's strongest aspects in my opinion was the great dynamic between the two main characters, Shinichi and his parasitic \"buddy\" Migi and how they have to start co-existing with each other after the plot kicks in. Said plot flowspretty well for the most part and our two heroes always have something to do. This starts from Migi learning how the modern world functions by reading books or even surfing the web, to roaming the streets and interacting with other human beings at school, to fighting other Parasytes who - unlike Migi - have taken over their host's complete brain and body and start killing and eating people all over town in a not really subtle way.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course the threats get bigger and the stakes are raised quite often as the story progresses and this leads to some well-done character development for Shinichi and even Migi, who at first only has his own survival in top priority. The character development really feels natural and there weren't any parts which stroked me as odd or forced, except for the characters suddenly having to spout preachy monologues near the end of the show. But sadly the praise in the character department pretty much ends there, since the supporting cast is rather lacking to say the least, especially the female ones. Shinichi's somewhat girlfriend and her friends take the cake, their personalities are rather flat and one-noted and they seem like plot devices serving to Shinichi unfolding as a character and occasionally driving the story along. Not to say that they are terrible, but it just seems ironic to me that the Parasyte Migi feels more human than some of the actual humans in the series. There are some other stand-out characters as well, especially the Parasyte called \"Tamura Reiko\" who has an interesting character arc and makes for an intriguing sort-of antagonist from the beginning to the mid-portion of the plot, she was a good addition to the cast and allowed the alien Parasytes to be seen from a completely different light.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I particularly liked about the show was that it didn\u2019t fall apart at a certain point; it practically stayed true to itself and even took some time to introduce us to the protagonist\u2019s daily life world before everything went more or less to shit. It also didn\u2019t go down the wrong path and turned into a mindless fighting Shounen in which fan\u2019s most discussed topics revolve around power levels and how cool the masks look (I don\u2019t care about how the manga is) instead of themes or characters. It sadly took some head scratching detours at times and even became a bit preachy near the end. The ending wasn\u2019t exactly what I would call a satisfying climax either, but the writing stayed consistent, the pacing was solid with hardly any downtimes and there was barely any filler content, if at all.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte also has its fair share of action bits and Studio Madhouse did a good job at them for the most part, but you can clearly notice that they spread their budget too thick in the beginning and the quality of the animation dropped noticeably after the first six or so episodes, which was very disappointing, but they\u2019ll probably fix the biggest issues In the Blu-Ray release anyway, which I am not reviewing right now, though. While there were some really detailed and very fluid bits of animation in some fight scenes, the character models became quite inconsistent as the show went on and there was quite some detail put into some scenes, but others were plain awful. Character models also look rather plain and they often use cheap 3DCG to animate non-important pedestrians or crowds of students for example, which looks jarring. It really looked downright average at some points, which is not understandable considering they often delayed episodes for a week or so. The general directing and presentation of the show felt a bit underwhelming as well at times, but to the show's credit it used some well made visuals effects in some fights or dream like sequences of Shinichi and others.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound many people\u2019s first complains were \u201cThe dubstep sounds like shit\u201d, and they weren\u2019t completely wrong, but the soundtrack does have its moments and when it wants to shine, it definitely does. Not all tracks have this dubstep tunes to them and are quite beautiful to listen to, even on their own. The Opening and Ending Themes are a mixed bag as well. While I think the Ending Theme \u2013 while not being bad - was quite out of place in the beginning, it fit almost perfectly near the end of the show. But! And that\u2019s a big BUT; I found the Opening Theme to be really atrocious. In terms of music AND vocals, I couldn\u2019t even recognize if they were singing in Japanese or English, it was definitely a mood killer at some points.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the voice actors did a great job on all fronts, from Shinichi and Migi, who were voiced absolutely brilliant, to some of the shorter appearances as well. All the needed emotions came across believable and the voices matched their looks nicely too. No complains there.\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time for the final verdict:\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is a nicely written show with a great duo of main characters which mostly stays true to what it initially sets up and some really gripping moments, it was a master of tension at some points. The presentation might be a bit lacking, the show's budget was mishandled and the soundtrack mostly consisting of dubstep and the rather lackluster appearing ending might not match everyone\u2019s tastes and expectations, but it remains a well done Sci-Fi thriller with some interesting ideas, a well fleshed out and natural setting with only a few loose ends. If you like these types of stories or especially if you\u2019re a fan of shows like Tokyo Ghoul, but don\u2019t mind the lesser focus on action but more on characters and plot, I can definitely recommend this show to you. It\u2019s one of the better shows to come out of 2014 and even 2015 so far for sure.\\n\\n\r\nRATING: \\n\\n\r\nSTORY SECTION: 8/10\\n\r\nPremise 2/2 (interesting)\\n\r\nPacing 2/2 (fast with no real downtime and basically filler free)\\n\r\nComplexity 1/2 (not much)\\n\r\nPlausibility 2/2 (set up its world and mechanics very well)\\n\r\nConclusion 1/2 (a bit underwhelming, but solid)\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER SECTION: 8/10\\n\r\nPresence 1/2 (except the main two fairly generic)\\n\r\nPersonality 2/2 (some are strong, some are weak, but well founded)\\n\r\nBackdrop 1/2 (there is some far and few in between)\\n\r\nDevelopment 2/2 (great and natural development on the main characters)\\n\r\nCatharsis 2/2 (solid)\\n\\n\r\nART SECTION: 6/10\\n\r\nGeneral Artwork 1/2 (basic)\\n\r\nCharacter Figures 1/2 (rather samey with mostly no distinct features)\\n\r\nBackgrounds 1/2 (rather generic but solid)\\n\r\nAnimation 1/2 (good in the beginning, got weaker later on)\\n\r\nVisual Effects 2/2 (some nice touches here and there)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND SECTION: 7/10\\n\r\nVoice Acting 3/3 (pretty good performed all around)\\n\r\nMusic Themes 2/4 (I didn\u2019t like the dubstep, some other tracks were good to great)\\n\r\nSound Effects 2/3 (ok, I guess)\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT SECTION: 6/10\\n\r\nArt 0/1 (looks fairly generic)\\n\r\nSound 1/2 (songs are a mixed bag but the voice acting is good)\\n\r\nStory 2/3 (presented nicely for the most part and was engaging, meh ending)\\n\r\nCharacters 3/4 (great main characters but mostly forgettable side characters)\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT: 7/10",

            "content": "\u201cYou sacrifice other lives so that your own life can continue. That is how animals live. Humans are one of a kind creatures that commit suicide.\u201d \u2013 Migi, Episode 3\r\nHumanity is a fascinating subject. What does it truly mean to be human? Do extraterrestrial beings exist? If so, do they emote the same as we do? Surely this is a greatly exhausted topic of conversation, but one that never ceases to be interesting. Why are humans naturally altruistic? Is that what separates us from the creatures of the Earth? Parasyte The Maxim, adapted from a late 80\u2019s manga by the illustrious studio Madhouse, takes theseconcepts and crafts a brilliantly paced suspense-thriller that hammers these questions home.\\n\\n\r\nShinichi Izumi is a timid, mild-mannered high school student who fits most of the normal \u201cSlice of Life\u201d quotas. He has the normal stresses of a teenager, and has a love interest made apparent from the very beginning. Shinichi becomes infected by a parasite, whose true origin is unknown. Instead of taking over the brain like most of its cohorts, the parasite (named \u201cMigi\u201d by his host) is stunted, thus limiting his control to the right arm. Migi\u2019s introduction allows Izumi to do things he couldn't possibly do under normal circumstances, and causes his arm to take on a mind of its own. The rest of the series follows Izumi and Migi\u2019s relationship as they adapt to survive and attempt to clarify the blurred lines of humanity.\\n\\n\r\nAs I much as I loved the series overall, I can't say I cared for the beginning as much. Instead of taking the time to flesh out the main cast ahead of time, the writers drop us in the midst of a parasite infestation from the very first episode. This puts a check in the action column, but forgets about the development one. The result is a protagonist that we really only know in tragedy, and a bunch of other characters that seem mostly reactionary in nature. It's really a double-edged sword. Sure, we get comments from Satomi (Shinichi\u2019s love interest) about how he\u2019s changed, but the comparison material is absent.\\n\\n\r\nThe first major positive about Parasyte is its outstanding pacing. There are no unwarranted time gaps or over extended fight scenes, resulting in an ebb and flow, with a suspenseful story line. Most of the time it appeared as though Shinichi was just struggling to stay alive, invoking a real sense of panic into each scene. I will say that the script writers did a fantastic job engaging the audience into an exciting and dramatic show. I get that some purists will disagree, citing that the anime doesn't stay true to the manga but I'm getting kind of tired of hearing that incessant argument\u2026. it's not going to change anything.\\n\\n\r\nWith an anime whose characters exhibit supernatural qualities, there's really only two ways to approach it: either the oddity is explained via some \u201cmade up\u201d reason, or nothing is said about it at all. The latter approach is one of the biggest complaints many people have about the series. Whether it's the random humans that can detect parasites based on intuition or the smorgasbord of a villain Gotou was, breaking many rules of the parasites themselves, it can be a tad frustrating. Perhaps less time could've been spent fighting the final enemy, and more time devoted to wrapping up loose ends. Although, you could also argue that the origin of the parasites was not the intent of the show\u2019s message\u2026 which is personally how I feel. To be honest, I really didn't care where they came from because I was more focused on the intricate relationship between the parasites and the humans.\\n\\n\r\nThis brings me to the exploration of themes present within Parasyte. I've seen other anime that involve creatures attempting to comprehend humanity (HxH\u2019s Chimera Ant Arc for example), and it's intriguing to see the similarities and differences across each series. It's possible that I'm more obsessed with the idea itself then the way it was handled specifically here, but it was still captivating nonetheless. Could these instinctive beings, who were so initially focused on vanquishing the human race, really know how to empathize or imitate human behavior? This is largely illustrated in the growth of Migi. Despite possessing an innate desire to protect only itself, Migi eventually learns to bond with and even depend on Shinichi. You could say at the end that they're even best friends. Ryouko Tamiya\u2019s arc is just as interesting, and she's possibly the most developed character of the entire cast. The message exists that quite possibly the parasites really aren't so much different than humans, and that our very existences threaten each other\u2019s. It's a race to see who\u2019s eradicated first. It can get a bit preachy and repetitive towards the end (most notably the mayor\u2019s speech), but still resonates.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development of the parasites is far superior to that of the humans, with many of the side characters being quite useless or convenient. For someone who\u2019s so focused on throughout the anime, Shinichi\u2019s development is there, but it\u2019s just not enough substance. I had a difficult time adjusting to the massive change he underwent midway through the series, and I would've liked to see a bit more time spent on what he was \u201cthinking\u201d outside of battle strategies. Most of the \u201chuman\u201d women in this series are also incredibly dense. I'm not sure if this was on purpose, but many of them seemed to do such drastic things without fear of consequence. Shinichi acted more on saving damsels in distress than exterminating the parasites at times. In the aforementioned paragraph I discussed the great characterization Migi and Ryouko underwent, convoluting the notion that parasites are inherently evil even more. It was brilliantly approached.\\n\\n\r\nAnimators assigned to Parasyte certainly had their work cut out for them adapting the evocatively dark manga. I feel they did a superb job keeping the ominous and menacing nature of the parasites and gore scenes while maintaining the necessary level of censorship. The way the shot would shift during various character\u2019s dismemberment was done with finesse and barely made you notice how purposeful it was. The character models were modernized appropriately and the parasites looked terrifying and intricate during the action sequences. The OP was also fantastically timed and strung together.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte is quite the mixed bag when it comes to the music. The OP always got me pumped with its unique blend of AutoTune and hardcore, though it kind of waned on me when I realize they were speaking broken Wnglish through the verses O_o. The ED on the other hand did its best to kill any type of tension or suspense built up from the end of each episode. The worst instance was when it was used as its full version during one of the episodes. The track sounded more like a Boyz2Men song than a part of an anime OST. The EDM tracks get overused at the beginning of the series, but I really enjoyed the rest of the soundtrack. A seamless transition of tracks between scenes. Perhaps the greatest achievement in sound within Parasyte is the voice acting. A star-studded cast shines brightly in each of the major roles here, and some of the inflections in their voices were shrill and desperate. \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I enjoyed Parasyte more than I should have given it's flaws, but the flawless pacing and nail-biting suspense made it an anime I'll truly remember for a long time. Plus, the thematic exploration and talented acting was right up my alley. Understandably, there are a plethora of loose ends and unanswered questions to be had, plus a few character development problems\u2026 but overall I think it's a solid series. I recommend it greatly, especially those who are looking for a gripping story with a strong underlying message. Thanks for reading!",

            "content": "I will keep this short and sweet. I enjoyed this anime. It's animation is average and the pattern of the story isn't unusual or overly unique. It's a parasitic life form which tries to take over the brain and eats humans in order to live. One little parisite doesn't quite make it to the brain and so we have a human with a talking parasite as his right hand. There is plenty of blood and fighting and characters actually do die ect. The story is good, but that isn't what really drew me in. I love how the story addressed so many complex and relevantquestions. I enjoyed watching two characters who saw the world and humans differently. I also enjoyed the fact that the anime didn't look at the parasites as being all bad. It actually looked at the posibility that the parasites were good and despite the difference in thinking, were very similar to humans. I feel this is one of those animes that make you think but also try to look at the situations from an unconventional manner. Not only that, but I think it did a very good job at doing so. I also enjoyed the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime also has a good ending. It's not the ending I wanted (because I didn't want it to end yet) but it wraped things up neatly. It left possibilities for a second season, but it didn't make it feel unfinished, so if there is no second season, it wouldn't be problem. Questions were answered and there weren't a ton of loose ends. It felt complete. I feel that is something that very few animes manage to accomplish, so that alone scores some major points.\\n\\n\r\nSee I told you this one would be short, and for once I stayed true to my word. I bet you didn't see that one coming!",

Parasyte leaves you craving to know more, and keeps you company with a charming creature character.\r\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\r\nParasyte is the best anime of 2014 (and likely 2015). I say this with confidence.\r\nThe story is about parasitic creatures that invade human bodies, taking over the brain and replacing the person. Not \u201ccontrolling\u201d them, but straight up taking residence. Your main character (MC) gets a parasite, too, but the creature fails to capture his brain. The parasite ends up taking over his right arm giving that arm shape shifting abilities.\r\nTurns out, the parasites are sentient creatures. The MC\u2019s parasite gets a name: Migi. It means \u201cright hand.\u201dInstead of a being a monster, Migi turns out to be the best (and most adorable) character of the show. It\u2019s not even a contest. He\u2019s curious, he speaks his mind, he cares, he\u2019s logical\u2014he\u2019s a little Spock.  The MC himself isn\u2019t too bad either. He has development: going from a wimp to getting a new haircut and a girlfriend\u2014and being less of a wimp.\\n\\n\r\nThe plotting is addicting. You\u2019ll learn more and more about the parasites. You\u2019ll find yourself popping one episode after another to see what happens next. It\u2019s 24 episodes, but they go by fast. If you weren\u2019t forced to catch this weekly then you\u2019re lucky. The rest of us suffered every week. The episodes seemed like they lasted 5 minutes a piece.\\n\\n\r\nThe action is engaging because there\u2019s always this real possibility the MC and Migi could be killed by other parasites. They\u2019re forced to strategize about their encounters. There\u2019s no power of friendship to save them. Plus, the MC has to keep Migi a secret so the whole show has this fundamental layer of tension. They even have to grapple with moral dilemmas.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is good enough. It\u2019s not particularly detailed or interesting to look at. It\u2019s a faithful adaptation, but they should\u2019ve added their own changes. It could\u2019ve used more hand jokes with Migi. Some characters deserved more screen time. But these are all very minor negatives. Did I mention the awesome dubstep?\\n",

            "content": "Ah, Parasyte. An anime about mankind, humanity, humans, aliens and dubst-\r\nHey, I'm Jumpy. Here's my review of Parasyte.\r\nParasyte is an anime by Madhouse, about a teenager called Izumi, that suddenly is attacked by this worm thing and now has a Parasyte in his right hand, which he names Migi. Let's get to the point; is Parasyte good? Well, yes, but it's hard to say. It has great moments, the story is actually pretty good and for the most part, well executed. Even though the pacing was, sometimes, all over the place, it tried to keep itself in one route and succeded at that.\r\nThe characters inthe anime are a bit too easy to judge, actually. Izumi and Migi are great and both are well developed, but the others... Well, not so much. Murano is a very cheesy 80's chick. It really felt out of place and kinda weird, but that's one thing. It does feel like that, because the manga was made in the 80's. Madhouse adapted this anime now, in 2014, but they didn't really wanna put us in the 80's setting, so they shoehorned the internet and cellphones in this, which really can take a few viewers out of the anime. This would make more sense if it was set in the 80's, because with the internet and phones now in this generation, I don't think these monsters can hide for more than a day without being posted on Facebook. I feel like this was a stupid move, and they should've kept it in the 80's, but that's just one large nitpick.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, other than Murano being a whiny shit about Izumi changing all the time, the characters were all pretty good. Yes, not all of them, but for the most part, they were alright.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty cool. I liked it. People complain about the CGI, but to be honest, I never really noticed it. I did researched a few of the CGI in the show, which is mostly crowds and some action scenes, but they never really took me out of the anime like some other ones. You know, Aldnoah.Zero...Yeah. \\n\\n\r\nPeople complain about the soundtrack, but that's completely subjective. It comes to your taste in music, and I personally liked it. The dubstep was pretty good and so was the OP and ED. One thing I will admit is that some dubstep background songs will be playing while people are talking and/or standing, which looks kinda dumb when the drop happens in the song. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, Parasyte is a pretty good watch and despite some of its flaws, I thought it was pretty great, it had a good story with likable and great characters, and I didn't mind the CGI nor Dubstep. It's pretty hard to rate the show, (for me at least) because my enjoyment gets in the way, but here's how I'll settle it. \\n\r\nParasyte is a 7/10. If I include my enjoyment, which was rather high, I would give Parasyte an 8/10. We good? We good. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my first review here on MAL but I felt that this anime was certainly deserving of being my first.\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nUpon completion of the anime I went back through and did a quick run through of it again, the story is well developed, but it isn't without a few problems here and there. Without spoiling too much the main problem I have with it is the parasites origins, and how it was never really explained. This was left a mystery even at the very end, and overall I felt that it could've lent a little closure to all the characters. It also felt somewhatrushed at times, but not to any major extremes so I felt it deserved a 9.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe first glimpses of the art, animation, and character designs may not have seemed impressive, but upon watching it a second time I was really impressed with how they didn't go overboard, and add too much or too little detail. Everything from the houses, buildings, exteriors, and even the gore and battle scenes were really well balanced. The battle scenes were especially well done in this regard, they easily could've hammed it up and made it intolerable, or made them far too quick and left them lacking. So for excellent balance in the art department this I give a firm 10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for this anime is excellent, and that is not an easy feat in my opinion. They managed to take several genres and styles of music and use them really effectively. At no point did I feel that the music was repetitive, and it always complimented what was going on instead of overpowering it. The opening and ending themes were excellent choices as well going perfectly in there respective spots, and I have to say it's the first time in a long time that I've watched every episode beginning to end listening to both.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I wish I could find at least 1 character to complain about I really can't. Every character felt very realistic like someone you could easily know in real life, instead of a generic anime stereotype. Migi and Shinichi were well portrayed and I have to give credit to their voice actors and whoever recruited them because they did a perfect job. The interaction between all of the characters was extremely well done, and at no point did I ever find my self questioning why a particular character did what they did. So with that the characters have earned a well deserving 10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nAs someone who has watched well over 100 anime, I can say that this is easily taking a spot in my top 5. I became attached to most of the characters parasites included, and this has been one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had with an anime since I began watching as a kid. If I were to give 1 complaint it would be that this series deserved a longer run maybe 1 or 2 more episodes on it to close it out, however the ending as is was extremely well done, and I can not fault it at all for where it did end so I'm giving it a hard 10.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is near perfect, and as mentioned before is certainly going into my top 5 favorite anime. From beginning to end it kept me invested with the story, the art and animation were perfectly balanced, the music and themes were well chosen and used, the characters were believable and sounded the way they should, and it has been an overwhelmingly enjoyable experience. Despite some minor complaints that really were out of the staffs control this has been one of the best anime I have ever had the privilege to watch, and I would recommend it to anyone as a good anime to start out with, as long as their not a small child. This has earned the 10 that I'm giving it, and I hope that others can watch this masterpiece and see for them selves what can be done in a great anime like it.",

            "content": "We have all been familiar with the concept of aliens landing on Earth and trying to achieve world domination. This has been recycled in films and TV shows many times successfully or disappointingly. However, an anime which came out in winter 2014 and finished early 2015 more or less dealt with the theme of man versus aliens. But, this particular anime portrays this concept in such a way that seems very plausible if you ask me!\r\nThe story is about a high school boy named Izumi Shinichi *yep ANOTHER high school nerd*  who lives in Tokyo with his parents. His life was normal until oneparticular day these alien lifeforms known as Parasytes rain down from the sky and take humans as their hosts by taking control of their brain. A parasite threatens to do the same to Shinichi while he is asleep, however it is unable to do so because Shinichi was wearing headphones *I swear Beats missed a perfect opportunity to have a product placement over here*.  Anyway, the parasite then gets inside his right arm and is unable to seize Shinichi\u2019s brain. As a result, Shinichi now has to deal with the fact his right hand is a dangerous alien being that now solely depends on our him to survive. He names the parasite in his right hand Migi which is Japanese for \u2018right hand\u2019. The series mainly focuses on the two\u2019s relationship and the encounters they have with other parasytes. Not to mention, the struggles Shinichi faces in this show.\\n\\n\r\nNow, even before I started watching this show I knew that I was in for a treat. The story sounded very interesting despite the fact I\u2019m not the biggest sci-fi fan. And also because the Parasyte manga in case you didn\u2019t know was published during the 80s and it got an anime adaptation like recently. So, I was really curious to see whether the anime would take place during that time period or will take place in modern times.  Well, they chose the latter and I must admit it works to the show\u2019s advantage very much.\\n\\n\r\nThe modern setting in my opinion was necessary in the development of Migi\u2019s character if you ask me. Because throughout the show he does gain his knowledge from the internet. Migi thanks to the internet ends up being a walking encyclopaedia, while the rest of us waste our time debating about the colours of a stupid dress! The show may not have had the most original setting considering the fact parasites and ghouls apparently lurk in the same area, however they successfully managed to tell the story in a different time period!\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in the show are relatable, real people who have their fair share of problems. First of all, let\u2019s talk about our main lead Shinichi. He reminds me of another character who deals with a drastic change in his life, and the way they both get developed is more or less the same.  Shinichi at first is weak and frail guy who was living in a  harem anime until the parasites arrived. The next thing Shinichi knew that he jumped from Clannad to fucking Tokyo Ghoul.\\n\\n\r\nBut, in all seriousness I really liked the character of Shinichi. He has been through a lot in the series and instead of being a wuss  he does whatever he can to survive and he constantly tries to help the ones around him. He also becomes a badass after the death of a certain character which causes him to become stoic like Migi and the rest of the parasites. Then again after the death of another important character Shinichi becomes human again which I thought was very ironic and also well executed.\\n\\n\r\nNow, his right hand is a character of his own. I loved how Migi\u2019s character was very developed in the series where he starts of this calm and emotionless parasite that always thinks practically and will do anything for only his survival. He doesn\u2019t really care about Shinichi at first let alone the humans. However, as the series progresses Migi and Shinichi\u2019s friendship blossoms.\\n\\n\r\nI would also like to talk about Tamura Reiko, who starts of as a brutal and emotionless parasite that ends up being pregnant with a human child.  A first she was considering to experiment with it or eat it, however the woman has a change of heart and actually grows to care for the child. After twenty episodes of seeing what huge assholes parasites can be, I didn\u2019t expect one of them to actual develop such human characteristics. And I am glad that she did change which caused her to be more likeable and relatable. I wish she would have gotten more screen time, but none the less she was one of the best characters the show had to offer.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest sadly were not very well developed ranging from Shinchi\u2019s parents to his friends. Shinichi\u2019s love interest does get some development towards the end but throughout the series she was nothing more than just a potato. Then again, I guess being a potato is better than being what the rest of those undeveloped losers are.\\n\\n\r\nAlso, only one death was truly sad whereas the others just didn\u2019t make the audience care that much. Mainly because the characters didn\u2019t get much development before having them literally chopped off from the show. Also, their deaths were also very predictable due to all the flashback and dream sequences.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing was a real let down was its inconsistent pacing. In my opinion the show started out great, but through out the middle it got a little slow however by the last seven or eight episodes things became twice as great than it was at the beginning. It\u2019s not a major issue in fact, but it\u2019s slow progress in the middle might cause people to drop the show. However that\u2019s just how I felt while watching the show, you might have seen it in a different light than me.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack for the show hands down deserves a Grammy.There was only one opening and I salute this show for not changing it to something crappy in between.The opening is without a doubt one of the best I have seen in the past year and it still stands out today among very stiff competition. It was very well animated and I also loved how the opening foreshadowed what will happen in the show without making it too obvious. The song Let Me Hear by Fear and Loathing Las Vegas really helps me get into the mood of the show. The song really gets me pumped for it and you just don\u2019t skip this hella good opening. I mean you just can\u2019t it\u2019s that awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song comparatively is much calmer, which I guess the audience needs after an intense episode. The background music overall was really good and it really helped set the mood during some scenes. However, I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the use of dubstep of the show mainly because I hate dubstep, but hey that\u2019s my opinion and for that reason I am not counting the dubstep as a flaw. The music that plays especially during the sad moments or the moments shared by Murano and Izumi truly stand out in numerous ways, like seriously I want this music to play when I die.\\n\\n\r\nThe show, I heard was more or less faithful to the manga and I am glad that Madhouse was able to pull off a good adaptation of the series. Then again, it\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t expect anything but greatness from Madhouse . The animation was really good if not great and the character designs were still very amazing, despite the fact they are a little outdated. The show overall had this dark and serious tone but when they had some comedy in there, they handled it very well. There wasn\u2019t much comedy not that it needed more comedy but the scenes that were supposed to be hilarious really were very well executed.\\n\\n\r\nNow the ending of the show, in my opinion was amazing and it managed to bring a smile on my face. I basically wanted an ending like this and I am glad I got it. However, I am not sure if others would agree with me, but don\u2019t worry the ending was nothing like the load of turd \u2018Lost\u2019 served us. The ending in my opinion didn\u2019t ruin the series but in fact it managed to wrap everything up very well.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, the show did have several plotholes though as some things remained unresolved like where did the parasytes come from and yes we more or less get an understanding of why they arrived, but I really wanted to know since the beginning from where they originated or did someone create them? Also, another thing I am curious about is how Cana was able to sense the presence of Parasytes. I wish the show would have offered us an explanation to how she was able to have such psychic abilities. Okay the serial killer\u2019s reason to have this ability makes sense, but what about Cana\u2019s? Well actually the serial killer distinguishes based on people\u2019s behavior whereas Cana on the other seemed to have some psychic abilities which never really got cleared up, which was really sad!\\n\\n\r\n Despite its flaws, Parasyte the Maxim is without one of the best series I have ever watched in recent times and it might just go down in anime history with the greats. I would highly recommend this show to those who love the sci-fi genre .\\n",

            "content": "Humans are the smartest creatures in existence right? We have brilliant mental processes, reasoning and thoughts which are astonishing in comparison to other organisms. But, what if we came across an organism which was exactly like us? And worse still, a threat to us?\r\nParasyte follows the life of Shinichi, a shy, average 17 year old who's life was turned upside down after a parasyte named Migi burrowed into his right arm. The story documents Shinichi fighting against parasytes who have taken other people's whole bodies, as well as trying to come to terms with their existence.\r\nIn terms of a genre, Parasyte isn't far enough tobe classed as a horror, but more as a sci-fi thriller, and it's the thriller aspect of the show they succeed at. Atmospherically, the sudden switch from the norm for Shinichi's life almost has a direct effect on the viewer, as in the first few episodes, the fast pace of the story allows us to relate to Shinichi struggling to come to terms with parasytes who are looking to attack him. It's almost as if both the viewer and Shinichi is thrown into the deep end straight away. As a story, Patasyte tries to view a possibility of a symbiotic relationship between humans and parasytes, as well as empathizing with a species that, with a high amount of knowledge like humans, gets killed off due to them being feared as they kill humans. Parasyte looks at survival of the fittest, whether it be for humans or parasyte, and thus leads the show to take more of a philosophical route. Are humans really morally just in its treatment of other species? These questions are constantly made throughout. Lastly, Shinichi's life is turned upside down and the story looks at how him becoming half parasyte-half human affects his own beliefs, his family and his friends around him.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main weaknesses of the show are it's pacing, the message the story tried to make and the ending. In terms of pacing, the fast paced start at the beginning lead the show to become interesting early on, as we wanted to gain more information about how parasytes are, how they think ext. However, the pace of the story couldn't keep up with its fast paced start, which lead to a decrease in character development which couldn't occurred later on, secondly, there were many instances in scenes which felt very rushed and uncomfortable, as it didn't seem to fit well with what was going on at the time. Furthermore, the message it tried to get across seemed too cheap. Although it clearly showed how inhumane humans can be, it was almost mixed up in trying to decide whether to understand where parasytes came from, or to try and understand them, or both. Lastly, the ending mainly was an upset due to it coming across as a filler, as well as the constant repeat of its philosophical message.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation, the battle scenes really do spice up the thriller aspect of the show, with the fluid animation of fighting in full view. Very typical of madhouse to make sure the show was given a great feel with the brilliant lighting, as well as making darkness that bit more sinister.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in parasyte are done to a acceptable standard. Shinichi and Migi make up the the main characters of the show, with both equally sharing the spotlight because of their symbiotic relationship. Shinichi is developed very quickly in a very short space of time, due to the events of parasytes attacking him, as well as killing others lead to Shinichi to overcome drastic changes, which cause a devastating effect to his family life and his life at school. He turns from shy and fragile to assertive and calm for the most part. He constantly undergoes many internal struggles to find the answers in understanding parasytes, as well as humans too. Migi comes off as more of an interesting character, as his lack of emotion as a parasyte comes across as simplistic at the start, as he helps shinichi defeat other parasytes, but Migi also tries to empathize with humans too. Finally Tamura Reiko, a parasyte who had taken over a teachers body acts as main embodiment of the relationship between parasyte and humans, with her theories and beliefs ever present in the shows message.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the main criticism of the cast is towards Murano, shinichi's partner. She is very much useless in terms of what she brings to the show, as her stance mainly stays the same throughout, as she constantly repeats \"shinichi, you've changed\" over and over again. Furthermore, she tends to be neglected for large portions of the story, making her influence on the show very slight.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music and OST, parasyte has a very quirky soundtrack, with many battle scenes containing dub step music, which fits in quiet well. Not to mention the increased suspense it gives to certain scenes. Also, the opening song was sort of a cross between techno and rock, which I wasn't a huge fan of. But I did personally lie the mellow j-pop ending.\\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, parasyte started off as a show with potential to become a stand out show, which it had done based on the epic battles and interesting concept, but failed as story.",

For the first 5 episodes i was a little so/so on the show. The main character just wasn't for me at the time. But after a big change happens he really starts to come through and become the hero he needs to be. The part i liked the most about parasyte was the fact that it teaches how the world needs balances. Not all parasytes are monsters they just need to eat to survive, while others are in fact \"monsters'. But at theend of the show they show us how people can be monsters as well.\\n\\n\r\nI wish there was more to this show, a second season would be wonderful even if it didn't follow Shinichi Izumi and instead was in the future about another Person infected with a parasyte. I recommended that everyone give this show a try and if you don't like it at first don't give up after a couple episodes. A solid 9.4/10 overall",

He's only in between, and feels as a total outcastto both human and parasyte, best way to describe this feeling is those children who were born of white and black parents back in the day(they were shunned by both races).\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, the story is a pretty good one, not too many flaws, however, there's one really stupid plot twist at the very end, with Uragami, Izumi, and Satomi...... that's not how you end an anime imo!!!! Really stupid, like why would you leave Satomi behind when Uragami is a know serial-rapist-killer........ that was just stupid....\\n\\n\r\nArt: Love the artwork, very nice feel to it and the fight scenes are amazing!\\n\\n\r\nSound: The voice acting is pretty well done, they nailed down Migi's voice pretty well too! My critique is some of the music is very unfitting at times though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Probably the weakest part of this anime. Lets see most of the female cast is just garbage.... except for Tamiya Reiko, she gets really great character development in this one. The love relationship with Izumi and Satomi just didn't do it for me. I didn't really care for them, and Kana was annoying at times. A weak female cast of characters does ruin the score of this anime... \\n\\n\r\nOverall, pass all those negatives this is still a really good anime!",

The show is full of action, intellectual discussion, and touching moments between human characters and parasites alike. My only issue over the story is that by the end there were some plot points which were overlooked and not discussed. This could be seen as grounds for another season or an excuseto read the manga (note that I usually watch the anime before reading the manga because it prevents me from being overly critical of what is different between the two). The art is excellent, the soundtrack was extremely impressive, and there weren't very many characters that I was indifferent about, which is a big deal for me to connect to the characters. Shinichi in particular goes through interesting character growth and development, which aids in the overall feel of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I rated the show an 8/10. \\n\r\nIt was very good in almost every category, but not the best anime that I have ever seen.\\n\r\nParasyte has an interesting plot, but at the same time is similar to a large number of anime that has been released recently.

            "content": "Hello, humans. This is Ebb a parasite living in mercury1980's body. If you were wondering what happened to mercury1980, he just got caught in an accident and he is severely injured. And now I am supposed to make him recover and do this review. Instead I am supposed to review this anime on the behalf of him. I took most of his memory from this anime so that I can take time to process what is going on. With that said, let's get onto the review.\r\nSTORY (8):\r\nThis anime follows a human being, Shinichi Izumi who lives with his parents in Tokyo. Parasites like us arealien worm creatures who enter human body to take control of human brains. One parasite took control of Shinichi's hand and they form a duo. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime took the time to develop the characters of Shinichi & his right arm. I thought their chemistry was handled well. The story also addressed how parasites originate and it was an interesting lesson.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is there was not enough material given to some characters and some of the parts are dull. Nevertheless the story was handled well.\\n\\n\r\nART (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is solid. It has a lot of disturbing images with different looks of parasite. Quite creepy to you people, aren't they?\\n\\n\r\nSOUND (9):\\n\\n\r\nThe opening was catchy. The opening song \"Let Me Hear\" by Fear describes perfectly the tone for this anime. They use electronic synth pop music.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending song by Daichi Miura \"It's the Right Time\" was relaxing.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER (8):\\n\\n\r\nShinichi & Migi became badass by fighting evil parasytes in the world including Gotou. At first, Shinichi was not used to having Migi on his right hand however as the series progress, Shinichi formed a strong bond with Migi. I did like the way how their relationship develops. Aya Hirano embodied the character of Migi well especially Nobunaga Shimazaki who embodied Shinichi well. They are one of the most interesting duo I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nReiko Tamura was an interesting character with a good backstory.\\n\\n\r\nI also did like Kirishima Kana as a character who tells Shinichi that nobody can perform perfect tasks. The problem is that Kirishima Kana did not get enough character development to make her memorable.\\n\\n\r\nGotou was very intimidating as a parasite and as a main villain. His role was handled well.\\n\\n\r\nSatomi Murano who is Shinichi's love interest was bland and generic. She has no fight scenes given to her. If the anime really made her into becoming badass, like a parasite infecting on her arm, I thought she would become badass. However, all she does is cry all the time which is annoying. Oh yeah, her voice actress Kana Hanazawa, she did voice acting earlier on that awful anime known as Coppelion where she voiced another crybaby character known as Aoi. If this anime tries to develop the relationship between Satomi & Shinichi, I thought that could work.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the characters really had not much material to work with.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION (8):\\n\\n\r\nDespite some problems that plague the show, I thought that the rest of the story was handled well, the animation and sound are solid, especially the characters. In fact, the moral of the story is \"Humans are unique in their way of living, just like species are\". This is why we must learn how to appreciate living creatures despite appearances.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime gets an 8 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you enjoy this review, humans. I will revive mercury1980 soon. Hopefully, you will see him in his full form in his next review. Till then, peace out.",

            "content": "[A quick note: There will be some minor spoilers here, but the source material for this show is 25+ years old so go figure. The narrative is by no means original or groundbreaking but I will avoid mentioning anything overly significant.]\r\nSo, Parasyte has finally come to a close and the adaption turned out to be simultaneously good and bad at the same time. You know, like most anime. If you haven\u2019t heard about this show yet, it\u2019s the one everyone is talking about with the main character who has a weird alien growing out of his hand and struggles with the implications of how thiswill affect his chronic masturbation habit, amongst other things. Or was that Midori Hibi\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOn the plus side, the pacing was done pretty well (until the final arc, where Shinici lives in a small village community for a number of days as represented by mere minutes of screen-time). Parasyte did manage to sell suspense to the audience well enough as the story unfolded. However there were a few patchy parts and some of the climatic parts were often hurt by censorship.\\n\\n\r\nNonetheless, we got to see Shinichi change massively as a character \u2013 from bumbling self-conscious nerd to an existentially challenged hybrid parasyte murderer over the course of 24 episodes. And for the most part he was likable. It was interesting to watch him attempt to understand his relationship with Migi (the creature that has morphed into his hand) and the implications of playing host to such an intelligent yet wildly unpredictable and bizarrely foreign entity.\\n\\n\r\nConversely, Murano managed to single-handedly cripple the show in ways that are impossible to overlook. She is a very old-school love interest: she\u2019s totally gorgeous, possesses the brain of a goldfish and the personality of a particularly unremarkable rock. Not even the voice talent of the omnipresent Kana Hanazawa could save such a poorly written character.\\n\\n\r\nMurano is constantly at Shinichi\u2019s side throughout the show like a sad puppy, hoping to understand his erratic behaviour despite the fact he keeps everything secret from her. I can\u2019t count the number of times she said \u201cAre you really Shinichi-kun?\u201d. It was fucking mind-numbing. If she had a personality or some ambition then maybe I could connect with her but she has nothing. She simply just is. For the sake of it. \\n\\n\r\nFortunately there are a bunch of more interesting side-characters, and the relationship between Migi and Shinichi was cool.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the OST was unremarkable and the action scenes were hit and miss. World-building was handled well enough but the narrative was plagued by a couple of significant hiccups, relying on Muranos selective memory (did I mention she was stupid and forgetful?) and possibly even stupider police decision-making to advance the plot. These flaws were particularly difficult for me to overlook.\\n\\n\r\nAn additional sin made by Parasyte came in the form of an epilogue. Shinichi treats us to a pseudo-intillectual and complentative monologue that touches on how humans are actually kind of greedy creatures themselves and, get ready for this bombshell: parasitic in nature, and that we should be nicer to each other and our environment.\\n\\n\r\nIn essence, Parasyte was not a bad show. Although it likes to think it\u2019s a lot smarter than it actually is.",

            "content": "I think this anime is a pure masterpiece, a huge pearl. It made me think and touched me along. The story is simply beautiful and superb.\r\nI loved the plot which I found very original. I've never faced this kind of story and frankly, from the start, it makes me very excited. It's innovative, new and fresh. And frankly, it's nice to have a story like this one, which is not full of clich\u00e9 and stupid stereotypes.\r\nWithout spoiler, and it based only on the anime, the story is well done and the protagonist\u2019s evolution is progressive, we understand his reactions and at the same time weput them into question. His view of life is changing, for better or worse. Some parasytes are even surprising. It follows the moments of everyday life of the hero in total opposition to the fight against parasytes. These creatures have different characteristics, including that of being able to remotely identify and recognize each other, which does not facilitate the task to blend into the crowd.\\n\r\nThe topics discussed in this anime show current thinking and go in perfect harmony with environmental concerns. Moreover, the ecological side comes mainly from Migi. It is about the place of humans with respect to other animals, other species and the planet overall. Man isn\u2019t itself the parasyte of this planet? This anime is supposed to bring us some answers.\\n\r\nOtherwise in terms of gore that is present in the fight scenes, it is true that there are sometimes a lot. But it is only used wisely and also causes several feelings in the viewers as terror or disgust. There is always action and we do not get bored for a second during his viewing.\\n\r\nSecondly, the graphics: I find them beautiful and really fun to watch. The colours are well used and are not garish; the proportions are very well respected. The physics of our hero (Shinichi) is very well done and it is quite realistic and not pushed or exaggerated.\\n\r\nThirdly, the music: The opening and ending are very good, nice and well presented. Let's say the opening puts us right back in the bath and the ending finish on a sweet note for that we are recovering, slowly but surely, from our emotions.\\n\r\nFourth, the characters in general.  I liked the most of them, such as Shinichi who is charming and brave. It is the most developed character in the story, and I admire his reflections. I must admit however that his change of behaviour / personality is rather abrupt but pleasant because it simply proves that the story is in progress and his vision too. After he has become much more strong than before, this does not mean that he is no longer human, quite the contrary. Then our second hero (Migi), I admire his knowledge and supposed reflections. He is a character who can generate a lot of things at the audience, especially sympathy. Yes, I have sympathy, a sort of strange love for this little insignificant and ugly thing. Migi is attractive and surprising at the same time, and I must say that this is what makes him charming.\\n\r\nOverall, Parasyte is really a must-watch anime because in any case, you will not regret it. It is a masterpiece, you mustn\u2019t skip it!",

            "content": "[6.0/10]\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\r\nExploring existential themes in any series marketed towards a more \"mature\" audience has become trite at this point. There can be so many explorations of what makes people humans and what makes the earth neat. That doesn't stop from industry executives pointing towards a potential adaptation and saying, \"That one.\" Then proceeding to throw a few hundred thousand at a studio who just so happens to enjoy drawing cartoons and then you get a show. Not just any show, though. An edgy show. With blood, existential themes, and very vague sex scenes. There are monsters that have sharp teeth, too. What you get is oneof many. There are plenty of shows that have everything I listed. As it has been proven time and time again, criticizing something due to a base set of tropes that it uses is like criticizing a piece of beef for having too much beef.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nTropes are the lifeblood of any kind of entertainment. Whether you like or dislike the idea of a trope, you will need to use them to tell your story. The problem is, pretty much every conceivable kind of story has been told before. So what you, as a creative, are left with is the thousands of tools left behind by previous storytellers. You eye these tools and find the best way to put them together. Now don't be hasty, make sure that the configuration of these tools is nice and original or you'll get something we call \"unoriginal\". Because honestly, that is all stories are now a day; An amalgamation of different elements smushed together to create something that might be unique. Out of the thousands of tools, there must be a combination that hasn't been done before.\u00a0\\n\\n\r\nParasyte isn't one of those combinations. I haven't seen much anime, however, a lot of the archetypes and patterns in anime have become really apparent to me for whatever reason. Maybe it's because the industry lacks an incredibly diverse pool of entertainment, maybe I'm just not looking hard enough. All I know is that there are an abundance of overlapping tropes and clich\u00e9s being used in many different series' that undergo virtually no changes. Which is inherently bad. Every show, as I\u2019ve said, uses a certain set of tropes. However, it is how that show utilizes those tropes and puts that extra little bit of spice into them that makes them stand out and surprise you.\u00a0This is what separates generic with exemplary. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Stage 1]\\n\\n\r\nAn idea infects you. It wriggles into your bloodstream and tries to permeate throughout the entirety of your body, but not before accessing your brain. Overriding every key piece with thoughts about said idea. That is what a great show can do. It introduces concepts that you may have seen before and presents them in ways that interest you. They make you question ideas that you\u2019ve encountered before already by introducing concepts that you haven\u2019t thought of. Parasyte attempts this respectably. Most late-game episodes include heavy motifs and themes that resonate with just about every character in the show. While it is not immune from the infection that is forced thematic drivel which, unfortunately, a lot of anime is plagued with. You do get a clear goal with Parasyte\u2019s thematic narrative. That isn\u2019t the impression the show gave off at first, though. \\n\\n\r\nThe beginning was unquestionably existential, but that existentialism was quickly undermined with some generic school setting in a generic little suburb with generic happy-go-lucky school characters. Our protagonist, Shinichi Izumi, a spiky-haired boy that is shouldering the weight of all the archetypical clich\u00e9s he must project. Shy boy who\u2019s bad around girls. Is kind of just \u201cthere\u201d. It\u2019s all something we\u2019ve seen before, even in western projects. We know these kinds of characters because, well, it is a superhero backstory. If you know anything about me, too, I dislike superhero\u2019s and their backstories. It isn\u2019t my kind of story. Hearing that this is pretty much just edgy Spiderman turned me off the show before I even began watching it. That being said, the first episode left me in a more intrigued state of mind that I expected. Expecting nothing, I was left semi-impressed. \\n\\n\r\nShinichi of course gets infected by an alien parasite, one of the many that lands in Japan. This plays as an interesting gray situation for him. On one hand he can retain his humanity and not become some bloodthirsty creature, on the other hand, he literally has a parasite. It morphs into an oddly cute little guy by the name of Migi, or \u201chand\u201d, in Japanese. A creature that can also morph himself into various kinds of weapons and generally any shape he wants. He is also an uncompromising and fully-logic-oriented monster that\u2019s entire purpose is to survive, and since he is now viewed as a \u201cfailure\u201d for only being able to capture a single part of a human host, and not the brain, Shinichi and Migi are off on a journey of survival. \\n\\n\r\nLike many anime before it, Parasyte doesn\u2019t shy away from moralizing and over-explaining simple themes. This bogs down the first half of the show. I found myself constantly getting beaten over the head with easy-to-grasp motifs which are obvious on their own, not even considering the monologues we need to endure to \u201cunderstand\u201d what these characters are thinking. Throughout the first half there is also an obnoxious focus on school-life that does nothing, in my opinion. The class-threats are so hollow and the different characters introduced within Parasyte\u2019s first twelve episodes are generally just uninteresting. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also an infuriating love triangle that left me ripping my hair out. I despise melodramatic love-triangles and this one was just about as melodramatic as they can get. The protagonist only likes the main girl in the show, however, she thinks he likes another girl that clearly likes him because she keeps seeing them at inopportune times. It is so clich\u00e9d. There were three separate scenes where the girl he isn\u2019t interested in talks to him and the other girl overhears and just so happens to be standing around that area. One is already bad, since that clich\u00e9 is as bad as they get. But three? \\n\\n\r\nWith the aggressive moralizing as well as blunt thematic narrative, you are left feeling kind of beaten down by this show for quite a while. Similar to something like Your Lie In April, a theme is brought up, obviously explained in a stilted way, and then addressed directly the characters not two scenes after it happened. The idea of losing your humanity has never been this unengaging simply because it doesn\u2019t feel like a person is going through this. I saw metaphoric checkboxes being ticked every time this theme was addressed. They followed the, \u201cexistential dread of losing your humanity\u201d trope to the T. With that trope there is also the enchanted love-interest which, thankfully, has a nice little subversion towards the end of that arc. Although, there are also these \u201cpsychics\u201d introduced within the story that can sense the presence of the parasites. These abilities never were explained. \\n\\n\r\nTo sprinkle even more frustration over all this, the habit in anime to make their girls too childish is prevalent within Parasyte as well. A lot of the female characters are just a mixture of blushes, compliments, and tears. I\u2019m not even asking for depth at this point. Just make them act their age. This inherent need to market characters while still restricting yourself within a realistic color pallet makes for this odd juxtaposing characterization within the narrative. None of them are overtly cartoony looking, yet they act like cartoons. I\u2019m using \u201ccartoon\u201d in the colloquial sense, don\u2019t read into that.  \\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, Parasyte still managed to have an engaging main story. All of these issues could be described as a secondary story to the main shows plot and thankfully, the more predominant story was engaging throughout most of the show. Thanks in part due to the well-designed parasites and well-tread existential humanist trope which is done quite well within the show. While the main character going through the concept of losing his humanity could\u2019ve been done well, but ultimately didn\u2019t leave me impressed; this shows handling of the parasites growing into the human culture was handled very well and I grew to enjoy having the main parasites on screen. Especially Reiko Tamura, who is the forefront of development provides an interesting look at the established trope. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Stage 2]\\n\\n\r\nCaptivating an audience with spectacle isn\u2019t something new to anime. It is also something I\u2019ve grown to dislike in a lot of anime. I understand that I\u2019m pretty much the buzz-killiest of all buzz-killers, but understand that I take the narrative concept of dramatic rising of stakes seriously. The stakes being risen to certain heights is a necessity for any kind of story, however, it needs to be believable. Many anime just throw that kind of notion out of the window and just go for the most unbelievable climax that breaks all kinds of verisimilitude. I was delighted to see that Parasyte denied that. The climax, and all the stakes, to be honest, felt very naturally heightened. Since the outbreak felt relatively controlled, in the sense that it wasn\u2019t spreading around the world, there was no need for a worldwide panic and gargantuan conclusion. In line with the story, we got something more personal. \\n\\n\r\nAnother idea in captivating an audience is the use of shock and gore to send a bolt of energy throughout an entire episode, if not show. Many shows do this badly, many shows do this well. For every Hannibal we have a Walking Dead. I wouldn\u2019t go far out and say that Parasyte is all too shocking with its gore, it is, similar to most television anime, quite tame even in its most extreme parts. But, for what it does it does well. It does its best to sell the psychological anguish that comes with witnessing something horrific, even if it drops the ball a bit on some characters in that regard. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on the idea of spectacle, we get fight scenes that, while not anything jaw-dropping, supplement the story well. A lot of the fight scenes are generally your everyday shounen fair with a hideous amount of monologuing and strategizing as well as constant stream of flying razor-sharp limb-knives. It didn\u2019t leave me impressed as much as it left me semi-entertained throughout the majority of that. However, some action scenes were better than others. Whereas the narrative and characters picked up traction towards the beginning of the second half, after the appalling love triangle was finally resolved, the action scenes were more interesting earlier on in the show since they often didn\u2019t last as long. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m always in favor of short and sweet action to extended over-dramatized anime action that loses steam and struggles to retain any kind of tension. There was a particular yakuza-related action scene that really impressed me in this show. It was by far the most well-animated, choreographed, and satisfying action scene in the show and it was hardly an important one, which was so weird. It felt like a complete non-sequitur in terms of visuals and style. \\n\\n\r\nOn a final note, the music added the final piece of spectacle to this series. Thankfully, the music was pretty great in Parasyte overall. There was an emphasize of winding EDM and Dubstep that thumped and whizzed into your ear. It was a nice change of pace from the usual anime soundtracks. Even the more commonly used dramatic stings sounded nice in this series. It was all backed up by a decent OP and ED that, while well-constructed, weren\u2019t my style of music. \\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Stage 3] \\n\\n\r\nStudio Madhouse had a nice grip over the entire show in terms of visuals. While there was a slight dip in fidelity in the last eight episodes, it wasn\u2019t noticeable enough to detract from the viewing experience all too much.  The style of the show also retained a more realistic look and the usual \u201cflawless\u201d-looking characters that are very common in modern anime were thankfully left to a minimum. This sense of grounded art helped elevate the dramatic tension within the modern tension as it sold the blend of character and scenery well. \\n\\n\r\nThe character designs were skirting the line between good and great. Certain characters, such as the imposing and badass Gotou and menacing Reiko Tamura were standouts. While Shinichi was fine, none of his more secondary friends really had overly memorable designs. Talking design though, I must mention the parasites themselves which had a nice creepy vibe to them. If I had one complaint was that in the first half, each individual parasite looked and felt wholly unique, while in the second half, many of them ended up getting blended together. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, the visuals were holistically solid. Nothing that I consider incredible, but good enough to sustain the kind of story being told. Keeping things grounded, visually, in just about every sense kept the atmosphere in the show almost always realistic in the world created. The verisimilitude was kept admirably and I found myself believing the kind of logic the world was built around. \\n\\n\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n\r\n[Conclusion]\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Parasyte provides enough intrigue to make up for the lackluster secondary story being told in first half of the series. The twists, while a bit too fake-out oriented, still were semi-shocking and the character motivations never really felt too confusing for any character that wasn\u2019t a part of the abhorrent love triangle. Furthermore, the world-building and engaging thematic progress created for a solidly above-average show that left me satisfied, while not necessarily craving any more. This may be in part due to the lackluster finale which felt tacked onto the true climax of the show. \\n\\n\r\nParasyte\u2019s memorable soundtrack and solid animation elevated this series, visually, from many of its competitors. Also, its exploration of existential tropes was handled well, for the most part. The unfolding story between the parasites eclipsed the humans, however, it all lead to a climax which, although not exhilarating, felt earned. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a knack for building in entertainment. You take two archetypes and you form something original. You craft an entire story with predetermined ideas and themes that have been explored before, but by adding a new kind of element, however minor, can sprout new questions that infiltrate your mind and endlessly poke at your curiosity. Parasyte achieves half of that. An exploration that just lifts its toes off the shallow end of the pool and begins to venture just a few inches deep enough to give its viewers something worthy of a intriguing, engaging watch.",

That night I finished every episode there was out up until that time. This anime kept me captivated and wanting more as I continued to watch. The storyline was unique compared to the other animes that i watched previously and was an overall good experience. There were some things that I did not like about this anime such as the ending that I won't give too much details other thanI felt like it was lacking. The supporting character development was slow so it was hard to get attached to some of the characters.\\n\r\n In the end, I rate this anime an 8/10. The lack of details and poor character development in the supporting characters prevent me from giving it a higher score but the unique story and the cliffhangers at almost every episode makes this anime a very good anime in my opinion.",

            "content": "To keep it short, a good story ruined by pathetic characters. \r\nCharacter:\r\nWhile the show did handle quite successfully the character development of, namely, Tamiya Ryouko, and Izumi to some degree, my main problem with the show is that most of other side/ supporting characters are either underdeveloped or just completely pointless and idiotic. \r\nWe need to consider the general public of this \"artificial world\" as a whole, viewing this show does remind me of Mirai Nikki, and in that show pretty much every single character has something called \"stupidity\" to it. Parasite falls victim to the same issue, words along can't describe how idiotic somerandom characters in this show are shown to be: \\n\\n\r\nThere is a girl called Tachikawa, upon discovering one of her classmate is a parasite, instead of calling for help, as every single \"sane\" person would do, she confronted the parasite on her own with the concentrated sulfuric acid she somehow obtained, just to be injured and irritated the parasite into causing a massacre. \\n\\n\r\nAnother girl called Kana, who developed a crush on Izumi, who had this superpower of detecting parasite around her (Never explained). After being warned by Izumi that her power is entirely unstable and can't distinguish Izumi from the rest of the parasites, she completely ignored the warning just to be killed by a parasite she ran into. Love, you say? Now this is a thing I dislike about many animes in general, that the writer tries to justify everything with love. Now love does make people do irrational things, however, if a character's only purpose is to love someone and you try to justify that fucking stupid of a decision, I can't take it seriously. Tachikawa is even worse, falling love with a guy that has no facial expressions, no emotions whatsoever (what a convenient plot device LOVE is!) The entire purpose of kana's existence is completely pointless because her entire trait in the show can be summarised as love Izumi, as with murano also. Kana is just a random character just to add to the tragic nature of the story, her role can be easily replaced by any other character. I'd be surprised if someone can tell me anything about her apart from she loves Izumi and has a superpower. How am I suppose to feel anything for her death if I know so little about her? What is her background? How did she know mitsuo? Where did she obtain this superpower? Nothing.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Izumi's father, who appeared randomly in the story whenever the story needs him to show up, and when Izumi is on his trip to other places for like several days, his father's existence is completely forgotten. Added to that, his father does what I hate about this show in general, that whenever some character discovered a shocking truth (parasite), he or she tend to doubt if it is a dream due to the inability to accept reality, the same case with Tachikawa and the private detective. This plot convenience is so overused in the show so as to make you question whether the half of the main characters are just completely idiots or not. \\n\\n\r\nAnd there is also a guy called Mitsuo, just your average street punk, whose entire purpose in the show is to show up, started a fight out of nowhere and move the story forward. \\n\\n\r\nKeep in mind that the these examples of idiotic characters are the ones that manage to gain atleast some screen time and survived for more than 5 episodes. More pathetic, however, is the fact that most of other characters never appeared more than 3 episodes, so there is no weight to any of the characters. As for villains, they simply come by waves, after one parasite is destroyed by Izumi, the show conveniently introduced another parasite just to cover several episodes and died whenever the story needs to move forward. These parasites contribute literally nothing to the entire show one of them might as well have the name of \"A\".  The two parasites that invaded Izumi's school served nothing but to point out the fact that \"parasite kills people\". \\n\\n\r\nAnd about Hayase, a girl Izumi met in his trip to another town, who developed a crush on him (not even sure why), and never showed up for the rest of the story. Why the hell bother to give her those \"love\" plot when you know she is just a plot device character that no one will ever remember for the rest of show? The same issue goes to literally every other side character. Uragami, for instance, had the ability to tell parasite from human, as if he is the only serial killer in the world; tried so hard to escape from the police just to be another plot device that pushed the show to its finale, not to mention despite he tried so hard to escape, him saying \"it's no point to escape, they'll capture me anytime soon\" is a god-tier contradiction right there. \\n\\n\r\nThe general public of the world the story takes place in is also beyond stupid: there is a guy who stand up just to be killed when the police warned them not to stand up, they give a serial killer freedom without putting handcuff, a detective who kept following a \"parasite\" after his arm been cut off. \\n\\n\r\nI'll say this: in this psychological story, 50% of the character are pretty much idiots with other 30% being underdeveloped and/or plot devices. And it is what ruined the show for me. How am I suppose to take it seriously if most of the characters are irrational? \\n\\n\r\nThe romance between murano and Izumi is also nothing to be applauded. Their relation is in this constant cycle of trust-Izumi becomes inhumane-distrust-parasite attacks-Izumi save the day-goes back to trust. I can not feel anything because their relation is stagnant for the entire first 20 episodes. What makes it worse is that we, as audience, know what the conflict is, whereas Murano, as a \"person\", despite discovering everything wrong about Izumi, about him meeting another girl and that girl got freaking killed, about his superhuman ability, about all the stupid tantrum he threw out of nowhere, still gives everything to trust him just because he saved her, as if it is normal to keep a mountains of secrets to your girlfriend in relation. This is so cringy to watch. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, there is a reason why this show excels at all parts compared to shit like Mirai Nikki. Izumi and Tamiya Ryouko received satisfactory character development. As a parasite, Tamiya had a curiosity towards human society and gradually developed a feeling for human. Now I want to ask this, is that something so unique that while watching, you'd be like \"WOW\"? Certainly not, Tamiya's character development is not a masterpiece tier of development, the reason why she seems so unique in this show is because the way the show handles all other parasites. Now parasite is a organism that possess super intelligence, (migi can learn Japanese in one day, for instance). However, in this show, EVERY SINGLE villain parasite apart from Tamiya are such piece of stupid organism that every thing they do is killing human without even considering the consequence of such bold moves. Do you think this is what a \"highly intelligent\" species should do? It is really pathetic that the reason why Tamiya Ryouko is so surprising is that every parasite of her kind is pretty much unicellular organism of IQ lower than 10. \\n\\n\r\nIzumi, on other other hand, received drastic development, from a timid, shy guy to a mature men capable of taking responsibility and his experience shaped his view of the world and life in general. However, what bothers me is that by referring to development, Izumi's change in personality isn't natural, it was the result of a inner biological mutation therefore it is ambiguous as to whether he would be like that without Migi's part inside him. However, this is not say a development from humane to sort of inhumane then goes back to humane upon the final realisation isn't a good development, it is satisfactory in my opinion. However, the main problem is that the show focus too much on Izumi's development so as to make everyone else look like stupid characters. \\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\\n\r\nI have to admit I did not feel boring through the entire show, for which I will not rate this show any lower then a 6. \\n\r\nParasite does a great job at keeping you on the edge of the seat. However, the problem is how the show does it. Let me describe two scenario: \\n\r\nA: \\n\r\nMigi: Shinichi, we have a problem, one of my kind is approaching. \\n\r\nB:\\n\r\n(during Izumi and Murano's conversation)\\n\r\nIzumi: stand here, and I'll.......(suddenly runs away)\\n\r\nThere two scenario are so overused in this show I honestly lost counts of how many times these conversations happened. It quickly makes me feel the show is getting repetitive. In the later episodes I could literally know when such thing would happen and I was not wrong. Also, having Izumi and Murano's conversation cut abruptly every single time is god damn frustrating and is really poor directive approach to a show. I had me shouting \"god damn, why can't you finish a single conversation.\" \\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that being a show with so many gory deaths, the death in this show is completely random and up to the writer to decide. What I mean is that whenever a character confronts a parasite, if the character is considered still \"useful\" by the writer, the parasite will suddenly make a speech or talk nonsense instead of immediately kill off the character. For instance, Tachikawa and Izumi had this invisible protection shell around them. On the other hand, however, when a character is deemed useless, the parasite will immediately attack that kills the said character: for instance, Kana. The overabundance of death in this show doesn't really mean anything because it's just a cheap way to make a character disappear and add to Izumi's trauma, whenever a character should not just \"disappear\", the show will somehow make them escape the parasite despite their lightening speed attacks. \\n\r\nAlthough I am against this show's method of introducing a new villain after the previous one got destroyed, I'd be honest that it wasn't boring. The parasite's transformation always delivers a visual impact and the elimination of them grants you the same amount of satisfaction as when you played an online video game about destroying zombies. The story itself isn't bad, however, with such a stupidly large amount of poor characters, the story can barely be called good. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Kiseijuu is no masterpiece, it fails miserably in handling most of the side characters, 90% of them are not fully realised characters. While viewing the show, I was constantly shifting between a 6 and a 8, there are high points in the show that deserved praised, but at the same time an equal amount of stupid writings. As a person who can't bare irrational characters and stupid logic, I have no choice but to give this show a 6.",

            "content": "Dropped after episode 9. I'm no expert on the series but I'll give it my thoughts. This is a short one because I only got partway through. \r\nParasyte is not a good show. However, the anime community seems to believe that it is. Parasyte looks at several philosophical ideas, which are interesting in their own right, and does a reasonable job of addressing them. But a good anime has to do more than that. That being said, the positive reviews of this show don't seem to praise that and instead praise the story's pacing and character development. I just can't agree with this sentiment atall. The first word that comes to mind when thinking about Parasyte is 'BORING'. I would say that the show falters in pretty much every aspect. The story is poorly constructed, though that I imagine it improves slightly along the way. The art is below average, suffering often and having to maintain poor character designs and a dreadfully boring color palette. The sound is poor. And of course, the worst is the characters. Yikes. I can't even tell what this series is trying to do. It does nothing. Well, let's get into it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 5\\n\r\nArt: 4\\n\r\nSound: 3\\n\r\nCharacter: 2\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 5]\\n\\n\r\nTo me, this is a generous rating. I expect the story to improve during the latter half of the series -- as most stories do -- but even in that case, I don't see myself enjoying Parasyte at all. The story completely lacks agency. The device by which the plot moves is Migi telling Shinichi that something is happening, and then Shinichi reacting to whatever it is. It does not feel like the protagonist, or really anyone, is moving the plot forward. Things are just happening around him and he predictably reacts to it by doing something heroic. There are villains that don't really seem like villains because they have no real attachment to Shinichi, they just exist in the world and happen to involve Shinichi for the sake of the narrative. The series tries to string along the audience cliffhangers, but even that isn't very compelling. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 4]\\n\\n\r\nThe art is close to average. I would say that it almost looks good, but the color palette is a big burden to uphold. Everything is muted and boring all the time. Look towards Psycho-Pass for something that has a similar style but executes much better. Beyond that, the animation just falters in general. Animation can be choppy and the characters flub pretty often. The character design is boring. If this series is trying to be action series, it fails. The action is just blades flying around. No punch. No choreography or engaging angles during fights. In my opinion, this should have strived to be animated like Psycho-Pass, and it is very far off from that. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 3]\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is bad. Specifically Shinichi's mom, but several characters don't make the cut. There aren't really any character themes. There is maybe one good song in the score, but there are others that are just confusing. The show seems to often adopt fast-paced electronic themes in 'intense' moments, which doesn't mesh with the aesthetic of the show and just falls flat. My guess is that it tries for this direction because of the (first?) OP, which is pretty decent. But I think we should expect better of our anime than to base the show content off an OP track. The effects are lacking and don't provide any punch or excitement. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 2]\\n\\n\r\nAre there any characters? The minor characters are all bad. I think Kana has some potential but that's just me hoping there is something redeemable about the characters. You would expect Murano to be a big character in the series but she is completely worthless thusfar. The villains are poor and really stick around Shinichi 'just because'. It seems many of the positive reviews seem to highly value the development made by Shinichi and Migi. From what I've seen so far, this is just misplaced. OK, Shinichi goes from a wimp to a manly man. That can be a great development, but the show doesn't execute well at all. Shinichi just goes from a boring baby (a shitty character) to AoT's Eren Yeager (another shitty character) overnight. Why is this exciting? It doesn't feel real because it just 'happens', and the outcome character is still beyond boring. Furthermore, he doesn't go through any emotional development like a normal human would to get to this point, something biological happens to his body. The audience cannot relate to this. I've read some plot synopses that indicate that Shinichi and Migi begin to understand their differences as species and begin to come to a more unified understanding on how they should value other people, and that sounds potentially good. But I have no reason to believe that show will execute it in a way that improves the characters at all, because it has failed to do so thusfar. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 3]\\n\\n\r\nCliffhangers are the only 'enjoyable' part. I thought the series was going to take a great turn at episode 6, but it disappointed me. Again. The show is just boring. Poor action, poor tension, and very poor drama and characters, which the show does devote a lot of effort into. I can't tell you what this show tries to be because it fails at everything. Serious, the best thing it does it cliffhang (poorly) and can't maintain that because the plot and characters suck. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 3] \\n\\n\r\nBoring. Do not recommend watching. Offers nothing of value from what I have seen. I don't know what this show is going for, but it isn't doing it well.",

            "content": "Parasyte the Maxim is perhaps the most entertaining, yet disjointed show I have seen over the past year. The premise is simple; one day parasytes turn up in Japan (or across the globe, it's not known) taking over human bodies and using their human hosts to feast on other humans. Shinichi, our 17 year old protagonist, has his right arm taken over by a parasyte, Migi, and must learn to survive and co-exist with the parasyte while fighting other parasytes. This is a great premise, however the execution of the story that follows is flawed.\r\nThere are two things that are consistent in Parasyte; the youngfemale characters are stupid and plot points being forgotten. Murano, the female lead, is both annoying and useless. Most of her interactions with Shinichi involve her creating drama for no reason or simply being stupid. There's one scene where Shinichi carries Murano, jumps three stories and lands on his feet unscathed and she doesn't question whether anything supernatural is occuring, instead only looking back on that moment to remember that Shinichi is actually a caring person. Kana isn't much better, being hopelessly in love with Shinichi for no reason other than being able to \"feel\" his presence, something that is never explained. \\n\\n\r\nThe general public in Parasyte are also quite stupid. There are hundreds of murders occuring frequently and yet there's no panic or change in the way the public behaves. After the mass murder at Shinichi's high school, the school is open the very next day as if nothing happened. The police are mostly clueless about what's going on, especially during the raid later in the show where they carry out one of the worst plans to attempt to discover hidden parasytes, leading to most of them being killed.\\n\\n\r\nAs for plot points being forgotten, this leads to the show feeling disjointed. For a while Shinichi is under suspicion by the police, but that ends up being forgotten. His father appears to be a part of the investigation but that is also forgotten. Tamiya Ryouko's whole plotline ends up going no where with her concluding that the parasytes are weak, when the whole show up until that point has shown that parasytes are, in fact, the opposite of weak. This makes the show feel like it lacks direction and makes it unclear what the end game is. When the ending does come around, many of the issues of having parasytes existing amongst society aren't solved.\\n\\n\r\nThe take home message from Parasyte is that humans are the same as animals and that we should treat animals with respect. There's nothing inherently wrong with this message. However, the method Parasyte chooses to deliver this message is awkward at best. Characters would monologue this message multiple times throughout the show, or the show would create characters to prove this point, for example, Uragami. The only points where the show attempts to explore these ideas come from the discussions between Migi and Shinichi, but these discussions don't really test the idea well.\\n\\n\r\nNevertheless, Parasyte is an entertaining show. The dynamic between Shinichi and Migi is captivating and holds the series together. The way both characters grow together feels natural. Seeing how they overcome great odds to survive is incredibly thrilling. The action scenes, while hard to relate to due to the blades moving at hyperspeed, are full of tension since they have real consequences that are felt by Shinichi. It also helps that some of the side characters, such as Uda and Kuramori, play their part well and are easy to empathise with, while Gotou is a fearsome villain. \\n\\n\r\nThe technical aspects are worth a mention. The gore is depicted well in Parasyte, however I hear that the manga has even more gore. The animation during the action scenes are satisfactory, but there isn't anything unique. The use of dubstep does put some people off, however it doesn't seem out of place. The voice acting is high quality, which is expected considering there are some big names in the cast of Parasyte.\\n\\n\r\nIf you wish to watch an anime which involves nice action scenes, gore and are able to tolerate moments of stupidity, this show will be great entertainment and I definitely recommend it. The journey that Shinichi embarks on is memorable and should leave you satisfied.",

            "content": "Aight. Time to try this again without spoiling anything. I done that in my last review I did, but the parts of spoilers got removed, but still...\r\nOkay, first I'm going to start with the story, because that's what you are supposed to do. Parasyte -the maxim- or Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu, follows the story of a 17 year old high school student named Izumi Shinichi. One day a meteor shower happens, a bunch of alien like creatures come out and infect people's brains and stuff.\r\nOne parasite by the name of 'Migi', well, that's his nickname, goes into Shinichi's room and tries to infect him. But,Shinichi is wearing headphones, so he isn't able to get in. Migi then burrows into Shinichi's hand and Shinichi prevents Migi from going up any further into his arm by tying his headphones around his arm and, basically... strangling the life out of his arm.\\n\\n\r\nI wasn't actually sure about the story at first. Not quite sure what it was about at the time. But, I figured out at about episode 5 or 6. Something like that. Now, I'm a diehard fan of psychological, supernatural type anime. And this one really creeps into my skin. There is so much gore in this anime, but I don't even care. That's one of the things that I like about it (I know it sounds kinda creepy).\\n\\n\r\nShinichi goes on all kinds of battles with Migi. Fighting parasites, monsters, well, both of them are the same thing. Shinichi suddenly stops wearing glasses after about episode 6 or something. I don't know why, I think his eyesight has improved, I seriously don't know. Shinichi survives a stab through the heart, and his body undergoes some changes.\\n\\n\r\nShinichi gained the ability to run like sanic, jump super high, and even at one point he ripped out one of the parasite's hearts. That was out of anger, of course. I think this anime has at least one character death per episode, either a main character or just a parasite nobody gives a damn about.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically, in conclusion the story is about a parasite burrowing into a teenage boys skin, and then they end up fighting a bunch of creepy, mutated aliens together. There's more to it than that, but I can't be bothered writing that right here and right now.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack of this anime is amazing. There's often some 'Chopin' music placed here and there, by that, I only mean about two episodes. Anyone know who Chopin is? Eh, nevermind. I would recommend checking out the soundtrack via... I don't know, however the hell you listen to soundtracks and OSTs.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Kiseijuu are amazing. All though you would only know a character for one episode or so, you'd still feel bad for their death. Is that a spoiler yet? No. I don't think so. (Insert spoiler here). Damn it! That part is going to get removed! I'm gonna explain some characters, but not all.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi Shinichi is the main anta-prota... anti-... I don't even know. Main protagonist of the anime, I guess? He's that type that isn't really that strong, and looks like he couldn't really do anything to anyone in the school. Next minute, jumps out of a school window and survives it. That's in episode... eh, I don't know. Not important. May contain spoilers if I write it.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi's father is not really that main to the story, because he only shows in the first couple of episodes until (insert spoiler here). After that, the only appearances he ever had, were about four or five more episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI'm gonna stop with the characters, I'm just gonna say, that all the characters in the anime are freakin' amazing!\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was really enjoyable to my extent. Did I use that term right? Eh, it doesn't matter. I watched this anime in about a day, because the anime is only roughly... 10 hours long. But, I couldn't stop watching it. I said to myself 'one more episode' until I wanted to take a break, but I couldn't take a break. I was to addicted at the point.\\n\\n\r\nThis series can have some seriously heartbreaking moments, but that's what life is about, isn't it? We all have our time on earth... eh, shut up, me. I'm just trying to be scientific. Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this anime as much as I did.",

            "content": "Overall - 9:\r\nThis anime is a well paced show with amazing character development and a great soundtrack. It had me always wanting more. The action sequences were thrilling and it was an emotional rollercoaster at times.\r\nStory - 9:\r\nThe story in this anime was very well paced and interesting. The events had good cohesion and the end of each episode always left me wanting more. The world building was great, and things were explained so well that when something happened it felt like it made sense rather than just being something you have to accept. My one complaint is that the show lacked a very clearsense of destination. I like that I didn't know where the story was going to go next, but I'm not entirely satisfied with the way they ended it.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 8:\\n\r\nThe art was very detailed and the animation was very impressive at times. Some of the characters were very intricate, and they did a good job at making everything look like it belonged. The creatures were disturbing, and the transformations looked fluid. I'm wasn't a huge fan of the 3d models they used for some of the background characters if only because they seemed kinda out of place, but it wasn't that big of a deal.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10:\\n\r\nThis is how you do a soundtrack right. Almost every song is great and a smaller soundtrack means that the audience becomes more familiar with the songs that are there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9:\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime felt very believable, the dad is a personal favorite of mine, especially in the beginning. The growth of Shinichi throughout the anime was very well written and now stands out in my mind as one of the best examples of character development throughout a show. It helps that the story takes place over a good length of time so the Shinichi can grow physically as well as mentally.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9:\\n\r\nMany times I had to remind myself I needed to go to sleep because I just wanted to keep watching this show. In total it took me a week to finish which is very quick and this means that it was something that I wanted to come back to again and again. I didn't enjoy the heavy gore, even though it was necessary to the plot.",

            "content": "To preface this review, I started watching it with next to no expectations whatsoever, good or bad, and I have never read the manga. \r\nParasyte: The Maxim has been a bit of a weird experience for me. On one hand, I think it\u2019s a good show, but on the other, I don\u2019t get the massive hype surrounding it. The show\u2019s themes and plot definitely appealed to me, so there\u2019s that bias. And by and large, I enjoyed the show. But there were a number of elements, mainly early on, that I simply couldn\u2019t overlook. These are mainly personal issues, granted, but they bear mentioning. So,before I get into the specific sections below, I\u2019ll run through these. \\n\\n\r\nFirst, I was not able to take this show seriously for the first few episodes. In fact, if I didn\u2019t know better, based solely on the first episode, I\u2019d have thought this show was supposed to be black comedy. Contributing to this is the fact that I couldn\u2019t take one of the main characters, Migi, seriously for about 9 or 10 whole episodes. I tried, trust me, but it wasn\u2019t working. In addition, despite the show really trying to sell the viewer on the whole \u201cthe Parasytes are horrifying and threatening\u201d thing, they just looked more silly than scary the vast majority of the time, which made it really hard to get into it.\\n\\n\r\nAnd secondly, a number of events occurred/decisions were made that I thought were just awful. A certain transformation in episode 5 in particular was so ham-fistedly an homage/rip-off of Peter Parker/Spiderman that I rolled my eyes so hard I almost burst a blood vessel. \\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the main stuff.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9/10\\n\r\nEasily the best part of the show. The presentation of themes, the way the plot moved and the handling and resolution of most events were wonderful. There were a few plot-related hiccups, and it wobbled a bit thematically near the end, but it righted itself and succeeded in telling a well written, well thought-out and profound story, and for that I applaud it greatly.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art and animation in Parasyte is very good. The character designs look mostly good (and they actually look their age, which is rare in anime), the animation is smooth and consistent and the backgrounds are excellent. The biggest issue I have with the animation in this show is in the Parasytes\u2019 fight scenes, which have a bad habit of devolving into blade-spam, which can be downright boring to watch. The fight scenes are really only interesting when human bodies are doing the fighting. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nEasily the worst part about this show. The soundtrack is heavily influenced by dubstep and electronic music, so unless you\u2019re into that, which I am not, you probably won\u2019t like it very much. Also, it just doesn\u2019t work. It fails in setting the tone for the scenes, which makes many of them have a lot less impact than they would otherwise. What makes this even more unfortunate is that there are a couple (and by that, I mean like three) good songs on the track that are not overly (or at all) electronic/dubstep, which shows that the creators knew how to integrate fitting, emotional, non-dubstep music into the show, but chose not to. I cannot fathom why they would make that choice. Because of these moments, though, I\u2019ll give the show a 4, rather than a 3 or even a 2 for music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6.5/10\\n\r\nThis would be the best part of the show\u2026 if Shinichi and Migi were the only characters. Alas, they are not, and we have the misfortune of being forced to suffer through laughably shallow, poorly-written side characters. I will give credit where credit is due: Shinichi and Migi are two of the best, if not the best, characters of their respective seasons (both fall and winter). They are awesome, and they are even better together. But just about every other character is a cardboard cutout masquerading as a person. Granted, Shinichi and Migi are the focus, but it was still painful watching everyone else. At times, some of the characters do become legitimately interesting (only towards the end of the show, though), but this leads me to another huge problem I have with this show: it has a bad habit of killing off characters right as they become (or start to become) interesting. If this show handled its side characters even a quarter as well as it handled Shinichi and Migi, the score for this section would jump right to a 9. But it didn\u2019t, so it won\u2019t. Out of respect for the beautiful Shinichi/Migi duo, I\u2019ll give it a 6, but it would be much lower otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nEven with the aforementioned flaws, I found myself enjoying this show each week, liking it and being interested in what would happen the next week. Shinichi and Migi were a treat to watch, and the story and plot were compelling, appealing and deep. For the reasons given in this review, however, I was never able to fully engage with this show, but it was an overall enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nParasyte: The Maxim is an overall solid, good show. It stumbles, it messes up, and it has some issues that I will never be able to get over, but all things considered, it is a good show and an enjoyable experience. \\n",

She has big potential for the anime and could provide much more to it than just her death a few episodes later. to be honest this death totallydestroyed me, and because of that huge waste of an awesome character i give the anime a 8\\n\\n\r\nEND OF SPOILER\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the animation on the anime is pretty amazing, especially on the parasyte fights.Throughout the anime the main characters evolve a lot, but in my opinion, sinichi's appearance change was maybe too much, but in general all the characters developed pretty nicely except for murano, who remains an uncertain b****\\n\\n\r\nI recommend the anime to everyone who likes some very good action, with tiny bits of romance very nicely spread throughout the anime.",

Not only did the anime ended up living up to most of the expectations, it completely stormed threw the anime world as one of the best and i now consider this anime a all time classic. \r\nthe story revolves around The 17-year-old Izumi Shinichi who was your normal average everyday teenager until 1 night that changed his life forever.that night, worm-like aliens called Parasytes invade Earth , entering human bodiesand taking control of their brains and acts as the control of the brain. One parasyte Migi, attempts to enter Shinichis brain but fails and enters his arm, takes control of Shinichis arm. The duo soon realize that they were going to have to work together to be able to survive in this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters from this anime is one of the strong points of this anime. Every character has a important role to this anime and it is executed exceptionally.\\n\\n\r\nThe Soundtrack in the anime is amazing. The opening and ending of the anime especially , it is just simply amazing and the song choices were spot on perfect.\\n\\n\r\nHorrors , sci-fi and mystery animes have never really appealed to me. But Kiseijuu has influenced me to opened up space for me to explore a new genre of animes. This anime had me staying up late at nights thinking about the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall this anime is a insanely good anime and it loves ups to the expectations that it had,10 our of 10. Kiseijuu, simply a classic.  \\n",

            "content": "I will probably get blamed because i'm about to \"attack\" one of the recent \"BEST ANIME OF ALL TIME\". \r\nWell there are some anime that i just can\u00b4t understand their rate and how the hell they got so well rated... this is one of them. I will try to explore this \"thing\" as well as an objective review because most of the times when a review starts by saying: It is a perfect 10.. well probably it will be just some fanboy. \r\nWell where do i start .. is this anime good? Yes it is ... does it worth it's rate at this moment? No.I think people are just forgetting some parts to praise this anime and i understand that, i do the same with some other anime. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10. The story starts to be really interesting and engaging. The problem is that it just gets silly with the time. There are a lot of things that bothered me as well as PLOT HOLES. Yes because it seems that no one knows the true meaning of \"having no feelings\". I won\u00b4t tell you much more otherwise i would be spoiling, but just pay attention to what i just said, and see if i'm not right. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the pace of the plot, it's fine. It's not to fast neither to slow. \\n\\n\r\nPersonally, after the 14th episode, this anime went way down below it's usual quality until the end. In the first 14 episodes, this anime only explores Shinichi and how hard was for him to live his new life. But then .. i don\u00b4t know what happened but i do now one thing: It was no longer Parasyte. \\n\\n\r\nThen you have tons of people that says : THIS ANIME IS INTELIGENT. Well ..  i must be the only one who already knew about all the things that this anime explored (believe me or not, some of the things explored in this anime were already explored by myself. Yeah i didn\u00b4t found it so \"inteligent\" as people say.) \\n\\n\r\nThere is one sentence that i would like to quote: \"The man claims to be racional but he destroys his own place to live .. how can that be called racional\". Srsly people .. did you never get to that conclusion by yourself? At least i did .. I think this anime plays around with some things and apparently it worked out because almost everyone that i know says that Kiseijuu is just too damn well made and so it's a 10/10. Not really.. \\n\\n\r\nSo don\u00b4t get fool by those who claim that this anime is too \"inteligent\". For me .. this is nothing. Philosofical themes? Non-existant. Let me tell you a little bit about philosofy: It means from the old greek, philos + sofia, which means \"Love knowledge\" or \"Love knowing more and more\". Of course this is a really simple definition but you get the idea. Is this anime philosofical? Not even close. It just picks some facts and says clich\u00ea things. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, an inteligent anime is that anime who manage to create an alternative reality where they explore the \"if\". \"What if there was society where crimes could be judge by a machine? This idea was taken from Psycho-Pass. This is an inteligent anime for me. It makes us think about that society and how it would be living like them. Here on Parasyte .. we already know that reality for god sake. IT IS OUR REALITY ! \\n\\n\r\nSo, the sentence that i quoted \" The man claims to be racional but he destroys his own place to live .. how can that be called racional\" is not so inteligent as you may think it is. It is just a fact. Nothing more than that. \\n\\n\r\nThere are other things to talk about but i just can\u00b4t tell you otherwise i \\n\r\nwould be spoiling. \\n\\n\r\nThe last thing i would like to talk about is how this anime desperately tries to make some suspanse with the action, how desperately this anime tries to make some cliffhangers .. how this anime tries to make some drama .. HOW THIS ANIME TRIES TO BE INTELIGENT. \\n\\n\r\nIt fails at all of those levels. It even tried to have some plot twists .. big big surprise it didn't had them. I predicted successfully every single on of them. \\n\\n\r\nSo i don\u00b4t really know how this anime can be a 10/10. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10. The design is fine. I personally loved the character's facial expression. Just truly well made. The background is fine for the most part.\\n\\n\r\nIf there is one problem with the art, is the movement. The action is static. Let me tell you how a fight looks like in Parasyte: \\n\\n\r\nTHEY LITERALLY STAY STILL. Yeah they only use some kind of arms to fight, the rest of the body doesn\u00b4t even moves at all. Oh but wait, they use a trick to try to make it \"OP\" which is the same trick used in One Piece. They speed up those arms so fast that we can\u00b4t see them. BIG BIG SURPRISE DO YOU KNOW THAT HAPPENS? It is a really useful trick to save money. Yeah people action like that is really easy to make. Check out any anime from 1980 and you will see they do better than Parasyte lol .. really disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10. Well they use dubstep for the action. Please kill this anime already. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening is great. Personally i loved it. The majority of the OST are OK for their purpose, but really none of them stands out. Pretty much weak. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10. Well well .. okay i admit it: Izumi Shinichi is a brilliant character in the first 14-18 episodes. I found in this character everything. Nice development, nice dialogues, nice reactions. It seemed so natural, they way that he reacted to his new life. The rest .. ah there is no rest. I mean really we only have Shinichi as the main character, and then for the supportive characters Temura Reiko, Migi and Murano, \\n\\n\r\nWhile Temura Reiko was .. PLOT HOLE. \\n\\n\r\nMurano was more interesting to watch but still to repetitive. She pretty much says the same shit throughout the entire show. \\n\\n\r\nAbout Migi .. i would say that he somehow does nothing in the story. Besides changing Izumi life, after that he acts like a plot shield for Izumi. I mean you will understand if you get there. Migi got some development but it was not interesting for me. \\n\\n\r\nRemember guys, this is a 24 eps show. Only 4 characters? Congrats. \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, Izumi carries this anime to the victory with his great development. I would say the best aspect in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: After all what i said, i think you can understand what i felt about this show. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10. I reccomend it ! It is a nice show with some interesting themes .. BUT .. don\u00b4t get hype or you may get disapointed. It is interesting but not great. It is good but not brilliant.",

If you want to see some gore,mass murder and pretty epic kills then this is a MUST watch. As for character development there's quite alot, even to the point where he changes.

You can see how awesome this anime is. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nStory is awesome. Cliffhangers , plot twisting and every thing are amazing. Now about little words about plot of this anime, Human being are considered to be ultimate species but what will happen when another species come which comes at top of food chain as well as more intelligent than humans.There numbers are few though What chaos can it create and what are humans gonna do....\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nArt was good. Fighting scenesare very well made. How human change into Parasyte. Migi is also very well drawn during fights but there was room for improvements.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nBest thing I can say about its sound are starting and Ending Songs of Parasyte. Starting races your heart to watch episode and then ending cool downs you by slow singing. Voice Characters are perfect match for their Characters. Migi voice was amazing through out Anime. The only Issue I had about voice was about OST because from my point of view fighting + romance scenes are good but they would have been perfect if they had perfect backgrounds for them like in HxH 2011.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nCharacter development is amazing in Parasyte. Shinichi, Izumi in start was just a coward but with as plot moved on his personality and character improved. What I liked most after Miki and Shinichi is Reiko. She in start was simple Minded Alien/Parasyte. Then she became curious about her own existence and so on...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI fully enjoyed Parasyte kind of anime in which there is a main plot which are twisted in such a way which are fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nTO end this review let me copy some of lines from Starting Song of Parasyte, which are following: \\n\r\nYou guys do not notice that we are gifted just by being humans \\n\r\nWe are absolute predators \\n\r\nWe do not even have any enemies \\n\r\nMaybe there are other animals watching us \\n\r\nand thinking that someday \"we will beat them down\"",

            "content": "Kiseijuu is definitely one of the best anime mangas out there. After for about 27 years since the release of the first volume of the manga series. And I can't believe MadHouse Entertainment took it and became a awesome revival. So here's my review:\r\nStory (SPOILER ALERT):\r\nThe Story follows a High School Student named Izumi Shinichi, a 16 Year Old Student who has the biggest role of his entire life when a alien-parasite enters his arm. The real objective of this parasite is to invade the host's brain and controls it's host and to erase any existence to any human being. And Izumi isn't one ofthem, instead of attacking to his brain, the parasite enters to his arm and became his sidekick to defeat every single one of the parasites in Japan to avoid any casualties as possible.\\n\\n\r\nMy review to this storyline is really good actually, including what will happen if this parasite became true to life and what will happen to us if that occurs, or what will Izumi and his parasitic arm named \"Migi\" do to the other parasites? And so on that you don't wanted to miss it out! The story is much more related to the \"Zombie\" types in any zombie movies, TV Shows and Animes (Like Highschool of the Dead) you've watched, but even more worst than those and it was not came from the experiments nor sickness. And until now (including the manga series), it is still quite unknown how they'd appear and what are the cause of all this (And I don't know if the anime's OP about the alien particles falling down the sky, but I guess that's one theory why...) But, to be honest, I like how the flow of the story works including how Shinchi's character has changed when Migi tried to save him by becoming his heart, his relationship with Murano and his expressions on his character, Shinichi's Mission, etc.. And I don't like to miss those plot in every episode until those mysteries were solved.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIf I Could Say One Word How To Describe Kiseijuu's art, it's \"HORROR\". Yes, besides \"Gore\", the horror of this animation is described like any other horror movies out there. If you see blood and gore, that's horror, if you see someone get eaten by a parasite, that's horror. or how about even worst, how about if that parasite crawls you without being noticed, that's even more horror. Everything in this anime is horror and it gives you a disgusting taste if you watch this anime, especially the eating and it's gorefest theme. So you'd better finish your dinner first before you watch this anime, because if you watch this anime while eating dinner, especially meats, if you'd see the very first episode of this anime, maybe you will never see the same look on your meat in a week or two. Also, if you have a weak guts to watch this anime, try not to watch this anime...\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nDubstep in every single episode is pretty annoying for the others, but for me, I like it. Hell, Maybe next time, try inviting SKRILLEX or Knife Party for these following episodes, because those dubsteps or should I say \"songs\" were totally need their attention and a perfect fit for this anime. But because this is Japan's work, I totally love their japanese dubstep, especially the first episode which I demanding to find that on YouTube right now. But, as for the voice acting, it's perfectly fine though so I'll take that as an excuse. But, as for the OP and ED which is kinda surprising that in all anime's that I'd watch which are changing their OPs and EDs songs at the 2nd half of the anime, Kiseijuu does not, I don't know why. But it was catchy though, especially the Opening song from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' Let Me Hear because I was a fan of Rock Songs and I love Parasyte so I took this and put it to my MP3 to face my stressful college days...\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (SPOILER ALERT):\\n\r\nI'm not going to tell any single one of the characters of the story, so I'd take what I think the most important so far. First of all, the protagonist of the story, Izumi Shinichi is one of the few anime protagonist that I've watched so far to have the biggest character development I've seen. Why? Well before, he's a decent and a normal person who is undetermined and kinda nerdy, which is kinda weird why they took him as a protagonist. Then all of a sudden, after his mother's passing and Migi's Heart Transplantation, he became vicious and kinda has a \"Bounty Hunter\" character due to slaying every single one of the Parasites he finds. Which is very remarkable, to me. And as for Satomi Morano, the protagonist's lover, she's maybe the MOST IRRITATING CHARACTER IN THE KISEIJUU SERIES for asking \"Are you really Shinichi-kun, Izumi Shinichi-kun?\" to Shinichi for many times in a row. And FOR THE LAST TIME MORANO, HE'S SHINICHI! I SAW IT IN MY OWN TWO EYES GAHDDAMMIT!! WHY ARE YOU NOT SO SURE ABOUT HIM? ASK ANYONE, ANYONE WHO WATCHES THIS ANIME IF THAT WAS SHINICHI, LET'S SEE HOW MANY WRONG ANSWERS WOULD YOU FIND YOU LITTLE (Grunts)... \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, as for the antagonist like Gotou, I'd say he's a very decent antagonist that reflects in real life. Why? Imagine, Gotou's parasite is a Corrupted Politician, who only seeks money and power by luring his or her citizens in the streets by sweetening them by his/her expressions, then as he/she became successful, he/she just didn't care what other people says around him/her and he/she only cares is his/her power and money. That's what Gotou's character in Kiseijuu (except that he's a parasite) and it was based on any corrupted politicians in the world. But only in an anime way. See, Gotou, in the anime, is running for Mayor and luring his people to vote for him because not only for the city but also he cares for the people, but his true intensions is, if Gotou wins the election, the more attention he gets, the more people will get harmed by the Parasites and from Gotou. That's why he's running for Mayor, to get more power and attention coming for both the parasites and the people.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters like, Reiko Tamura, who is a former antagonist, has also had a character development from being a bad to good due to understanding what humans think to parasites and explaining why are they here to Shinichi. And Migi who is a very reliable sidekick to Shinichi, always helping him to avoid getting him from harm as soon as possible by turning Shinichi's arm into a sword.\\n\\n\r\nThese characters in this list has a very interesting character I've seen so far. That's why I enjoyed watching these characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall:\\n\r\nNeither one bit, I've never saw any kind of flaws in this anime. All of these were fantastic and giving me some disgusting feeling or goosebumps whenever these parasites came along in real life to eat you up or tries to invade your brain as their host. And it is not a very disappointing anime to me, no not at all. From Battles to Revelations, this is just a very special icing on the cake. And this is by far the best anime I've seen from MadHouse Entertainment, a \"Blast from the Past\" kinda feeling that after 27 years after the release of the very first manga. This anime has the miraculous return and became an anime adaptation. And this is the main example, not WHAT anime revival looks like, but HOW anime revival looks like. Just don't take it from the whole manga and put it to the anime like a dead corpse returning from the dead, take it more seriously and more feisty from the manga and revive it to the anime in a more miraculous way. And that's what MadHouse Entertainment did just to not disappoint both fans and new to this anime adaptation based on the critically acclaimed Manga.\\n\\n\r\nSo My Final Verdict to his Anime is a Reviving Score of 10/10. It was truly a masterpiece, a work of fine art, a work of a miracle director, you name it. This anime is definitely recommended for those anime fans and horror fanatics out there. Especially if your dad or your mom, older sister or your brother who were a fan of this manga wanted to see this anime adaptation for too long. It was not disappointing at all, so you must definitely watch this anime!",

This anime starts out like every other anime, guy sees boobs, guy is a loser with glasses, but my main man here gets some sort of protozoa parasite that crawls into his arm. You might think \"but what is so cool about a parasite in a guys arm? Shouldn't that make his arm to rot and cause infections?\" Unless badassery is a type of infection, then yes, he does. My man over here becomes a jack ass and kills people left and right, my buddies and I startedcalling the as$ hole Joseph Stalin, and for crying out loud his parasite has the ability to talk and turn into blades and sh*t. I can't quite recall but i'm sure the parasite even knows the quantisation of matter or something. The thing is smarter than Kanye West. As all anime's go, the dude or \"Joe\" finds a really attractive female (I personally think the b*tch looks like Edna Mode from the 2004 Disney Pixar animated film \"the Incredibles.) Anyway, he finds a girl and finds out his genitalia doesn't function properly when they are in the process of sexual intercourse, and so his arm turns into a 12 inch genitalia and splits the poor broad in half. Which is fine. I won't spoil the ending because it is worth watching. I'll just end this on the note of saying that this anime is sweeter than 90 year old virgin catholic nun p*ssy juice. Well kept and preserved with a tingling feeling on the tip of your tongue. Don't get me wrong, i've had more fun sneezing into a used tissue paper filled with my very own ejaculate fluid on it, but i'd say give both a try. This has been a Clams Review, if you'd like me to review something just message me.",

I watched the whole series in 2 days just cause it was so good, I couldn't stop.\r\nStory:  Sometimes with a series, there is like a drop off point where u feel like some episodes lacked a little and brought the series down.  Not with this series though! It was consistently good all the way through.  Never once did i find the story to not make sense.  It was very unique and kept my interest at all times. \r\nArt:  Theart was very good.  There was a lot of detail in every scene, especially with the gory scenes.  The characters all looked very nice as well which I think is important for a series.\\n\\n\r\nSound:  Sound was great as well! The opening song and the ending song was nice to hear every time I watched an episode.  The characters all sounded good as well.  There was some real emotion in their voices.  Definitely no complaints.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:  I enjoyed most of the characters in Kiseijuu.  The main characters Shinichi and Migi were fun to watch and i liked seeing their relationship progress throughout the story as well as Shinichi's relationship with his lady Satomi.  The antagonists were cool too.  Like you could understand where they were coming from  which I think is important for a series as well.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:  Like I said before, I watched the series in 2 days.  I enjoyed watching it so much I wasn't able to stop till I saw the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this was a a phenomenal series.  It has action, gore, drama and even romance which I always enjoy seeing.  I definitely recommend seeing it if u are looking for a series that will leave you on the edge of your seat with what will happen next.",

It's the second one I watched as a recommendation after Tokyo Ghoul, therefore I don't have much experience. Even so I found it pretty interesting and as someone who is more interested in a story rather than visual violence, it had a very good balance between horror/bloodshed moments, but not enough to make me turn away. I had a feeling this was not the focal point and that is why I expected more of the story side. There were someissues with it, some lack of character development or forced dynamics (especially at the end of the show), but my association for this anime is \"balance\" - it gave so much in little steps, giving you just enough to want more and giving each viewer their own perspective. It didn't have a straight answer on the question \"why?\" and to me it felt a bit open ended with questions to ponder about. The OST helped with leaving an interesting impression a lot. Even though I see why some people complain about the show, I dare to say it is definitely worth the watch as it was one hell of a ride.",

As Migi and Shinichi learn to understand one another, they come todiscover that other alien parasites are integrating themselves into human society and trying to understand the morals and norms of human behavior while slaying and feeding on other humans for the sake of self-preservation. Before I go further into this review, I will warn folks that this baby won't be for the young and squeamish as there are a number of violent and gory deaths that occur in conflicts between parasites and humans. If you aren't the type who can tolerate such content, I would advise you to move on. Otherwise, on with the review.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte offers up a nice balance of elements of sci-fi, horror, and psychological drama in its exploration of the dynamics between humans and parasites. The first several episodes of the series start off fairly light in spite of the messy ways that parasites and humans get killed onscreen as the series milks some humor off the awkward interactions between Migi and Shinichi as the former tries understanding humans and the latter tries concealing his rather unique predicament. However in a rather shocking plot twist which I won't spoil here, events escalate toward more darker and serious fare when Shinichi becomes more willing to seriously engage the alien parasite threat and learn more about their presence on Earth.\\n\\n\r\nFrom that point, Parasyte mixes around focus between exploring more about alien parasites and getting into some existential themes regarding the worth and relevance of humanity as a whole. More is revealed about the motives of parasites like Reiko Tamura who have varying perspectives on how to coexist with humanity and an apparent alliance made between a number of them that gradually become curious or threatened by Shinichi and Migi's unique co-existence. The events also drive Shinichi to come to terms with comprehending humanity's worth in the world as he tries to understand the varying perspectives that parasites like Migi have regarding human concepts like emotions, procreation and desire to bond with other humans. Both elements mostly carry gray morality to them as the worth of a living being's existence is one that is not an easy question to comprehend and Shinichi finds himself coming to struggle with trying to understand what he has become with his coexistence with Migi.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of style, the series also creates some rather convincing suspense out of Migi and Shinichi's fights with random parasites. The two find themselves often having to strategize and create plans on the fly to exploit the environment and openings against enemy parasites to get an upper hand or fatal blow delivered on them. Many of these instances are risky for the pair of them and they usually have to deal with minimizing human casualties during more hostile situations, which raises the stakes and tension during battles. Outside of creating genuine thrill out of whether or not the two will prevail in their fights, it also helps to further develop the relationship between the rather unique pairing.\\n\\n\r\nAll isn't perfect with Parasyte though. The romantic relationship that the series attempts to push with Shinichi and Murano is not quite all that convincing as Murano has little involvement with Shinichi's struggles throughout the series and she does not get much in the way of focus throughout the show beyond being concerned about the outward changes with Shinichi's character. The finale also suffers somewhat with a couple villains introduced in the final episodes of the series who are rather shallow with their motives and lack much in the way of dimension, even with the genuine suspense created with the danger they offer up to Shinichi and those close to him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Parasyte offers some engaging suspense and psychological drama with the relations and hostilities between parasites and humans seen through Shinichi and Migi's eyes. In spite of some of its flaws, the series is still worth checking out if you're a sci-fi and/or horror anime fan.",

The parasites are brutal and capable of manipulating their human host in unspeakable ways, with little to no regard for emotion and sensibility. Their main concerns are for their own survival and the extinction of the human race. This anime is an exciting thrill ride from start to finish, with a quality storyline and great character development. You know the character development is top notch when it includes development of your feelings towarda parasite in a person\u2019s hand. Parasyte will make you laugh, make you cry, make you wince, and everything else for that matter.\\n\\n\r\nYou might enjoy this if: You are searching for a unique sci-fi anime that you will want to finish as soon as possible to find out what happens.\\n\\n\r\nYou might not like it if: The sound of parasites taking over bodies and manipulating them in unspeakable ways is too much for you.\\n\\n\r\nNote to the Viewer: Be prepared for something you will not be prepared for.",

            "content": "Wow. I finished Parasyte last night (technically this morning) at around 2:00 AM. It's one of those anime. Now I'm not here to critique it's fine points, because you can break down even the greatest anime until they look like pieces of crap. So I'm here to simply talk about what was GOOD about the anime without giving any spoilers.\r\n      I'm usually one to zone out and simply enjoy my anime, so I usually don't try to write reviews as I don't go in depth too much, butI learned from this anime so I though I'd try. To begin, the story was fantastic. It's an interesting concept, and the story is perfectly done to intrigue you to ask questions and view the world differently. The characters were the best part. They were dynamic and never boring, with the main character Shinichi and his little parasitic helper forming a bond over the course of the show. The art was perfect for this show but if you don't like a LOT of gore don't watch this. I've seen much worse as far as gore goes, but there is still a reasonable amount in this show so just something to look out for. The soundtrack was suitable for the show, and the opening and endings were fantastic and perfectly captured the mood. The anime was intense and captivating and kept me on the edge of my seat for the first time in awhile, as I haven't enjoyed an anime this much for so long. The real part that made me enjoy the anime was the view it showed me on human beings. We as a race have this sense of entitlement and have these strange emotions such as loyalty, love, and we do things no other organisms do, like suicide. It's like our primary goal isn't just to live as our instinct tells us, but we want to live for others as well. When a predator comes on to earth that threatens human's in this anime, the first reaction is to call them enemies, and to do whatever we can to get rid of them. But what the characters and dialogue makes you think about is things like \"What makes us so superior?'\", \"Why to we get to pray on other animals as a matter of course, but when we get preyed on, the other organisms are the truly terrible ones?\". It makes you think of what's truly right and wrong and takes you out of society's norms.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I give this a 9/10 and I'll hope you'll give it a shot.\\n",

            "content": "Summary:\r\nParasyte adopts many characteristics akin to previous great, popular anime. Specifically, it introduces an original fantasy concept and attaches it to an ordinary main character (such that the viewer can imagine themselves in that situation). The chosen concept allows for cool fight scenes and cliffhanger episode endings, both of which give the viewer a constant sense of anticipation and excitement.\r\nSadly, Parasyte offers little beyond this enjoyment. While the anime attempts to explore themes relevant to modern times, it offers little incite into these areas beyond \"humans are polluting the earth\" and \"human values are often inapplicable and illogical\". In fact, the points it tries tomake are often illogical or portrayed via a poor example. The idea that humans are demons and that \\n\\n\r\nOverall, you should watch this anime if you're looking for something exciting to kill time. \\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10:\\n\r\nAs mentioned, the initial concept/premise of Parasyte is great and offers a world of potential. Additionally, the episodes cliffhangers are done really well, constantly forcing you to watch the next episode. Based on this alone, the story would be 10/10. However, the plot progression is unrealistic. Often you will be left wandering why character A did this and character B did that. Worst of all is when the special force teams get involved and take an idiotic, casualty-heavy approach to fighting the parasites.\\n\\n\r\nI was not a fan of the final episode, but others may disagree. The ending scene was felt tacked-on to the main arc and felt like a poor attempt to re-iterate the points the anime was trying to make (that were already pretty in-your-face). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\r\nLet's start with the main characters. Migi and Izumi are great characters. Their actions completely align with their character progression throughout the series. The development of both these characters is great and well fleshed out. \\n\\n\r\nAlmost every other character is awful. All the female human characters get significant screen time. During all of this time they do nothing but hopelessly chase after or fantasize about the main character. They hold no real personality and have no objectives of their own. Each antagonist's character can be summarised by \"I like to eat humans when I'm hungry\". The detectives/special-forces are constantly endangering lives and hold no objective except \"kill the monsters\" without any thought towards gathering information. The female parasite is an acceptable character but her main appeal is just being different from the other parasites.\\n\\n\r\nMany characters die but none of them are developed well enough for you to really care. You're left thinking \"ah, they got themselves killed, that was stupid of them\". If done well, events as significant as death should leave an impact.\\n\\n\r\nExecution 9/10:\\n\r\nParasyte is (or at least looks like) a high budget project. The art, voice acting, and dialog are all great. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10:\\n\r\nThe cliffhangers will keep you watching. The concept will peak your interest. But at the end of it all you might feel a little bit empty and wonder if it was worth your time.",

The one thing missing was sufficient amount of background information so that the as called plot twists would be more twisty. On every scene there was a really high chance of you knowing whats happening next. These bits harm the otherwise naturally going story. I've got to mention that the decisions main characters made were rational in compassion of what they were presented. 7\r\nArt was top notch. I could ask for more frames per second or smoother development in Izumi but on the other hand I understand this way of approaching. The styledidn't do correctly in regards to the manga, though. Especially animation of Satomis expressions was just outstanding. 10\\n\\n\r\nSound track was memorable and fitting, although the dubstep in fighting scenes took kind of a big role. Also I just couldn't stand the opening. The voice acting was really great, as it should be on an anime of this caliber. 9\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, well apart from their close to rational choices in every situation, weren't the best part of this show. Every character of this show could be described in a single sentence. However, it did not ruin the experience in any way. 7\\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy it, but wasn't that hooked on it. I always knew that what I'm going to watch is going to be good, and it didn't put me down.

It had a thing to teach, had somewhat emotional impacts all cleverly enough plotted with action and packaged in a good outer shell. I would recommend watching it. 8",

A while later, I gave in to the anime community that praised this anime and I gave it a shot. It was 100% worth my time. It really showcased the human psyche and how we perceive them, in which made me question my perspective of humanity. This has quickly become one of the greatest anime I have watched. Easily with the top 30, despite having watched hundreds of anime.\r\nThe story, characters, art style,it all had done a part in making this such a fantastic anime. Through out the whole series, I've noticed how Izumi had change within the timespan of this series.

            "content": "The first reaction after watching this anime is \"DAMN! this is the best anime ever!\" However, with reflection this anime (while being great) has many weak characters that flood the screen for far too long. This anime could have easily cut out the fluff and made it into 12 episodes. That being said this anime is still and will remain one of my favorites of all time. \r\nThe internal struggle Shinichi Izumi undertake throughout the series. You really feel for him and his parasytic partner Migi. Without spoiling the end, I will say that the growth of those two characters together is eye watering. Icried tears of both sorrow and joy at the end of this series. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problem with this show is a problem that plagues other anime. It's the random harem of girls syndrome. Female characters with no depth or characterization apart from the fact that they are in love with the protagonist. One of the more interesting characters in the series (or so I thought) plot went absolutely nowhere! You waste time seeing this character for many episodes with no real closure leaving this time suck feeling in your head. The main love interest of Shinichi Izumi doesn't really go anywhere either. She loves him more or less the same throughout the entire series with no growth really as a human being. You do see how bothered she is by the struggle that Shinichi goes through and you do grow to care bout her in that respects. But apart from that she has no character of her own. The show would have done better with more emphasis on the dynamic between Shinichi and Migi instead. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Great series with an intriguing plot and well done protagonist. But otherwise has weak and mindless female characters that dominate the screen. The Music is astounding and leaves you breathless in the most emotionally gripping sections of the show. I do recommend a watch. But to give it any higher than an 8 would be an insult to other anime that properly give attention to all characters. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Parasyte (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu) is a throwback to the old nineties sci-fi alien killing machine anime with a very thought provoking message.\r\nStory: \r\nUnpredictable - Parasyte goes from light-hearted school life moments to some of the most gruesome murders in the same episode. Parasyte does well to let you know early on that everyone is in mortal danger and nothing is sacred. There are moments where I was nearly unable to continue watching the show, which made it all the more impactful. \r\nArt:\r\nParasyte's animation is above average but nothing too special in this day and age. The important scenes and characters are well drawn, howeverin some scenes they used that god awful 3D-rendering for panning crowd shots, which I absolutely hate, but can deal with in minor doses. The fighting scenes looked physical when they needed to, and they really nailed how arbitrarily the parasites can kill a person. I'm glad that they didn't shy away from blood and gore, but also didn't use an excessive - and unrealistic - amount of it.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nSolid type-cast voice acting with no annoying characters you wish would die just so they'd never speak again. The intro song is OK, a tad too \"angsty-teen-who's-favorite-band-is-Linkin-Park\" for me, but it fits the anime well. The outro song is really inappropriate and unsuitable except for a few select episodes, hilariously so.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nA fairly bland main character in Izumi Shinichi somehow becomes more interesting by becoming more bland. The real star of the show is without a doubt Migi, with his dry humor and subtle quips that compliment his generally creepy (but somehow also cute?) appearance. The supporting cast definitely have more depth to them than Izumi, but he manages to engage the viewer by himself enough to be passable.\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of Parasyte is that you are never fully able to tell who is the antagonist, if there is one at all. It's about survival, and at the end of the day can you blame anyone for desiring to live?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis anime ripped my emotions to shreds; you're never quite settled in and it just keeps landing haymakers right where it hurts. It deeply invests you in its story - toys with you - before leaving you high and dry, and yet I couldn't get enough!\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n9/10 due to a fantastic and thoughtful story; the only thing I felt held it back from the mythical 10/10 was a forgettable main character and several inconsistencies regarding characters (mostly with the ever-frustrating Murano Satomi). I left Parasyte feeling satisfied and yet also hungering for more.",

            "content": "Story \r\nParasyte's greatest strength is the relationship between Shinichi and Migi. Migi is more than Shinichi's right hand, Migi has his own intelligence and personality. As such, it is a nice treat seeing how the two of them grow as characters throughout the series. The really intriguing thing is how the two of them shape the views of other, with both of them behaving startlingly similar to the other at different points.\r\nSoundtrack\r\nWhile it got off to a bit of a rocky start with its heavy use of dubstep-like music early on, Parasyte's soundtrack eventually grew on me and now I can't imagine ever forgetting thesongs in the series. From the excellent opening and ending themes to numerous pieces of background music, there was just so much for me to love about this show's music. It also helped that many of the songs perfectly set the tone for the scenes they played in. For instance, whenever the chanting from the song \"Hypontik\" would play, I knew something big was about to go down. But for my money, I think my favorite song on the show's soundtrack is the calming \"Next to You\" and \"it's the right time\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nAlso, this is one of the very few anime that I've watched that I don't feel the need to go back and read the source material. Not because I don't think it'd be good, but because this is such a brilliant work that it left me with nothing more to be desired.",

            "content": "Parasyte is an odd anime. Not in terms of its basic premise, story or characters or anything like that. It's an odd anime because there's so much it does right, yet leaves an unsatisfying feeling once you're done.\r\nThe basic premise isn't anything exceptional or noteworthy, though it isn't bad in any way either; the show opens up with a normal teenager waking up and realizing that his arm is gone, and in its place is a parasite (roll credits folks).\r\nThe show basically covers the dynamics between the parasite and the student, exploring how parasites are slowly taking over the world, melting into human society andthe contrast between them and the humans (whether as a community or as a species). The contrast is generally well done, but becomes less engaging as the show progresses due to a lack of any real complexity among any of the parasites (for the most part) and completely among the humans.\\n\\n\r\nThis makes sense in the context of the themes, but means that the characters are simplistic and one note, becoming less engaging as the story continues.\\n\\n\r\nThe themes are quite interesting and compensate somewhat for these flaws, discussing how humans are in this setting no longer at the top of the food chains and how the parasites attempt to coexist and cope with humans for survival. \\n\\n\r\nThe show delves further and discusses how humans aren't mere killing machines among the parasites, delving into all sorts of different perspectives among the parasites and among the humans.\\n\\n\r\nProblem is that that is exactly what the show does wrong. The themes are well-fleshed out and very interesting, but the plot is incredibly simplistic and incredibly reliant on the themes and the audience being completely engaged with them; once you delve further, the plot is filled to the brim with plotholes and flawed logic, and becomes less consistent and weaker as the show progresses.\\n\\n\r\nThe way the manga was adapted takes a good chunk of the blame, since the internet being present yet no one knowing about the parasites is in itself a giant plothole that is increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief for as the show progresses. The manga took place in the 80s, at a point in time where the internet was non-existent and as such it would make sense if parasites took time to be discovered. This gets worse as the show progresses, and is incredibly hard to ignore.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork is pleasant to look at, though not as fitting as the manga's artwork. The animation is above average but nothing particularly special to look at, fitting the show but fairly low quality by Madhouse standards.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is solid and consistent throughout the show, and the sound effects do not disappoint either.\\n\\n\r\nHere we get to yet another problem the show faces; the soundtrack is generally very poor with very few standouts. I don't know who had the bright (read: stupid) idea of putting dubstep in the soundtrack, but it doesn't work and ruins immersion completely in certain scenes, which is a shame because this show has plenty of amazing moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are generally unremarkable and forgettable, with character relationships being very forced, unnatural and forgettable for many. The show is fairly good at developing the interesting dynamic between Shinichi and Migi, and this is easily the best part of the show and the most entertaining one to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are poorly developed, with very few receiving anything resembling development other than the main leads.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Parasyte is a show that does it's job and is a solid time waster for those looking for something thought provoking and distinct from most anime.\\n\r\nIt's a far, far cry from perfect though, and the show is very inconsistent or even weak at certain parts.\\n\r\nNevertheless, there's something in it for everyone, and it's highly recommended to give it a shot.",

The last episode caught me by surprise because I had not read the manga before watching. I have since went back and read certain parts of the memorable scenes and seen that they did a great job portraying the actions as described in the manga.\r\nMy favorite part of the show was the music. For each scenario, be it action packed or even a romantic part, the music was on point. \r\nI did feel like it was slow at some points, but after seeing the whole seriesthrough, I was amazed. Not only was it great to follow as the episodes were released, but the show also has very high rewatch value to see some of the fight scenes and see some of the interactions between the characters. Although I have only watched a small amount of anime, this show is going to be one of the best that I have seen.",

The story is well written, that creates a lot of suspenseful situations that leaves me on the edge of my seat. It had amazing music tracks that are queued in at the right time and great use of sound effects with some generic ones. The style and art of the anime can be seen being evolved and shows the artists in the production being increased in their skill, not saying the art was bad at first but you can really notice the effort and precision put intothe later episodes. It puts a nice polish to the ending. The ending of the anime does seem a bit rushed, it could have been extended with more detail, but it is understandable since it is a 24 episode series. Not sure if there will be a sequel soon, but I can say that there will be an OVA for sure because there is a high demand for this anime. Overall it is a great unique story, and very well directed and co-ordinate help from the producers and is a must watch for any anime fans of horror/action anime.",

I actully put off starting this because I thought it would be really gorry or scary and to be honest it was neither. lets face it, anime just can't be scary... it's not possable. \r\nBy that asside why I feel this show is just 'good'?\r\nWell the premise is pretty good and a little different from any epidemic like show I have even seen before, for that I can give it credit. please be aware I haven't read the manga...\r\nI found the characters a little boring, Shinchi probably the most so and that'snot good when he's the main freaking character. Migi on the other hand is pretty cool and at least his lack in emotion can be understood. I just feel like the charcters went backwards in development and become more boring and less easy to sympafice with as the show went on, it wasn't really possable to grow to like characters. I'm not saying it's impossable to like them, the show just doesn't try hard to make you like them...\\n\\n\r\nThe art on the other hand and action scenes are beautiful and very well done and although i'm not a fan of 'screamo' i really felt the soundtrack fits the mood on the show to a tee... I especially love the second ending 'It's the right time' (note: no screamo, just a very lovely male voice ^_^)\\n\\n\r\nI don't really know how to expain it, there was never a point where i wanted to drop this show, I just think compared to other stuff I wan watching at the same time this is not one of the best... but it's also not one of the worse... \\n\\n\r\nYou would have to give this show a watch to gauge your own opinion I think,  i just wasn't that over the moon about it, at least not as much as one of my friend's were, maybe it was just his hype making things a little worse for me and that could have effcted my overal enjoyment.",

I mean characters annoying because they are far from the reality by their over-feeling. ---> shinichi (the protagonist) is the king of those. Now, imagine the opposite. Someone who can't feel absolutly nothing for others but himself. A parasite.  \r\nWhat would happen if you mix this human with this parasite in a same team fighting for their lifes?  this is for me the best part: They need cooperate to survive but the fact that they arevery different makes  them  fight themselves all the time saying  different approaches of the same thing. Shinichi, the protagonist,  can't stand see the people die meanwhile he doesn't do nothing...  and the parasite... well.... just doesn't care others but himself.  It's awesome the way that mixing opposite extremes creates a perfect intelligence.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has 2 faces: \\n\\n\r\n1\u00ba ) Action/fight:  A lot of action and fights  further they are very sensefull (not like other animes). \\n\\n\r\n2\u00ba) thoughts: This anime is really well-thought. There are philosophy everywhere, and not stupid philosophy; it is very accurate to the reality.\\n\\n\r\nWatching this anime you will enjoy both, fights and  approach, I promise.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I would like to stand out that you never know who will die, thing that gives emotion in every battle ;) \\n\\n\r\nSince this anime made me think a lot and it's funnier than most (further it has  the most original battles I've ever seen)  I mark this as a MUST-Watching anime. 10 out of 10.

            "content": "Whenever I try to describe this anime to someone else, it just sounds so awful. \"A guy gets a parasite in his hand and has to kill bad guys\". The anime summary even sounds mediocre, and to be honest, no summary can do this anime justice. This is one of the best anime I've seen, it's a roller coaster of emotions, and once it gets rolling, it doesn't stop. Each episode has something new and exciting to offer, there was seriously not a dull moment.\r\nThe story was 10/10 to me. It was just unique and outstanding. It combined plots of thriller and suspense with someemotion and slice of life aspects. Like I said before, once it gets going in the first episode, it doesn't really stop from there. There was no slow episode, you know, those episodes so full of dialogue that it's hard to concentrate and you end up losing interest? There's none of that. It weaves in elements to the story through actions and plot line. The story just keeps going and it's full of action and new things to look forward to. It also gives you something to think about as you watch: how human emotion relates to other living things. The story contains times when you can relate to a character, and it really pulls you in.\\n\\n\r\nArt was 8/10. I mean, it really wasn't bad, but it did no justice to the original manga artwork. The manga had some of the most detailed, scariest art, it was stunning. Due to animation, most of the parasytes don't look as scary as they're supposed to. Nonetheless, the art was easy on the eye  and quite well drawn with high detail and attention to littler things. \\n\\n\r\nSound is a 7/10. The background music was energetic and mood fitting, and it especially helped put the emotion in. It had some dubstep in the background for some of the more actiony moments which wasn't bad. However, I disliked the opening of the anime, I felt that there was a lot of autotune and the likes. The voice actors and sounds really fit their characters. All the parasytes sounded monotone and emotionless like they should, and the main characters really had a lot of emotion and inflection that was well done.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment is 10/10. Each episode contained something new and exciting, so I knew that looking forward to each episode as it's released was worth it. It always kept my attention. Each episode kept you wanting more, and it was always exciting to watch things come together. It contained much suspense and action for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall is 10/10. I'm trying so hard to write this without spoilers and do it justice. The anime just sounds so bland and cliche when you read the synopsis and stuff, but it really takes you for a ride. It's unlikely to find an anime like it, something with suspenseful thrillers and captivating life moments. I cannot do it justice. Even if you don't care for suspenseful, thrilling anime, this is the kind that includes many other elements as well to appeal to all senses. There's new things at each episode so there's never a dull moment, and I've said that like 8 times but it's true. The anime ties together sound, art, and story so artfully together that it takes you for a unique, outstanding ride.",

I can remember when I was watching this anime and  my roommate  saw the scene in which MC's hand was talking and he asked me, \"What the hell are you watching?\" But let me tell you how weird synopsis may sound it is a must try anime. The MC is very realistic, neither any prodigy nor very dumb but a normal guy like us leading  a normal high school life. The best thing about the anime is that they completely explained the questions which we might get in our mind.At so many scenes I felt that they will try to pull plot armor to get MC out of the situation but MC analysed the things in his mind which we as viewers might think. Mostly in anime fights characters take actions without thinking even if they have no chance of winning and we as audience like them for being so \"cool\" but here MC is realistic. He was afraid when it was needed and also bold accordingly. The best example of this was MC's fight with Gotou. For me ending was not that great though not bad. I felt that Migi's (the parasite who got into MC's body) thoughts in the last episodes should have shown more clearly.\\n\r\n                 Well you can make out flaws in everything if you want but this anime for me was very enjoyable and is highly recommended.",

            "content": "Some stories are written to illustrate an idea. This anime tries it's very best to express something profound and interesting. It succeeds.. for the most part. I am editing this a few weeks after watching the show, and I want to add that the ecological message it delivers is quite effective. The idea that we are the ultimate predators, that the old law of survival of the fittest no longer applies to us because while we may be weak as an individual, we wield devastating power as a society, that we are focused on our definition of survival at any and all costs is compelling- because it is true.\\n\r\nThis verse from the opening theme illustrates this perfectly:\\n\r\nA human baby \\n\r\nWhen will they find out \\n\r\n[When will they find out the true fact yeah] \\n\r\nthat at the point they were born, we are \\n\r\n[we are winners] \\n\r\n(the) winners of Earth\\n\r\nI am more impressed with this show now that I have put some time between myself and the last episode. Watch this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall, a good show to watch. It is an emotional and thought provoking ride that I was happy to be on.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\n The story tries to talk about what it means to be human and what it means to live as an organism in a complex ecosystem. The ideas presented in it are worth thinking about and even if the story doesn't convey everything it wants to as well as it wants to, there is plenty of food for thought.\\n\r\nThe plot follows the traditional high school hero and throws in other one dimensional characters to help him along or offer advice. There are some very interesting elements such as the episode titles [Crime and punishment, The selfish gene],  the serial killer who wears a T shirt with 'REDRUM' on it, that hint at a greater philosophy driving the story than simply Monster Battles. This makes the world well fleshed out. \\n\r\nThe first half seems to see things from the human perspective and the second from that of the parasites. It is interesting to see how valid the arguments from both sides are.\\n\r\nThere is also, unfortunately, the annoying feeling of having the writer try to consciously pull on my heart strings. That is well and good when I agree subconsciously to go along with the ride, but not so much when the audience knows exactly what they are trying to do, and it ends with a bogus emotional pay off.\\n\r\nThere are also some plot holes, but the story moves at a pace that prevented me from dwelling on them too much.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6\\n\r\nCharacter development is sketchy. One character - migi - is the only one who gets well fleshed out. Shinichi is someone I grew to dislike over the course of the show. He is the voice of exposition in some cases and coming from him, it doesn't seem believable. Migi on the other hand definitely gets the short end of the stick and still manages to stay awesome.\\n\r\nThere is more of the casual misogyny that we have come to expect from anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nQuite good. There are a few glitches here and there but the fight scenes and movement in general is good.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9\\n\r\nThe opening and ending themes are atmosphere appropriate. I liked them a lot. The sound track is pretty good too. The voice actors are serviceable.\\n\\n\r\nI watched this in a marathon session without having read the source material.",

            "content": "Are Humans really superior? Are we the only ones who are at the top of the food chain? Or are there some beings which can even manipulate us; the so-called superior beings? If you want to know more about this view then Parasyte is your ideal choice. \r\nStory: 8/10\r\nThis anime's story is about a teenager boy named Izumi Shinichi, who gets his right hand taken over by a worm-like alien known as Parasyte. The story then follows this boy's adventure which eventually turns out to be a horrific one. This story may seem a bit similar to other anime stories (like Tokyo Ghoul) but thefact is that this anime was made from a manga which was released in 1990. So it has quite the original story. The concept of Parasyte isn't complicated (though being philosophical) so it's quite easy to grasp on. The only lacking is the ending which didn't really make sense because I thought they were going to solve the Parasyte problem rather they stopped at a place where things remain unanswered. Except for that, the story was rather good and kept its uniqueness till the end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nParasyte's character development seemed a bit sluggish because they didn\u2019t really develop the side characters as they did with the main characters. They introduced quite a many characters but didn\u2019t actually develop them well enough. As for the main characters like Shinichi,Migi,Reiko they were quite good. So, I\u2019d give credits to the script writer because the dialogues were spot on and voice acting seemed pretty good too (especially the dubbed version). Sometimes the characters created a sadistic environment which matched the anime genres really well. Shinichi is a pretty likeable character but I would go for Tamura Reiko as the most decent (likeable) character in Parasyte. \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 8.7/10\\n\r\nThe animation of Parasyte seemed quite realistic from my point of view. The characters were not overly beautiful and handsome rather it pointed out the reality (Unlike other animes where pretty much every character is Dashing or Hot). Madhouse did an excellent job as to make the animation quite neat and well-polished. The sceneries were also quite detailed. The gore part of the anime was really good as it influenced the mind of the watchers to a great extent. The animation certainly fits with the theme of the anime. However, the action scenes didn't really depict the reality. The parasytes were fighting in a bulletlike speed where you can barely see what's happening. As this Anime tried to put effort into making the show realistic they certainly made the action a BIT (not too much) unrealistic.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack: 9.5/10\\n\r\nAs for the soundtracks of Parasyte, they were Awesome. The opening really goes with the main motif of the anime and I think the lyrics were also the type which fitted  the anime. Here, you can get the feels right in the spot with the help of the soundtracks. The fighting scenes' soundtracks really enhance the enjoyment among the audiences. You can also get the gloomy type of soundtracks which point out a particular environment of Parasyte. So here ''Ken Arai''(The Music Director) did an outstanding job. Frankly speaking, the soundtracks made me more eager to watch this anime. You can try out \"Next To me\" to know what I'm talking about.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nNow this is one of the strongest parts of the anime because the anime was really paced up. The first 15 episodes were really good. It kept me waiting for another episode quite eagerly. I really enjoyed the anime as it really kept its environment top-notch. Those who have interest for psychological thriller, this is the anime for you. But the ending may (or maynot) disappoint you. The fighting scenes were mostly strategical and it kept me glued to the screen. I didn't really like the romance in here but some viewers may like it as it pointed out another perspective of Parasyte. Talking about perspectives; the show features some deep things like: Are the parasytes bad because they kill or manipulate humans or Are the humans bad as they kill each other for no good reason? These questions are must to pop-up in your head while watching Parasyte & these gave an extra enhacement to my watching experience.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\r\nThis anime is quite good judging from the aspect of its genres. The episodes were executed well enough to eager the minds of the watchers. Though not having an expected character development and ending, the anime was really worth watching. You will find immense thrill watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019d recommend this anime to those who have curiosity in thrillers & don't have any problem with gore. The environment may seem quite gloomy but I assure you this anime is worth your time (at least for the first 15 episodes). About the ending, I\u2019ll let you judge it by yourself.\\n\\n\r\nNow here's a philosophical quote which kept me thinking :\\n\r\n''Upon researching the concept of demons, I believe that, among all life, humans are the closest thing to it.'' - Migi",

This anime is just so good.\r\nThe animation style might seem a little wierd at first, but as the anime goes you can see that it is the most fitting for the anime due to the dark atmosphere it has. \r\nFor me the best thing about this anime is the story; There was some observations i wanted to do regarding the development of some characters but i can only think about how awesome the plot is. It makes you think, it makes you interpret and create ideas of your own about what could be happening. \r\nA great exampleof that is that military operation, that shows that even tho the parasytes have a very logical way of thinking, they learned it just now. Humans have logic completely mastered and refined along the years at their side (personal opinion). Parasytes tend to think in different ways depending on how they were \"grown\" in the first days and i think that is also awesome and says a lot about us.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack is great, highlighting the use of \"action\" eletronic and dubstep on tense scenes. The gore is so good to look at and the movement in battle flows beautifully. The anime kills characters and shows blood with no fear and present moments where there's not a single character in scene, but the scenario is so dark you can feel something bad is going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character growth is one of the most important things in this anime, and goes off the cliche road of forever innocent and pure protagonist. You can also notice how he physically grows as the anime goes.\\n\\n\r\nAlso a huge thumbs up for the desperation scenes, period.\\n\\n\r\nI devoured this anime and i suggest you guys to do the same.",

            "content": "Parasyte was an Anime I had picked up and put down quite awhile ago. Out of simple curiosity, I had went back to it and re-watched what I was up to, and then the newer episodes. It was amazing.\r\nIt was one of the first series I had ever kept up with, (the second being Jojo's) and WANTED to keep up with. The story of Parasyte is quite good, the only complaint I have being a few things I wished they elaborated on further.\r\nThe art in Parasyte doesn't have much need of elaboration. It's Madhouse, so naturally it's phenomenal. The sound is also stellar, the dubstep style opening for a modern feel and the soothing piano ending.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is also phenomenal in this series. Despite the fact most of those watching don't speak Japanese, you can really feel the emotions they put into the characters. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Parasyte, at least some of them are episodic. Besides the core cast, depending on what we are tackling different characters will appear in different episodes. Some don't stick around forever, however. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters I wish, (even though it's an adaptation) had more screen time. Though, it's a bit understandable as the main characters are Migi and Shinichi, and Shinichi's struggle to keep Migi hidden and maintain a normal life, as well as protect those he cares about from the Parasyte menace.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, despite the fact that it gives most of the spotlight to Shinichi and Migi and not others, it's worth it. Both of the characters go through astonishing character development that needs to be seen to be understood. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Parasyte is one of those good series that should be a standard in the Anime Industry today. I enjoyed it, and if the synopsis interests you, you probably will as well.",

An anime which indeed asks a lot of questions about what is humanity, what is life, when is it okay to kill or not, who is the real enemy?\r\nFor me the anime was somewhat average especially if one have seen monster and Berserk the original which both takes on those questions and many more. But Kiseijuu/Parasyte was indeed very entertaining with its action, drama, gore and quite memorable absurd funny moments and even though it is quite similar to Tokyo Ghoul, I think at least it did everything right where Tokyo Ghoul did wrongly andfailed.\\n\\n\r\nAll the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things\\n\r\n- Quite lovely that this anime didn\u00b4t keep the 12 episodes format, it didn\u00b4t feel rushed at all!\\n\r\n- Great absurd memorable moments both the parasite design, gore and the parasite human interaction.\\n\r\n- Not an original plot line but still quite entertaining and especially when it didn\u00b4t try to put on a big world plot but it kept it more small and therefore more \"authentic\" and realistic, and not over the top.\\n\r\n- For me I loved the art, it was simply, still pretty and serious but where its more plainness highlighted the parasite fight moments!\\n\r\n- I love gore, and no this is not a horror! or it is a very softcore horror, a splatter horror :)\\n\r\n- It does indeed do a great job of balancing the more action and drama, the less serious elements, with the philosophical perspective. Therefore it makes an interesting anime which isn\u00b4t too heavy so you can more relax while watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons \\n\r\n- This is not really a critique because I watched this one for the purpose of it being more relaxed and average, but if it should have had a chance of becoming a 10 in my book, then it shouldn\u00b4t have been so predictable, better real horror elements and being more heavy on the philosophical part. But that is just my taste ^^\\n\r\n- Some might criticize the art style for being too boring.\\n\r\n- The opening and ending were memorable but not that great and the soundtrack wasn\u00b4t that noticeable. \\n\r\n- The characters are archetypes especially the side characters, sometimes they do illogical things (something weirdly of their personality), don\u00b4t think too much about it. But I loved the interactions between Shinichi and Migi!\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah I will definitely recommend this anime especially for it being a good all around anime and an anime with a serious tone to it. :) (and not relying on ecchi, classic anime comedy or lollies)",

            "content": "My abridged review of Parasyte (Kiseijuu), one of the best anime in years...\r\n*Plot: 10/10-* Parasyte is paced to near perfection. Every episode moves the plot towards its ultimate destination with even the slower episodes providing greater insight into the characters and plot.\r\nConstantly throughout the series, plot twists are thrown at the audience to always keep you on the edge-of-your-seat. Countless times I would catch myself holding my breath due to the amount of suspense the anime creates. This tension is able to be built up because early in the series you are shown that anyone can die, and yet it never overplays the death-card tothe point of exploitation with just enough characters dying to always keep you on your toes. Despite the thrills, Parasyte is often genuinely emotionally impactful.\\n\\n\r\nThematically, Parasyte portrays various thought-provoking ideas without ever allowing the themes to overshadow the story or characters (read the full post for a further discussion of the themes). \\n\\n\r\nIf a negative had to be stated, it would be episode 22. It slows down the story before the big rush towards the conclusion, which some viewers might dislike, although I had no issue with it. The only other minor issue is that the environmental message is overstated ever so slightly, although it is one of the better uses of said message.\\n\\n\r\n*Characterization: 10/10-* Shinichi Izumi is the protagonist of the story, and he starts out as a likable and compassionate guy. As the series progresses, he slowly begins to lose his humanity, thus turning into the one thing that is trying to kill him: the parasites. His journey is a compelling ride that makes you feel for him as character, especially when his actions cause conflicts with his family and girlfriend. From beginning to end, Shinichi transforms into a different person with a very organic sense of growth, which is reflected by the series\u2019 themes.\\n\\n\r\nMigi is one of the most unique anime characters in recent years. He is literally a hand that can morph into deadly weapons, and yet, his development is a minor image to Shinichi's transformation. The characters symbiotic relationship is rife with conflict and distrust as neither side wanted to be in this partnership. As the series continues, their relationship slowly changes as each one begins to understand the other, which makes for compelling drama and thought-provoking material.\\n\\n\r\n*Overall: 10/10-* Virtually flawless, Parasyte: the maxim (Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu) effortlessly balances riveting suspense, emotional character drama, and thought-provoking themes without ever allow one aspect to overshadow the other. No other anime has ever been able to execute all these aspects to such an effective and mature degree in the past. Undoubtedly one of the best works of fiction in years, not just anime, Parasyte receives my first ever 10 out of 10 as an anime that is about as close to perfect as an anime as can be.",

(SPOILER ALERT) and when Kana dies i acctually freaking cried which is rare because ive only cried when two anime deaths occurred. As before mentioned kana and (SPOILER ALERT) L from death note.The story for this anime was fast paced but i loved it! It is were a kid from highschool (shinichi) gets a visit from an alien parasyte (migi) takes over shinichi's right or left arm (i cant remember :S) and they grow a special bond together although migi tries to act as if he cares nothing for shinichi! \\n\r\n          so all, in all the story is a boy gets his arm taken over by a parasite and he gets hunted down by multiple parasites leaving migi to save his life.\\n\r\n          I hope you found this reveiw helpful- Dylan\\n",

            "content": "Sigh... I'm not good with this kind of stuff. I mingle what I want to say, and don't properly put what I had thought about a single show into a review. It's hard to get my point across since I'm terrible with expressing myself in this fashion with words. I'm afraid that my words won't truly bring out how good this show was, but oh well I'll try, and hopefully you will watch it. The actual review starts now:\r\nHmmm lets see, this show starts with Shinichi Izumi. I think that's his name, who gets infected by a parasite. He was once human, but now he'ssomewhere in between, kinda. This is their tale. \\n\\n\r\nSo basically, imagine Tokyo ghoul. But instead of just fighting, it adds a huge psychological impact onto the story. About how these two species mingle and \"co-exist.\" The purpose of their life, and honestly, much, much deeper and many other subjects spoken from both the human and parasite's perspective. How they change and how these species not just live but how they think as well. This is all just becoming repeated words at this point. So I'll just summarize it \"clearly\" with this last sentence. This show is definitely not just about fighting and getting stronger, it actually gets you thinking and puts out some very deep thoughts. The impact that a new species on this planet was and the turmoil from the two. It's like as if there's actually two different sides to the story.\\n\\n\r\nYou also get to see one person's standpoint upon all this, with all his traumatic events and all his turmoil. There's one episode that's very heart warming and touching... for a multitude of reasons.... but basically. This show is more than just fighting, it's adapting to new life and how Shinichi deals with the turmoil of all this. Since he's somewhere in between, you get to see the human and parasites side of all of this. The statements that they make are easy to understand and are thought provoking. Maybe that's because they're blunt and direct with their statements rather than going around the bush like how some shows have done before. \\n\\n\r\nSo anyways, that's my \"Review.\" Hope you enjoyed, and I definitely hope you watch this show.",

            "content": "What a great story, looking at the human existence from the eyes of another creature, eyes of a parasite, a creature that shares not the most important thing that the humans own, Emotions: love, hate, affection, fear... And that's all experienced by a high school student who's still developing, as for his age, his moral and ethical principles, and moreover he struggles even harder when the part of the parasite which replaced his right hand at first as a fully conscious parasite, was forced to emerge with his heart, and mind later when the young fella was at risk of death, so he starts tolose his human features, most importantly the empathy towards his mankind, and as for his parasite companion, it's all good, because this will only lead to more logical decisions.\\n\r\nSo the story goes through that point, our friend will struggle fighting parasites with their great physical and thinking power, and fighting himself trying not to lose what he has left from his human nature.\\n\r\nThe Art in the manga is amazing, the author made a great work making all scenes look so real, vivid, and alive. As for the Anime, they did a great work too, no less than the original manga, though as a start if you read the manga first, you'll for sure feel it's better than the anime, I think it's because you're still a prisoner of how charming the manga was, but later on you discover that the anime charms no less than the manga, especially in the fight scenes where our hero is trying to save someone or himself from a parasite.\\n\r\nIt's just one thing, I always wondered why did they change the way the characters look in the anime from the originals in the manga, it's a confusing change for me, and I remember how I felt nostalgic to the originals once I watched a remake of the opening theme with the original characters looks with no change.\\n\r\nThe sound in the anime is also great, hearing the blades of the parasites fighting is so pleasant. The opening theme is one of the most haunting themes to me.\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I always wished that the main character isn't a high school student. though being that is better for the plot and it's too interesting, but imagining a grown up with a nihilistic point of view was the one who's merged with a logical parasite wouldn't be that interesting to most people, I think it will bring more destruction to the story, but it will explore another side of the human nature.",

            "content": "*minor spoilers*\r\nStory & Writing: \r\n\"I expect this to be difficult for you to comprehend, given human emotions. However, we are fragile. We are merely a lifeform that cannot survive on its own. Don't bully us too much.\"\r\nKiseijuu was heavily inspired by The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka and had the potential to be a 10/10 series but I felt it only made the most of 70% of its potential. Great concept with semi-realistic execution and amazing soundtrack. The transformation and internal struggles of Shinichi is very gradual and believable. His life is a balancing act between humanity and the parasites. The conflicts and unions of interestsbetween him and his right arm are always interesting to watch, and although he vows to reject the parasites, claiming that he can never sympathize with them, he does come as close as he can get to a parasite without actually becoming one. The various themes explored are also quite intriguing, ranging from existentialism, nihilism, individualism, to the sanctity and cruelty of life. Kiseijuu is anything but one-sided in its treatment of the either sides of the conflict. Not only do the parasites slowly become more humanlike, but the humans also slowly become more like the parasites. \\n\\n\r\nOr, rather, the humans have been the original parasites all along. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, on the flip side the show is bogged down by dipshit scumfuck romance subplots, complete with extremely annoying love interests. The romantic triangle mini-arc completely destroyed the atmosphere and pacing of the story, and annoyed me to no end. Also, while Shinichi's girlfriend is interesting in that she serves as a beacon of the human world that Shinichi still has one foot in and is trying to pull the rest of his body over to, she's a useless whiny bitch whose only purpose every time she's on-screen is to bitch, whine, and cry. Halfway through the show my only desire is to see her die a violent death. \\n\\n\r\nAs I've said before, Kiseijuu only made use of 70% of its potential because some of its most compelling themes feel underdeveloped and not as fleshed out as it could. Instead, the show chose to allot too much of its runtime to action scenes and retarded romantic relationships. What a waste.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse's animation is a visual treat as always, with insane and ultra-realistic tentacle animations the like you'd never seen before in all 20+ years of tentacle hentai history. The movements and anatomy of the parasites are mind-blowingly detailed and life-like, greatly enhancing the immersiveness of the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe color palette consists mostly of very dull and dark colors, which fits in quite well with the atmosphere the show is trying to create. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, I feel like Madhouse really pussied out on the gore department. A lot of the carnage happens off-screen rather than on-screen, and when the gore does happen it's usually out-of-frame or soft-censored. Fuck that noise. In a dark and violent story like this, gore goes a long way to set the tone. Don't overdo it, but don't understate it either. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nDamn holy shit. These electronic trance and dubstep tracks really blew my mind. I haven't heard an anime series with a soundtrack this good since Re:Zero. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\n7/10 \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\n7/10 tbh I would kill myself if my right hand started talking whenever I try to jerk my ding dong.",

The action scenes are also good, some of them I will admit they are a bit flashy/transformery where you are like what the heck is happening right now, but still good.\r\nThe gore is also great, what I meanby this, is that there isn't just gore, gore, blood, blood in every scene they use it only when needed or appropriate which I can appreciate. Also, the animation art style is gorgeous taking on a bara/traditional style of drawing with a lot of detail.\\n\\n\r\nHighly recommend you give it a watch as it is a great anime.

            "content": "There are many reasons why this is my favorite anime of all time..\r\nThe Character Development. I am always a fan of proper character development and this show is very rich in that. Some changing quickly others more slowly and some not at all but regardless if that is something you enjoy this show does it very well. The main character in particular undergoes extremely rapid change and affects how he relates to others and himself. His struggle, their struggle.. It's Heavy. I would love to talk about this in detail but to me its the most essential element of the show and I dare notspoil it.\\n\\n\r\nThe Philosophy, as a result of the rich character development, many characters find themselves pondering the situation they are in, who they are and what things mean. And I really empathized with many characters, especially once some of them have undergone some change. I am a sucker for quality philosophy. On that note it also deals a good amount with psychology.\\n\\n\r\nThe horror. Okay so this show isn't terrifying, and that is very much due to the way it was animated. If the anime style was darker (which I wish it was) this show would probably given me nightmares. Still there are some scenes where it is very easy to tap into what some of the characters are feeling, and it is pure dread. There is a good dash of lightness to the show at the same time.. And there has to be otherwise this show would just be so dark.\\n\\n\r\nThe heartbreak. I cried several times throughout this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe action. The action is the main of the show but there a good deal of it and it is done well for different reasons. From intense moments of power and gore to tactical contemplation in the heat of battle. \\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the soundtrack to this show compliments it so well. During intense moments they play this hybrid dub-step in a horror setting.. my first time through this show it threw me to the edge of my seat. The opening theme is also epic.\\n\\n\r\nI wouldn't consider this a show for everyone, but if you are one of those who it appeals to then congratulations! You are in for a treat.",

While watching kiseijuu i can never know what's coming next. I like that the drama, is very realistic... except the part that parasitic aliens come from the sky and infect humans to then proceed to eat other humans. It tells the story of how Shinichi (the main character) coexist with the alien that tried to eat his head from the inside, and how they overcome the problems that arise by being a halfalien, half human. The intro is one of my favorites and i can listen to it like if it was one of my favorites songs, it reminds me of the intro of Air Gear, another one of my favorite series. Kiseijuu to me is a mix of Mirai Nikki, Btoom, Psycho Pass and maybe Akame Ga Kill, so if you liked any of them you'll probably enjoy Kiseijuu. If you are looking for a series that's more mature, filled with suspense this is for you.",

            "content": "Before I review Parasyte, I'll start by saying that I'm very picky when it comes to anime. I don't like barely any anime made from 2010 and beyond. Most of them, to me, are too similar or cookie cutter.\r\nWhen I first found out about Parasyte (without ever reading the manga beforehand) it interested me. It seemed unique. I remember watching the first episode and I fell in love instantly; every Wednesday I had to watch every new episode.\r\nI'm terrible at finishing anime. Most of the time I'll watch the first episode and lose interest. I watched Parasyte all the way through.\r\nSTORY: 10/10\r\nAt first the premisemay not strike anyone as different or groundbreaking. A normal high school boy suddenly gets special powers. At first it seems like a monster-of-the-day type deal, with Shinichi and Migi finding new parasites to fight. It isn't until midway through the series, where Shinichi undergoes a drastic change, that this story is anything but average.\\n\\n\r\nThere are many life themes in this series, such as what it means to be human. Throughout the series Shinichi grows and changes, and learns about human emotion and worth. Many episodes are very emotional, and I found myself crying quite a few times.\\n\\n\r\nParasyte's deeper indulgence into philosophy and emotion makes it more than what you would expect from a common seinen anime.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI have been a fan of Madhouse since I first watched Kaiji a few years ago. They have a wonderful way of showing character expressions, ranging from frustrated, scared, and upset. Shinichi goes through many phases, and even when he's angry, the animation shows it very well.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as character designs go, it's nothing really special, aside from the various parasites (including Migi). Another part where it shines is definitely the fight scenes, which moves at a very fast and fluid pace with lots of blood and gore.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nWhen I started the series and first heard dubstep playing I was rather hesitant, not being a fan of the genre. As it went on, it became very fitting to the series, especially the action-oriented parts. Next To You from the OST is a particularly uplifting track.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP is excellent, one of my favorite anime OPs to date. The ED is a drastic change from the OP, but that by no means makes it bad. It's very soft and melancholy. If an episode ends particularly sadly it will invoke a lot of feelings when the song starts.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI want to start off by saying that I liked Murano Satomi. I know it's easy for people to hate her or write her off as useless, but I think she was very important to Shinichi's development as a human being. Although I am not a fan of romance subplots (and the part where they had sex was pretty much useless), I think they have an important relationship, especially in the final episode.\\n\\n\r\nBut Migi is where the characterization really shines. He starts off as something that wants to learn about humans and the world they live in, and does not seem to show any kind of emotion. As the series progresses, however, he becomes attached to Shinichi and wants to protect him. Without spoiling anything, the ending shows Migi's true feelings towards Shinichi, and it was written beautifully.\\n\\n\r\nI have to make a special mention to Tamura Reiko, one of the parasitic characters. She, unlike the other parasites in the series, does not simply desire eating humans. She learns to care for a human child and starts to think about what makes humans and parasites the same. Although I wouldn't particularly call her a villain (I'd say that was Gotou), she's very unique compared to the other parasites.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI give this a 10/10 because I enjoyed a large amount of episodes. However, since nothing is perfect, I must add that there was a rather disappointing slowdown near the ending. The parts in city hall and the character Uragami did not hold my interest very much. I did like the last few episodes, though, and I think it wrapped up nicely. The anime was a ride of emotions from start to finish, which I have trouble finding in more recent anime.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nOther than small flaws such as story pacing and some plot holes, I would say this is the best anime of 2014. I enjoyed it the whole way through. It made me very upset to watch the final episode to realize that I can't be excited for Wednesdays anymore. I became very attached to Shinichi and Migi, and I'm glad I saw their adventures.\\n\\n\r\nIt might be difficult to recommend this anime. I think it's for people who like to truly feel something from the anime they watch, and think about life and the human race. The gore and fighting are good for fans of that. It's also uncensored, so you can see Migi turn into a dick, if that interests you. Whether you enjoy it as much as I did is really up to you; but I feel like any anime fan should experience this series at least once in their life.",

The story is one like never seen before because of the unique way of becoming an monster from a human.  fulltime I was deeply enjoyed every single moment of the great tension at every episode. This story really is an good one because it doesnt only have a great  action horror story but it also has great characters with relationships all the way to loving each other to not trusting each other. This serie has the best background music ive everheard on an anime which makes the fights much more tremendous. This anime also has one of my favourite anime openings and endings which makes me keep wanting to watch even more. I can tell you that in my opinion this one is worth watching and i wouldnt change anything of the story.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 10\\n\r\ndefinitely worth a 10 because it doesnt only have an epic horror action story with a great tension but also has great characters with relationships from loving to not trusting that makes the story even better.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nThe art in this anime is absolutely well done in my opinion. Especially the fight scenes because of the fast good looking movements of the monster characters. it could be even better so ill keep it at a 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nLike i said before this anime has the greatest background music ive ever heard because it makes every single fight way cooler and gives it an big amount of extra tension while they're fighting.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 \\n\r\nThe characters are really good. The main character starts as a shy boy and ends totaly different. His friends notice his change of behavior and change their minds about him which makes this story even better with Drama.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nEvery single episode enjoyed me the from beginning to the end especially because of its great tension and music at fighting scenes, but also because of the really good drama.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading my review :)",

Unrelenting action and plot twists kept me satisfied the whole series.\r\nI didn't give it a perfect score on story just because a couple of episodes did seem a bit lazy. For example- their were a couple of battles at the main characters school where a lot of people died. However after the events, the school reopens a couple of weeks later and the students quickly mention their distraught and then move on. It just seemed like it wasaddressed very minimally and I had a hard time believing the setting could just go back to where it was. \\n\\n\r\nI could overlook this largely though, because it is a story about aliens and one must suspend some sense of reality obviously. Also, it introduced me to one of my favorite characters of all time: MIGI. The bond I felt with this character was almost as strong as the bond I share with my own right hand in real life and that's saying something \ud83d\ude2c.\\n\\n\r\nAlso I should note the soundtrack. I really enjoyed all of the music, especially the OST \"Next to You.\" All of the music fit the scenes perfectly.",

OH! and also there might be spoilers.\r\nOn we go.\r\nEvery now and then there comes an anime that no one expected to be released. The anime in question is Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu (or Parasyte: The Maxim) based on the manga \"Kiseijuu\" by Iwaaki, Hitoshi. \r\nThe Story 10/10\r\nAlthough there is a lot of anime using the topic of alien \"invasions\", Kiseijuu seems to do the topic more justice than any other. I enjoyed how the show didn't turn Shinichi into the whiny character that everyone seemsto hate, instead making him deal with what has a happened to him and moving on. The ending was sort of lackluster not to say it was a bad ending, to me it just felt to good (if that makes any sense).\\n\\n\r\nThe Art 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation and character designs are stunning, MADhouse does an incredible job as always. The one thing that did bother me was the cgi. Whenever there are too many people to draw they are animated in cgi, don't get me wrong the cgi wasn't bad in any way, it was just distracting.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe opening themes was great, usually i find myself skipping over the opening as to save time, this time such wasn't the case. The OST fit every scene perfectly, i particularly enjoyed the dubstep track mostly due to my own personal taste in music. Now the ending theme while enjoyable, did not hold my attention for too long.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nKiseijuu like much of the other anime I've followed weekly has kept me on the edge of my seat. I'd like to partly acknowledge the characters for that. Migi was fantastic often said to be the breakout character and i agree, even for being the emotionless and rational alien he still felt very lovable. Shinichi the main character is and will forever be one of my favourite anime characters, mostly because of the way he dealt with the situations that arose. All the supporting characters were given enough screen time and development to be believable and relatable. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nIll admit, i didn't watch this show from the beginning. Which gave me enough time to binge-watch half of the show, making me much more excited for the episodes to come. In short i followed this series with a burning passion and enjoyed every frame of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is a great anime for those who enjoy the sci-fi/Horror genre... Actually scratch that, this is a great show that i recommend everyone give a shot.\\n\\n",

But they had a habit of debating the line between human morals and animal instincts.\r\nNow I would like to note that when your enemy is dead before you and slowly regenerating, that is not the time to discuss your morals, and try to cling on to humanity.  This is something thatyou have worked out prior to the battle.  If you're going to show mercy.  Please do not waste an episode discussing it with yourself.  That is an episode that could be used for much better things.  Another battle per say.  \\n\\n\r\nI give this show overall, a high seven, maybe a low eight.",

The story is very gripping and you crave more as you delve deeper and deeper into the mystery of Kiseijuu.

The side characters were decent. Murano might come off as annoying to most viewers but I felt she was genuinely concerned and did help him through his internal struggles. Kana was poorly written and annoying. Mitsuo first came off as a generic bully but showed some hidden depths later on. Tamura was excellently written and was definitely one of the best parts of the anime. \r\nThe story was well paced( until the last 1/4) . The voice acting was good althoughnothing was great. The music was decent but could have been better. In the last 1/4th of the anime, a large tonal shift occured which I felt wasn't done well and deeper themes were shoehorned in. I also thought the ending was unfulfilling. The japanese audio was far greater than the english dub. The english dub was horrible.\\n\r\nAlthough, my review comes off as really negative, I actually really enjoyed it despite its flaws. 7.5/10\\n",

            "content": "I think that this show had a lot of potential to be interesting but bad writing, mediocre animation, a laughably stupid soundtrack, and an ending that left me lost for words (not in a good way) makes me give this show a 4. However, if I was just rating the last few episodes, then I wouldn't be reviewing it on this site because it does not feature negative numbers as a score.\r\nParasyte is a show about an alien species invading Earth, taking over the minds and bodies of humans, and killing us off one by one. The main character, Shinichi, is taken over by aparasite who he will later name Migi. However, something goes wrong in the process of taking over his body and Migi ends up only taking over his right arm. \\n\\n\r\nThis is what initially got me interested in the show. Shinichi is a regular high school student but with this parasite now connected to him and other parasites looking to kill him he must work together with Migi to survive while also hiding his existence from everyone. What makes this interesting is that Migi does not have any emotions. He thinks only with logic and his main and only goal is to survive, with or without Shinichi. Because of this Shinichi has to find ways to deal with him and convince him not to kill his friends, family and sometimes, Shinichi himself. \\n\\n\r\n(Spoilers ahead)\\n\\n\r\nIt's a very interesting dynamic that really kept me interested in watching. Especially, when Shinichi is injured and Migi merges parts of himself with Shinichi to keep them both alive. At this point, the show starts to pick up as Shinichi stops being such a whiney bitch and actually starts doing cool stuff. With more and more parasites after him, Shinichi must work even harder to survive. Even sometimes skipping school, which is great because the scenes when he's at school trying to apologize to his girlfriend for the hundredth time over are fucking awful. Although, it seems that right when a plotline or a character starts to get interesting the writers just cut it short. Like one of the characters, Kanna, who was able to sense parasites but was killed off before they could explain why she had that power.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, right when it seems that the show is starting to get interesting, all the writers all simultaneously get concussions that leave them with permanent brain damage. From this point on the entire story turns into a mess of... I'm running out of words to describe it. It's fucking awful like it's really fucking bad. There's a point where a cop starts suspecting that Shinichi is a parasite and right as he starts to confront him about it the writers don't know what to do so they just have him wake up from a nightmare in his house and never explain what was a dream and what wasn't. Also, the writers were so clueless on how to end the show that they literally show two different outcomes to a situation. Not even kidding they show two different scenes of Shinichi doing two different things. It's fucking ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nHonestly, most of the show was enjoyable to watch. I'd probably have rated it a 6 or 7 if it wasn't for the last few episodes. Really that abomination disguised as an ending was so bad that it felt like some kind of morally wrong thing to give this show a higher score than 4. Even if most of it was pretty decent.",

            "content": "How do you know when you enjoy an anime very much? Well there are many tells, and one of them that told me I absolutely enjoyed this one was that the episodes felt very short. It's the same thing that happened to me when I watch One-Punch Man. I get so into it, not a single dull moment, and before I know it, the episode is done. So then, Enjoyment 9/10.\r\nThere are the reasons why this anime was so enjoyable to me:\r\nStory: 9/10\r\nI believe that the progression and story-line was well paced, without missing out on necessary information that was needed to be delivered sothat the viewer has a good understanding of the setting and the events that occur, including the reasons. Almost every episode ends off with you wanting to see more of what will happen next. I have to say that I watched this one episode per week as it aired in English on Adult swim. I'm not a big fan of watching as something airs because I prefer to binge watch when it's over, but it was a surprisingly pleasant experience for me in this instance.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nNot the best art ever but they did do a good job with the action and the tentacles. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLoved the enthralling modern soundtrack. Always gets me in the mood, I feel the action or sadness of a scene quite well. Very EDM-esque. I find it bad-ass! Outstanding on this one. I will definitely get the soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nShinichi and Migi are the central characters in all this and I feel like they were well developed. There are other characters that could have, no, should have been better developed i.e. Reiko and that girl that liked SHinichi... the one who could have sensed him. I want to be able to connect to those characters and feel for them, but I felt nothing. But I guess that's just the way it is. Shinichi and Migi are the best <3\\n\\n",

            "content": "As someone who has the attention span of a small rodent, it\u2019s very rare that I stumble across a show that manages to keep my attention for hours and hours upon end; eager to lose myself in its story, visuals, and characters. Parasyte is one of those rare gems that hit almost all of the right notes and kept me hooked for the entire series.\r\nIt\u2019s hard to call this show \u201cnew\u201d and \u201crefreshing\u201d since it\u2019s almost three decades old. The manga originally ran from 1988 to 1995, but it is only now getting an anime adaption. However, it seems to have been updated slightly tofit modern times, seeing as everyone is running around with smartphones and tablets. \\n\\n\r\nThe show starts off with some sketchy moments that made me doubt the direction that this anime was going to go in. The very first scene of the anime shows a parasite infected husband eating his wife\u2019s head off, then proceeding to kill their daughter. And after the main character, Shinichi Izumi, has his right hand infected with a parasite, his errant hand grabs his lady friend\u2019s breasts. Being the cynic that I am, it honestly made me think it was going to be THAT kind of anime: full of extreme violence and sex with not an ounce of substance in sight. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. Out of place sexual fanservice is almost non-existent. In addition, while the anime is pretty violent, it doesn\u2019t feel gimmicky and ham-fisted. There\u2019s nothing in Parasyte that is on the level of the fingernail scene in Higurashi or the scene with the puppy in Elfen Lied for example.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first thing you\u2019ll notice about this anime is the amazing art and vivid animation. The character designs are all very realistic (barring some funky hair colors): no impossible proportions or humongous eyes. Of course, sometimes anime with such an art style can fall into the trap of making the characters look too similar, making it hard to differentiate between even the important members of the story. This isn\u2019t the case in this anime. Each character has a simple yet unique and memorable design. Whether it is Reiko\u2019s intense look and striking beauty, Nobuko\u2019s prominent scar, Mamoru\u2019s rosy cheeks, Satomi\u2019s funky yet cute hairstyle, Kana and Mitsuo\u2019s sense of fashion, or Gotou\u2019s intense facial features, each character has a unique trait that sets them apart from the rest. It\u2019s interesting to note that Shinichi\u2019s distinct feature changes over the course of the anime. First it\u2019s his glasses, then his hairstyle, then the scar he acquires near the end of the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is an intense, well executed, and well-paced psychological horror that keeps you hooked from the very beginning. Strange creatures known as parasites kill and hijack a human host\u2019s body and then must sustain themselves by killing and feeding on other humans. However Shinichi Izumi\u2019s parasite fails to hijack his brain and instead lodges itself in his hand. They reluctantly band together in order to protect themselves from other parasites who are beyond reasoning with. \\n\\n\r\nThe premise is pretty simple but this works in the anime\u2019s favor. The parasites are creepy, yet fascinating creatures and seeing their evolution throughout the anime serves as the core of the series. The series never really seems to reach any slow, unexciting points. There always seems to be something going on yet it doesn\u2019t feel like it moves too quickly either. There are some hidden messages in the story dealing with environmentalism. The parasites frequently compare their feasting on humans to humans killing and eating other life forms such as cows and pigs, as well as their casual disregard for the environment. While this makes Shinichi and the viewer think about and question the value of a life, it\u2019s a plot element that\u2019s mostly just sprinkled in. It\u2019s never really developed into a message that will stay with the viewer after they\u2019ve finished the anime.\\n\\n\r\nDespite being a horror/sci-fi film, it develops and handles romance a lot better than some actual romance anime. Romantic relationships in anime are frequently unsatisfying. If two characters even end up being together at all, you rarely see them show each other any kind of affection. They\u2019re usually too shy to do something as simple as holding hands. Then the anime ends before we can even see their relationship grow to the next level. Parasyte however, does an amazing job of building and showcasing relationships and sex, all without being childish or having its characters act like five year olds with crushes.  It truly showcases a mature romantic relationship.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending does a fairly good job of tying up most of the loose ends. Although you can\u2019t help but wonder about certain plot points that were never concluded or clarified. For example, learning more about the parasite's origins and body compositions would have been fascinating. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters aren\u2019t bad, most of them are very static and are either killed off, ignored, or barely change throughout the story. Shinichi and Migi are the two characters that change the most. Being infested with a parasite changes Shinichi and slowly saps away his humanity, empathy, and emotions. Most of his development involves trying to regain these qualities, while clinging to what little humanity he has left. Migi is the exact opposite. Migi is initially a life form with no remorse, empathy, or emotions. Migi only really cares about learning and surviving, it doesn\u2019t matter who dies or who gets hurt so long as he and Shinichi live. It's interesting to see how interacting with Shinichi and observing other humans changes Migi for the better. \\n\\n\r\nAnother parasite with a similar development is Reiko Tamura (known earlier in the series as Ryoko Tamiya). This creepy, emotionless, woman is cold and calculating at the beginning of the series, much like all the other parasites. Changes to her character come about when she is impregnated early in the series and gives birth to a human baby. The treatment she gives this child is abhorrent at first, but slowly she too develops both a genuine maternal instinct and a true understanding of the relationship between humans and parasites.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters of note aren\u2019t given such treatment when it comes to their character development. A lot of the characters introduced either die or are largely ignored in the overarching story. For example, we barely learn about Mamoru Uda, a crucial ally to Shinichi and Migi. Satomi Murano also makes the most appearances behind the main characters and main antagonists. But we learn nothing of her life, backstory, or interests other than her complicated relationship with Shinichi. She is little more than a love interest for the main character. Cute and sweet as both these characters are, their lack of development was a wasted opportunity. \\n\\n\r\nWe also never learn why Mitsuo is such a douchebag, why Kana has the powers that she has, or why Nagai and a few of his fellow classmates have beef with the rest of Mitsuo\u2019s gang. All of these are interesting plot points that the writers could have AT LEAST made a small nod to. \\n\\n\r\nLast but not least is the sound. The soundtrack is a pretty mixed bag. There are some very good tracks that perfectly convey the anime\u2019s creepy, intense mood, and then there are some really horrible, out of place dubstep tracks. The voice acting is great, with a diverse and lively cast of veterans and newcomers alike. \\n\\n\r\nParasyte is a rare gem of an anime that clearly sets itself apart from your average, run of the mill, throw away series that blends in with the giant mass of anime that gets thrown at us every season. It\u2019s a memorable anime that doesn\u2019t show its age in the least; an amazing example of great execution and engaging storytelling. And its full of memorable meme worthy scenes that you\u2019ll be laughing about long after you finish, including (but certainly not limited to) the \u201cWhy are you talking to your penis\u201d and \u201cWho in the world holds a baby like that\u201d scene. \\n\\n\r\nEven despite its small flaws, it\u2019s an anime that hooks you in keeps you interested for all 24 episodes.",

            "content": "I happened to make a report on \"Parasyte\" in an intensive writing on comics book class. Citations below. Enjoy.\r\nMaxim of Man: Our Natural Order\r\n     Great stories go beyond entertaining people. Stories can be used for encouraging people to think for themselves and provide insight to how people think. Parasyte-The Maxim provides insight on how people act as an individual and as a collective. This series can be watched passively and absorbed as an action series. However, the true meaning of the show is a psychological thriller that constantly reminds you of humanity. We are all under the influence of media. Everyoneis networked in ways that public messages stretch across the country and change our behaviors. Othering groups is a way that people have united. The humans and the parasites in the series view each other as the inherit opposition because they are different and do not understand the thoughts of the opposing species. Fantasy stories are open-minded and do not follow a straight line of any ideology. Parasyte shows viewpoints from an omnipotent view. You are forced into the minds of different characters with different motives. There is a left-wing politician who is a bit overboard in his conservationist ideology. Although he seemed borderline psychotic, there were a few points in his last speech that had a nugget of truth to it. We are all familiar with being human and acting as what we perceive to be normal. Deviance from our social dogma is infringement on a social contract. We have all signed this contract with our first breath and this contract is applicable to the day we die. There is an underlying duty for all of humanity to behave in ways that validate what it means to be human in terms of ethical behavior especially.\\n\\n\r\n     Everyone knows that that there is an invisible code of conduct that we must abide to. Dr. Zuleyka Zevallos, PhD in sociology, says that this creed is created by the \u201c[s]ocial institutions such as the law, the media, education, religion and so on hold the balance of power through their representation of what is accepted as \u201cnormal\u201d and what is considered Other.\u201d (\u201cDefining Otherness\u201d). Parasyte-The Maxim covers power of both the media and law. People often think about how the media refers to music and movies and how these sources of entertainment shape our culture. People overlook the power of the news and how information is processed and given to the public. Lies and distortions of news has caused numerous deaths. Captain Carl Otis Schuster, NAVY intelligence officer during Vietnam, wrote an article in Vietnam Magazine regarding the Tonkin Gulf incident. Capt. Schuster wrote, \u201cThere were 122 additional relevant SIGNIT products that the Phu Bai station had misinterpreted or mistranslated many of the warnings\u2026These mistakes led U.S. destroyers to open fire on spurious radar contacts, misinterpret their own propeller noises as incoming torpedoes, and ultimately report an attack that never occurred\u201d (Case Closed: The Tonkin Gulf Incident). It took forty-four years for this information to come into the public view. This \u201cincident\u201d was a lie that got the USA involved in the Vietnam War. This war led to the deaths of over one million people. Parasyte covers how the media is guided by the government, and they are allowed to release censored content that is government approved. When the parasites first landed on Earth they were embedding themselves in humans. If these parasites took control by fusing with the brain, they would become the human and the life that inhabited the body before the hosting is no more. The parasites were cannibalistic. There was a sudden flux of humans killing other humans and eating them. The media was not allowed to cover the subject until there were too many murders to overlook. The murders were then said to be committed by a serial killer. Understandably, some people were paranoid by these deaths that they chose to stay inside and parents kept tighter surveillance on their children. It was intriguing to see how the supposed actions of one person, according to the media, would terrify people to the point of living in fear. The media had an element of control over people and when they left their houses. The media then made it further into everyday life when they learned the nature of the parasite. The government allowed the media to tell people about the parasites. If the parasite took control of the brain, it would have complete control over the host and every piece of the host was an extension of the parasite. There was a silly public trend that was encouraged by the media by having people walk up to their friends and pulling out a single strand of hair as a part of a greeting. If you happened to pull the hair of a parasite, the hair would shrivel up and die. This greeting was a way of finding out who has been infested. We can look around today and see dumb things people are doing because it is popular. Twerking is a public trend that has worked its way into the dictionary. On a darker note, people have died taking selfies. The media is as strong as the law when it comes to social forces. Laws define what is acceptable behavior and differ depending on which borders you stand within. Laws are in place to make sure that people follow a social construct that is beneficial to themselves and to the government.\\n\\n\r\n     Electing representatives that believe in similar philosophies is one way of pulling the societal norms towards your beliefs. If you have enough representatives in a country that believe a certain way, you can relieve the stress of the \u201cOtherness.\u201d Dr. Zevallos said, \u201cDichotomies of otherness are set up as being natural and so often times in everyday life they are taken for granted and presumed to be natural. But social identities are not natural \u2013 they represent an established social order\u201d (quoted in \u201cDefining Otherness\u201d). Otherness is clearly seen in gay rights of the British Isles. The battle for gay rights in Great Britain has worked in steps because the people elected representatives that leaned in their social views, away from wanting to govern homosexuality. Homosexuality was punishable by death in England from 1533-1861. The Buggery Act of 1533 was passed under the rule of King Henry VIII and was a civil sodomy law that grouped homosexuality and bestiality in the same group. Even though the act was repealed in 1828 they continued to hang people for homosexuality for another three and a half decades. Doctor Rictor Norton believes this medieval law to be a basis for modern law. (The Medieval Basis of Modern Law). It took until 1967 for homosexuality to be decriminalized to a mental disease and homosexuality was legal for people aged 21 and up. Homosexuality was equalized with the age of consent, 16, in 2001. There is still a bit of a stigma of homosexuality and residual thoughts that still lie in modern Britons. The kingdom has evolved towards being more open as a whole. These changes happened because people wanted these social standards to change. In the universe that Parasyte took place in, humans saw the parasites as the others and wanted a complete eradication of the species. They did not think for one moment about how the parasites may be able to benefit mankind. The parasites were an alien race that saw only logic and had no feelings. They saw eating one type of food to be far less barbaric than eating a variety of lives to sustain their own life. The humans and the parasites shared a similar goal because they were the only two races to seek evolution that were known about. They could have worked together but reactionaries saw this as an immediate threat to humanity and wanted to kill the aliens without hesitation. Upon finding out that there were parasites that had taken politicians as hosts, the government had launched an attack on the parliamentary building and faked a mad shooter. The military created a scenario where they were able to lockdown the entire building and scan every person as they left the building in a controlled manner. They corralled the hosts off in corridors and killed them and blamed the gunshots on the supposed shooter. The commander of the operation had shown an irrational amount of hate when he saw the first parasite die. He smiled as he rambled on about how these aliens were not life forms, but machines operated by demons. He led a zealous crusade within parliament to gleefully kill every alien he could find. The aliens mutually saw humans as a threat because humans are recognized as the dominant species of Earth that wanted to protect their own way of living. The parasites did things in their own interests of preserving their own lives and saw humans as the others. The parasites had created a caste among themselves where they held themselves above humans and deemed them as expendable because they were an inferior species. \\n\\n\r\n     During the raid on parliament there was an esteemed environmentalist who saw similarities with the parasites and made an alliance. Sasha Simic, a progressive writer, states the obvious but misconstrued notion that \u201cSuperheroes can be reactionary \u2013 but they don\u2019t automatically have to be. In any case stories that treat superheroes as reactionary can also tell progressive tales. Genre does not dictate quality, nor profundity, nor politics.\u201d (Sasha Simic\u2019s A Critique of the Gotham Programme). Parasyte covers a few progressive topics. There is a a mayor named Takeshi Hirokawa. He was a sympathizer of the parasites and worked with the parasites in power. This man was a bit crazy, but made some progressive statements with his final speech that even the most anti-authoritarian members of society understand. People are toxic to this world and we are killing this planet. There are too many people, we will hit a ceiling in terms of sustainability. He raised questions about value in predators. Hirokawa was a populist and created safe havens for the parasites to feed on humans in abandoned buildings and underground parking lots.  The mayor saw nothing wrong with there being a creature that was above humans in the food chain. He thought it was a healthy occurrence that the aliens came to Earth and controlled the human population. One quote that is hard to dispute is \u201cEnviro-conservation measures are all skewed in favor of benefiting the human race!\u201d Saving the Earth is synonymous for prolonging humanity. The politician would see the recent one-child policy of China as a smart move towards bettering the Earth. There is a finite amount of resources available to us and we need to decide how to use them. Is there a way all of humanity can pull together and decrease our need for resources? There are many ways of saving resources; some are more humane than others. China had an infamous one-child policy is one way of making our resources last longer. There are alternatives to such radical ideas of population control. Norman Borlaug, known as \u201cThe Man Who Saved a Billion Lives,\u201d is a good example. This American saved a projected billion lives by engineering high-yield wheat crops (Norman Borlaug \u2013 Biographical). These crops took less water and produced more food. There may be some truth to the words of Hirokawa, but humanity is adaptive and we will survive for as long as we can. Change is the essential process of all existence. Humanity pulled together to make us what we are today; the best this world has to offer. It is a pleasant thought that humans will live forever and spread across the galaxy like in Doctor Who, but we will likely end on this planet. Earth will keep spinning long after we are gone as it did before we cropped up. An inevitable end to humans is nothing to stop us from being altruistic.\\n\\n\r\n     Reiko Tamura was an alien that had experimented with her body and had a baby to understand the stages of childbirth. She had the original intention of dissecting the child after it was born, but grew fond of her baby and developed human instincts. Chris Yogerst, a professor of film and communication, makes a point that \u201c[stories] themselves come from a good place. The belief that people are capable of real altruism is inescapable, human, and the farthest thing from inherently fascistic.\u201d (Stop Calling Superheroes Fascist). She started to love humans. The aliens felt a level of betrayal and felt it may undermine their existence. Her fellow parasites who had caught wind of her appreciation of human life attempted to kill her because she was the other. After bonding with her child she grew an animalistic love and need to protect her child. She was the first parasite to have a real laugh and feel what she believed to be love. She underwent the most otherness in this anime. She was hated by her own kind because she sympathized with the humans and started to behave like a human. She had turned back on cannibalism and started to eat human food. She was hated by the humans because she was an alien. There was no safe place for her in this world. When the government discovered her secret, the detective sought what he believed to be a necessary investigation. The human detective tried to take her baby away from her and she stabbed him with an appendage she turned into steel. This proof of her being a parasite was enough for her to be executed in the park while protecting her child. She was one of the stronger parasites and she could have fought back or fled, but she chose to use her body to save her baby. She talked about starting off as a parasite and ended human as she could get. She thought it was poetic that she began to love humans and her baby was worth her life. She knew her human baby would be better raised by the protagonist Shinichi because he understands humans and parasites. Shinichi has a parasite named Migi that lives in his right hand and Shinichi is in control of his body. The actions of Tamura are seen as heroic to the audience. Human selflessness is in every story that I have read because it is a characteristic that people admire. People see altruism as heroic. It is the recognized duty of a hero to be serving. \\n\\n\r\n     Parasyte \u2013 The Maxim tells a beautiful story with many lessons to take home. Otherness has led to not only ostracization, but to death. People feel exile in their own land. Social constructs dictated by government and media contort the way people think. When people control the way people think, they have control of an entire society. We are also reminded that entertainment isn\u2019t intrinsic of its genre. Trends are not concrete truths in the same way how correlations are not causations. We see more than our share of bad days on the news. There is rarely a story about the Borlaugs of this Earth. There are people who care about the wellbeing of our future and innovate the way we live without radical ideas. Believing in heroic characteristics and loving characters for them can lead to a better place to live. Entertainment is supposed to go beyond asking if someone has seen it and then ending with a casual agreement about it being cool. The best stories I have ever come across ask me to think about myself and about this world. Both the manga and the anime of Parasyte has exceeded most stories and it creates an instant stimulating conversation between anyone that has enjoyed it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWorks Cited\\n\r\n\"Norman Borlaug - Biographical.\" Norman Borlaug - Biographical.

            "content": "Entertainment factors: Gripping story, battle scenes, romance, emotional ride, serious themes, dying characters.\r\n_____\r\nSimilar to Attack On Titan, this anime does not paint a rosy picture of humanity, ie. showing scenes of bullying and animal torture in multiple episodes. Shinichi comes in contact with not only the monstrous parasites, but street gangs, politicians and a serial killer. The dark side of man is well-represented in Parasyte the Maxim.\r\nDespite the violence and gore, the anime is deeply heart-warming and very, very human. People around Shinichi keep dying and it scars him to a point of total numbness. His isolation and relationship troubles parallel the feelings of thosereeling from harrowing personal losses. Even after Shinichi\u2019s dark experiences and the parasite in his body begin changing him into a selfish, uncaring person, he never stops struggling with his need to help people. He is brave, cowardly, selfish and altruistic. His conflicting character is so very human and a serious literary feat from Iwaaki Hitoshi, author of the original manga.\\n\\n\r\nThe deathtoll in the series builds up quickly. It\u2019s actually bizarre that the constant killing doesn\u2019t become too uncomfortable to watch. I\u2019m personally very sensitive to violence, often deriving anxiety from it, but Parasyte The Maxim did not provoke this reaction in me. The show remains both thought-provoking and entertaining from start to finish and I can only recommend you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation style is more realistic than on most anime - even Deathnote was more artsy than Parasyte. The character designs are refreshing, not abiding to any recent anime clich\u00e9s. Voice acting is natural, all voices fit their respective characters. The soundtrack has both lighter tunes and darker, horror-enhancing electronic beats.\\n\\n\r\nNot a minute spent watching Parasyte is a waste. Due to its heavy subject matters, and the grace with which it handles them, Parasyte The Maxim is one of the most relevant anime in recent history.",

            "content": "Sei no Kakuritsu, also known as Kiseijuu, is about a student, Izumi Shinichi, who one day will be confronted with non-human beings: parasites. What could be humanely hard to accept, is that these parasites nourish themselves with real people. One of them is going to try to possess Shinichi, but will succeed by just taking his hand. The main character will have one option: survival, if possible, help the humans or protect the people he liked.  \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nBefore watching Kiseijuu, I was a bit skeptical due to the genre. It describes this anime as an Horror-anime. It is true that there a few scenesthat could shock, nonetheless it should not be in my opinion over 17 years old.\\n\r\nOn the guideline of the story, I savored all the episodes. None of them should not have been there, the twenty-four episodes were all essential to me. Not to mention that I really appreciated the fact that the director did not split this anime series in two and gave us directly  all the episodes; they fit together neatly into a continuous story.\\n\r\nThe ending for me was the best part of the story. Without telling you anything, I thought \"this is the way it should end\". It keeps us,\u00a0the viewers, on a good question:\u00a0are humans not the most dangerous species? This story returns us to current problems of our world with the themes as pollution, human rights or the development of our society. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nThe super realistic style of this anime made me really enjoy the show. The design of the main hero changes, when he is sad, happy, fearful or angry; every single step of the story is brought into account on the aspect and art of the characters. To sum up the following the main characters arts are unique in their own way.\\n\r\nWhether it is the nature, cities or parasytes everything seems to be carefully made in details. Thanks to the art, the path of the hero was well-done and it kept a part of mystery for the story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nDo you think you'll listen to this OST in the future?\\n\r\nYes of course. I especially loved the song in the Parasyte OST - \u00ab\u00a0Next to You\u00a0\u00bb, which I would advise to anyone who is\u00a0a fan\u00a0of piano. For me, the best point\u00a0of\u00a0the music was that it had a real symbiosis with the images. The right song\u00a0for\u00a0the right scene, nothing more, nothing less. So the background was completely fitting to the atmosphere. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10/10\\n\r\nMy favorite topic: the characters. What I notably enjoyed, is that Izumi Shinichi will dramatically change through the story. Not only on his physical appearance, but also on his mental believes. He is always connected to his Parasyte, also called \"Migi\", and starts to have a reasonable good relation with it. Izumi Shinichi harbors various feelings to the parasite and you constantly hear what his opinion can be to any of them. I adored this internal perspective of the character. Even if you listen to all his thinkings and see his story with your own eyes, in the end, you never know if his actions were right or wrong. There never was one solution, but multiple ones. You just follow the path of his actions.\\n\\n\r\nWithout any doubt, my favourite character was Mrs. Tamiya Ryouko. The reason is pretty simple, she is the one who possesses curiosity. She will try to understand the human world. Also, Shinishi and her are having more often than not a few talks and she could maybe be considered as his instructor.  \\n\r\nAs many anime's, parasite gets a romantic side, where Shinichi is involved with a girl, called Murano Satomi, who is continually asking the same question: \"Are you Izumi Shinichi?\" Depending on the moment of the story, he answers in different ways. This is the occasion where you really see the contrast of the appearance and thinkings of the hero. It seems quite unusual at the beginning, but becomes essential with the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThrough his philosophical, super-natural and fantastic conceptions, I recommend this show to anyone who wants to lay back and enjoy a good signing, psychological thriller that can capture your attention.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10",

            "content": "Izumi Shinichi, a seventeen year old high school student, lives a fairly quiet life with his mother and father in a quiet neighborhood in Tokyo. One night, alien parasites fall to the Earth, infecting humans by entering their mouths or ears. Once infected, the parasite takes control of the host\u2019s mind and physical form, essentially becoming their host. One parasite attempts to infect Shinichi while he sleeps but, because of the headphones in his ears, burrows into his arm instead. Shinichi awakes in horror to discover that the parasite \u2013 which he later names Migi \u2013 has taken control of his right hand and arm.The story follows Shinichi and Migi, two beings with their own separate drives, intellects, and existence, as they attempt to coexist, explore the purpose of the parasites\u2019 arrival, and survive in a world where aliens, disguised as humans, see humans as a means to an end.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9) : Kiseijuu is easily one of the best shows of the 2015. A deeply psychological and philosophical anime, Kiseijuu uses Shinichi\u2019s struggle to maintain his humanity despite his increasingly superhuman abilities to examine what it truly means to be human and the relationship humans should have with other living creatures. As Shinichi becomes exposed to Migi\u2019s strain of consciousness and other parasites and their motivations, he becomes caught in numerous internal debates, such as wondering if humankind\u2019s relationship with animals is truly different from the parasites who must feed on humans to survive. Migi, with his distinctly logical thinking, grows to understand human empathy and emotion, as well as what it truly means to live. Another well paced story, the series juxtaposes its philosophical messages with a strong focus on Shinichi\u2019s character development and growth.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) : Shinichi is a believable young man who reacts realistically after being subjected to a rather terrifying situation. Migi, although almost robotic and obviously disconnected from human emotions and motivations, is even likeable for a character essentially devoid of emotions. However it is in their interaction and cohabitation together where the two really combine and shine. Kisejuu even supports its two protagonists with a strong set of supporting characters that not only drive the show\u2019s plot, but give a peek into both human and parasite societies as well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Design (8) : Although nothing particularly noteworthy, Kisejuu\u2019s animation, particularly during fighting scenes, does well to portray just how creepy the parasites can be.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10) : EPIC, JUST EPIC...One of the main reasons why I started this anime....\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9) : I'm rating this 9, because it has several negative things that I didn't like at all.... but I would recommend this anime who likes Sci-fi/ horror genre...\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "NOTE: Spoilers ahead... also this is my first review so please leave me feedback if you will. Thanks!\r\nNow that the dust has settled and we've all long-forgotten the trickery, and occasionally the asspulls that Shinichi Izumi and Migi conjured during their stint in Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu, I would like to explain why I think this nearly unmatched show deserves a 7/10 in my book. With its unique approach to sound and composition, its ability to successfully revitalize a manga that has not aged well and its relentless dedication to thrilling the audience, it actually pains me to give this show a score anything lessthan a 9. However its weaknesses were absolute pitfalls to this show's memorability and depth. Let's start with the positives:\\n\\n\r\nBiggest pros:\\n\\n\r\n- Transforming a boring plot into an exciting one\\n\r\nA teenage boy wakes up the morning after earth has been infiltrated by aliens to discover that his right hand has been replaced by an entity that appears to be... an apex predator. And a polymath. And a psychopath. And an organic \"machine\" with an appetite for human meat. Like this we are immediately introduced to a plot with elements that are unoriginal with respect to anime - a high school setting with an \"average\" teenage male protagonist with recently gained superpowers, an exploration of the interaction between aliens and humans, and an \"enemy\" that appears to be an insurmountable obstacle for our protagonist to defeat. However, Kiseijuu manages to take a completely derivative plot and mold it into something much more interesting as the show continues. For one, an early attention-grabber that I noticed about the story was that instead of imitating any other high-school themed anime in which the protagonist builds a harem of girls starting from scratch, Kiseijuu initially attempts to develop a single relationship that has already been established. Seeing Shinichi and Satomi already dating at the beginning of the show was a fresh change to the generally touchy nature that anime has with true romance. Although I have problems with how their relationship eventually panned out, in the opening phase of the show it was an absolutely stellar feature. Secondly, Migi's persistence towards maintaining its character traits - calculating, self-interested, lacking ego - was superb. For most of the show, I was incredibly impressed that the creators never allowed Migi to break out of character. Even in the moments in which it was indeed an incredibly low-hanging, sweet fruit to be able to see Migi show some sense of emotion towards Shinichi, e.g. attachment, care, sympathy, remorse, Migi stayed true to itself.    That, my friends, takes impressive writing ability. And in Kiseijuu, it truly was the little details like this that ensured that the plot had integrity despite overused themes and archetypes.\\n\\n\r\n- Exceptional sound and music\\n\r\nI'm no music connoisseur but I really consider myself a fan of all music. I play a few instruments, listen to basically anything and everything (besides country blah blah blah), and I like to keep my mind open about new sounds. That being said, Kiseijuu has received both backlash and praise for its score. I belong to the latter camp. The adjective I would use to best describe it would be: fitting. That does not mean that Kiseijuu pulled punches in the music department. In fact, I find it incredibly rare for the music an anime to be fitting to its plot and overall \"feel\". With Kiseijuu, its score almost gave me cues to the emotions I should be experiencing, which I find is rarer than it should be. For lack of a better word, Kiseijuu's \"dubstep\" really worked in a battle- and action-heavy story, and although some of the OST was overplayed (I'm looking at you \"Next to You\"), it never quite got old. Overall I was more than happy by the fact that the show was completely unencumbered by its score and even complemented pretty nicely by it in its more intense scenes.\\n\\n\r\n- Endless High-Quality Action\\n\r\nIf you are a lover of action, adventure, and blisteringly fast plot developments, Kiseijuu will probably be unrivaled compared to most anime. This is indeed one of its best pros. There's not much for me to say other than the fact that Kiseijuu took the hated \"monster-of-the-week\" formula, and actually managed to flesh-out a continuous, consistent story with it. Considering that oftentimes monster-of-the-week type animes fall flat on their faces when it comes to overall plot development, seeing Kiseijuu pull it off was incredible and always kept me eager for the next episode (which I can't say I feel about most anime).\\n\\n\r\nOnly Con:\\n\\n\r\nHaving mentioned all the main things I loved about Kiseijuu as a whole, I have to explain why Kiseijuu falls from a 9 in my book to a 7.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters\\n\r\nIn a paragraph above I raved about Migi's dedication to its character and Shinichi's and Satomi's early relationship. I still believe that Madhouse did an incredible job with these two points. However, almost every other aspect of character development in Kiseijuu was just a tease - a taste of something that could be so much better.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, Kiseijuu really enjoyed focusing on characters that were just plain bland when we had a cast full of infinitely more interesting characters to explore right at our fingertips. In the biggest example of this... why did Satomi remain alive (and boring!), for the entire duration of the show yet other pathologically unusual characters like Kana and Reiko all died mysteriously quickly? Although I don't care for fanservice, getting rid of both characters was like an anti-fanservice (maybe a fan-disservice). It was as if the writer was deliberately attempting to take the life out of the story and, subsequently, alienate viewers and readers. This significantly docked points from enjoyability during the second cour of the show as much of the reason I was watching it was for these two characters specifically.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, despite its appeal Kiseijuu never truly managed to establish an emotional connection with its audience (or at least me). I recognize that the show is supposed to represent a cold re-enactment of how a quasi-apocalyptic alien event would occur, however I don't think I ever felt \"sad\" for the protagonist or Satomi. I did experience both highs and lows seeing Migi, Reiko, and Kana on screen, but it is certainly a problem when one cannot connect to the protagonist of a show. Could I relate to him? Yes. Did I like him? Nah. Frankly Shinichi's character only evoked in me a sense of \"meh\", which eventually became a huge letdown as the series continued when I realized my perception of him would never change.\\n\\n\r\nFinally, I'm going to eschew all helpfulness and description here, but fuck the sex scene. It was like a pity fuck where you don't know who is pitying who and everyone just feels really miserable. Why the fuck would you show me that Madhouse? Sex isn't INHERENTLY good. Good sex is good. Sad sex is sad. This was sad sex.\\n\\n\r\n-----------------------\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, Kiseijuu was still a great show. It was well-rounded with a great story, exceptional sound, good art (although I never talked about it) but a penchant towards inconsistent character development. Despite the fact that I would critically not describe it as a \"masterpiece\", its enjoyability ranks it with the best on MAL and I really do not regret a single moment I dedicated to the show. It really is a must-watch for all but the most queasy (because it can get bloody).\\n\\n\r\nNow what are you waiting for? Go watch Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu!\\n",

            "content": "Parasyte Review\r\n\u201cIt is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change.\u201d \u2013Charles Darwin\r\nThe human race is a legion comprised of completely different beings. Unique in mentality, emotional structure, and often argued, purpose. Knowing this\u2026 Do you ever just, sit and wonder why we are here? What does it even mean to be a human? Is it your bones, your skin and body? Or is it your soul, intelligence, and compassion? \r\nIf you were to lose your body, would you still be human?\r\nThere has been a story written in the purpose of asking these questions,readers. That story\u2026 is Kiseijuu. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---PLOT---\\n\r\nScience Fiction is a sub category of \"speculative fiction,\" a type of writing that consists of the extraordinary and normally impossible or improbable happenings, usually elements of fantasy, horror, or scientifically themed concepts or outcomes. A lot of these stories are usually more detached from reality in aesthetic, but reflect it in its themes. Therefore, a supposed main purpose of using Science Fiction in writing is to mask the author\u2019s true objectives and commentaries in their story, using interesting psychological concepts and distortions of reality. Science Fiction can range from a vast number of different ideas, and has the most diverse body of stories ever, including hugely different things like the revolutionary Star Wars, critically acclaimed Steins;Gate, hugely celebrated comedy Gintama, Horror/Sci Fi classic The Terminator, and even George Orwell\u2019s definitive allegory of communism, Animal Farm. \\n\\n\r\nIn Kiseijuu, or Parasyte -the maxim\u2019s- case, the subject of the madness is an alien invasion, where wormlike body snatchers hiding away within tiny little orbs rain from the skies. They\u2019re ordered to destroy humanity by taking over the brain of a random host and eating as many people as possible. As usual, this kind of event induces mass concern as the \u201cmincemeat murders\u201d start piling up on one another, and the issue of the invading \u201cParasites\u201d gradually becomes something that will change one young man, Shinichi Izumi, for the rest of his life. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing I see stories like this struggle at is subtle foreshadowing, and Parasyte surprised me by shaking off that stereotype. Its apparent that a lot thought goes into foretelling what will happen with subtle symbolism and visual hints that aren\u2019t meant to give it away, but are perfect for engaging the scenario that they foretell. These additions tie into the thread of the anime's narrative, since it focuses heavily on tasking the main characters' humanity with life threatening situations, that all state a bigger, more complex, environmental question. Because of this, the different happenings separate themselves into several different, shorter \"arcs.\" Each arc's \"test\" is essential when it comes to progression, and shows the hardships that affect the characters in their day-to-day lives as they slowly change due to the Parasite invasion.\\n\\n\r\nIts genre of \u201chorror\u201d comes into play with not only its bizarre and grotesque body modification, but also how it shows the dark truth and real \u201chorrors\u201d of humanity, flipping the genre on its head. Have you ever asked yourself if there was a difference between a human killing and eating a cow, and a lion killing and eating a human? If, because we can think, build, and thrive on the environment by destroying it, does that mean we\u2019re the monsters ourselves?\\n\r\nDo we deserve to be here? Do we seriously, truly, understand those species we cull for our own profit?\\n\\n\r\nIs\u2026 pollution actually a worse crime than murder?\\n\\n\r\nThis anime asks these questions by both showing, and telling. It might preach one thing specifically, and in turn a whole plethora of other questions are asked alongside it. I won\u2019t be the one to tell you what conclusions the anime came up with, because as the viewer, that means it\u2019s your job. But, in short, this is not a television show. It is a political statement disguised as one. \\n\\n\r\nThere remains, however, one major problem many will have with the story, and that is its conclusion. (Or lack thereof) Many of the lingering questions one will have after viewing Parasyte will remain unanswered, and while most of these questions speak for themselves, the rest of them are seemingly forgotten, unacknowledged. \\n\\n\r\nBut the story of Parasyte was not written to explain \"how\u201d it happened. It instead is a demonstration of \"what\u201d happened because of it, and \u201cwhy.\" These stories don\u2019t always need an answer, because, its impact is left imprinted on the viewer specifically if they don\u2019t figure out what happened canonically. When this is done, one is left to interpret what happened themselves. \\n\\n\r\nWe\u2019ve become so engulfed in knowing the answers right away with the media we have to use at our leisure; we forgot what stories were originally created for. A long time ago, stories were written to stretch the imagination and teach a moral, instead of just to entertain. They always encouraged the readers to make up their own continuation, and understand what the story was written to say. Parasyte reminded me of that, as it was the type of story that was written to provoke heavy thinking and to teach something to its audience. Even if toward the ending it seemed to go off on a tangent; Parasyte\u2019s style of a \"traditional story\" is what makes the series truly special. \\n\r\n---Plot Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---CHARACTERS---\\n\r\nCharacters are often the most difficult portion to write. Parasyte tasks itself with being dedicated to developing its main characters throughout the entirety of the story, as development and evolution is a central theme. Shinichi, our main lead, is a cautious and quiet young man in his teens, said to have never really had a \u201crebellious phase.\u201d On the fateful night that he is assaulted by a symbiotic larva, his life changes forever. With quick thinking, he stops it from reaching his brain and forces it to mature within his right arm. He doesn\u2019t know why this strange creature (later named Migi) has been ordered to destroy humanity, or who even created it. All he knows now is that he and his now talking, shape-shifting hand must co-exist. \\n\\n\r\nThe course of their interaction really shows that two beings with different outlooks and points of view can still influence each other, grow a bond and live in harmony, even if they don\u2019t entirely understand one another. In a way, Shinichi and Migi\u2019s relationship is not too different from that between two humans. \\n\\n\r\nBoth of them change drastically, as the direction this anime takes makes sure to have their personalities alter over time. Shinichi struggles with the fact that he has a monster living inside of him, and not being able to tell anyone about it. He becomes desensitized to the now gruesome world he\u2019s in slowly, fight after fight, trying to protect himself and those he loves from the Parasites. Over the course of a year with these horrors, he begins to turn into an emotionless statue. First he stops smiling, and his eyes lack expression. Later he doesn\u2019t even acknowledge tragedy, and can\u2019t cry. As his father puts it, \u201cYou\u2019ve become as hard as steel.\u201d This gradual characterization is defining to him, as a human who must live with such a ridiculously abstract burden. But he soon, comes full circle with the monster he became and begins to see what it truly is to be human once more.\\n\\n\r\nMigi moves the same way, but in the opposite direction. He\u2019s introduced as a completely stagnant being, unchanging of his ignorance to the emotions humans experience and actions they take. But just as he begins to influence Shinichi, Shinichi begins to influence him. Slowly, that uncaring attitude of his, where he just doesn\u2019t understand begins to lift itself from him, even if his \u201crationality\u201d refuses to let him admit it.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not only the two main characters that develop either. At the beginning of the series, Tamura Reiko (a teacher at Shinichi\u2019s highschool) is taken over by a parasite, and goes through a development that changed the course of the series forever, further encompassing the theme of evolution. \\n\\n\r\nDespite these pluses, many of the other characters may appear \u2018flat,\u2019 and their only purpose seems to have been reminding the viewer that \u201cShinichi\u2019s changing,\u201d especially the love interest of the series, Satomi Murano. You can tell she deeply cares for Shinichi, and continues to try her best at making him talk and confess as to why he\u2019s so different from his usual self. But she tries and tries constantly, and because of this, her persistence comes off as shallow, and one might ask themselves why she\u2019s so uncooperative. (Most people would probably just want her to shut the f*** up) However, that actually makes her seem a lot more realistic. A personality change wouldn\u2019t go unnoticed by those around you, (especially your girlfriend) and actual people poke and pry and hound one another when they notice something is wrong. That\u2019s just human nature, and while it doesn\u2019t make her complex, it adds a sense of realism to the romance between her and Shinichi. But that doesn\u2019t excuse her from being so unexplored.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s this abundance of underdeveloped background characters; Kana for example, and her boyfriend. They have entirely one-dimensional personalities. All the random bullies, and the girls that seemingly get attached to Shinichi are even guiltier. Even arguably one of the major villains is guilty of this. They don't hold a candle to the others. \\n\\n\r\nBut it\u2019s impossible not to give it credit. Even if the secondary cast is lackluster with a capital L, The main cast is downright amazing, fleshed out and wonderfully developed. \\n\r\n---Characters Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---ANIMATION---\\n\r\nMadhouse doesn\u2019t usually disappoint, but the type of animation they\u2019ve demonstrated in the past doesn\u2019t quite apply itself this time. Granted, for what its worth, its good. But what Parasyte lacks is a definitive style. Its story is far from forgettable, but the visual presentation makes it look generic because it keeps going back to painfully ugly CGI crowds and vehicles.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it did get right were its beautifully drawn backgrounds, and action sequences. Even if the characters are just standing, the fluidity of what actually is moving during these portions is downright amazing, and the visuals are highlighted with heavy detailing, like sparks radiating from the swiping blades and morphing viscera. (The Parasites, by the way, have great detail attributed to their fleshy structure by being almost bioluminescent, as they sparkle and shine in a manner similar to being covered in glitter)\\n\r\n---Animation Score: -Great- ---\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n---SOUNDTRACK---\\n\r\nThere are few soundtracks I can listen to all the way through and have no grievances. With this one, there are some pieces I like a bit more than the rest, (Hypnotik, I AM, and Galaxy) but the use of dubstep was honestly quite fitting. It gave Parasyte a modern feeling, something an adaption that has source material from the nineties surely needed. Others may dislike it, but it all comes down to taste.\\n\r\nThe opening, despite its Engrish vocals, had an appropriately climactic tone and sums up basically the premise behind the anime in the lyrics alone. It was good to see it not get replaced halfway through, and the ending was a nice breather from the heavy tone of the show. \\n\r\n---Soundtrack Score: -Amazing- ---\\n\\n\r\nAFTER REPORT:\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\r\n- Brilliantly developed main characters, visible progression\\n\r\n- Philosophical and political insights that are both hidden and stated aloud within the narrative, crafting comprehensible brainfood\\n\r\n- Well placed symbolism and foreshadowing\\n\r\n- Sense of unpredictability\\n\r\n- Fitting, amazing soundtrack\\n\r\n- Refreshing use of Traditional Storytelling, with a clearly attached message that ties into the occurrences that happen\\n\r\nMIXED:\\n\r\n- Subjective conclusion; it works for some and not for others\\n\r\n- Heavy use of gore, bodily modification may be unsettling\\n\r\n- Animation is a mixed bag, somewhat generic\\n\r\nCONS: \\n\r\n- Underdeveloped background characters with flat personalities\\n\r\n- Becomes mildly spastic plot wise in last few episodes, with a few conveniences\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: -Amazing-\\n\r\nParasyte may have its fair share of problems when it comes to its characters, but it knows what kind of series it is, despite its sometimes frantic narrative, and has brilliant writing when it comes to its political undertone. Some might say it\u2019s all over the place, and towards its conclusion it certainly feels that way. But the thing is, the plot sits in the back of the car while the messages it reinforces sit in the front.\\n\\n\r\nAnd these messages, paired with fantastic character development, are very good drivers.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing this, Parasyte is completely subjective, and that\u2019s probably why the score keeps falling. It is something that splits its viewership; it appeals to people who think deeply about the themes it presents; and not so much to those who take it at face value, who will only see it as a preachy, pretentious action seinen. To appreciate it to its fullest, in most cases, a specific mindset is essential. But if you're looking for something to do this to you, masturbation jokes, and phallic hands, then Kiseijuu... is for you.\\n\\n\r\nFrom space, the gracious score of 9/10 fell to Earth.\\n",

Although at first sight you might perceive that the plot is very clich\u00e9, one must consider that this is based on the manga from the late 80 and thus, this kind of plots were not that popular at that time, and hell, the character development and the existential themes that touches upon are definitely worth watching.\r\nWhat I liked:\r\n-It is very faithful adaptation of the manga.\r\n-The general existential and philosophical questions that comes from the story are one of the strongest points of the anime, andat the end you can see that message that comes from it is very powerful.\\n\r\n-The character development is fantastic, and although it has very few cheesy moments with the drama exposure of some characters, all of them are justified with the existential themes that surrounds the story.\\n\r\n-The narrative of the anime explains everything by itself and never leaves you unsatisfied with unanswered questions, and when it gives you an answer it does with scientific accuracy.\\n\r\n-The story is a constant flow of twists, touching and intense moments that always keeps you in the edge of the couch.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I disliked:\\n\r\n-In the narrative arch, the exposition that comes before the rising action and the climax, feels very weak, this is maybe because the story follows a classic narrative style, but even if that's the case you can see that those episodes does not feel as strong as they should be if we consider that the spectator is used to a constant flow of twists and intense moments.\\n\r\n-Although all the character drama exposure are very well justified by the existential themes of the story, few of those scenes and their concepts are extremely cheesy and some of them even unnecessary.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThis is easily one of those anime I would recommend to anyone that likes deep themes in a story with an intense narrative, whether they come in form of anime or not. It is clever, with some spirit and it is one of those \"once watched, never forgotten\" stories.",

            "content": "Following my brother's recommendation who had just started watching this, I started watching as well, so I didn't really have any previously constructed opinions about it, just curiosity. I will try not to spoil any direct events and keep this as concise as possible.\r\nIt started with that \"weird beings are infecting humans\" type of vibe, where small alien-like worms would find their way in human bodies and take control over the brain and try to blend in society. But that was not the case with the protagonist, Shinichi, and only his right arm was infected. But what seemingly was just an intelligence-less parasite searching fora host to leech on turns out to be an intelligent life form whose intellect and learning abilities rivals and possibly even surpasses that of humans, learning in hours what a regular person would take months or years. \\n\\n\r\nThese parasites also turn out to have individuality and no emotions, always doing a cold logical analysis of situations and acting accordingly. Their primary way of killing is turning the upper limbs and/or head into blades and then consuming the victim. A lot of background information about them was simply not there and if you are the type of person that needs an answer for everything and is not satisfied with things just happening and an excuse-like explanation, you will be disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nIn the initial phase of events you might think this is a world-wide situation and humanity as a whole is in danger, battling for survival and supremacy as rulers of the planet. As the episodes go by you end realizing the plot is not pretentious and the ending is not a closure to the situation and instead of that just makes the viewer confused as to what the show is really about. \\n\\n\r\nIs it about humans being the real monsters? Is it about saving the planet from pollution? Is it about what makes us really humans? Is it about learning how to co-exist with other forms of life and respecting them all? We are offered possibilities, but no definite answer. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development and utilization was also something I think could have been better. Shinichi's personality takes sudden changes for better and for worse in a very inconsistent way. Sometimes you feel he is coming more like Migi, and sometimes you feel Migi might be becoming more humane. A couple important characters are eliminated from the story even though they could still add a lot to the plot. The interactions between Shinichi and everyone around him is as inconsistent as his view of the world. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound and the art of the anime are elements that are decently done. The animation goes a little 3D every now and then, I noticed no big mistakes, the episodes have a consistent level of quality, and the soundtrack plays its part. These aspects aren't the highlights or the downsides of this show. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel this is an entertaining show. There are good fights, there is a lot of blood, there are episodes that I found myself very anxious to find out what happens next, some nice horror scenes, some romance. The last episode gives an ending to the story we were presented, but also leaves room for a bigger plot that could happen in a different time, in a different place.",

Read at your own risk!!!\r\nA anime bases off a award wining manga by Hitoshi Iwakii about mysterious lifeform known as Parasyte, it eats humans and disguse as a human.\r\nStory - 9/10\r\nThe story is amazing for a adaptation of a late 80's/early 90's manga. It's very understandable at every side no matter what, even thought it didn't last long enough... it's only... 24 episodes long. Each episode has a important event that happend to acertain character like Shinichi.\\n\r\nSo it's about a nerdy character, Izumi Shinichi and his intected right hand, Migi as he faces so many death and bloodsheed as he try to find the main excistence of Parasyte.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10/10\\n\r\nThe art are just pure gold covered with diamond.LOL\\n\r\nThe animation was done by MADhouse, the one who also done HunterXHunter (2011) and now, the art of every fight scene and bloodsheed is perfectly done and the best of all, the censhorship of gore is very little.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is what I like about review, the first thing is theme song, the opening \"Let me hear\" by Fear and loathing in Las vegas which also the one who done the 1st ending of HXH (2011) \"Just awake\" is really cathcy and the ending \"It's the right time\" was a really relaxing somg and it remind me of anime song in year 2000.\\n\r\nAnd now OST and voice acting, the OST is really mainstream but enjoyable at the same time and the voice acting, it's really great and really fit with the character very well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10/10\\n\r\nEach character is unique and very likeable, Migi the most. (Imo)\\n\r\nThe character are diffrent at the start and the character always develop in each episode, some can be hate and the time (s)he make their debut for time first time but trust me, they become loveable like Kana.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10/10\\n\r\nThis is a great anime for those who enjoy horror mix with Sci-fi, the suspense, the character development, the song, the everything. So I recomended you this to add to you watch list!\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading this, you deserve a reward! *give you hugs and chocolate*\\n",

            "content": "first review on here, pretty long and un-organized, but I hope it can entertain some of you (also, my native tongue  is not English, so forgive me for I have almost surely made some mistakes)\r\nFirst of all: I don't watch many seinen-animes. I just don't like these fantasy/sci-fi/monster/robot-plots and ideas. They always seem kind of childish and most of the time it's just violence for the sake of violence with the supernatural element trying to be a justification.\r\nDon't get me wrong, both sci-fi and fantasy are legitimate genres and I can completely enjoy an \"unrealistic\" universe if the rules within the diegesis are coherentand there is a genuine, not-too-far-fetched idea behind it. For example I really enjoy distopian stories like shinkansekai yori or fantasy elements in stories like the one of kokoro connect.\\n\r\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was, for me, an enjoyable anime just because of the fact that I watched every episode of it. It is very flawed and this review is 90% negative, but I can't shy away from the fact that I did like it somehow. Most of the time, with these monster stories, I can't even finish the first episode (I do try!).\\n\r\nspoilers, duh\\n\r\nIt is a partly childish premise: Parasites just happen to come to a particular town in Japan (and to nowhere else on the Planet) and it turns out that they do not only love to eat humans, but they also kill them in a very brutal manner so we get some violence on the screen instead of just having them be efficient like the indicated intelligence of them would suggest. I can put up with this because the anime does not leave it at that but tries to implement philosophical question going along with it: what is human nature, what is a life worth, are humans worth more than animals, how can you justify eating them while judging parasites for eating humans, aren't humans the true parasites to this planet?\\n\r\nThese questions are stated at the beginning of the anime and they are dealt with pretty \u2013 o.k.- for the first few episodes. Then they are just dropped for the majority of the series and replaced by hollow set phrases. Only at the end of the show these questions get picked up again and are a liiiittle bit deeper explored but the show just does not use them to their full potential - I mean, these questions are not new. If you wanna take part in a very frequented debate which takes place pretty much all around the world you just need to add some new ideas and perspectives. Well, none of that. Yet it IS enough to make for an pretty OK monster-anime. Like always, it could have been much better, and like often times, it should have been.\\n\r\nLet's get to the main character. At first, he is a relate-able character, not too nerdy, not too ballsy, he is not constantly picked on and also not loved by each- and every one. It is pretty rare for a seinen-show (and modern anime in general) to have these black-and-white, clich\u00e9 characters and I am thankful that Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu did not do that (at first). Then he gets confronted with all these supernatural and horrifying events taking place around him and he has to deal with it because he is part of it. He remains relate-able and believable. He asks questions, he struggles with reality, he wants to be strong and mature about it but fails at plausible points.\\n\r\nThen he gets killed and his parasite is able to repair him because parasites can do pretty much anything if it is convenient for the story and maybe, at a later point, they won't be able to anymore (if it is convenient for the plot, eeeey). I mean, how can Migi just replace his heart and then go back to being his arm and suddenly there is a heart again. I thought Migi would just be his heart for the rest of the series and he would be missing his right arm for the rest of the series. In many ways that would have made the character development taking place later on much more plausible and unique.\\n\r\nThen he just regenerates his body for a few days and as he wakes up, he is a completely different character. He just did a full 180 kick flip on a wave board. I understand that he does not need glasses anymore and his senses are sharper, that's a nice idea. But why is he fucking ripped like a wrestler after basically sleeping for a week. The body develops muscles if you fuckin use them, and only then. He could have just trained and be really efficient at it, because he has superhumanly senses now, but nah, he just wakes up ripped and with a more masculine facial structure because plot convenience. Oh and he hasn't shat himself or even peed. Migi did feed him, right?\\n\r\nAfter that his character is:\\n\r\n>people get murdered all around me the whole time and are turned into mincemeat and I am mildly upset about it for a few minutes\\n\r\n>my mom died and my whole world is in shatters and I am concerned but basically it's ok.\\n\r\n>lol, I am lying in between dead bodies and these guys totally think I am dead too, rofl ( thats a bit later but it fits)\\n\r\nAnd everyone tells him that: wow, you are different, you are like a complete clich\u00e9 now, you boring piece of seinen-main-character\\n\r\nA few days later he remembers that and has a hard time beliving it, because he didn't even notice, so we get a montage of retrospectives of people telling him that like we needed the anime to explain to us the completely flat main character and his uninteresting behaviour like we didn't had to cope with it for two episodes now.\\n\r\nIt does make sense for him being that way, at least a little, but it just makes for a main character I do not care about and a fuckin clich\u00e9.\\n\r\nHis main bitch does not really like that either and he really wants to explain it to her, but migi does not let him do that because for sure Satomi (her name) would tell the police. hmh.\\n\r\nBut his side hoe also need to now the truth and he finds a way to tell her without migi noticing it. Because migi sleeps 4 hours a day. wow. he has a 4-hour-window each day to use and tell his dad and his girlfriend about his secret and jet he only manages to tell Kana; which should be the person he least cares abut.\\n\r\nI know that the anime tries to explain this by her completely unexplained ability to feel parasites but she thinks she just feels the presence of ther true love so Shinichi has to explain it to her so she does not constantly put herself in danger.\\n\r\nUh but she does anyway.\\n\r\nBesides, Kana is one of the most unbelievable characters ever. She lives in a room which looks like it belongs to a 12-year-old princess-loving girly girl, she dreams and behaves like that as well, while in fact she hangs around a pretty violent street gang. On these occasions she behaves like she hangs around a street gang. Her ability to feel parasites has no reason to exist (other than plot convenience) while later in the anime, the mass-murderer dude has a very nice and plausible explanation for the same ability. She is cute tho. \\n\r\nThen Shinichi manages to convince migi to enlighten another human being about her existence. And he is an detective. So the risk of being exposed to the police or government is quite high; certainly higher that with his dad or his girlfriend. But that turns out ok. The detectives dies tho, and Shinichi is mildly upset about that for a few seconds.\\n\r\nAnd jet still he does not manage to tell Satomi. He rather breaks up with her and has a reason to be mildly sad some times. How convenient for the plot. Other then that there is not much wrong with Satomis character and she was somewhat of the character I could identify with. She should be a lot more traumatized but that goes for every character on the show (except Shinichis dad, he seems to be really devastated, which is also a plus) - she has a reason to be in love with our hero, she has a reason to be confused about him while staying interested nonetheless. \\n\r\nThe last major issue I have with the show are the way humans fight against parasites. At the beginning of the show, when a parasite enters the school as a \"transfer student\", the girl who falls for this guy soon finds out about his identity and confronts him. She is a very clever girl (no sarcasm) and protects herself with acid and it turns out that it works pretty well to stun and weaken parasites. Good thinking. Her brother is a policeman involved in the very investigation about this whole thing and she knows it. Yet she does not feel the need to tell him that she found out about this method, or maybe she did but the police didn't care. That is unlikely and it would have needed some explanation why they decided to drop the idea.\\n\r\nShnichi tells the police at a later point that flame-throwers would be his weapon of choice against these monsters because he knows it is their weakness. First of all: he didn't even use fire against his numerous enemies of that sort until the final boss. Second of all: the police laugh this idea off and then proceed to use every possible option and advantage they could get against the parasites. They seem pretty desperate and they are even vocal about it at some later point. Wouldn't it have made sense to at least bring some flame-throwers, in case things get a little bit messy? The man who is the head of the operation knows that Shinichi is hiding something, that he knows something, but he does not believe that the flame-thrower idea was more than just a wild guess. How convenient, because only trough this, they aren't able to defeat the strongest parasite.\\n\r\nThen, the boss battle.\\n\r\nThe only reason Shinichi wins this is because apparently parasites have no possibility to sense humans through sound or smell. This is just not believable. On the one hand, genes of this very species enabled Shinichi to get superhumanly senses (and strength), but on the other hand, this species isn't able to use this gene-material for them selves; which would be pretty nice for hunting humans, you know, they eat them They are designed to kill humans and yet they just can't smell them. Uhm, what?\\n\r\nThen, shinichi is fast enough to attack and seriously injure his foe by simply stabbing him with a pipe. Even with migi, and he is without migi at this point, he was not fast enough to get a hit in, Gotou was just faster and superior in every way. When he stabs him, Gotou does not even try to react. Yeah, he was already injured, but so was Shinichi, and Gotou even had more time to recover. He wins. And, oh, Migi is back. He is not a cripple.\\n\\n\r\nThen the last 10 minutes of the show are basically unnecessary, but fail at trying to give the whole thing a deeper meaning.\\n\\n\r\nSo why did I even enjoy the anime?\\n\r\nBecause it was okey. Mainly, because it was exiting and managed to keep the tension up in every episode. I cringed and shook my head often times, but it was just good enough for me to klick on the link for the next episode. Also it did a good job at conveying emotion, even though some of these emoitions could have been avoided or dealt with in a more siutable manner if the characters would have been a little smarter. Some fights are pretty good and are executed in an unpredictable and exiting way. The story itself lacks a bit of deapth and plausible development, I mentioned that, but it's not too flat and has its moments.\\n\r\nObjectively, it is maybe a 4 or 5 out of 10. The art was nice. The music was sometimes good, sometimes not soo good.\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was pretty high, at 8 maybe.\\n\r\nAnd for a monster/seinen anime, it was somewhat above avarage, because this genre is mostly far-fetched bullshit.\\n\r\nhate me",

            "content": "Ever wondered what it'd be like to share a body? Ever wonder about \"aliens\" or if humans will be the cause of their own destruction? If so This may be the anime for you. \r\nParasyte starts off with a young boy of the name shinichi. When he meets with a parasyte by fate his life drastically changes (probably for the worst). This show really tackles how humans think and how we would react to not bieng at the top of the food chain. We will do anything to survive een if it meant killing other life forms. \r\nParasyte is an old manga and actually hada kind of revamp with the artstyle and time period. It arguably looks much better than its manga counter part aside form the parasyte themselves. The manga was also abit more grotesque than the anime. The music was actually very engaging and fast paced. It really fit the mood and I found myself really listening to the music almost not paying attention to the screen. The ED is probably the best of last year. \\n\\n\r\nI really enjoyed parasyte. It was a fun and impactful anime. It builds greatly off shinichi and migi and their development is great. Another thing the anime didn't fall into heavily (until the last episode) was that it never came off as preachy. Everything that was said about humans and how we treat the earth and other inhabitants is 100% correct. The action and thrill of the show was always steadily rising which keeps you on your seat for the next episode. \\n\\n\r\nThere were a few gripes with this anime but the biggest was the Charachters. Some acted plain stupid in the situation they were given. There was also a forced rushed love interest to shinichi who was already with murano. The girl had no real reason to like him other than she could \"feel\" something special from him. \\n\\n\r\nI give parasyte a light 9 which it fully deserves. At 24 eps the show dosent overstay and knows where it's going and what it's doing.",

There may be spoilers so read with your own caution.\r\n Now that\u2019s done with I\u2019ll begin. A lot of people say that Parasyte the Maxim is overrated but in my own opinion I don\u2019t find it overrated, because It was just that one anime that wasn\u2019t really hyped or anything before it aired but then it began to air and it took people with a shock because of how good it was, and it\u2019s not the most popular anime outthere but it\u2019s not unknown and I just think it\u2019s people who try to find something negative about Parasyte the Maxim which there is barely any of.\\n\r\nThe story is pretty damn great I\u2019d give it a 9/10 \\n\\n\r\nThe art is outstanding, especially when there is gore or when the parasytes are in a battle. I\u2019d give it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sounds/music is pretty good, there is a lot of dubstep in this anime, and I normally don\u2019t like dubstep, but this anime nailed it and some of the ost which are not dubstep are incredible like (Next to her. The sounds are pretty good nothing too special 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters are great because you feel like you know them or really begin to like their personality. I\u2019d give it a 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment I had when watching Parasyte is outstanding. It\u2019s probably the most enjoyable anime I have ever watched 10/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall I\u2019d say it\u2019s a 10/10 but before  anyone says \u201cHe\u2019s just a fanboy that\u2019s why he recommends it so high because it\u2019s not this good\u201d I am not a fanboy.

If you've come to watch something deep and meaningful, don't push it. Because in the grand scheme of things what show really is?\r\nIt does express the thoughts on what makes something a human, which isn't going to be life shattering (although I do look at my dogs in a different perspective now) but it does put a few thoughts in your head. That's all.\r\nI enjoyed the story for what it was, (insertanime description here). It's a great thriller, has good comedy, excellent romance (the good kind of romance, one that doesn't invade the story), the gore (yeeeeah!!), and it was hard for me not to stop watching. (On that note, the beginning is a bit slow, but we all know shows can start out that way)\\n\\n\r\nIt has a feeling to it as Death Note. Why? Let me explain\\n\\n\r\nLike learning about the Death Note, you get to immurse yourself in figuring out how and why these \"Parasytes\" work and behave like they do which ultimately gives the story more consistency, something I am fond to.\\n\\n\r\nThe music, probably one of the best parts (for me)\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was finominal, nuf said about that..\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were actually quite decent, no one was too whinny, and no one was too extreme. And the character development was good shizz.\\n\\n\r\n And prepare for cliff hangers or really messed up things, for I was about to start tossing crap out of my window because of the last episode.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, got any comments or anything to add, I'd love to hear your opinion.\\n",

            "content": "What do you get when you mix corpse party and tokyo ghoul? Parasyte.\r\nIt's amazing how violently awesome this anime is. Despite being adapted from a manga way back in the 90's, they were able to reshape the setting into the modern world. Also, they were able to retain the same amount of gore found in the manga.\r\nThe character designs were waaaay different in the anime. For example, in the manga, Kana was seen as a delinquent (and she smoked), but in the anime, she was cuter and a bit innocent. Dunno why they changed her personality, guess it's because she looked better like that orsomething. \\n\\n\r\nOther than Kana, the other characters were accurate. Too accurate, in fact, that the MC looked the same as he looked in the manga. And the dialogues were the same! Well sure, there were differences here and there, but other than those, it was spot-on.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about the art is that when you compare it to the manga... you get confused. You know that there's a difference, but you don't know what they are. It's just so friggin' accurate, dammit! It'll make you doubt your own eyes. You know there's something different about the character's face, but you don't know in which aspect because they took all of the characteristics into account. I swear, the only difference I could see is that it's colored and animated and more modern. Is something wrong with me?\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed watching it. Lots of gore, lots of conflicts, lots of dilemma... It's pretty realistic, in my opinion. Overall, it's a good anime and I recommend it to whoever wants to see something realistically different.",

            "content": "At its core, Kiseijuu is an overrated, cliche coming-of-age romp, drudging through empty messages of philosophy, morality and unity between humans and a force they can't entirely understand. However, whatever it attempts, it usually succeeds, not necessarily with flying colors, but it's something, at least. Most of my gripes all come down to the original source material. Keep in mind that this anime is a fairly loose adaptation from an 80s, early 90s manga, so there's definitely a generational gap that the anime had to compensate for. In that sense, one could assume that it's not as cliche as it seems.\r\n  Thestory is relatively basic, and like other shows of this seinen-style \"fairly lighthearted but gradually becomes a bit darker\" archetype, it starts out fairly lighthearted the first 4 or so episodes, but gradually becomes a bit darker after that point.  A race of alien organisms, possibly bent on destroying the planet, begin to infect other, more familiar organisms (in particular, humans, but there's a dog too) for unknown purposes that become only slightly more evident near the end. \\n\\n\r\n  One of these organisms, title of \"Migi,\" crawls into teenage boy Shinichi's arm. Migi takes control of the arm, but stays independent of Shinichi himself. Both have separate personalities, which proves pretty entertaining early on. Their dynamic is based off of mutual survival. At first, if Shinichi dies, Migi dies as well. Because of this, Migi influences Shinichi heavily throughout the show, both emotionally and in dire, life-or-death situations. These two go through the show as partners, killing any immediate threats Migi detects. It's like a buddy-cop show, but you never really feel like they're friends until late in the series.\\n\\n\r\n  Shinichi develops (or regresses in some parts) because of Migi. He assimilates Migi's personality traits, like lack of empathy, human emotion and compassion, but Migi never really develops as a character, which I think is really cool. I'd say throughout the first half of the show, through thick or thin, the show reminds you that Shinichi is a high schooler with an eclectic personality: a loser who, while disinclined of the situation he's in and constantly attempting to hide Migi from everyone else, adapts to his life with his parasite. By the end, Shinichi is an adult, and he definitely feels like one in the last five or six episodes. \\n\\n\r\n  Other characters like Murano (Shinichi's primary love interest) are more complex, however, due to how effortless they were written in: Murano is unaware of Migi's existence, regardless of how obvious or curious the circumstances are. She's a blank slate for Shinichi to project his emotions onto, and when he screws up, she gets mad and he's discouraged. As Migi's grip on Shinichi's personality tightens, she says the phrase; \"are you really Shinichi-kun?\" Be prepared to hear that a lot. Murano is a frustrating character that would have been much less so if she was more intelligent... although maybe she seemed unintelligent from a purposeful standpoint, causing more conflict and disparity between her and the new Shinichi.\\n\\n\r\n  The characters who really interested me were Tamura Reiko and Hideo Shimada, two hosts of parasites, specifically due to them toying with Shinichi's own moral compass. Reiko, unlike the rest of her kind, has a sense of scientific intrigue with her own species, and what her purpose on this world is. It just goes to show that Shinichi isn't the only one who's questioning the violent modi operandi of these parasites. Hideo, a fellow high schooler hosting a parasite, shows Shinichi that, really, anyone could be under control of a parasite. They're complex beings, much like humans, with many intricacies in their own ways of going about things, although Migi shows no remorse for these two, and when they provoke Shinichi, the situation turns sour. \\n\\n\r\n  The mood of the art direction in Kiseijuu varies: sometimes it berates you with grotesque imagery of meat between mandibles, jaws unhinging and countless sets of nightmarish teeth, either to frighten or to fire the viewer up for the next foe Shinichi faces, but some episodes can have very poignant, beautiful visuals, especially later on. The artstyle stays consistent, which is more than I can ask for. The fight scenes are very well animated and everything sort of \"pops out\" very satisfyingly. It draws your eye, keeps your attention, et cetera. Pretty solid.\\n\\n\r\n  Kiseijuu's soundtrack is very much a mixed bag. I'm positive the opening turned a lot of people off from the show, mixing hardcore vocals with autotuned blips and blops over heavy rock guitars and electronic instrumentation. It's pretty unpleasant compared to the ending theme, a heartfelt, uplifting piano ballad that raises your spirits... that is, until you have to watch the next episode and listen to the opening once more. The music in the fight scenes is very dubstep inspired, which is pretty hit-or-miss for many people. The rest of the music seems fine, though, just a little generic (which makes a little sense in the context of the show.)\\n\\n\r\n  I'd say this show was enjoyable, but it's a slow burn like a lot of seinen shows. Not for everyone. In fact, it's a bit overrated by most people. I'd say this would be a great stepping stone between entry-level shows and beyond: it's not too long and there's little unresolved questions by the end.",

Parasyte shows us a reality where humans and '' alien parasites '' must coexist together, between a thin line of hunter and prey. The majority of humans disconnect the existence of these parasites, however, some of them know very well their existence, and even coexist in a special way with their guests. The anime itself has a beautiful animation and direction, with a soundtrack that honestly, is rare to hear in anime, and it seemed pretty good. Usually break a bit with the cliches and try to forge theircharacters in a special way, here is where I can say that the development of the protagonist is quite intense and qualitative. Of course not everything is perfect, because the anime also tries to enter into philosophical measures by asking questions like '' What is the human? '' 'And what do we live for?' 'This is where I think it becomes a bit pretentious trying to enter in a pseudo-intellectual field; but in spite of that it is a quite entertaining anime with some excellent scenes of action and a quite original story.",

            "content": "In order to gain something, we must lose something with equal value. \r\nThat was something that screamed at me during the series. One can argue that sometimes you can gain something just by, for example, working hard, but that does not fit into this context whatsoever. \r\nThe main character of Parasyte - the maxim - gains something incapable to humans, but, it was at the expense of a piece of his own humanity. \r\nWhat I initially thought of as a generic and typical plot turned out to be a perfectly told and executed storyline, rich with well-made characters and meaning. There's really not much moreI can say about it, but the fact that the storyline had a great build-up from beginning to end. A possible flaw may have been that it lacked a definite climax but that aside, I reckon the story had progressed quite satisfactorily. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter development? Let me tell you about the character development. It was done so well that it honestly broke my heart at times. Shinichi's hardships and accomplishments all played a part in making him into the character he is. Watching all of those factors in play from beginning to end \u2013 I can't say it didn't leave me, as a watcher, not feeling anything.\\n\r\nMigi's cold and inhumane nature juxtaposes Shinichi's altruistic and kind human heart, so the two make an unlikely yet well-matched combo. That's honestly all I have to say \u2013 the characters, especially Shinichi are all very well developed.\\n\r\nAdding to that note, all of the females in this anime are extremely perceptive, and I mean all of them. Not just the main ones but  even the side characters too; it's actually quite amazing watching the writers incorporate this little fact into the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe art had a style unique to the series, and was something that had grown on me. It's often quite dark at some scenes but it all contributes very well to the overall genre and mood of the anime. Together with this art style, the music was befitting of each scene, I especially loved the opening and ending theme songs, I think they offer a nice contrast to each other.  \\n\\n\r\nParasyte offers an extremely accurate and realistic standing of how the world would react if there were indeed other life forms coexisting on the planet with human beings. It portrays the reaction humans would have, the thoughts that they'd process and the actions they'd take in response to discovering such a thing \u2013 and I believe this is very close to what could actually happen (that is, if aliens were actually real). \\n\\n\r\nThe anime explores what it means to be human, and fathoms further on the idea of greater life forms other than ourselves, and why they too, have the capability to question the meaning of their existence much like we do. It teaches us about fear \u2013 true, human fear \u2013 and how deeply it roots in our hearts.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that makes this series so precious is the fact that it seriously and strongly questions humanity as a whole. For an animated work to tread on a such philosophical journey while doing so successfully and with characters that connect with the audience so meaningfully, it'll have to be one of my all-time favourites. Despite all my praise for Parasyte, it's a series that should definitely not be passed by unless you really can\u2019t handle a little bit of gore. But hey, there's a censored version just for you guys too. \\n",

            "content": "For a very long time, I found no enjoyment in watching anime and reading manga \u2013 or just most lenghty shows or books - no more. As a young teen, I would binge on Bleach, Detective Conan and other multi-season shonen series and read 20 volumes of manga when I had the time and money, read every book series I could get my hands on \u2013 but as I grew older, I realized that I knew all the plot points and tropes to come, and many works just seemed predictable at this point. So that character has special abilities out of random? That dude probablyhas some sort of destiny to back this up. A portagonist has to conceal his true nature? Of course no one will find out no matter how poorly covered! Where's the appeal in fearing for detection or wondering about mysteries when they become so predictable? I think this is why exactly this anime grabbed my attention.\\n\\n\r\nFirst off, I know the show has issues. It is by now means perfect, it does have its plot holes and worn-out story elements that we've seen plenty of. Though, considering it is an almost 100% faithful adaption from a sci-fi horror from the 1980s, you can't really say it is \u201ecopying\u201c other way more recent shows with its pattern (like Tokyo Ghoul). This brings me to the first point of my analysis:\\n\\n\r\n1) The adaption\\n\r\nAs most anime, Kiseijuu is an adaption from a manga published in the late 1980s. I've rarely seen a story adapted so faithfully, especially if we consider that the anime is set in modern times. They had to change some scenes (in the manga, there are scenes where teachers harrass the students in ways that would be deemed inappropriate nowadays, thus those had to be changed). The character designs had to change too, because a typical nerdy goofball from the 80s looks different than he does today, and your average bully won't have his hair slicked back and wear a military-style school uniform. Also, in the Manga Shinichi (by some translators dubbed Shinji, but I am unsure wether the name change occured because of translation issues or because it was intentional) wears other clothes, doesn't wear glasses in the beginning and instead has a collection with weirdly specific clothing items which consists of sweaters with English words on them (each word reflects the current stage in the manga, such as \u201econfusion\u201c \u201emisery\u201c \u201edelusion\u201c and \u201ephilosophy\u201c). This was probably a funny subtle easter egg in the 80s where most japanese readers wouldn't understand English and manga wasn't read in English speaking countries, but as nowadays the audience is able to understand the hints, they didn't include them. Only in one very important key scene Shinichi wears one of those sweaters, which was probably a nod to the original work.\\n\r\nAs you can see, there's so little differences between manga and animethat it boils down to fashion changes. I was very pleased by how they handled it, I expected drastic changes but instead, it's almost word-by-word the same.\\n\\n\r\n2) The story\\n\r\na) In general: I think, the story could be the weakest point of the whole. It's not bad, I really enjoyed it because it is full of twists and you never know what comes next. You get sucked in and want to know more, it really makes you sit through the whole thing within a day. This suspense comes at a price: It is very inconsistent. It is at if the author didn't really know where to go with it, so he included bits of everything. It is actually enjoyable because if you don't want too much action but you still like to see some bodies hit the floor, this is the right mix for you. It gives you a balance between battles, mystery, romance, gore, psychological challenges and dark humor. If you love seeing your protagonist facing all of those things, you'll be happy with this show. I must say, at times it feels like the creator just wrote fanfiction of his own work \u2013 fleshing out his character with actually unnecessary plot devices that don't drive the story forward, just to show sides of the the main char you wouldn't see normally. This is why I would call Kisejiuu a story that is very character-based, with little actual plot and lots of hints to psychology, morals, human behavior and trauma. Funnily, this is what I thought Tokyo Ghoul would go for, but found more strongly represented here. \\n\r\nIs the show bad for going in multiple directions at once and not focusing on a single theme? It really is up to you to decide, I really liked it though.\\n\\n\r\n3) Moral of the story: This is where many people have very varying opinions. Some say, the very end of the story was bad for having an overly pseudo-philosophical feeling to it, while others claim it is deep and meaningful. I must say, I don't think it's any of the two. As I already said, the story is very character-based, and the \u201epretentious\u201c monologues you get from Shinichi are actually part of his development as a person. I think at this point it really depends on if you like him or not. If you get attached to the guy, you'll find yourself liking the ending, if you're having a \u201emeh\u201c-approach to his struggles, you'll have the same to what happens in the last episodes. Personally, I do not agree with what was said (only to a certain degree), but from what Shinichi went through, it is just very likely that he would develop like that. You can watch this in many people recovering from trauma, actually.\\n\\n\r\n4) [Slight Spoilers because I talk about literature tropes]\\n\r\nCharacters: In my opinion, Shinichi's character development was amazing. I've seen a lot of protagonists change through a series because of what they go through, but in Kiseijuu, you can literally feel the cold radiating from a guy who used to be an awkard dork. In many works, I deem character development very rushed or too slow, but here it feels just right and follows Campbell's \u201eThe Hero's Journey\u201c pattern very closely, while not being too predictable and offering the reader many new twists and sides of the protagonist to explore.\\n\r\nIronically, Migi also follows The Hero's journey, but this time it is David Adams Leeming's version, where the individual is born under mysterious circumstances, studies hard to understand the world, is tested by enemy forces, then  goes into the \u201eunderworld\u201c, comes back and finally \u201eascends\u201c. Shinichi is confronted with lots of difficulties in those three years, and by the end, all he knows is that he simply doesn't understand. Many people saw this last part of the story as either deep or pretentious, but in my opinion, it's just well done development. A 16-year-old who has a very clear view of the world to an 18-year-old whose only certainty is that ultimately, humans just really hate being lonely, and just try to get what they desire, and protect themselves. Despite having only this much information on his hands, he seems lucid and content. Unlike many say, this isn't an edgy \u201ehumans are evil egomaniacs!!!\u201c story that we're all sick of. It just showcases how a teen struggles with being human, tries too hard to be it because he fears becoming a monster, and finds that humanity is nuanced and cannot be generalized. Funnily enough, there is even a character who is the \u201ehumans are evil\u201c trope personified, and it clashes wonderfully with Shinichi's newfound clarity. The others are though a bit....meeeeh. I loved Reiko, she has a wonderful feeling to her, every scene she was in felt engaging and interesting. Murano felt a wee flat and stereotypical, I liked her better in the Manga where she was more of a weirdo. Kana....I am not entirely sure about her, but I deem the hate she gets from many fans exaggerated. \\n\r\nI think she's pretty okay.\\n\\n\r\n5) [Slight spoilers because I talk about visualisation of emotional turmoil]\\n\r\nCinematography and Sound:\\n\r\nThe animation in Kiseijuu at times is very very nice. You get wonderful, fluid motions, expressive faces and the gestures and camera work show that the producers know what they're doing \u2013 but well, it's madhouse, we all know they're good at their job! At other times though....well, let's say, they really gotta work on CGI crowds and aerial perspective shots. I was a bit sad that they changed the manga's unique art style to something very generic, the show could have worked really well with a Steins:Gate-esque approach, where unique style choices carry meaning in itself. In the manga, many parts are drawn very realistically, which would also allow a form of realism you see in shows like Death Note. I must admit though, that the first episodes who are very comedic wouldn't have been as funny if the style was more grim, so I guess it all has its positive and negative sides. What I really liked was how they changed camera shots with Shinichi's change. At first, you have wild camera work, dramatic views and epic tracking shots, lots of perspective work and zooms to show the confusion the protagonist experiences, while in his emotionally numb times, the camera barely moves even when there's threat. It feels mechanic. When he's calmer and more balanced, so is the view. In the last episodes, shots are wider and even when stress and panic ensues, rarely you'll get a dramatic closeup or zoom, but it's more peaceful and grounded than the life-less monotone shots during Shinichi's grieving. During that time, cuts are sharp between scenes, and the camera usually steadily moves left-right or up-down, without much change in speed.\\n\r\nMusic-wise.....well, this one REALLY depends on personal taste. I like dupstep, glitch and electronic, thus I didn't mind too much (even though during the first two episodes it came so unexpected that I thought I left my spotify playlist on and just later realized it's part of the show). It's good with fighting scenes, it really buys into the Rule Of Cool approach the show has regarding action. Sometimes it seems oddly misplaced though. The Opening is really nice though, it really has one hyped up every time you hear it, and some main theme songs are emotional and well put. All in all, I'd say it's quite good.\\n\\n\r\nSo, this was my analysis/review of the show and I tried to keep it as spoiler-free as possible so you can enjoy watching it! All in all, I found it very very good because I love character building and just fleshing out protagonists in every possible way. It may be dissapointing to people who prefer story-based plots who spend more time on building up to the climax instead of having unnecessary distracting elements that are more about the psyche of the involved individuals. Though if you want an anime dealing with inner turmoil, trauma, morals and humans as a whole, you'll love this!",

            "content": "WARNING- Contains light spoilers\r\n(Honest)-OVERALL: ~ 9\r\n(Bias)-PERSONAL: 10\r\nParasyte honestly wasn't a masterpiece, but this is gotta be at the top of my favorites list.\r\nSTORY: 9.5\r\nThe overall plot was wonderful. Smooth transitions, relevant scenes, 11/10 foreshadowing, and much more. Parasyte's story just blew me away.\r\nExecution: 10\r\nThe execution was outstanding! It wasn't a bumpy ride at all. The episodes mostly left off on good cliffhangers and it was well made to emphasize the relationships between humans and parasytes aswell as goes into Parasyte's behaviors in detail. The focus never switched to something irrelevant and almost always involved parasytes. I was always hooked from the events that happened. Thefirst scene right off the bat was always alluring me. The foreshadowing was otherworldly. The visuals in the OP hinted many of the important events of the show and plenty of scences foreshadowed later key events. The best example was in episode 18. The events leading up to episode 18 consisted of scenes that were blatant and scenes that you couldn't realize were foreshadowing. The story also always was tense. It would really get you nervous, especially episode 10. You had the thought in your mind if something bad would happen or if you would get a happy ending. Many episodes left you with that, not being able to predict if there would be a tragic or pleasant ending.\\n\\n\r\nOriginality: 9\\n\r\nParasyte was nearly completey original. There have been other ideas with biological parasites and other things but Parasyte displays the Parasytes not as mindless-human predating monsters, but rather as flexible, adaptive creatures that have varied intelligence. On top of that, the route was coexistence instead of complete annihilation of the human race as a goal(later on).\\n\\n\r\nQUALITY: 8.67\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7\\n\r\nAnimation was well done but there wasn't anything too special. The parasytes were animated well and the characters didn't look similar. The muscles of the parasytes were detailed and the transformations from a regular looking human to a parasyte were smoothly drawn. The detail I took most interest into was Kana's eyes- they were beautiful and were superior to all other characters' eyes. Everything else was good, but has no special recognition.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\n#It'sTheRightTime - The sounds were fantastic. Most of what I enjoyed was the OST. The OST was suiting and well varied. The ED is one of my favorite overall EDs and the OP was decent aswell. I also enjoyed the piano insert/background songs- they suited the scenes. Voice acting was great aswell. The parasyte's monotone voices and Migi's voice were excellent. When the characters faced fear or sorrow, it was realistic. Some sounds could honestly be a little more realistic though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 10\\n\r\nProbably one of the best features here is the characters. Most were unique and they weren't too cliche personality wise. What I liked most was the character development. It was just out of this world- Shinichi's emotional and physical changes were outstanding such as in episode 18. Tamiya Ryouko( Tamura Reiko) was initially concepted as the main antagonist, but as I continued to watch, it was revealed that she truly was not the bad guy. It was much greater on a scale that involved human-parasite relationships. The minor characters were also well done, such as the old lady(Mitsuyo) from ep 23. Although she didn't have much screentime or backstory, she left an impact on Shinichi that aided later on. One character I felt should've had a greater role was Kana. That's about the only negative thing I believe is with the characters- Kana didn't get enough screen time, but truly, she left an impact on Shinichi which was hinted in the opening scene with Shinichi's Mother. Another small infraction was the girl at the beach hotel. I would've like to see atleast Shinichi visit but it's not necessary because the girl is a tertiary character.\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 11\\n\r\nParasyte is one of my all-time favorite shows.\\n\r\nParasyte always left me on the edge of my seat and had my heart beating quickly at times. Some scenes were intense and left my eyes stuck to the screen. Shinichi always had me feeling sympathetic and all the depressing things he had to face just made me feel awful.",

            "content": "I'll be blunt about this: I have no idea whether or not I actually like this anime. Throughout the whole time I watched this, I had so many mixed feelings about this that I genuinely do not know if I liked it at all. I guess I do because of the score I'm giving it, but maybe I'm being lenient.\r\n[Story - 7]\r\nThe story follows Shinichi Izumi, a typically-introverted high school upperclassman who lands himself in an unfortunate situation when his right hand is taken over by an alien called 'Migi' (or Rightie). There is no 'real' overarching plot, but rather just mini-arcs that follow howShinichi and Migi react to fellow aliens and humans. While they all work by themself just fine, I found that as a cohesive whole, it just did not come together well. It kept jumping genre from psychological horror to action sci-fi to high school romance, and while I appreciate a variety of genres in one work, it doesn't work here since it's so jarring of a shift each time. Even the final 3-4 episodes go through this, which was rather annoying. This resulted in me not quite knowing what the themes of this show were, but maybe I'm just dumber than a sack of hammers. I'd guess it would be similar to another popular 2014 horror seinen, Tokyo Ghoul, with the whole 'maybe the monsters aren't so bad + how cruel is humanity?' stuff, but it kept going back and forth on this so much that I can't say that for sure.\\n\\n\r\n[Art - 7]\\n\\n\r\nThe art here isn't particularly stellar in my opinion, but I don't have any major complaints. While I found it lackluster at times in regards to character and background design, the level of detail for each parasite and the action scenes made up for it. If you're a gore enthusiast, you could find some good scenes here too, since there is tons of blood flying around. Another thing to note is the only example of good character design: Shinichi Izumi. His designs over the course of the show display his gradual development, which I enjoyed a lot. All in all: definitely not Madhouse's best work, but I wouldn't call it their worst.\\n\\n\r\n[Sound - 6]\\n\\n\r\nI honestly loathed the OP + the dubstep tracks that served as part of the OST, as I found that it just did not suit this anime at all, or were even good songs regardless. That being said, the ED + the more softer/ambient tracks were way more enjoyable in comparison, even if not particularly memorable.\\n\\n\r\nThe seiyuus did their job well, especially Migi's and Shinichi's. I found that they made the banter feel much more real and intriguing than if other seiyuus was cast. Other than that, no one else was memorable for me.\\n\\n\r\nThe SFX in this show are cool, though! Even if Migi makes weird fart sounds as he moves around, everything else sounded really fine, especially the other parasites' various movements and sounds. Definitely made the action much more awesome.\\n\\n\r\n[Character - 6]\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this show are rather static. While there are a few exceptions, I found that most of these characters don't really change/develop outside of their initially established traits. Most of the supporting cast stays the exact same, and the antagonists are usually not super fleshed-out outside of their power. This especially applies to most of the women in the show, who are usually damsels in distress who \"don't know better\" despite having big hearts. While I don't mind this initial set-up, I loathe how it persists throughout the whole 24 episodes. Even the main love interest stays (mostly) like this up until the very end, which is quite frankly ridiculous.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, there /are/ some stand-out characters here. While he can be rather whiny and inconsistent at times, Shinichi is a suitable protagonist to explore this show's concepts (or bare-bone proposals of concepts). I'm aware that his characterization at the beginning is not like the manga's, but I'm guessing the writers decided to change him like that to further contrast his transformation from 'human with a monster attached' to 'human/monster hybrid'. If so, they did well as Shinichi actually does go through some development from these situations, as he has to struggle with maintaining both his new strengths and remaining humanity. Even in the last few episodes, he goes through major changes, and I was left satisfied with his arc. Another notable example is an antagonist, Tamura Reiko, a parasite who has managed to blend in with society even more so than most parasites. She goes through a rather interesting arc, where she tries to discover just WHY the parasites exist, and whether or not they can really blend in. I honestly found hers the most interesting for multiple reasons which I won't discuss because they\u2019re spoilers, and even the conclusion to it was rather fine too. \\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment/Overall - 7/6]\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this show is a VERY mixed bag. I'm not sure how some people were able to so quickly decide their opinion on it, but I guess I'm just weird. I'd recommend this if you want to see another take on 'monsters infiltrating society', and if you like your horror seinen with tons of gory action. Perhaps avoid this show if you're looking for consistent character development for the entire cast, along with stellar art + OST though.\\n",

From beginning to end it kept me engrossed with the story, characters, and overarching analysis and questioning of humanity without being too heavy-handed. Great art, amazing soundtrack, proper pacing, believable story, characters, and motivations. In a medium that seems to be less and less driven by narrative and character, I was surprised to find out what an absolute gem Parasyte turned out to be. It really hit home on all fronts for me and I felt like it wrapped up perfectly as well.\r\nThere are two types of anime series that I tend towrite reviews for - Animes that are really good and ones that are really bad. Parasyte is a masterpiece. It blends together the right amounts of psychological narrative, action, and memorable characters brought to life with stunning animation, great voice acting, and a very fitting soundtrack. The result is superb, there are very few animes that I've been motivated enough to binge watch, but this one was impossible not to!",

Until the ending. Oh the ending. I actually had to go to the wiki to make sure that National Geographic had not bought the license for this anime. Although I hate the stereotype that all manga-based anime that diverges from the manga is bad, I have to say that they made wrong decisions in this one.\r\nStory - 6\r\nLike I said, the beginning and background was brilliant. It had never been touched before and it was interesting. However, towards the end, itstarted to go downhill. With several obvious plot twists and outcomes, the last arch was a huge disappointment. The conclusion was also unsatisfactory and did not provide closure for fans.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 6\\n\r\nThe art was normal. Although I personally disliked some character design, it was fine. Nothing to fret about. Solid Madhouse art as always.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\r\nDubstep. Need I say more?\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 7\\n\r\nThe character development was a bit sticky. Some where underdeveloped, some were overdeveloped, and just in general too many characters were introduced and quickly thrown away without doing much. Also, some character interactions were unreal or too dramatized.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7\\n\r\nAs I previously said, the beginning was very good. The ending was bad. Action scenes are sometimes really lame, but epic at others. Overall, it was a good watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7\\n\r\nAs I previously said, I hated the ending of this anime. If only the ending had not been so off-beat, I could have easily given this a 9 and called it a masterpiece. But because of the soundtrack and the beginning, it is worth watching. Definitely give it a shot.",

            "content": "~Contains two major spoilers in the characters section~\r\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu was one of the popular anime that came out in 2014. 2014 contained many monsters that shook up the anime community, and even though Kisejiuu took control of the fall season, it couldn't claim the year, not even close. The few people who have seen Kiseijuu will defend it to death... but the review below will explain why it didn't reach the popularity of it 'deserved'.\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\nSTORY: 7/10\r\nFor such a 'complex anime' Kisejiuu is actually not that detailed of a story. Aliens have come to earth and hide inside humans, and the protagonist becomes halfhuman half alien. 'Big deal... It's just Tokyo Ghoul junior then... it has no actual plot.' Well, that's where you're wrong. Instead of killing off the human race because they have to for food, these aliens, called Parasytes, actually have unique personalities. I'll get into this more with characters, but it definitely messes with the plot and makes it more interesting when you don't know what the parasyte is going to do next. But again, as was with Tokyo Ghoul, there really is no overall 'plot', it's just another episode about a boy trying not to be found out as half alien. Kiseijuu earns bonus points though, because they end every episode in a cliffhanger, so once you start, you won't be able to stop. But...... it all leads up to an unsatisfying conclusion, so I took those points back.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nART: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nMost people see Madhouse and immediately score the anime 10/10 visuals. At least try to remember what it looked like, please... now, don't misunderstand, I'm not hating on Madhouse, it's my favorite studio as well as yours but.... the art itself in Kiseijuu is... nothing special. It's just average. The animation as well, is good, but, just nothing to write home about.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nSOUND: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nKiseijuu can be nothing less than a 9 in this category. The opening, ending, and every soundtrack perfectly fit the mood of the anime, and the soundtracks are not only unique and recognizable, but they are dang good! The voice acting as well, is just amazing! The only drawback I have to say is that the songs get old fast, but they are strategically placed in the anime so this doesn't happen. However, there is one or two scenes where they get overconfident and place dubstep where it doesn't belong. Despite this, the sound in Kiseijuu is still truly masterfully crafted.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 5/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters of Kiseijuu as a whole, are bad. Don't get me wrong, Kiseijuu has a few very good characters. But most of them are just unlikable, generic, and blandly designed. I will list out the few characters I liked and tell you why, but the rest are just boring. 1. Migi - Great character, he's weird, quirky, and curious and I love it. 2. Kana - She is like a fangirl towards the main character, but does it in a fresh way so it doesn't feel like a cheesy romance. However she is arrogant and doesn't heed the warnings of Shinichi, and as such pays the price. Well done Kiseijuu, well done. 3. Ryuoko - Hands down the greatest character of the show, debatably of 2014 as a whole. She is a parasyte who is not quite on either side of the battles, she is clever and takes on many names to escape her fate, but perhaps her most intriguing trait is her curiosity towards human life. This same curiosity leads to her producing a human child with a human man, despite her being a parasyte, and her love and understanding of the human mothers is what causes her to chose death over abandoning her baby. 4. Shinichi Izumi - I almost didn't put him on this list based on design alone, but Shinichi has massive character development, and though I do feel he is overrated because he is the protagonist, he is still a good character. As you can see, I have amazing things to say about these characters.... but the rest are so unlikable that you really don't care what happens to them, which took away my enjoyment of the show.\\n\r\n__________________________________________________________________________\\n\r\nFINAL VERDICT: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nKiseijuu is a good anime, but it is still a little bit overrated. Even though it passes out an extraordinary message saying that humans should treat all living beings as equals, it still is not a masterpiece. However, I encourage you to try it out, especially if you like thriller anime.",

            "content": "I've been wanting to write a review for Parasyte for a really long time now; from June, to be exact. This anime rally holds a special place in my heart. It's not the best I've watched\u2014but nevertheless its still my favourite. Depending on how you interpret it, or how deep you DARE to go, Parasyte is either a deep and moving tale with an inquisitive set of themes; or simply a well flowing story with great action. \r\nStory: 10/10\r\nUnless you really, really hate Parasyte for personal reasons, you can't give it anything lower than an 8, but to me, it's a 10. As a fanof the sci-fi genre, it was always interesting to see a more subtle approach taken to the whole 'alien invasion' theme. But Parasyte takes this beyond. Following the misadventures of the hero Shinichi, Parasyte leads you along a truly moving tale that sees Shinichi and his Parasyte amigo Migi, change and evolve as they're put through immense violence, death and trauma\u2014all while Shinichi struggles to maintain his humanity as he notices that his behaviour is turning increasingly animalistic through each painful trial. With an increasingly powerful and terrifying series of villains emerge, bringing their own twisted ideas and ideals into the fold as Migi and Shinichi move in to end these dastardly plots. There's no compromise in this tale\u2014life is truly cheap, and you WILL feel Shinichi's pain as the bodies drop everywhere; and you'll ask yourselves the same questions he asks himself. After a merciless and brutal trip, you'll be treated to an ending that defines Parasyte; it'll give you a hugely satisfying feeling, but you'll be left with one final question: as usual. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nParasyte boasts great art and design, and it excels where animation is concerned, especially in the high paced battles. Character design is well done, and there's nothing else inconsistent when art is concerned. There's a certain darkness conveyed all throughout the canvas here, and it fits in very well with the violent world.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nKen Arai is a beast, an absolute beast. The dubstep music throughout Parasyte is well done and it fits, giving a sci-fi, fast paced action mix to the countless epic portions in the series. Some themes like Got\u014d's theme go above and beyond the other great ones; and you'll just be saying \"wtf wtf wtf holy shit\" the whole scene, because the soundtrack makes it all the more impressive\u2014most notedly one scene where Goto comes chasing after Shinichi and Migi by foot, while the later are going by vehicle. Pure incredible badassery. Then there's the all time fantastic track\u2014Next To You. The way Arai switches from dubstep to a pure, romantic yet tragic tune is simply mind blowing; and I found myself learning to play several of the themes on piano right away. Simply incredible music here. The OP isn't that great, but the ending tun is fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nI don't have much to say about Shinichi and Migi; they're fantastically well written and developed, everyone acknowledges that. The two protagonists are rock solid and show massive development, and they alone mainly anchor the show, and take you on an emotional ride. Then there's Murano, definitely the most divisive character in the whole show. While people can really hate Murano, I love her, cause she's realistically portrayed. She's not superhuman, she can't tell what's going on in Shinichi's mind, and she can't possibly comprehend the non-human struggles he goes through; but she tries her hardest to. She's an everyday girl trying to hold onto the boy she loves; and in the end, she plays a very crucial role in Shinichi's life. Then there's the magnificent Tamura Reiko, a Parasyte with fantastic development, and the most tearjerking scene in the anime. Reiko is the definition of a fantastic support character, and you'll see why\u2014she shines whenever her moments are handed to her, she'll be the one you love to hate and then...you'll see. There's also the delinquent Kana, whose devotion to Shinichi is one sided but still admirable; the main romantic completion to Murano for Shinichi. She's not deeply delved into, but she shows trait that may endear viewers to her. However, none of these characters are cliche hero types, it's important to note that. Try looking at them in the way you would lol at mainstream characters, and you'll be disappointed. Look at them as normal human beings, everyday people, and you'll realise just how good the characterisation is.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nPretty straight forward score. I liked it, after looking at it from both a philosophical and everyday point of view. Thoroughly enjoyable both ways.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nGets a 10 in my book. There are many anime that are better, that's true, but Parasyte deserves to be AMONG the best. It's a masterpiece of emotion, thought and action; and it sucks you in. It has high rematch value and a plot that keeps going, without getting boring. Well worth the watch.",

            "content": "Story: I really like the premise of this even though it's not really my style- very science fiction, and I'm not super into that. It's gory as well. So basically, this kid gets infested with this parasite that's supposed to manifest in his brain but instead ends up in his hand. The parasite can only control his hand but other people infected usually get completely taken over and the human body becomes a host for the parasite- rendering the human basically gone, but the body continuing on with the parasite as it's host. Now these parasites have one goal- eat humans. See how this couldget interesting? I also really enjoyed the character development as well- the main character goes through some pretty dark stuff, and it actually reflects in the way his character behaves, and even looks. It's pretty interesting. The story itself takes a lot of twists and turns, but the arcs all connect pretty nicely. I didn't really find a dull moment in this anime! \\n\\n\r\nArt: It's okay. Not my favorite ever, but it's simple and gets the job done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Same as above. I don't have very strong feelings for or against it. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Pretty good. They put a lot of effort into the lead and the parasite he's infected with, but not much elsewhere. Not to say it's bad necessarily- they all just change based on him. It's cause and effect I guess. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: I really enjoyed this. Definitely not a masterpiece but worth watching if you want something interesting and pretty unique. It's gory that's for sure, but it all kind of makes sense with the story. Definitely an anime I enjoyed watching, over the period of about a week or two. \\n\\n",

Also, the main character having problems with accepting himself, problems with his family, problems with his relationship and stying to stay alive, these problems just really make this anime so colorful. The amazing depth of the charter design is just amazing which is always good in an anime ofany type. This anime is emotional and exciting and I DO recommend.",

Por\u00e9m comecei a assistir mais uns epis\u00f3dios e agora coloquei ele no meus favoritos, muito bom.\r\nO que eu mais gostei foi de como o anime trabalha com a express\u00e3o, tanto facial quanto emocional. No momento em que o Shinchi muda a sua personalidade, eu n\u00e3o consegui de parar de olhar o anime pois ele tinha ficado muito fod\u00e3o.\r\nA hist\u00f3ria ent\u00e3o, falando sobre a humanidade e sua especie que se p\u00f5em no topo da cadeia alimentar, os parasitas vem com o intuito de acabar com isso, penso eu. Pena que teve algumas coisas que n\u00e3o foram bem explicadas,por exemplo: como o Gotou conseguia administrar todos aqueles parasitas absolutamente? \\n\r\nO romance na trama \u00e9 muito legal, da uma discrontaida a aquele clima tenso, juntamente com a com\u00e9dia. \\n\r\nQuanto ao design dos personagens, eu achei muito bom. Se voc\u00ea olhar bem da para perceber a semelhan\u00e7a entre Sinchi e seus pais, diferente de muitos animes em que os pais s\u00f3 s\u00e3o parecidos na cor dos cabelos. Al\u00e9m do mais, n\u00e3o temos muitas personalidades clich\u00eas, para n\u00e3o dizer nenhuma. \\n\\n\r\n[English-USA] At first, I did not like the anime. But I started to watch a few episodes and now I put it in my favorites, very good.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I liked the most was how the anime works with the expression, both facial and emotional. By the time Shinchi changed his personality, I could not stop staring at the anime because he had become really fucking.\\n\r\nThe story then, talking about humanity and its kind that put themselves at the top of the food chain, the parasites come with the intention of ending it, I think. Too bad there were some things that were not well explained, for example: how did Gotou manage all those parasites at all?\\n\r\nThe novel in the plot is very cool, from a discrontaida to that tense atmosphere, along with the comedy.\\n\r\nAs for the design of the characters, I found it very good. If you look well to see the similarity between Sinchi and his parents, different from many anime in which parents are only similar in hair color. What's more, we do not have many personalities clich\u00e9s, to say the least.",

            "content": "This is the one genre in anime that I'm least familiar with. Body horror or horror in general is a genre that I don't always watch especially in anime. The only horror based anime Ive seen is Hellsing and believe it or not I heavily enjoyed it. Parasyte is a series that centers around science fiction and body horror. So going in I knew I was gonna encounter gore scenes and disturbing character design, and as expected I did. The main reason what got me into Parasyte is that it has received much praise and from what I heard has little to no filler episodesthanks to being a faithful adaptation. So after completed this series here's what I thought.***contains MINOR spoilers***\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:8/10\\n\r\nVery well paced and an interesting premise. The main themes used here are \"the meaning of life\" and \"what makes a human,\" and the series does a solid job explaining these. As Shinichi encounters many conflicts that effect him it makes him question his human nature. The story has a lot of drama, fights, deaths, and it has you ask who are the real monsters ?? There are a few flaws however for example, there was a love triangle that went on and it wasn't executed well. The main flaw is that it suffered from exposition as we were left with some unanswered questions. The origins of the parasites and how some humans can sense parasites were never fully explained.\\n\\n\r\nArt:9/10\\n\r\nHas any Madhouse series ever looked bad ?? Parasyte of course has stellar animation and a good look to it. But of course it contains gore and blood that makes it mature. It also looks very modern with the way the characters dress and its technology use like tablets and headphones. The fight scenes were well animated and the face transformations were good enough to disturb some viewers. The visuals have a strong horror frame to it but at times can look dry.\\n\\n\r\nSound:9/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting here was spot on. Adam Gibbs who's a VA that I never heard before puts on a great performance as Shinichi, making him sound very natural. There was one voice that bothered me and that was the elderly woman Mitsuyo but she was only in a few episodes. The soundtrack was very solid, it used a good mix of piano and electronic dubstep. My favorite song being its ending theme \"Its the Right Time\" as it sounded so beautiful, it also contained numerous background music that set the tone for its scenes. However I wasn't crazy about its op song \"Let Me Hear\" as it never grew on me and people might bash me on this cuz it seems a lot of fans enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:7/10\\n\r\nHave to be honest I was disappointed with the cast. Shinichi isn't a dominant protagonist by any means as he comes across bland but he relationship with Migi is imo the best part of the series. Watching their character growth was so intriguing and seeing them cooperate and undergo personality changes with each other was gold. Unfortunately the side characters weren't handled well. Other than Reiko Tamura most of the characters were either poorly written or given no development. For example Murano was given good screen time but it was mainly cuz she was Shinichi's love interest. I wish she was given more of a backstory to help make her more interesting.\\n\\n\\n\r\nFinal Verdict\\n\\n\r\nI'm sorry to say this but Parasyte fell below my expectations. While it had great production values the cast kept it from being a great series. The duo between Shinichi and Migi was by far the best part and although the storyline had a great concept it doesn't answer all its questions. It is however still a very solid series but with all its praise I was expecting more. I recommend this to fans of the horror genre as well as sci-fi fans and to people who hate filler. Lastly this is NOT for kids or for people who get easily disturbed.\\n\\n\\n\r\nSub or Dub Recommendation: Sub",

I was looking for something scary; this was neither scary nor thrilling. The first half of this series was really good, and I was expecting things to keep building up, but the second half feels slow and hesitant in comparison. The characters become less interesting, the storyline feels safe in a way, and the philosophical content seems like a meaningless afterthought. There were definitely some episodes near the end where I was apathetic towards the cliffhangers, probably because I stopped caring about any ofthe characters.",

            "content": "Parasyte the Maxim is a good, but not outstanding, anime. Overall, I would say there are no harsh critiques to be said, but also no high praises either. It\u2019s a competent action-horror show with some good ideas.\r\nI was expecting the story to be a simple action romp where the main character faces off against a bunch of monsters, each one more dangerous than the last. While there is certainly a lot of that, the anime does get a bit philosophical at time. What is life? What does it mean to be human? How should we treat other lifeforms? It even dabbles a bit into environmentalism.These questions added a new layer to the story which was unexpected but welcome. I wish the show would have dove deeper into these questions but I suppose the answers were meant to be open ended.\\n\\n\r\nThe story also focuses on the main character and his struggles with being part human, part parasite. At first, I was getting some Spiderman vibes. \u201cNerdy character gains superpowers and confidence,\u201d that sort of thing. However, it is different from classic superhero genres because the source of the main character\u2019s new powers has a mind of its own, and that mind is coldhearted and logical to a fault.\\n\\n\r\nThe main driver of entertainment is the tension between Shinichi and his parasite Migi. Shinichi is your average high school kid that reacts in ways you would expect. He isn\u2019t your typical hero with the always-positive attitude. In fact, he is almost constantly beaten down by the unexpected turn in his life thanks to the arrival of the parasites. Shinichi is always trying to do the right thing, but the show does a good job at conveying that it pains him to do so. He is constantly paranoid and stressed about the dangers that can come from every corner. Migi has a more dead-pan and self-preservationist attitude. He makes it clear that he is willing to do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means harming Shinichi or the people he loves. Shinichi will often try to save people while Migi tries to save themselves. This dynamic makes the show fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe villains of the show are the parasites. They are interesting because their motives are not necessarily evil. They are just doing what any animal does - survive. This makes them appear ruthless and cold-blooded. The parasites also evolve throughout the show, changing their methods often. These are formidable foes that are able to learn and adapt, making them feel like a real threat.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is at its best when it portrays the parasites. Humans that have been taken over by these things have an appropriately \"dead\" look in their eyes, making it easy to find out who they were. The highlight of the show is when the parasites reveal themselves to do battle or to eat humans. The faces split apart to reveal deadly flesh-transforming-blade-things, which is always fun to watch. There are other wiggly movements that they are capable of, particularly showcased through Migi. This establishes them as a truly unique lifeform that you just can't take your eyes off of.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this show was a good watch. It doesn\u2019t do anything particularly noteworthy in terms of sound or animation, but the characters are good enough to sustain your attention throughout the show. The show has interesting ideas but it\u2019s lacking that \u201cit\u201d factor that makes it super compelling. Nonetheless, I think those looking for an action anime with a unique twist will enjoy this one.",

            "content": "- English Review (Translated version)\r\nI enjoyed \"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu\" so much. That is the main idea that I want to convey from the beginning, so roughly. It reaches a good level in all the sections and stays regular, there is nothing that stands out in excess of the rest, but it doesn't fail in any of them. It doesn't reach excellence for a few details, but it is certainly a great option.\r\nThe story is very interesting, with a relatively original idea and surprising from the beginning. It hits from the first scene and goes to the point from that moment on, almost bluntly. Thestructure of small arches, joined together in the main arch, works perfectly and the plot keeps you constantly on edge, even in the final epilogue.\\n\\n\r\nThere may be a lack of some depth in presenting the topic of parasite invasion and conflict with humans. However, we are talking about a worlwide global problem. Perhaps with more chapters or seasons this idea could have been developed further. In return we get a closer look at Shinichi, the protagonist, how it affects him and his immediate surroundings. They are two different ways of approaching it and I would say that they cannot be considered either better or worse, simply two different points of view.\\n\\n\r\nAnother point to emphasize is that, except for exceptions that could be considered more or less logical, \"Kiseijuu\" does not have problem for eliminating characters with relative importance, both for the script or for the protagonist himself. And of course, speaking of script, the marked message pro-conservation of Earth that history has, with a significant amount of dialogues and monologues chapters defending nature, the environment and its creatures, while criticizing the general disrespect of humanity for all this. Without doubt, an invitation to reflect on a topic that affects us and concerns all the inhabitants of this planet.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, I think we will all agree that the undisputed star is Migi, despite not even being human (especially at the beginning I remember Kyuubey from \"Madoka Magica\"in personality). Shinichi is a good protagonist, has a great evolution throughout the series. Both form an extraordinary couple and take the story with an almost perfect note. In the opposite side, in my opinion, are the secondary characters and their treatment. Few in number and with virtually no development in the majority. Light-years from the Shinichi/Migi tandem. It's true that there are interesting characters like Ryouko Tamiya or (the one denigrated by many) Satomi Murano, but in general I have the feeling that the secondary ones could have been better used. They had possibilities and plenty of material to do so.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is a fucking wonder. Just like that. I'm not talking about opening (which is good, although different and risky and everybody doesn't like that) or ending (right), but especially about the background melodies. Varied, with rhythm, from electronic tones to harmonious classics or to genres as unheard of in anime as dubstep. Perfectly synchronized with the scenes and brilliantly chosen for every moment. Seriously, melodies like I am, Bliss, Next to you, Kill the puppets or The truth are incredible. Of those that deserve to be heard outside of one's own anime. A genius soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n\"The earth. Someone had a sudden thought. Life must be protected.\"\\n\\n\\n\r\n- Spanish Review (Original and faithful version)\\n\\n\r\nHe disfrutado mucho \"Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu\". \u00c9sa es la idea principal que quiero transmitir desde el inicio, as\u00ed a grandes rasgos. Alcanza un buen nivel en todos los apartados y se mantiene regular, no hay nada que destaque en exceso sobre lo dem\u00e1s, pero tampoco falla estrepitosamente en ninguno de ellos. No llega a alcanzar la excelencia por alg\u00fan que otro detalle, pero desde luego que es una gran opci\u00f3n.\\n\r\nLa historia es muy interesante, con una idea relativamente original y que sorprende desde el inicio. Impacta desde la primera escena y va al grano desde ese momento pr\u00e1cticamente, sin rodeos. La estructura de peque\u00f1os arcos unidos en el arco principal funciona perfectamente y la trama te mantiene en vilo de forma constante, incluso en el ep\u00edlogo final.\\n\\n\r\nEs posible que se eche en falta algo de m\u00e1s profundidad y globalidad a la hora de presentar el tema de la invasi\u00f3n de los par\u00e1sitos y si conflicto con los humanos. No obstante hablamos de un problema a escala mundial por lo que nos dan a entender. Quiz\u00e1 con m\u00e1s cap\u00edtulos o temporadas se podr\u00eda haber desarrollado algo m\u00e1s esta idea. A cambio de eso tenemos una visi\u00f3n m\u00e1s cercana de Shinichi, el protagonista, c\u00f3mo le afecta a \u00e9l y a su entorno m\u00e1s pr\u00f3ximo. Son dos formas diferentes de enfocarlo y dir\u00eda que no se pueden considerar ni mejor ni peor, simplemente dos puntos de vista distintos.\\n\\n\r\nOtro punto a destacar es que, salvo excepciones que se pudieran considerar m\u00e1s o menos l\u00f3gicas, \"Kiseijuu\" no se corta un pelo en eliminar personajes con relativa importancia, tanto para el gui\u00f3n como para el propio protagonista. Y por supuesto, hablando de gui\u00f3n, el marcado mensaje pro-conservaci\u00f3n de la tierra que tiene la historia, con una cantidad importante de di\u00e1logos y mon\u00f3logos a lo largo de los cap\u00edtulos defendiendo la naturaleza, el medio ambiente y sus criaturas, a la vez que se critica el poco respeto general de la humanidad por todo ello. Sin duda, una invitaci\u00f3n a la reflexi\u00f3n sobre un tema que nos afecta y concierne a todos los habitantes de este planeta.\\n\\n\r\nEn cuanto a los personajes, creo que todos estaremos de acuerdo en que la estrella indiscutible es Migi, a pesar de no ser siquiera humano (sobre todo al inicio me recordaba en personalidad a Kyuubey de \"Madoka Magica\"). Shinichi es un buen protagonista, tiene una gran evoluci\u00f3n a lo largo de la serie y cumple con creces con su labor. Ambos forman una pareja extraordinaria y copan la historia con una nota casi perfecta. En el gran debe de la serie, en mi opini\u00f3n, est\u00e1n los personajes secundarios y su tratamiento. Pocos en cuanto a n\u00famero y con un desarrollo pr\u00e1cticamente inexistente en su mayor\u00eda. A a\u00f1os luz del t\u00e1ndem Shinichi/Migi. Es cierto que hay personajes interesantes como Ryouko Tamiya o la denostada por muchos Satomi Murano, pero en general me queda la sensaci\u00f3n de que se podr\u00eda haber aprovechado mejor a los secundarios. Ten\u00edan posibilidades y material de sobra para hacerlo.\\n\\n\r\nLa m\u00fasica es una jodida maravilla. Tal cual. No hablo del opening (que es bueno, aunque diferente y arriesgado y eso no gusta a todo el mundo) ni del ending (correcto), sino especialmente de las melod\u00edas de fondo. Variadas, con ritmo, desde tonos electr\u00f3nicos hasta armoniosos cl\u00e1sicos pasando por g\u00e9neros tan poco o\u00eddos en el anime como el dubstep. Perfectamente sincronizadas con las escenas y elegidas de manera brillante para cada momento. En serio, melod\u00edas como I am, Bliss, Next to you, Kill the puppets o The truth son incre\u00edbles. De \u00e9sas que merecen ser o\u00eddas fuera del propio anime. Una genialidad de banda sonora.\\n\\n\r\n\"La tierra. Alguien tuvo un pensamiento repentino. La vida debe ser protegida.\"",

            "content": "Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu or Parasyte the maxim is one of those anime that constantly has you at the edge of your seat.\r\nThe show centers around parasitic alien life form coming to earth and taking over the bodies of humans by merging with their brains, kinda like invasion of the body snatchers. the show follows Sixteen-year-old high school student Shinichi Izumi who falls victim to one of these parasites, but it fails to take over his brain, ending up in his right hand instead.\r\nThe story and themes of this show have been told many times across film, cartoons and other anime however, Parasyte tells thestory of how mankind killing the earth and other life forms in a unique way that was enjoyable to watch. Main character Shinichi Izumi was handled pretty well in my opinion. I enjoyed his development throughout the show and how he changed from shy kid to total badass and I found him to be pretty relatable which is always a positive. The main parasite Migi was also pretty fun, I enjoyed the interactions between him and Schinichi and found their back and fourth throughout the show quite interesting. The supporting characters were also good although they lacked in the character department area some were still really great with the standout in my opinion being Reiko Tamura. The love interests Murano and Kana were decent but could have used more development in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nMadhouse studios once again do a fantastic job with the art and sound. The action sequences were absolutely phenomenal especially the fights between Shinichi and Goto.The voice acting was passable, none of the performances really stood out, but I think the actors did an incredible job.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I found Parasyte to be an incredible anime, I enjoyed the story, the comedy and the action sequences and loved the main character. The only problem I have with the show is that I would have liked to know more about the origins of the Parasites.\\n",

Music: I feel the music was pretty good but they overused in particular two songs, one I think is an original and then one piece by Chopin, this probably become annoying when you binge-watch it as I did.\r\n2. Visuals: Visuals were okay, some bakground shots were very annoyingly animated, it's one of those almost auto-generated idle-human very animated memes. Not very pleasant but overall I feel it was pretty okay.\r\n3. Story: Interesting and altough it's not deep philosophy it's interesting.There are other series that handle this in a more meaningful way I think, like Monster. But it's pretty damn entertaining with a good climax. \\n\\n\r\n4. Characters: This is were this shines through, even though there are some disposable bi-characters that are a little odd the main character and Migi (his parasite) are very well written. This non-emotion relation is very interesting for me and this anime really knew how to play on that strenght. I feel the \"main\" female character could have more development however.\\n\\n\r\n5. Conclution: Good anime, entertaining and bring some concepts that makes you think. A little overfocus on the envoirment which felt a little odd, beacuse this anime isn't at all about the envoirment except in two places were it's extremely \"central\" to the story. However I recommend this anime, especially with the over-saturated waifu shit that's out there.",

            "content": "Parasyte, you never know when to let up.\r\nComing back to this one a year later and I must admit, it's better the second time around. Parasyte is about a young man named Shinichi Izumi who is one of many to get infected by an unknown origin from what we later figure out is a Parasyte who he respectably calls 'Migi.' The two of them at first seem very distant, but in time grow into a cool, sentimental bond that only they can understand. It's a formidable tale of two organisms living in tandem.\r\nI have a strange liking toward the OP, it's catchy, yet just doesn'tquite make too much sense. As for the Art-style, it's beautiful, but with a nasty catch. I love everything it does right, with the intense action scenes of two parasytes fighting. But I cannot stand the weird \"3D\" animation that they sometimes throw into the mix of regular anime-looking things. That entire prospect ruins the art-style for me.\\n\\n\r\nIt does however get better with the characters. Migi is the most interesting here, while at first he doesn't seem to quite understand just what being \"human\" is, but he slowly starts developing a sense of right for himself. Shinichi is what you would call a 180. He starts out as a gentle, kind high school boy who wears glasses and is very sensitive, but soon follows a path that most other in his shoes would want nothing to do with. Shinichi over time develops a sense of being able to control himself to uppermost limits, and for good reason. While his classmates and his father try to crack the code the shinichi has made far too apparent. As for the classmates and shinichi's father, they are all respectable characters that may not get too much screen time, but the time we see them, it's all good fun.\\n\\n\r\nI must admit, this show always brings the unexpected. One moment could lead to something unthinkable in the next, and I like that about this one. This is a great watch and I highly recommend this. This was my second watch and like I said before, It DOES get better the more you watch.\\n",

            "content": "This is one of the few seinen anime in recent years that has been universally praised by fans and critics alike; some people have criticized it for being rated higher than how it should be rated. In my honest opinion, I think that Kiseijuu is a decent seinen anime. There's definitely something about it that intrigues me. \r\nAs you've heard before from the synopsis of this anime (if you actually did read the synopsis), Kiseijuu tells the story of strange small parasites who take over a human's body and mind. In this anime, the story is based off of Izumi Shinichi, who is an averagehigh school student. He is unlike any of his other fellow humans because he has a creature on his right hand. That creature is known as Migi, who is one of the parasites that exists on earth. Unlike Migi's fellow parasites, he (it's a male) has failed to take over Shinichi's mind, so Migi instead takes over Shinichi's right hand. These parasites or creatures are what a normal human would expect them to be. They are heartless, and their only goal is to survive in a world where humans have dominated the entire population. To achieve this goal, they resort to becoming a human themselves by taking over a human completely.\\n\\n\r\nTypical of a seinen anime, Kiseijuu has a lot of bloody gore that is not to be viewed by people with weak stomachs. Anyways, as simple as the premise may be, the story itself is rather decent. It is a rather serious anime with some emotional and gut-wrenching moments. If you were to ask me, I would say that an anime with a rather simple story but with good execution can definitely be a decent series indeed and Kiseijuu does just that. Also, Kiseijuu does not really have a \"main plot\" because it is character-driven. Most of the anime is not just about Shinichi being forced to live with a creature on his right hand but rather, the characters involved around him.\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the fact that this show is mostly character-driven, we were also able to get some very decent character development. For example, a parasite such as Ryoko Tamiya was once a creature who would basically only live to survive as she didn't really care much about humans. As the series progresses however, she begins to develop human-like traits such as laughing, smiling, and she even develops an affection for them. This trait also applies to other parasites as well because some of them, other than Ryoko,  begin to develop human traits which sets them apart from their other fellow creatures. Another example of some excellent character development is when Migi, who starts off as an emotionless being who only protects itself along with its host, ends up being much like Ryoko and even gains some affection towards Shinchi along with the humans near the end of the series. On the other hand, Shinichi becomes the complete opposite, and ends up becoming more and more like the parasites who have populated earth.\\n\\n\r\nOther than Shinichi and the parasites, there were also some humans that have appeared in the show. Most of the humans in this show don't get as much development as the parasites but then again, they all do show some development as characters regardless. It was also somewhat strange, but some of the humans had a special trait that allowed to them to distinguish a human from a parasite. The characters who were capable of doing this were Kana, who has a crush on Shinichi, and Uragami, who is an imprisoned criminal. There are also antagonists that exist in Kiseijuu, and if you didn't already know, they are all parasites (not really a spoiler). \\n\\n\r\nThe art and animation is nothing amazing; however, for an anime adaptation, the art/animation was rather impressive. The anime itself is an adaptation of the manga from the 1990's and because of the fact that Kiseijuu was made in 2014, the art was updated to look more modern. The blood and the gore looked pretty damn realistic too because I kinda got sick from watching people die. Anyways, despite being animated by Madhouse, I don't think the animation was great, but I know for a fact that it looked better than the manga. The sound on the other hand was definitely great. The OST in Kiseijuu was filled with a lot of dubstep music, some of which I thought were very decent, and for an anime with some dubstep music and whatnot, I think the soundtrack had fit the anime perfectly considering how it was a seinen. The opening is awesome as I think that it perfectly fits the anime. The ending was soft because it was sung by someone with a high voice, but I think that it was also pretty decent. All in all, the sound was definitely something that I liked.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed the crap out of this anime. I liked its characters, its soundtrack, and I was definitely a fan of the story even if it wasn't anything magnificent. I did not really have any problems with this show because I couldn't really find anything wrong about it that was worth mentioning. This is an anime that I could easily recommend to anyone who is looking for a seinen that they could enjoy.\\n\\n",

Pick your pleasure.\r\n                  The sci-fi gore types never really jump out at me so shows like parasyte rarely make it onto my plan to watch list.   My disdain for gore acted as a damn against a flood of mixed peer reviews ranging from , \"ITS THE GREATEST\"  all the way to \"Overrated science fiction trashime, lol\".     I finally ended up bored enough to give it a watch...  and I binged it in two nights.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n          Parasyte is a psychological horror type science fiction anime that is laced with philosophical viewpoints.  The psychological aspects of the story are generated form being presented complete situations that impact the protagonist and onlookers in big ways.  It's all in the open, and they never try to deceive the viewer.  This impressed me on a grand scale because the show is  themed around creatures that are masters of deception. \\n\r\n          Viewers get the privilege to experience a dark set of emotions as the story develops. There is loss, hopelessness, helplessness, isolation,  and all these tragedian plot markers create the perfect garden of imperfection to watch the characters grow in.  Parasite is one hell of a ride.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                    The art is nothing to write home about, but it isn't sub par either.   I would call it average but it was used in amazing ways. There was a lot of location recycling but the characters change enough to give the anime a pass on that.  The action sequences were very well animated and the moods were set very perfectly.   So the look was bleh, but awesomely so,  just in case my contradictory justifications weren't connecting.   \\n\\n\\n\r\n               Parasite was a great show in the Sub and English dub formats.   That almost never happens.  Kudos to all sound studios and voice actors involved.  The world needs more good dubs.   The soundtrack itself was a little forced and obvious about trying to create the feels, but the enveloped content was not distorted by the agro emotion tracks.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                  Excellently written main cast of characters... for the show.  The protagonists were executed perfectly,  and the supporting cast played their positions of observation well, but you never feel like you get to know any of them.  I would have liked a little more backstory on everyone involved,  but the lack of character foundation makes it less ABOUT THEM, and more about the moments they are in.   I feel that was intended, and cant give the show poor marks over my personal desire to have a little more content.\\n\\n\\n\r\n            Parasyte,  I enjoyed the hell out of it, and wouldn't consider it a waste of anyone's time if they tossed it onto their plan to watch list. Grizzziff Kingsbeard gives Parasyte an uninfected [8/10].   If I  randomly change that score to [10/10]...   trust no one.",

            "content": "Parasyte is another big name anime that a lot of anime fans have heard of. It's a very unique story about evolution, co-existing, and is a bit philosophical. Let's just jump straight into this long-overdue review!\r\nStory: 9\r\nThe story is very unique like I mentioned, and it is really cool! There are some really cool concepts, and I can't think of any plot holes. They definitely do a great job walking you through the story, and they also leave some things a mystery, but I like that. Essentially, the main character Shinichi has to cope with the fact that there's a parasite / alien in hishand, which lead to some really unique character development.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is really nice and the animation looked good, too. However, it should be no surprise that I've seen better! Anyway, I give the art a 9, and I don't have much to say about it other than it looks nice, and fits with the story.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\\n\r\nYes, yes, YES!!! In my opinion, the soundtrack is the best part of this anime. It has one of my favorite soundtracks in any anime, really. It's really interesting, and may be surprising, that a lot / most of the soundtrack is dubstep / techno. But keep in mind that it's very good quality! The soundtrack really makes the fight scenes a LOT cooler! I like how there are also themes that are quirky and comical. I think that really adds to the anime, too. I really can't explain the soundtrack. You just have to give it a listen yourself! There are even quite a few emotional pieces. I recall there also being a famous classical piece in the anime, which I found was a good touch, as long as it's not overused (it wasn't)!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nShinichi Izumi and Migi are arguably the best characters in the show. There are some pretty awesome villains, too, but keep in mind that there arcs are quite short unfortunately! But even though the anime is quite short, there was quite a lot of character development for not only our lovable main characters, but also the villains, too. The side characters were also pretty good. You may feel quite sad for some of the characters in this anime, too, which is really good!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nThis is a very fun anime that is REALLY damn funny. There were moments that caused me to laugh my ass off. In addition, with all of the great fight scenes, Parasyte proves to be difficult not to love. It's definitely a great anime that is worth your while to check out!\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\n9 is a really good score! It just didn't quite get to the point where I would consider it a 10, but that's okay! I can't just give out 10s to EVERY anime that I love. It just wouldn't make sense. I feel like a lot of people give this anime a 9, and I honestly feel like that's what it deserves. So, Parasyte, thanks for being awesome!\\n",

Mostly because I had a need of watching something new and perhaps a bit different from what I'm used to.\\n\\n\r\nI really like it when an episode ends with a twist and gives me the reactions: \"oh my god\" or \"whaaaat?\"\\n\r\nEach and every episode in Parasyte ends like this. \\n\\n\r\nWhat really caught my attention was how the two main characters went through some intense development. Speaking of their personalities and their way of handling a difficult situation.\\n\\n\r\nGetting used to all the gore and gross looking creatures didn't take as long as I thought it would, in fact, it took two episodes before I got used to it. \\n\r\nThat's a relief from my side. \\n\\n\r\nOne thing that I really would like to point out is the details on the anime characters faces as they change. \\n\r\nIf there is a person that has a problem with taking care of themselves and ends up drinking and similar things, their faces will be turning pale and they will be looking older than what they actually are.\\n\r\nThat's realistic of course and it's indeed an awesome detail to add. \\n\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching how the main characters trust in each other started to change.\\n\r\nIn fact, they didn't trust each other at all in the beginning. I even started to think that things would never really change for the two of them.\\n\\n\r\nBack to what I wrote at the top of the review, about how my point of view changed, regarding the unknown species, a parasyte in this case. \\n\\n\r\nThrough the first episodes, we were given the impression that the parasytes are brutal creatures that does nothing but kill humans without any second thought. \\n\r\nAll of the parasytes I got to see were like this. \\n\r\nThey are fast learners though. The main character quickly learned how to communicate with the human it had tried to take over at first. It learned how to communicate in words within one single night. \\n\r\nWell, I don't know if they at some point had their own personality but the main character was emotionless but a curious one. When it came up with a bunch of strategies it impressed me once again. \\n\\n\r\nAs these parasytes started evolving and changing into a different direction than what I thought possible, they all became confused.\\n\r\nThey started asking themselves: What are we? Why are we here?\\n\r\n\"We eat meat in order to survive and so do you humans. In the end, it's all just instincts that tells us how to survive.\" \\n\\n\r\nAnything out of the ordinary has always frightened mankind. No, not just mankind but every specie we know of. \\n\r\nThese Parasytes that were slowly popping up everywhere around humans, became rather curious on what purpose each creature has on this planet. \\n\r\nSome of them started observing humans rather than attacking them on sight.\\n\\n\r\n\"We humans protect other species because we feel alone. We protect the environment because we don't wanna go extinct. Look inside the human heart and all you'll find is self preservation\"\\n\\n\r\nI'm glad I watched the anime, I feel like the moral contains so much truth to it and it reminded me of how mysterious everything in the universe is.\\n\r\nHow much we need to explore, and how much we won't ever be able to reach. \\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "Disappointing. The anime adaption does not live up to the manga, and it fails to communicate with color and sound what the original artist could do easily in black and white. Very, very many characteristic scenes were deleted in the anime, probably because the director thought they \"weren't important\", but those small scenes were necessary for character development. \r\nOne of my biggest disappointments was how the anime failed to express the \"animalistic glare\" that we saw so clearly in the manga. This really shouldn't have been that hard to do, especially since we know very well what is possible in the anime adaption world. Asa comparison, I felt that the Made in Abyss anime adaption was much more powerful and expressive than the manga, whereas for Kiseijuu, it is clearly the reverse. \\n\\n\r\nI did enjoy the music quite a bit, except for the songs that were too dubsteppy.\\n\\n\r\nI also felt that the character designs were quite strange and generic, especially for the female protagonist, although I suppose the same could be said for the original manga's characters, who are also quite generic in appearance. I am NOT a fan of how they added glasses to the main character, who didn't have them in the manga. Glasses are a powerful symbolic device for describing how someone \"fails to see\" or \"cannot see clearly\", and they seem to interfere with the director's already poor ability to express the power of the \"animalistic gaze\".\\n\\n\r\nI give the show a 7/10 purely because the colorful animation does bring some unique quality compared to the manga, but it's still a disappointment. It could easily have done better if a more artistically-inclined director, like Yuasa Masaki, had done it. Without the character development, the show becomes more like a generic sci-fi thriller compared to the power of the manga's story.",

            "content": "~Pre-Review Thoughts~\r\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu, was on my watch-list for a very long time, too long in fact. The title-card turned me off after I had watched a few gory shows with very to little plot or character development. Why do I always make this mistake with title-cards, maybe I'm too quick to judge? Who knows, but what I do know is I should have started watching this show as soon as I saw it, I shouldn't of gone 'plan to watch' I should've smashed 'watching' and dived right in.\r\nKiseijuu is a wonderful cesspool of questioning your own moral ethics, asking what it's like tobe human, understanding individuality, and grasping the concept of death. \\n\\n\r\n~Story~ 9/10\\n\\n\r\nShinichi Izumi has fallen victim to an alien that has attempted to burrow its way into his brain whilst he is sleeping one night. However, the alien fails and ends up burrowed in Shinichi's right hand/arm instead. While being fully sentient the alien which is now deemed Migi, (ironically dubbed 'right') doesn't quite understand the value of life, but rather holds a more evolutionary stance on ethical reasoning. Migi does not have to take over Shinichi's brain for he can feed off of him as a host without controlling his brain. However if Shinichi tells anyone about Migi, Migi will threaten to kill whom Shinichi tells for Migi does not want to become an 'experiment'. A pact is formed between the two to work together, mainly whenever one of Migi's 'kind' is close a fight will ensue. Later on in the show a deeper pact is formed between the two, a deeper plot is developed, and a deeper sense of fear is provoked. By the end of the show you will feel engaged and impacted by the stories' narrative.\\n\\n\r\n~Art~ 10/10\\n\r\nWhen I think of connection in anime the first thing that comes to my mind is facial expression. The connectivity or the disconnect is seen here extraordinarily with these characters. It could possibly a facet that connects the primal instinct of the antagonists to our protagonist. Also this opening, oh my god. I'll get to that more in the next portion.\\n\r\nOh yea and seeing people morph into scissor-like aliens and munch away at each other is pretty rad too. \\n\\n\r\n~Sound~ 10/10\\n\r\nRegarding the latter, (OP) it was stunning. The Soundtrack for the OP: Fear and loathing in las vegas - Let me hear, was stellar, upbeat and matched the OP's animation themes. It seems like whatever anime Fear and Loathing touch amazingly adds a little pixie-dust to the final product. Although the majority of the song is in English, (some would say broken English) the song describes the show and the OP itself reflects events to come.\\n\r\nSuch tracks as Close To You get you emotionally involved within the situation, the fight tracks are a mechanical dubstep which plunges you into a fast paced fighting scene. Ken Arai did a magnificent job on this soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\n~Character~ 8/10\\n\r\nCharacter development plays a major role in this show, mainly due to the fact of the main character is  drastically changing and effecting the lives of those around him. No stone is un-turned, even the antagonists at points in the show have a major development shift due to the psychological traits that the show provokes. If you came here for mindless violence you came to the wrong place.\\n\\n\r\n~Enjoyment~ 10/10\\n\r\nKiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu is a psychological thriller filled with gold nuggets. You're a miner, you came here for some gold, go watch it now and collect some.\\n\r\nKiseijuu is worth your time and worth your purchase, and great show to watch with friends. \\n\r\nYou'l be on the edge of your seat, grabbing the tissue-box and wishing more existed after the show ends.",

            "content": "Parasyte...\r\nis an interesting show, a good concept in paper but honestly this is one of the worst series I have ever seen. I will give my points on why this series is so dreadful to watch and describe some story bits here and there so yeah expect spoilers because they need to be told for some parts.\r\nStory = 3\r\nThe story starts very simple, you have this ordinary and normal world, no magic, no superpowers, nothing out of the ordinary when suddenly these creatures from outerspace looking blobs show up and start invading living beings bodies ,from Humans to dogs. When we meet our main characterShinichi which is infected by one of them, so he tries to understand this fusion within his body and try to live a normal life  but also understand this blob looking thing which they agree to call Migi. \\n\\n\r\nThe story starts very simple, trying to keep going in life and not make such a fuss about this invasion of new creatures, but the fusion Migi tried to do with  Shinichi fails because he could not reach his brain and now lives as part of his right arm. At first the story explains how these creatures survive by killing humans and killing other parasytes alike among other things that incllude when they decide to attack and some of their natural instincts they have. After the introduction is explained then the story makes a big 180 with a plot of revenge against these creatures because Shinichi loses someone important in his life because another parasytes kills that person. So he decides to protect and defend humanity against them and also exterminate every single one of them. Continuing with that then it is obvious that these creatures showing up and leaving death bodies in every corner around gets attention from the government and then we go with this philosophical cliche dilemmas if parasytes are good or bad beings, and why humanity is bad because they are the destroyers of everything surround him to later end that parasytes adapted and now live within the humans that they killed using their bodies as the human they are possessing \\n\\n\r\nThis show's story in simple words doesn't know what it wants to be, they throw these ideas out of the blue just because reasons. The actions that drive the story are so poorly done, the dialogue is sometimes very lame, the actions and the characters are very idiotic to drive the story. But more of that later, because that's what affects the story more. Also the story tries way too hard to play with your feelings in such cheap and crappy way. Because again the characters that die in this show are so low on energy and simply not memorable at all except for the first death that is related to Shinichi. Also also this show throws super powers out of the nowhere because reasons. They establish that the setting is a normal and mundane world and only parasytes grant you super abilities but for some reason we have characters that become clairvoyants because.... yes again reasons and nothing is explained on how those super powers exist. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter = 2\\n\\n\r\nIf there are no characters there is no story but honestly I could not find characters at all except for 2, the main protagonists Shinichi and Migi.\\n\\n\r\nMigi is the best out of both, because it shows how it is very antihuman in nature like not understanding human feelings, reasons and emotional drives everyone has. Also with a mentality of surviving no matter what and  in mind that he has to cooperate with Shinichi to achieve that. Migi does the job done of being the creature that wants to understand the human society but that fails to comprehend at all seeing that as waste of time even as something as basic of having a name. It is just that but is so well portraited that you get to understand and care for the hanging arm.\\n\\n\r\nShinichi is also very well portraited, he is afraid of all this chaos and rampage that is invading his life and the others. But with Migi being part of him he loses the sense of being human and goes in a very cold tone in many ways but also trying to not lose his soul and heart. \\n\\n\r\nThese 2 are very basic characters but the actions and relations they have to just keep living complements each other and actually make a good pair that transform them into one solid character if you can say that because share the same body but for the rest.. hoo boy I have a lot to say.\\n\\n\r\nFirst Murano is one of the dumbest and ridiculous characters I have ever seen, she is in constantly in love with Shinichi but starts to notice that he has changed but she still talks to him and tries to hit him and make him notice her. But when she talks to him and sees some of his actions she gets sad for seeing the drastic changes Shunichi has, but when she tries to accept him and sees that he is good in nature, she accepts him until another wrong action happens with him and we go into a infinite loop of \"I love you but you changed, but I accept you, but I hate you because you change\". Can this girl decide if he is good or not jeez? the unnecessary whining is so idiotic. Also she is a big airhead because along the story there is a part where Shinichi saves her by him falling with HER from like a 10 floor bulding and then him jumping through a barricade of like 4 meters and believe he was drived by the moment. I mean what kind of stupidity you have to be believing that a normal human can do that. Again this is a normal and mundane, no magic nothing like that at all setting, so no human is possible to do that simply 0% at all and to believe that it's because of the adrenaline rushing through your body is simply lazy, playing and making a fool out of the users watching. There is no characteristic besides that from her, she is useless and doesn't add anything to the series except of Shinichi wanting to protect her from the parasytes.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Kana, oh another useless character, she for some reasons has wet dreams with Shinichi, after she being part of thugs that assault Shinichi and touches him, she gets this superpower of sensing parasytes. Then with her it is just that wet dream, meeting with shinichi and use of her power, repeat the loop. It is not explained at all how this power came to be, it is just there because............. yeah again no explanation. She uses this power to attract Shinichi but for what? Just to get killed because the dumbass doesn't know that it makes her sense other human eating parasytes around the area. So knowing that she just risks her life like an idiot just to see if her wet dream of Shinichi and her making babies comes true and it is just that. She doesn't serve another purpose than being another person Shinichi must protect. This character could be cut from the show and you don't miss anything at all.\\n\\n\r\nThen the human population as a whole is simply more retarded. There is one episode when a parasyte invades the school Murano and Shinichi go and shows that is a threat and danger to everyone around. Later they have a parasyte camouflage as a student and after getting poisoned and can't return to a human form,then it starts attacking everyone that is around it, just to show the students happily joking and KNOWING the threat like that  already happened and that killing teachers and other students is not a big deal. But for some reason this is lovely goofy trick and prank of some sorts to them when it is clearly that is not something like that. Yeah I will be laughing my ass knowing that my life is in danger after hearing many news of brutal deaths of local citizens around my city. So normal right???\\n\\n\r\nAlso when the government gets the inside of what these creatures are and tell the population on how to detect them, noboby questions how to protect yourself from them in such case to say at least, when they report that the parasyte that they found and made test on him that he killed students, teachers and police reinforcements during the moment they tried to stop it. What they say is that they have to pull part of your hair and if some cells are moving after doing it they demostrate that they are parasyte and you defend with nothing, because you are already dead. Honestly is this society so stupid to don't question things like that? The show just go and roll with it because again reasons unknown. So yeah the government is horrendous at this but also the citizens not questioning nothing at all contribute to this idiotic way of life.\\n\\n\r\nFinally the other parasytes, they are simply bland. The only ones that have some traits are Ryouko and Parasite. Ryouko with its understanding more about the humans, like doing sexual acts and raising a child as it is in a woman body but just that. Parasite would have been a great character to add with the dilemma of parasites adapting to its human partner and not controlling him/her completely but it is wasted because Shinichi and his owner Uda are the only ones that achieve this cooperation. The rest of the parasytes in the show are your typical villain of the week showing up and trying to devour everything in their path, even the last parasyte form called Gotou is just that, a multiple parasytes body created by Ryouko just to see how it goes with this social experiment until they die. Nothing more than that.\\n\\n\r\nSound = 5\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is a mixed bag. Some tunes are great some are just meh. The main ones being Next to You and Speak. But the Dubstep included in fight scenes is so out of place. They just throw it to put an ost there and I like dubstep music but it is just inserted because the scene needs music but it doesn't have something good to it, when they changed to the more instrumental and dramatic tunes for the fight scenes it got better. The opening and ending for me feel out of place. The opening is just your typical screamo autotune edge song that is required in your show if it has some gore in it and the ending is like meh, the song is not bad but it feels out of place when you see a head being cut from its body and tons of blood to this relaxed song coming up, it feels weird. The transition that they do is so sudden after a brutal scene happened. The voice actors do a great job, they portrait the characters really good even when some are just lifeless characters in the show but they bring out the little heart and soul they have,\\n\\n\r\nArt=9\\n\\n\r\nSimply outstanding. The character design is so well done. There aren't any weird frames when you pause an episode, the highspeed of the parasytes attacking each other is fabulous and exciting to watch. Everything is so fluid in this show and so amazing to watch and appreciate. The only thing I would criticize is the CGI in large crowds. Holy cow this tendency keeps going. They just look weird and like those early 3D videogames attempts but with HD resolution. They look bad honestly but other than that the production Madhouse did simply surpasses a lot other shows that  do animate even to this day (2019)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment = 3\\n\\n\r\nMany things bugged me with this show. So many inconsistent things going with the story, the changed of the plot is horrible and the crappy superpower without explanation was tough to watch without questioning every single time. I couldn't entertain myself with this besides the battles and the AMV I did for this thing. \\n\\n\r\nOverall = 2\\n\\n\r\nThis show is simply dumb, they treat the spectator as an idiot with their crappy plot points and inconsistent direction. Besides the battles and wanting to find how will end, I don't see the appeal of this, it is so basic but the basicness of it lacks a lot of elements that could be improved even if is adapted from an 80s manga and change the setting to this 2010s world, \\n\\n\r\nWell thanks for reading this review. Enjoy whatever you are doing and see you around this site. Take care.",

            "content": "This anime is as bad as it is overrated, I watched all 24 episodes, and frankly I admit it was good for a little while but things got rotten when the anime hit the second half.\r\nThey call it a horror anime and one of the best anime in recent memory, I found it to be quite repetitive and lacking in anything good. The animation was pretty top notch but the characters, theme, and story were incredibly shitty and the protagonist is a bad toady version of Shinji Ikari who doesn't really change and and he keeps melting into poop because I have lost all respectfor this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThey try to make the series interesting by adding themes of Environmentalism, survival, Human condition, and the complexity of morality but the painful truth is that people of the current generation overanylse everything and try to get all philosophical and shit but the anime itself is nothing but stylized action and cheap jump scares and the audience is high on weed trying to cope with the utter faliure of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters fail miserably to intrigue me, most of them are bland and uncolorful and the protagonist doesn't have any real character development apart from changing into a mopey whining pathetic crappy hero who is as interesting as a log of wood in the toilet. He just helps people, that all he does, he is a cliched reluctant superhero who doesn't bother to help himself, even if it turns him into an asshole. That's not my kind of hero.\\n\\n\r\nReiko Tamura, one of the villains was kinda of okay but after her so called heartbreaking death and how she learned about the value of human life really pissed me off. You think you can just redeem yourself by dying, even though you murdered dozens of people and terroized an entire nation, and then release an mass murdering super parasite on the people, no freakin way, she went the coward's way out and she gets no sympathy from me. She's a horrorible self serving asshole bitch who deserved an painful death with no restraints. \\n\\n\r\nIn my final paragraph, perhaps one of the worst parts of this anime is the emtional scenes, its overused and overhyped nowadays and everybody wants to cry all the time. I'm not saying that stuff is bad but when you overuse it to tighten the emtional quality, it's gets ridicious and overbearing. One of the most underhanded methods is when they try to make you cry, not just because of the intellectual factor but just to make something that's clearly sad and make you ball your eyes out. It's repugent and stupid and I find it's commonly used these days to bolster the ratings of the networks that air these shows. \\n\r\nYou can trick my eyes into crying but my Brain knows what your really doing and your damn lucky, I won't book a flight to Japan and kick your arrogant hippy asses.\\n\\n\r\nI'm out.",

            "content": "Parasyte to me is the most disappointing anime of all time. The first five episodes showed how Shinichi really had to learn to grow with Migi and show him how they have to be civil about how they take care of people and deal with their problems. But at the end of episode 5 when Shinichi's mom comes home from vacation and Migi heals him, this show becomes insufferable for the next six episodes with only one redeeming character, being Kana. After Kana's story is wrapped up over the next few episodes and the story with Ryouko is resolved not long after, which are actuallygood story lines instead of episodes 6-11, the show becomes very solid from episodes 19-21 with the city hall raid. But the last few episodes in the forest are overly convoluted and create and unnecessary plot point and character that drags out the story for longer, but in episode 23 my biggest problem with the show is temporarily resolved, which is Shinichi acting like an actual human. before I go more into why I was disappointed by this show, let me talk about what I liked. The op was fantastic and really got me through the bad episodes, the first 5 episodes were perfection, and the art style was pretty good as well. The two main character deaths are full of emotion and accompanied by a fantastic OST that brought tears to my eyes, and the action was pretty enjoyable at times and the city hall raid was enjoyable. Now with why I'm typing this out in the first place, why I think its not very good. Episode 6 completely took Shinichi form one of the best MC's of all time to worse than your average Kirito type character that has no personality. This is made worse because he had a lot of personality, but it was all taken away for some mindless violence and being \"cool and edgy\" for no reason. Now lets compare this to the protagonist of my favorite manga, Kaneki from Tokyo Ghoul. These two series are compared a lot, and I see why, with the similar premise they both have and main character that goes through trauma and becomes stone cold. Kaneki, as a character, is very complex and has a motivation to protect everyone so he doesn't lose anyone again, like what happened to Ryoko, this plus the torture he got is the reason why he changed and became the way he is. Shinichi, on the other hand, takes a fatal injury and Migi has to repair him and get his cells in Shinichi's brain and that's why he changes. these two differences are exactly why Tokyo Ghoul is great to me, but Parasyte is just okay. The reason I say episodes 6-11 suck are because Shinichi doesn't feel relatable at all or able to project myself on to him at all. This is the main reason I dislike Parasyte and if Shinichi had never changed, the show could've been a 9 or 10 to me.",

            "content": "I normally don\u2019t go for serious genres or anything \u201chorror\u201d and decided to try this out, I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this. It was a bit of a slow start with some characters I didn\u2019t like at first, but it got real good and remained that way up until the very end. This was the most fun I\u2019ve had watching anime in quite some time!\r\nTL;DR: A really good show with lots of blood and really good at creating suspense. \r\n(Spoiler free review from an anime-only watcher\u2019s perspective)\r\nSTORY:\r\n9/10\r\nCool ideas and execution, I like that it was never explained super in-depth forthe most part and kept an air of mystery which I think worked really well at keeping you engaged and interested in what was going to happen next. I didn\u2019t find anything very predictable and definitely gasped out loud a number of times while watching, not being sure what the outcome was going to be for a number of dramatic scenes.\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nLooked very good overall. Some lazy scenes and characters becoming very blob-like(and not just the parasytes) when there were wide or distance shots, but I\u2019m finding as I watch more anime that it\u2019s almost to be expected for budget/time saving I guess. The parasytes sure did look freaky when they were first introduced and pretty solidly threatening throughout the series. \\n\r\nI feel like they almost could have gone more intense with the gore but I\u2019m probably glad they didn\u2019t as I\u2019m the type who would probably get squeamish easily, I almost stopped watching immediately after starting the anime and seeing the very intense first scene, but I\u2019m really glad I kept going.\\n\r\nJust the scenes were very dark in a few of them, with the colours being hard to distinguish the subject but that\u2019s probably like why people dint want to see Batman in broad daylight, it ruins the mystery and literally lightens the mood too much, so I can\u2019t really complain.\\n\r\nOverall, really well done and suited the tone.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nGood OP, I love how it turns to what sounds to me like screaming and pure angst, really good for getting me hyped for the episode. \\n\r\nThe ending was a nice contrast, being so peaceful, almost felt like tearing up several times. \\n\r\nOne thing that was also a really nice touch for me was the music that would play for the preview shots of the next episode, it was really eerie and always freaked me out.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay so the main character I found pretty unlikeable at first, but his actions were always somewhat realistic(although a huge wimp at first) but it made his later actions so much more justifiable and satisfying to see. I loved seeing the character growth and interactions. Even the characters that I felt didn\u2019t get fleshed out much or development were still mostly realistic, if a bit dull at times.\\n\r\nOverall, no huge relying on stereotypical character tropes like the super tsundere etc which was a nice change to see.\\n\r\nI liked how human (or in the non-human cases how non-human) their choices and actions felt.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nWas not expecting to enjoy this this as much as I did. This was fun, it grabbed me in and although I was a bit skeptical at first, had me looking forward to each next episode I watched. There were a good number of cliffhangers, but also some surprising nice episode ends so I never felt like the anime was trying to be cheap with fake outs and the like.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\n10/10\\n\\n\r\nVery fun alien spooky anime drama. Had good drama and mystery and actual good characters that I enjoyed seeing progress and mess up.\\n\r\nShinchi and Migi are forever best bros to me, this made me think of the 2018 Venom movie, this was almost like a buddy-cop at times which only added to the fun for me.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost(definitely) cried over a right hand, would watch again.",

            "content": "Parasyte: The Maxim is basically if Devilman Crybaby had been done right lol. This sci-fi/horror/action anime is one of the best made by studio Madhouse, and I actually like it more than their previous thriller Death Note. I don't have much time to re-watch anime series (mostly because I'd rather watch a new show) but I'm glad I revisited this one from 2015, which totally held up! Sure, I knew what was coming, but I'd still get excited on my 2nd viewing whenever the kickass music was about to start up. *Because* I knew what was coming, I could turn up the volume right beforethe beat dropped and, man, it was great.\\n\\n\r\nWhat could've been a simple monster-of-the-week series evolved (hey, appropriate!) into something so much more, guys. Sure, Parasytes are killing people, but they're only doing so in order to survive. As the show points out, it's not so different from us humans killing and eating animals lower on the food chain in order to live. What's more, the show also depicts several moments of human cruelty and destruction, begging the eternal question of \"Who are the real monsters here?\" We also see some sympathetic portrayals of Parasytes, such as the woman Tamura Reiko who attempted to have a human baby and blend into human society.\\n\\n\r\nWhat this show does best (as in 10/10) is its character development. We see some big changes in not just our everyman protagonist Shinichi, but also his hand Parasyte Migi! This was what I loved most about the show, how the two of them developed in different directions and became more like each other. After further exposure to Migi (and having his cells mixed with the Parasyte's) Shinichi becomes more cold and detached, less human. He even at one point throws out a dead dog in the garbage can, saying \"It's just a dog shaped lump of meat now,\" something no human would say. Migi, on the other hand, starts out as a cynical self-serving alien, but over time grows more sympathetic towards humans. We see how his friendship with Shinichi has changed him, to the point where he even asks someone to try to understand how *Shinichi* feels, and he's even willing to put his own life on the line to rescue Shinichi?! It's wonderful. I was honestly hoping we'd get a similar relationship between Akira and Amon in Devilman Crybaby, but that's neither here nor there.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is a perfect 10/10, the way the Parasytes glisten and shine when they morph and battle, it's just astounding. The dubstep soundtrack, while off-putting to some, fits perfectly in every scene it's used in. This 10/10 soundtrack is one I listen to all the time on its own, but I also can't separate it from the anime in my mind. It's essential! I also want to mention the excellent sound design in the show, the sound effects, right down to the eerie static-y voices the Parasytes use. So much attention to detail was put in this anime and that's why it's one of my all time favorites.\\n\\n\r\nThere were so many epic moments in this series, too many to count! Again the dubstep kicks in at key moments, transforming a simple scene where say Shinichi saves a kitten from being abused to something beyond epic. My favorite fight scene is when Shinichi must confront the Parasyte in the body of *spoilers* his mother. The action, the music, the emotion in this scene is so damn raw and perfect, I just love it. Another favorite moment is when Migi reappears during a battle, interrupting the frantic dubstep music with a simple \"Yo,\" which had me laughing my ass off.\\n\\n\r\nI have a few minor nitpicks of course. For one, the sound effect for Migi stretching sounds *a lot* like someone passing gas, and that would actually throw me off for a second in an otherwise tense action scene. I also thought for a horror anime, this actually wasn't that scary. To be fair, very few anime have actually scared me in the past. Still, Parasyte's a legendary 10/10. I hope the success of this show leads to more and more older manga being adapted to anime.",

            "content": "I read the manga months before the anime went out. I was glad when I found out that it got an anime adaptation but at the same time I wasn't because most adaptations don't follow the original book or do some enormous changes; this anime didn't let me down.\r\nStory: 9\r\nHumans have become species which are very harmful to the planet. To prevent their growing numbers, parasytes have come to earth, took control of people and after that they kill and eat them too. I don't really understand why but most of them kill their own kind as well (maybe they fight because of food, Idk).This parasyte wasn't able to invade the brain of Shinichi, the main protagonist, but instead grew on his right arm. Not being able to control Shinichi, the two must have extreme coordination when other parasytes try to kill them. Shinichi now having to live as half human and half parasyte is the most interesting thing to see in Kiseijuu aside from the fights and understanding Tamiya Ryouko, atleast for me.\\n\r\nThe studio (Madhouse not sure) did an excellent job adapting the original book. Followed the manga and had a great pace.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8.5\\n\r\nThe art has really improved. I didn't appreciate the manga's art but in the anime, I loved it. The fights are terrific, but sometimes the MC not doing a thing, the spotlight is only on Migi. (Although, I don't think I should be complaining about that in art section, my bad) For me, it is really cool, seeing how fast they fight that you won't know who's attacking or defending.\\n\r\nThe character design changed in a better way. Shinichi's appearance before the \"transformation\", having eyeglasses and that hairstyle made him look quieter and more of 'intelligent' type (I prefer him that than the transformation and than how it was in the manga, maybe I'm just in fangirl mode lololol); the main female, murano and a supporting female, Kana, had a better design which made them look cuter and younger. Her personality plus this drastic char design change of Kana even made her more popular than Murano.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nThe voice actors did a not outstanding but not terrible performance. I don't have much to say about that. There are only 2 things which left me an impression, how Tamura Ryouko laughed and migi's voice actress, yep actress: Aya Hirano. Maybe it's only me (well ^^\") but I wouldn't have guessed that migi has even a female voice actress.\\n\r\nI don't like the op and ed to 'Dat' level but they aren't bad either.\\n\r\nNow the themes. They're fantastic heh. I'll give you a brief description, more like opinion, of my 2 favorites. 1- Next to you, this theme is a not so fast melody and has a melancholic and sad feeling. It's like someone's saying 'I know it's sad and tragic but you have to accept, fight and move on, because that's life'. 2- Migi's theme. A melody of someone full of curiosity wanting to define the mystery of the world.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nMigi's and MC's relationship is really interesting. Starting from a doubtful one to faithful friendship. Shinichi accepted migi because of their experiences and hardships and vice versa. Migi became shinichi's best friend that he was thankful to not be able to control his brain. I like Migi because he isn't the typical parasyte that only wants to kill, he is always curious and fights using not only his powers but his intelligence as well.\\n\r\nTamara reiko or Ryouko is like migi and that's why I like her too. Her character has a strong impact. Further description of her may make me write big spoilers.\\n\r\nMurano the female lead. She doesn't mean much to the story but well. When she said, 'you are Shinichi, aren't you?' and migi was already there, it made me 'woah hmmm, interesting'. Now stop saying that like 4 times in an episode, it was pretty annoying. I regret not counting how times she said that.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9 \\n\r\nI loved this anime for the positive things I wrote above about the various sections. Migi and Tamura made it more interesting. The moral about the the relation of human and the earth, and what the mc and the last antagonist spoke about made me open my eyes, because it is applied to real life too.",

            "content": "Parasyte -the maxim- spoiler free. \r\nFirst lets talk about the things I didn't like about Parasyte.\r\n.....................................................................\r\nNow that that's covered.\r\n\"Parasytes\" invade Earth, taking over the brains of human hosts by entering through their ears or noses. One Parasyte attempts to crawl into Shinichi's ear while he sleeps, but fails since he is wearing headphones, and enters his body by burrowing into his arm instead, taking over his right hand. Because Shinichi was able to prevent it from traveling further up into his brain, both beings retain their separate consciousness. As the duo encounter other Parasytes, they capitalize on their strange situation and gradually form a strongbond, working together to survive. This gives them an edge in battling other Parasytes, who frequently attack the pair upon realization that Shinichi's human brain is still intact. Shinichi feels compelled to fight other Parasytes, who devour humans as food.\\n\\n\r\nI love the writing and the direction of this story as it unfolds. The underlying themes of humans are toxic and are pollution etc. are common talk these days, so it was no surprise to hear such philosophy, but then I remember that this story was written in the early 90's, and I feel a bit more respect for it's message. Things are slow and take a nice steady pace. I enjoyed the tense situations and battles the way the were believably (within reason) handled by the characters. The fighting wasn't all super hero crazy like some other generic battle shounen I know, but still exciting. The melodrama is a little potent but it never felt really forced, and had some great moments built up with suspense that genuinely made me care what had happened. There are places I feel that could have been stronger, and left a little bit of detail uncovered, not really any loose ends, but a vague closure. But nothing that I feel was poor. \\n\\n\r\nShinichi feels more real then other certain MC's with the pacing and progression of his character. His reaction to situations are what you would expect from someone in his shoes, and his growth is very justified unlike some other anime where the hero becomes the savior because, well a hero is needed so they make it convenient.  The supporting cast is kinda shallow, but they are not really necessary to develop and are given enough attention to be relevant to the story's advancement, but are not forced into the scenario. Like Murano, who is there to serve as a reminder that Shinichi is changing. And Kana, who is needed to accelerate Shinichi's resolve. \\n\\n\r\nI love the dubstep BGM used throughout the show as well as the OP, ED. The art desig, it looks great and animation is pretty solid during it's action. All and all, I loved this show.\\n\r\nDefinitely recommend a watch.",

If you are interested in ethics, philosophy, biology, and/or sci-fi, this one's for you--- you just have to put up with a few shortcomings. The show does falls prey to these tropes: 1) completely unnecessary gore and massacre like in Deadman Wonderland 2) the main character's overdone obsession with human values (like in Tokyo Ghoul), and 3) Like in many parasite stories, there's only a rather vague explanation of the parasites' existence. But other than those holes, it's spot-on. Great writing, original story, good characters for the most part, decent art style, great music, and EXCELLENT fleshingout of all the what-ifs of a world where humans are preyed upon by another species. This show makes Tokyo Ghoul look like some 12-year-old's attempt at horror. Seriously, watch it.",

            "content": "I usually don't leave reviews, but my god, I couldn't let this go without one. This anime had a good concept to work with, and it's completely ruined by poor character development and cheesy dialogue.\r\nStory (5/10):\r\nThe first initial episodes were great, as it set up Shinichi's newfound conflict and the curious musings of parasyte Reiko Tamura. Her mysterious interest in Shinichi, combined with his gradual transformations, draws you in as a viewer. Once her story arc ceases, however, it becomes the mediocre story of a boy getting chased by an alien. The story also leaves several loose ends unresolved, such as Kana's ability to senseparasytes, the investigator's suspicion of Shinichi, the group of parasytes enraged by MIgi's failed inhabitation of his brain, Reiko's baby . . . it's as if they wanted to add complexity to the story but fell short by leaving these subplots unfinished.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development (2/10): \\n\r\nShinichi's character is not the brooding, deep character in existential crisis that some may have you believe. His internal and external dialogue are so forced to make him appear complex, that it feels as if you are being hit over the head with a hammer by the writers. His love triangle counterparts (Murano and Kana) lack any depth aside from fawning over him and giving the series a subplot. Reiko is the only mildly interesting character due to her evolution into becoming human-like and questioning her purpose as a parasyte. \\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10):\\n\r\nThere is nothing wrong with the art in this series. It's not bad and is quite decent.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10):\\n\r\nAnytime Shinichi launched into a droning monologue about the existence of mankind, this terribly sappy theme music began to play and ruined any hope of me taking his words seriously. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (6/10):\\n\r\nDon't waste your time trying to finish Parasyte. It fails to achieve the level of hype it created in shallow character development, unfinished subplots, poor dialogue, and an unsuccessful attempt at exploring the niche of mankind.",

            "content": "Parasyte was a good anime, the changes in Shinichi was huge when he got stabbed in the heart which made him almost emotionless. The fights between a parasyte and him was good too. What made me sadden was Kana, I think she deserve to be with Shinichi, Why i preferred Kana and Satomi was that Kana was kind of unique to be hearing wavelength which only a parasyte could, that was one special trait she had, while satomi was just one of your typical ordinary high school girl, being shy yeah. I don't hate her though, I just preferred kana. \r\nKana was quite obsessed withShinichi, as far as plucking his hair and curl it to represent a ring and put it into the ring finger. And dreaming too. Kana first met shinichi when he got bullied by Kana and her gang. Kana told them to stop bullying and wanted to help him up, but sensing his right hand was weird, which made Kana curious and all the romance and stuff came up as kana became a \"stalker\".\\n\\n\r\nThe interesting part was when Shinichi became badass, after reviving from death by Migi. As shinichi became kind of strong, having part of some power from Migi, Migi really helped Shinichi a lot, but after gaining some of Migi's power they co -operate and defeated Parasytes.\\n\\n\r\nMigi was a cute character, the voice was cute, what I like about Migi was that he was quite strong, protecting shinichi, and through out all he has experienced with Shinichi, they kind of became friend, and Migi seems a bit more understanding Humans and more of having compassion.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself was okay, the plot was okay too as we see changes in Shinichi, Art was good, Sound was Amazing, especially Migi. Character development was kind of good as we could see changes. Enjoyment was definetely Fantsastic, I enjoyed a lot. Overall it was nice to see the anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow to the ending of Parasyte, it was kind of confusing because the parasyte was gone and i was wondering where did they went. Migi disappeared, I would miss him, as Satomi and Shinichi live happy ever after, after some epic event happening. Where did migi went too, I meant he was in Shinichi body, its not like he would go anywhere else. Will miss migi. :( Kana too.",

The show dances around the topic of life just enough to grab the attention of people with several different views on the subject before coming to a conclusion that some of you will find either deeply philosophical or simply common sense.\r\nThe first couple episodes are a bit stretched as the show tries to fit in the results this new threat poses to humanity. But by the third episode and so on, well, let's just say you better not have work or school in the morning. This wasa great anime to wait for it's completion for a full marathon.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is that they should have put far more effort into the action scenes. Sure, they were still pretty epic for the style the director seemed to be going for, but the Dragon Ball Z, too fast to see, fighting style isn't as fun as it was back when I was a kid.\\n\\n\r\nAs a sidenote: About the soundtrack, I hate dubstep, vehemently so, but this anime used it so beautifully that I couldn't complain in the slightest.

I figured, \"Hey, maybe there was some underlying meaning in it all along,\" so I kept that at the back of my head and tried to think about Parasyte as a thought-provoking anime about human behavior and the threats of survival\u2014\r\nWhich in my pure and honest belief, themes that aren't that strong to even save a crippling plot progression for the second half.\r\nIt may have been a few months since I watched Parasyte, but oh boy, do I remember distinctly how I felt like everything became a waste of time when Ifinished watching it.\\n\\n\r\nLet's go straight ahead with the plot and execution. Shinichi Izumi is one of the victims of the silent invasion of extraterrestrial parasitic beings called Parasytes (may be, may be not, but for the sake of this review let's assume they're called such). However, he manages to prevent the complete invasion of the Parasyte inside him and traps the alien inside his right hand. The being turns out to have eaten his right hand and replaced it, and together they learn to co-exist as a team in order to survive against other hosts of the same race which varies on either neutrality or hostility.\\n\\n\r\nPretty simple for an entry in the science fiction. However, what Parasyte suffers from is not the clich\u00e9 premise nor the straightforward outline\u2014it's the fact that it's not a good show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite a simple Point A to Point B storyline, the show never really knows what's it supposed to be\u2014which I would like to call the Sword Art Online syndrome. It has romance, it has angst, it has sex jokes, it has blood, it has politics, it has ethics\u2014but how the fuck do you cram that within 24 episodes and not look like a mess?\\n\\n\r\nWell, it's not exactly the problem. The problem is Parasyte has terrible balancing of these genres. You have similar shows of roughly the same length like Evangelion that may be debatable on its plot progression and themes, but still pulls off the same tone all throughout. It had comedy, it had seriousness\u2014but it never feels so overpowering and the show knows when it should stop.\\n\\n\r\nGranted, that the show actually gets more serious in the later episodes of the series, with certain characters getting entangled in Shinichi's mess and the grief of maintaining a romantic relationship because of intergalactic affairs, but here comes the underlying problem of getting nowhere\u2014not the genres this time, but the plot.\\n\\n\r\nI did not understand what the hell was going on in the last couple of episodes. Everything had poorly-paced narratives, and not enough explanations were given on why they were doing this and why they were doing that. I wish I can elaborate more, but the more I tried to wrap my head around it, it fucking rips into pieces. The show starts off as a psychological sci-fi shounen-like first half, and the next episodes were a goddamn political and morally questioning thriller\u2014which, mind you, should definitely be the direction it was taking, but there was no absolute reason why these situations are being thrown around suddenly!\\n\\n\r\nI'm sure I've repeated myself in different phrases, but the pacing in this show is terrible, and makes me wonder how much content Madhouse had to cut off from the manga.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's the next thing to dislike about Parasyte? Its poorly-written characters.\\n\\n\r\nFor the love of God do I not understand Shinichi's character development. He starts off as a wimp, then after [the thing which must not be spoiled] he turns into a badass with a nice hairdo. Then, after another shift in the final arc of the story, he's suddenly reverted to this wimping coward who just realized how he's scared for his life? Like no shit! And you may claim that the situations he's in are enough to make someone regress into cowardice, but the point stands that the bad pacing of this show ruins any semblance of notable character development.\\n\\n\r\nMigi was okay, but I didn't feel anything special about him as much as he feels for humans. Murano, aside from being voiced by KanaHana, has nothing to go for as the main girl. And Kana, aside from being voiced by Sawashiro, has nothing to go for at all. I mean, why do people like this character? Just because she's some clingy bitch who can't even listen? She's just as poorly written as much as Murano is. The only character I have at least a little bit empathy for was Ryouko, and that's not saying much, considering how little her involvement was in Shinichi's arc aside from discussing philosophy and handing over a baby.\\n\\n\r\nA lot of the praise to the show goes from its animation studio Madhouse, a long-standing behemoth of consistent quality and a role model for good production values\u2014and I couldn't agree more. For Parasyte, however...\\n\\n\r\nIt's not to say that Parasyte had bad animation, per se, but I didn't feel as much sakuga as I expected. To top it off, there isn't enough gore as I felt it should have, coming from a show that has aliens preying on humans. I guess it's the thing with the show feeling more like a shounen than a seinen\u2014which were my expectations. And the fight scenes were honestly boring\u2014I felt more hyped watching JoJo fights where it's mostly oraoraoras.\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing I will always remember about Parasyte that was great, its the wonderfully animated OP that brings me goosebumps every time I hear it that also blends greatly with its song. The ED is a calming song after a long hard day at alien work and suits Shinichi's character nicely. The rest of the soundtrack\u2014forgettable. I'd be fine with the dubstep if they didn't put it in every goddamn insert.\\n\\n\r\nWas Parasyte deep, though? In some ways, I think it is. However, these themes are not well-explored and while the show would have been a good metaphor for racism and other heinous human acts, its execution really undersells its message.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't hate Parasyte, but I feel like its writing is an insult to aspiring writers like me, who value pacing as an importance out of all things, and it strikes the heart how something like this is highly rated on MAL. People like Parasyte for the wrong reasons, because it's supposedly an \"edgy\" show for the cool kids. Parasyte is likable because it explores these themes that can be likened to other exceptional sci-fi shows with depth\u2014which should be valued more as opposed to this heaping pile of mess.\\n\\n\r\nFor what it is, Parasyte is a good entry-level anime. But it's not even the best in being one. There are better shows out there that are worth your time, with the same level of impressiveness and theme explorations that do not slip on its own pace.",

            "content": "GUYS THIS IS REALLY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!Warning this may contain some minor spoilers. First of all I have to admit that the writer was fully aware of parasites. Indeed parasites are much more developed than bacteria, viruses etc. In fact they use us as hosts and can do incredible things. One parasite (i don't remember the name now, anyway) causes the host to eat sand (yeah indeed!!!) so that more parasites of his kind will accommodate the host. Some parasites do not appear in the circulation of the host in the morning and appear in the circulation in the night when the host most likely is sleeping( as a defence mechanism) that's why doctors must know precisely the time of the appearance of the parasite, in order to detect them in blood samples. Apart from that there is a neurological syndrome called alien hand, in which your right hand is not under your control and you don't understand it when it is moving. Maybe the writer was inspired by these two facts. Anyway let's get to the plot. The plot is really amazing cause they paid attention even to the slightest details. For example when the parasite tried to enter the protagonist's hand at first it tried to move forward subcutaneously and when there was something on the way (the earings with which the protagonist tied his hand) it tried to move throught the blood flow. However the earings were tied so tight that also the blood flow was cut and the parasite couldn't move forward in order to take over the brain. Therefore it was stuck in his hand. Apart from that the plot is really deep. An example: How can you be sure that the way you feel is genetically determined? For example how can you be so sure that when you were 5 years old, your parents were lovey doveys, so this was a very strong stimulus that made you subconsciously imitate this way of behaving and as a result you are very romantic? It is a major issue between psychosociologists whether the way we feel is genetically determined or it is affected by our environment. That's why a parasite, although at first was genetically programmed to have no feelings at all, in the end gained some maternal feelings! And how can you be so sure that maternal love and maternal sacrifice isn't just a genetic programmed feeling in order to maintain our species? But above all the story unravels the human nature. It shows that in fact we are a species that are the ultimate predators. We have developed compassion for other humans as a way to prioritize human life and multiply our species.Guys it really worths watching!",

            "content": "\u3010 The following is a review of : Kiseijuu and Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu \u3011\r\nI\u2019m going to cover both the anime and the manga of Parasyte in this review. So, pretty much, Kiseijuu vs. Kiseijuu: Sei no Kakuritsu. To preface, Hitoshi Iwaaki is one of the most prolific names in Japanese horror comics, Parasyte being his most referenced and revered work. His historical work, Historie, has a lot of fans as well but not nearly as many followers as the people who follow his ever trending, cult classic Parasyte. \r\n\t\u2022 Iwaaki\u2019s art style is very distinctive and he\u2019s even made cameos in famous short storycompilations like Neo Devilman, a love letter to Go Nagai more or less with many artists interpretations, though with all of the erotic shorts, I think it should be considered a doujinshi. There was even a compilation collection, like Devilman, for Parasyte, called Neo Parasyte.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Since Devilman went on to influence Berserk\u2019s Kentarou Miura and Evangelion\u2019s Hideaki Anno, and for Iwaaki you can plainly see Parasyte\u2019s effect on the anime horror genre, he\u2019s even had a tremendous influence on the works of  Junji Ito though Ito was mostly, verbatim, influenced by Kazuo Umezu, I think that it speaks volumes if they can both inspire so many people that there\u2019s anthology short story collection for both of them.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 You get my point, Parasyte is a very important manga! To be frank, I thought the manga was good and the anime was garbage. I may be biased, since I had read the manga years before the anime aired and I know many people love the animated version, but I, for one, couldn\u2019t get behind it. The animation was inconsistent, if you watch the trailer for the first episode and then compare the animation quality, it\u2019s obvious that they just used all of the well-animated scenes in the promotional material. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The music was awful, save for the opening because Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas are my jams; there was tone-deaf dubstep playing at inappropriate moments. The comedic timing in the show is horrendous. I know it\u2019s not meant to be a funny show, but the manga had relatively campy humor, like the penis hand and the parasite woman jogging with her top half effaced. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The panel layout for the penis hand scene actually made it seem in good taste, where the anime version was clunky and weird. I thought the voice acting mostly sounded amateurish in the Japanese audio as well, other than Migi\u2019s voice. I give a thumbs up to his voice actress. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I didn\u2019t like that Shinichi\u2019s character was adapted in the anime to be a geek that becomes a badass, because is incredibly clich\u00e9, and it wasn\u2019t a thing in the manga. When I first saw the character designs, I thought it might be okay, but the anime portrays him as an unlikable perverted loser rather than what he was in the manga: an average 80\u2019s kid.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 The series is chalk full of plot conveniences and stupidity, while the manga is shorter and so, these flaws are practically non-existent. The anime is not a faithful adaptation; there are many artistic liberties taken. The plot is very shaky and unfocused. I believe anything good about Kiseijuu that you want can be found in the manga. \\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 Overall, don\u2019t watch the anime adaptation. I had the same kind of clairvoyance at the ending of the Kiseijuu manga that I did when I read a good novel, like with The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao written by Junot Diaz, not quite the heightened emotional reaction I got from Nabokov\u2019s Lolita, but a feeling that had me walking outside and the sky seeming more vibrant than usual because of my enlightenment from reading something spectacular. Like a\u30fcI\u2019m satisfied being a human feeling.\\n\\n\r\n\t\u2022 I don\u2019t know if any of you can relate to that, but please read the manga instead of watching the anime, so you can actually contract some kind of feeling from an otherwise empty waste of garbage. Parasyte: The Maxim is one of the worst animated adaptations, if not the worst, in anime history. I give Kiseijuu: the manga a 8/10 and the anime a 2/10.",

It's one of these animes in which I was initially looking for horror, but stayed for the plot and beautiful art style. This anime has a great aftertaste - it lifts you up and makes you think. \r\nEven though I found quite a few things to nitpick, overall I really enjoyed the story. This anime has something I haven't observed before - it can shift the mood in a matter of seconds, but do it so effortlessly that it feels natural. One moment you'll have adrenaline rushing through your body, but the other - eyeswet from tears. Despite what turns the plot would take, it felt natural, nothing seemed forced just ''for the sake of story''. And, honestly, that intro just kept me going. It fits the anime (and my music taste) perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nI don't really want to go much in details, but if you're somebody who is looking for a good bit of action-packed horror that goes along with a non-linear drama-filled storyline, this anime is a good place to start.",

            "content": "Exists as an allegory for the toxicity of humanity to Earth, and focuses on the hypocrisy and lack of logical consistency of anthropocentrism, most specifically in regard to treatment of animals and general exploitation/pollution of the environment. The writer very clearly wanted to design a shonen masque around this central idea, and created 3-4 major plots points to continue engaging the viewer so they could eventually express their ideas. Aside from these few points, most of the show exists either in a lull, or in a state where the main character has no influence or part of the events taking place. Even when these majorpoints are hit, the author could have had better understanding and clarity when expanding his thesis and examining human society. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea of altruism deconstructs most of the characters \"motives\", and is only barely touched on at the very end of the show. Feels like something they found out or finally thought about 15 episodes in when they touch on it, realized their mistake, and just pushed the story into a place where altruism no longer would be a character motive.\\n\\n\r\nMany character lines are simply repeated over and over again, as if the writer had no understanding or willingness to further flesh out any of the supporting characters beyond what bare minimum role they had to play. The few main characters though do develop well and transition with decent seamlessness. Some main character lines are awkward or misplaced, but all in all pretty consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound was fine. Some of the random dubstep tracks distracted from the medium, and some of the battle foley certainly were not selected or produced correctly. Animation was Madhouse (great). Enjoyable enough to be recommended.",
