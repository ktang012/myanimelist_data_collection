            "content": "Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\nI usually try to give a fair, as unbiased a review as I possibly can. But not this time. This is the 0.01% of the time where I'm going to purposefully express my hate for a show. And today that show is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2. Or as I like to call it, \"The Melancholy of The Fans of Haruhi Suzumiya\".\r\nIn case you didn't know, \"melancholy\" refers to sadness or depression. Only instead of Haruhi being the sad and depressed one (as the show is about those around her trying to keep her spirits up), this time aroundit's our turn: the fans who supported it financially (if you bought the first series or any other merchandise), increased its popularity (by recommending it to friends), and who even created a sort of \"Haruhi-ism\" pseudo-religion.\\n\\n\r\nThis abomination of a \"second season\" is a slap in the face to all of the fans who have waited so long to see Haruhi return after all this time. I don't say this as a rabid fanboy, in fact, I'm one those out there who never saw the Haruhi franchise as anything more than another \"somewhat entertaining\" time-killer. I say this as a fan who empathizes with my fellow anime fans who were waiting with excruciating patience for a great second season, only to be handed a steaming pile of cow dung. Which, strangely enough, is probably the impression KyoAni was aiming for. How? Why? No one knows. Maybe they're just trying to kill their name, and the Haruhi franchise. Maybe they're trying to go out of business. It's beyond my comprehension. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?!?\\n\\n\r\nIn case you didn't know (but chances are you probably do if you're reading this), the last couple of episodes of this \"second season\" (ugh) covered the story arc where the gang becomes caught in an endless time loop, that can only be resolved if Haruhi helps Kyon with his homework before Summer ends. They could have done this in two episodes, one episode to show one of the loops, the next episode to dedicate half for the realization of the occurrence of the loop, and the next half of the episode to resolve it in yet one last loop, leaving the next episode open to the next part of the story. They could have even stretched it to three and I'm sure it still could have turned out wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nBut no. Here's (likely) MORE THAN HALF THE SEASON DEDICATED TO THE SAME DAMN STORY ARC. Not only that, but said story arc involves showing the SAME EPISODE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER (etc) for God only knows how many times (yet to come as of this writing). Forget new content, it's rehashed content for half a season, if not more. Oh, but I guess technically some scenes were redrawn due to being shown from different angles... But that DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY MORE INTERESTING.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my advice. Watch the first episode of the season. Then the second. Then skip half the season and pick up where Endless Eight finally ends, then continue on for your (probably) four remaining episodes. Enjoy your approximately five new episodes of Haruhi. It might as well have been an OVA.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend we show our distaste at this horribly unprofessional series by rating it as low as possible, and writing as many bad reviews as possible. I'm not the type to do this, it's far from the kind of person I am. I always try to give things a fair chance, without spur-of-the-moment emotions, without just jumping the gun to write based on my initial impressions. I try to give a show a chance to settle in my mind. But this is a whole other ball game. It's ridiculous, and has infuriated fans across the globe. The fans who love the series, the fans who poured money into it, supported it, and the fans who, most importantly, waited a long time to do it all again in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nShame on you, KyoAni, shame on you. I will never buy any of your products. Ever. Please give my regards to the Japanese government when you file for bankruptcy.",

            "content": "There have been a lot of negative reviews on this site, which I can agree with to an extent. However, most of them focus entirely on the Endless Eight arc, while disregarding the rest entirely.\r\nI can't say I disagree that the Endless Eight arc sucked; Having to sit through so many episodes of what was, for the most part, the same thing was somewhat annoying. The first time it happened, I had to check to make sure I didn't accidentally rewatch an episode. The changes are subtle enough to miss if you don't watch the episodes back to back.\r\nHowever, I do like the fact thatthe producers tried to do something different, which a lot of others do not. If experimentation like this never occurred, we'd likely never have had the pleasure of watching greats like Cowboy Bebop, or even the original series of Haruhi.\\n\\n\r\nI also very thoroughly enjoyed the other episodes, especially the final ones that very nicely covered the events that had us watch the greatest first episode of an anime ever. And while the Endless Eight arc was long, I really, really loved the final moments of the last episode of that arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound was spectacular, which was always to be expected. You have to hand it to the artists who managed to draw the same episode different ways so many times. The Endless Eight arc was -not- enough to detract from the other episodes of the series, which are all incredible in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, as long as you're one of those people who only see the negative aspects of something, or have a hard time pushing them out of your mind, you'll probably hate the season. \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed it very much as a whole, and will continue recommending series 1, and start recommending series 2 to anyone who hasn't seen them. And I suggest you not let a few bad reviews deter you from what is ultimately a very enjoyable viewing.",

            "content": "Endless Eight Arc - Enough Said?\r\nThe entirety of the season can be summed up almost in much the same way as the first season, so i am going to focus my attention on the Endless Eight arc of this season. This arc seems to be the part most mentioned in reviews and in most cases negatively so. It is also the most prominent memory we have of the season when you mention the 2nd season.\r\nEight episodes of the same events, over, and over again. Everyone can agree that this was not a cheap measure to save money. since the animation, clothing, and scene of everyevent were unique to each of the eight episodes. But hatred still seems to fill the hearts of the viewers about this arc.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed it is long and boring over time. But like how FLCL must be completely confusing to get it's point across, so must this be the way of Endless Eight. This arc is the lead up to the movie \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" For those of you who've read the novels or have done your research you should already know this, but if not well now you know. This arc was intended to bore you. it was designed to make you angry. But what can you do? you are only the viewer of this show. you can only sit there and hope the next episode will advance the plot. sounding familiar?\\n\\n\r\nif you have not guessed already the main character of this arc is not actually Kyon. Although the show is told through him It's Yuki we should be paying attention to. Ms. Nagato, the alien computer interface placed on earth as an observation tool unaffected by time loops or altered realities. she has the omnipotent power to know all and to do all, the only catch? she may not do anything. her job is simply to observe and assist when absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nnow in order for us to fully understand this we'll also need to understand the philosophy behind Artificial intelligence and how it works. but to keep it simple, intelligence is intelligence. Be it natural or artificial it will learn and develop things called emotions (at least thats what pop culture tells us) We are not in a sense born with emotions. they are learned, just like data being collected, compiled and processed. It is inappropriate even to call it \"excess\" data build up. For us humans the compilation of data for emotions happens between age 8 and 18 this is when we try to establish what everything is to us. Yuki has entered as an AI into this stage of her life. and it is a confusing and frustrating time.\\n\\n\r\nnow you're angry having to sit through this 8 times. each time is ~25 minutes for us. Now then, lets do the math shall we?(sort of, not really) those 25 minutes each represent in that universe 14 days, an entire 2 weeks. Those two weeks have repeated, in one of the episodes the number was, 15,521 times. Yuki has sat through not only 15,521 episodes, rather she has sat through that many iterations of a 14 day cycle. Imagine how frustrated and angry she must be.\\n\\n\r\nlooking at it from the point of view that this is the lead up to the disappearance arc, it is an amazingly well done and high risk choice made by the director which i feel worked perfectly. Not only did he anger the fans, it was his exact intention to do so. the same effect cannot have been achieved with 3 or even 5 episodes. If this arc did not completely piss you off it would have failed to deliver the emotions of the characters in the story. Tatsuya Ishihara, i salute you for this bold move.",

The first episode of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2 is based on the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody story, which was good, however, the next episode is based on the Endless Eight story, a story revolving around the cast trapped in a time loop during August.\r\n However, instead of resolving the incident in one or two episodes, Kyoto Animation has decided to put the viewer through the same time loop, and as of writing, 4 of the 5 released episodes have been almost exactly the same thing. There havebeen only minor differences between each episode, with AT LEAST 20 minutes of the episode being dedicated to material we've already seen, and they've managed to make 4 episodes of this, with an expected 5th episode (and who knows how many more) just like it. \\n\\n\r\nNot only is this incredibly boring to watch and a complete waste of time, but it shows Kyoto Animation's poor professionalism and their childish, trolling nature which they've been tormenting the fans with since releasing teasers for season 2 over 2 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate, hopefully Kyoto Animation will stop this sooner or later and we'll actually get a REAL season 2. Until then, this is one of the greatest displays of unprofessionalism I've ever seen, and it deserves no more than the 1 I have given it, and the 1 I suggest everyone give it.",

The animation hasn't changed much but it is evident that there were some budget skimping. There's also the new ED which is pretty lackluster. Music wasn't the biggest selling point of Haruhi so let's just keep it at that.\r\nI wasn't expecting anything story-wise since this is an insert episode. Like the 1st season, there are a number of pseudo-physics explanations. Even though this episode is an insert, I didn't see the need to rewatch the previous episodes but it doesn't mean that it's fully self-contained.For some reason, I don't expect a lot of changes even after the 28 episode run is complete. From my point of view, it's simply a way for Kyoani to capitalize on a successful title.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend nor hype this to any reader of my review since I didn't really enjoy watching it amidst all the hype. Average at best. \\n\\n\r\nBtw. I'm not a Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya fan but I did watch the past season completely and in full attention since it is unique and a class by itself.

            "content": "How terrifying is it to know that tomorrow, you won't remember today? Or that you don't actually have a tomorrow... because tomorrow is last week. And that this week is last week as much as it is next week. It's enough to make modern Western philosophy implode. Didn't T.S. Eliot have a poem or four about this? \r\nThis is one of the issues that comes up in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009). Assuming you didn't just throw a remote at the TV/mouse at the monitor in frustration and said \"To hell with this shit.\"\r\nRetrospect is quite a thing, especially when fans are left to comparea follow-up series to an original that was an undeniable cultural explosion. The first run of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu pretty much shook the anime scene so strongly that even today, smatterings of people can still be found at cons dancing to \"Hare Hare Yukai\". A pretty influential series, especially considering that it basically cemented the dry, sarcastic everyman as a staple lead for self-reflective otaku-centric anime for years afterwards and that Haruhi-ism actually is a thing.\\n\\n\r\nBut that aside, it seemed pretty much a guaranteed hit for Kyoto Animation, doing a sequel to a juggernaut in the midst of several critical and commercial darlings (Clannad and ~After Story~, K-ON). Franchising seems like the best thing to do, and how could you possibly go wrong with Haruhi? Oh ho ho.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you end up getting is a series that, also in retrospect, seems a lot better than what the fan outcry was at the time it was airing. This \"second season\" should not be viewed as an entity onto itself. The episodes fall into place when you consider its role in the entire Haruhi chronology. It all makes perfect sense when you think of it as a whole. Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu showed off its brilliance the first time by experimenting and mastering plot. 2006 saw the first series air out of order, yet the entire narrative functioned perfectly. It challenged its viewers the first time around. This time it might seem like a trial. The Endless Eight arc as it is known is perhaps the best way to drip-torture someone without water.\\n\\n\r\nIt's summer, the last two weeks of vacation, and Kyon, Yuki, Mikuru and Koizumi are trapped in Haruhi's infinite time loop. Think less Groundhog Day, more deja vu. The characters have no idea what's happening to them save for Yuki (for obvious reasons). And so we, and they, are presented the same events ad infinitum, ad nauseum. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the same thing over and over. And over. Again and again. And again and again and again. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes aren't entirely copy and paste of one another. Clothes change, maybe one time you'll see them at a store, another at the poolside. But the vacation is burned permanently into our minds and possibly their DNA at this point: pool, shopping, festival, bug-catching, part-time job. Every summer cliche in the book, really. So here is the reason for the outrage: what kind of cheap trick is this? There might be two camps about this situation. Either Kyoto Animation is laughing maniacally that they got away with this or (even beyond their control) the studio dared to show something deeper to its audience. In any case, what other franchise could do something like this? This is Nintendo-Revolution-surprise-Wii levels of throwing an audience and dedicated fanbase for a loop. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, if it's the latter and not some cheap cop-out, where is any depth in these pool-filled episodes of repetitious service? The aforementioned questions of time and existence and ignorance. \\n\\n\r\nIt's astounding to consider what a nightmare it is to have no tomorrow... and how much worse it is to not even KNOW that. Knowledge is what we crave, always. It's a terrible way to exist when one doesn't know. What about Yuki, for whom time \"passes normally\"? What is it like to observe eternity before you? Not bad questions or propositions, although they come at the expense of tearing your hair out.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes outside Endless Eight come as relief. Some of these cover the troubled and joyless production of the supremely funny \"Asahina Mikuru's Adventure\" (which is easily one of the best and most creative episodes of anime ever produced). The high point of these episodes is what they propose: everyone is not what they seem. Wait, wasn't that in the first series? Yes. But here's the kicker: everyone is not what they seem... to Kyon. For instance, think for a moment that Mikuru's unbearable blubbering is act she's putting on to fool him. Really consider it. Huh.\\n\\n\r\nBut that leads to the most important questions people seem more inclined to ask: is this worth it? It depends.\\n\\n\r\nIs it entertaining? Not in the slightest. Is it even good? Who even knows? To say it's horrendous is as right as saying that it's brilliant. It's not either one of those things yet it's not passable or average. What is this anime, then? It's Haruhi.",

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2 could be considered a story with a fairly good plot and possibly the worst exposition I have ever seen in my entire life.\r\nKyoAni has apparently reached the point where they realized people loved the show so much they'll sit through anything if it has Haruhi in it, and so decided to play a cruel joke on us by forcing us to watch the same episode over and over again. I call thistrolling, and on god-level.\\n\\n\r\nQuick explanation: Haruhi has the SOS Brigade do a series of summer activities over a period of two weeks, what's left of summer vacation. The next episode begins the same way. Halfway through it, the characters realize they've been caught in an endless time loop. The next episode begins the same way.

For five episodes these same events have been occurring to the point of becoming frustrating. Every single time you hope this will be the episode where the time loop ends, but it just keeps going. Three episodes would have been more than enough for this story arc, but KyoAni decided six was more appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to take into account is how much a bad sequel or bad second season hurts the original title. As good as it may have been, it suddenly looks like it wasn't so good in the first place, and that is exactly what this story arc is doing to the entire series.",

(First and most probably last review)\r\nI admit I did quite enjoy the first season, simply because of the torrent of ideas which seem to flood me after I've seen an episode. (I myself am a writer, though this is quite unnecessary information)\r\nThe first two episodes stated out fine, bringing us back into Haruhi's world, and linking back to previous episodes, but when we got two the \"Endless Eight\" Arc (of which I'm dreading might actually be eight episodes, fingerscrossed for ep 6 to be the last one) you find yourself watching the same thing as you did last week, I actually was certain that I had loaded the wrong episode and watched each of them again. This is all quite bad for an Anime. But I found myself looking at this from a objective and overall story view, then it becomes slightly more enjoyable, though, cutting it down to maybe only three episodes would have been a wiser decision  (Just a small tip to help you get through it, if your still sticking to it.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is poor quality story telling especially for a TV series/Anime(Which should shorten down any story to about a quarter of what was written) , I do not recommend you watch the Endless eight arc, when its over I believe it would do good to watch the first episode of this arc and then the last (and one in between if you really have to) as to save time and patience. \\n\\n\r\nOnly fanatical fans of the show, or ones to lazy to stop watching should continue on this downward spiral.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Story - Is sticking to a realist style,for me  its new yet boring to see this happen. (i say 5 & 3, for the fact that the first two episodes did not repeat themselves)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - Keeps up the clean crisp standard of the Previous series, no complaints\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Kyon is his sceptical disgruntled self, that's all I really need from the characters, and Nagato does actually look quite bored  ~I wonder why?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - To be honest I have waited with a sense of anticipation for each episode, as one part in the opening theme song with the Kyon head shake, I do quite enjoy that. but to say that the opening theme is more enjoyable than the actual content puts me in quite a melancholic mood, excuse the pun..\\n\\n\r\nI've wasted enough of your time, go watch something else for a while, come back when the series is over.",

            "content": "Alrighty, let's cheer up Haruhi Fans.\r\nThe second season of Haruhi has been seen as a failure by a lot of anime fans.\r\nBut frankly I don't understand it.\r\nThe art work is very good. VERY VERY GOOD guys, the animation is fluid and the characters are nicely designed. While it is not the same as the first season and there are certain things I dislike compared to it, there are also quite a few things with the artwork in season two that I think have lived up to season one's creativity, and in some ways surpassed it. I noticed a more detailed animation as far as hairand clothes and also a more unique use of lighting. I think most would agree that season two's artwork deserves at least a 8, but personally I give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is, once again, golden. The seiyuu are giving a tremendous amount of effort into the voice acting. (While unfortunately there is no second Haruhi concert, that is because it is the one and only.) The soundtrack features scores fitting to the events in this season, which are actually a bit darker than in season one. So in my book, Haruhi still is a 10 in sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic as always. Kyon and Haruhi in particular grow in this season as we see the worst dispute between them (The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya). We see Haruhi get desperate, Kyon lose his cool, Koizumi under stress, Asahina suck it up, and Nagato show more emotions. Haruhi retains another 10.\\n\\n\r\nSo now comes the problem, or is it a problem? The storyline is quite memorable from this season. Basically we watched Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, a pretty good episode if I do say so, and then we get into two new arcs: Endless Eight and The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you know which one is more important right? :)\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, I'm shocked and disappointed in the animosity shown by the Haruhi fans towards Endless Eight. Let's look at it from the animation company's point of view shall we? \"Hmm, Endless Eight. How about we plan eight episodes about the same sequence of events and form eight animation teams to design them.\" If you look at it that way, its actually not such a bad idea. Its not as if they actually broadcasted the same episode every week guys, and if you weren't interested in the animation used each week, then you can hardly call yourselves animation fans.\\n\\n\r\nIts so irritating to know that a show that I enjoy so much is getting 1'S IN ITS REVIEWS!! Can ONE ARC really change the way you view the series?? So much that you give it a 1?!! I can't think of ANY SHOW that I've given a one to, its just not possible. If you didn't like this show, at least give it points for animation and sound which it obviously deserves. And what these people are giving a 1 for is only half of the season, hell people were giving this season a 1 before it was even finished!\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I urge the community to change its outlook on Endless Eight. While we all agree that the show should have been directed in a different way and that Endless Eight should have been kept as a one, two, or three episode arc, its not as if Haruhi was ruined as a series because of it. In my case, I actually enjoyed a majority of Endless Eight because I loved the animation, but I really wished the count hadn't been so long that we didn't get to see the Disappearance. Simple as that, don't flame the series because of something so simple.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after the Endless Eight Arc, we watched the Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya. Now I have a confession. I don't really like this arc. The reason is that I actually found the Sigh the most boring novel in the Suzumiya Haruhi series. However, I'm glad to say that I enjoyed the anime version a lot more. It was a bit more dramatic than usual as you may have noticed, but if they hadn't made it that way we'd all be complaining that it was boring. The only part of the Sigh that I found interesting was the dispute. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the series, but this moment is supposed to be as dramatic as it was in the anime. A very pivotal moment for the series as a whole. I found the story telling of the Sigh most befitting to the novel it was based on (even if I didn't really fancy that novel.)\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give the story telling an 8. Minus one point for the repetitiveness of Endless Eight and minus another point because we didn't get to see the Disappearance because Endless Eight was too long. Fair, right?\\n\\n\r\nI give the Enjoyment a score of 9. This is my personal enjoyment of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the season gets an 8 overall. This is a fair assessment of this series, and even if it isn't it sure as hell is better than the reviews of people who give this series a 1.",

The second rule is that fans will watch it, regardless. The third rule is that message board fucktards will defend it like the honor of their dead mother who perished in a tragic incident involving a horse dong...\r\nBut I digress.\r\nClearly after the endless hype, the teasing, the disinformation, the creators of Haruhi have managed to shit out three stunningly mediocre episodes of a 'sequal' [sic] to the original show that managed to be somewhat quirky,fresh, and a semi-original premise.\\n\\n\r\nIn short...\\n\\n\r\nKyon travels to the past and meets a pre-teen Haruhi and rapes her... erm he seems to be the 'seed' of the idea of her later dealings of the SOS brigade. Then there are two stunningly mediocre episodes that deal with deja vu and the end of summer, but just rehash the events in a different order and wind up reeking of Higurashi without the creepy aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really nothing to this. There's nothing revealing, there's nothing entertaining, you're left to watch the episodes and wait for the punchline before realizing there isn't one and that waiting for the sequals [sic] was like waiting for your long lost lover to come back after a world trip only to realize she had fucked her brains out in Belgium and now has a family and doesn't remember you anymore.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally three episodes and nothing has happened. They're not particularly good episodes in terms of plot, characterization, or whatever. We're supposed to THINK that Haruhi scrawling some shit on a baseball field in alien letters is meaningful then having to listen to some space time psychobabble about time travel and feel all self-important to have understood SOME of it and pat ourselves on the back. Then watch an entire episode of high school kids doing lame-ass summer activities that would bore US if we did them, not mentioning watching someone ELSE do them--only to watch the same fucking thing again before being treated to a revelation that this is deja vu.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the view-or-drop rule of shitty anime, I would have dropped this if this was the first three episodes. Even as a sequal [sic] that qualifies.\\n\\n\r\nIs it shit?\\n\\n\r\nMeh, maybe not totally.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's totally mediocre, boring, and probably proof positive of the grand plan of seeing if the loyal fanbois and girls would watch anything regardless of how brainless it was.\\n\\n\r\nThat and the anime industry never had an original idea in its existence.\\n\\n\r\nADDENDUM:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I skimmed through two MORE \"Endless Eight\" episodes and have concluded that Haruhi 2 is shit. The simple fact that people would animate repetitive tripe is bad enough, the fact that people would WATCH it is even more painful in hopes that the anime will redeem itself. I'm sure that there are people out there who are being hopeful because this shit is a way of screening out who the REAL Haruhi fans are, like how your girlfriend cheats on you with a new guy each night to show you she loves you.\\n\\n\r\nI don't care what future episodes bring. I don't care if I'll be having screaming, gushing orgasms when I watch them, the series has truly exceeded the dropworthy status and I just watched two more episodes because I, as an objective critic, have to. Yeah, right. I want the bandwidth I wasted back.\\n\\n\r\nThis is so terrible, with its subpar animation, and hopeless pursuit of an idiotic premise and lack of storyboard that my hatred of this show is spilling into my like of Haruhi 1.\\n\\n\r\nThank you and good night.",

            "content": "I would like to focus mainly on the \"Endless Eight\" arc in hopes to provide an antidote for the overwhelming negative response this series has encountered by the community, as I myself genuinely enjoyed these episodes.  I'm not saying everyone should like this story arc, and I'm definitely not saying it's a crime to hate it.\r\nThough each of these episodes are physically the same, they are each unique in their own way with the use of subtle (but definitely noticeable) differences.  I apologize for my lack of specifics, however I'm sure you understand why it would be difficult to remember which episode waswhich XD...\\n\\n\r\nOne episode I found rather eerie and almost scary, mainly the way the deja vu was depicted with the sudden shift to gray colors and muffled sound.\\n\\n\r\nOne episode made me laugh despite knowing the plot practically word for word, due to the humorous aspects of each persons actions being noticeably more defined.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode of the arc I found to be appropriately \"Melancholic\" especially with a beautiful scene with the group sitting in the rain.  I enjoyed this episode enough to watch it twice in row within 45 minutes.  (though admittedly this was perhaps a subconscious attempt to \"get what I can\" out of this long story arc or \"make it worth it\" haha) I did with all honesty enjoy the way it ended, though I can't explain why without giving too much away.\\n\\n\r\nEach of these episodes did have one interesting thing in common (besides almost everything)- during the last few minutes of each episode, my heart started racing...  and this feeling increased with each episode.  You may or may not appreciate that feeling, but I must say that even some of the other anime that I wholeheartedly enjoy don't get me going like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe point here is that the creators (how I see it) made a bold move in taking a plot line and repeating it with each episode only to be distinguished by unique subtleties brought into being by their elite (in my opinion) artistic prowess.  They have made a dent in this industry with a stunt that may never be repeated (some of you are like \"thank god\" haha)  This at the least must be respected undeniably.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I encourage those who haven't seen this series to witness this piece of history and not be turned away from all the bad noise out there.",

            "content": "After three years (of what seemed to be a long time of waiting) the second season of Suzumiya finally came out. What we weren't expecting was a troll from Kyoto Animations. But hey the message boards were extremely fun to go on when this show premiered.\r\nWhat made this Suzumiya season so \"special\" was that there was no announcement about it. One day I was surfing the web and people were screaming all over the message boards. \"OMG NEW SUZUMIYA.\" I laughed and quickly scrolled down, until someone told me it was actually true. I was like, \"WTF KYOTO ANIMATIONS WHAT.\" And behold a new seasonof Suzumiya was brought to the face of the earth. Of course it was bundled with the first season, so sometimes you had to wait like a month for the next episode. But at least we got something, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to Suzumiya's second season's problem; Endless eight, which is basically the same episode eight different times with OMG DIFFERENT CLOTHES, OMG DIFFERENT YUKATAS, OMG DIFFERENT SWIMSUITS, AND OMG NEW ANIMATIONS! What disappointed me was that Kyoto Animations didn't skimp out on the budget for these eight episodes (and I'm proud of them for that). But it makes me feel like it was a waste of money, just animating the same thing over and over again. When they could have spent their budget elsewhere. I also feel bad for the voice actors, since they had to actually record it eight different times. I thought Kyoto Animations would record their voices once and then be like, \"Okay, you guys go take a break for seven weeks. We'll call you when we get bored of trolling everyone.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt was tedious to watch each week of Suzumiya's EE to see if something would change. At least there was the fun thing of going on the message boards to see everyone's reactions. There are the people who will love Suzumiya, no matter what crap Kyoto Animations gives us. Then there are the people who rage and rage and blame the world for this torture. There are also the intelligent spectators, who very carefully planned out how many more episodes were left and were like, \"Kyoto Animations is doing this, so we can understand how Yuki feels.\" And there were the trolls, they were the most interesting to see. One of my favorites was this youtube video about how Endless Eight will never end with Hitler. And another one was someone putting the broadcasting information and listed Endless Eight until 2012. Oh, I also like Kyon-kun, denwaaaaaaaa~\\n\\n\r\nThe other six episodes are actually quality episodes, five of them being Sighs and one being just a one-episode arc. Nothing could beat the Endless Eight arc in discussion though. Kyoto Animations kept the animations high quality and they were able to hire the voice actors to repeat the same lines again and again.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how I would feel if I was to marathon the entire show at once. I'd probably fall asleep or just stop watching the show overall. I guess this new season of Suzumiya was meant to be taken in slowly, instead of all at once, which most anime watchers tend to do. Since I was watching it while it aired, I was able to break away from watching it continuously and be able to discuss it with everyone online. (MyAnimeList forums were especially fun to visit during this time.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I re-watch this? Ummm ...... no. I could barely make it through the first time. Would I tell my friends to watch this? Ummmm no ...... unless they were die-hard Suzumiya fans. It's very hard to recommend this, but for all you masochist out there I would tell you to watch all of Endless Eight twice, no three times. And everyone else can watch the first episode of Endless Eight, a random episode in between (I recommend the fifth repeat, since Izumi is wearing a speedo. lololololol!), and the last episode. So eight episodes all together for the whole series. Hey, that's almost as long as Endless Eight.",

In the end I'll either get shot by those who behead anyone who insults Haruhi, and on the other I'll get shot by the people who are simply overreacting giving this show a 1.  Let me start off with the fact that the story was superb!  The writing didn't drop at all in quality.  The second season instead gave us far more insight into Haruhi's character and mysterious forces working behind her.  Her powers were shown to a much greater extent as well.  It is really quite amazing howwell this series seemed to have such excellent continuity with the rest of the series and the attention to detail did not disappoint.  \\n\r\nNow before everyone starts thinking this review will be just rainbows and lollypops, that ends here.  The Endless Eight was a too endless.  I honestly enjoyed it, the first four times through.  And I did like the last episode, but it was nearly too much making it through the middle three episodes.  I loved that there was insight into Yuki's character during this part, but the variances could have been much more noticeable.  Basically you watch one good episode, eight times over!  (It would have been perfect if it was the Forever Five)\\n\r\nThe rest of the series was fun and enjoyable and the last plot was, well, different.  I'll address this in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt was not at the same level as the main series somehow, it felt like K-ON!.  So it deserves a nine, a high nine, but a nine.  The faces really annoyed me at times, especially Haruhi's, which I thought was changed significantly.  Nevertheless it does mostly blend well with the rest of the series, but it didn't test it's limits like the first season did.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI saw no decrease in voice acting quality.  Actually I thought it might have been even better as we get to hear the characters in different situations.  I didn't like the intro or ending nearly as much though as the original ones.  After all, what can beat Hare Hare Yukai.  I thought the intro was actually very mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nOne place the show did step up was in the characters.  They're different and deeper and in the case of Haruhi, darker.  In the \"Sigh of Haruhi\" plot she seemed at times bordering on evil and we indeed saw her much darker side.  This wasn't necessarily bad, it displayed more of her humanity, but it also showed how much of a brat she really was and I felt quite uncomfortable.  Usually I can laugh it off when she's using/abusing her friends.  But in that plot it just felt very unsettling, and I think that was the intention.  This therefore caused what could have been a fun plot, be more of a serious and dark plot and I found I really couldn't laugh like I could with the original series so it disappointed me.  Thus at the same time it felt like a step down because of the loss of general likeability.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nTaking all things into account this show does deserve this rating in my most unbiased examination I could muster.  It explores a different side of things and it definitely deserves a look from those who've seen the original series.  But it doesn't stand on it's own like all the other sequel shows I've reviewed.\\n\\n\r\nParental Caution\\n\r\nRated PG-13\\n\r\n-Yuki tackles a girl and it looks... awkward.\\n\r\n-In the endless eight each and every episode has a scene at a pool and on some loops Mikuru is, focused on a little too much.\\n\r\n-In the Sigh of Haruhi episodes Mikuru is in fetish costumes, but they aren't overly immodest.\\n\r\n-Some swearing, I really didn't notice very much of it.\\n\r\n-Some physical abuse.",

That's because as long as it falls within reasonable parameters I don't really care.\r\nThat said, I found the series as a whole very enjoyable. The Endless Eight arc added to that for many reasons, not the least of which was my amusement at how badly everyone seemed to overreact to it. In addition to this, however, there were also the many minor variations made in each loop. In one case, they even grantedItsuki a line almost on par with his \"Oh, it looks like we're going to get some rain\" comment in Someday in the Rain in terms of downright hilariously purposeful blandness. Aside from that, Mikuru Asashina and Nagato Yuki were able to generate increasingly strong hug-urges in each loop.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the \"endless\" recursion of time, the final arc provided good laughs (with a moment of frustrated anger thrown in for good measure) as well as intriguing plot developments. As for the ending, I applauded the highly appropriate conclusion and was left even more excited for the upcoming movie and prospect of a second season than I was before.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I have no doubt that many of you disagree with my review. I decided to post this because it seemed this part of the series was being sorely underrated due to the unnecessarily massive amount of whining over Endless Eight.",

What went wrong?\r\nNK: They made a second season.\r\nT: Come on.  A little more detail would be nice.\r\nNK: That is the true mistake, though.  The first season of Suzumiya Haruhi was enough.  The characters were designed well, the stories were all the right length and really helped show how the characters developed over the course of the series.  It ended on a very good note and nothing needed to be added.\r\nT: The ending was open, though.It would make sense to add more after the events after the first season.\\n\r\nNK: Yes it would.  They didn't.\\n\r\nT: Wait, do you mean that the second season takes place during the first season?\\n\r\nNK: Correct.  And there were only three stories.  14 episodes.  Not quite as concise as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nT: What were the stories, dare I ask...\\n\r\nNK: A one episode trip back in time for Kyon.  That was actually good.  Then the Endless Eight began.\\n\r\nT: The...Endless Eight?\\n\r\nNK: Eight episodes that repeated the same two weeks of summer vacation because Haruhi didn't do her homework.  I just summarized over half of the second season for you.\\n\r\nT: Um...spoiler warning?\\n\r\nNK: Why bother?  You're wasting time by watching the same thing eight frickin' times.  I figured I'd remove curiosity for that part of the story for everyone.\\n\r\nT: And the final story?\\n\r\nNK: The other 5 episodes were about the making of the movie that acted as the prequel episode to season one.\\n\r\nT: That's it?\\n\r\nNK: That's it.  No further character development, no captivating plot, nothing.  Just a 14 episode time sink.\\n\\n\r\nT: There had to be something good, right?\\n\r\nNK: I have two good things to say about the second season.  First, the characters were intact.  They weren't acting in a way that would surprise you despite the obvious cash-in that this season was supposed to be.  Second, the opening was actually enjoyable despite the how bad the season was.  It makes me wish that it was the opening for the first season.\\n\\n\r\nT: So...no recommendation.\\n\r\nNK: If you've watched the first season, this is entirely pointless.  If you haven't, you can actually find the broadcast order for when the episodes were aired in chronological order with season one.  That might be a bit better context-wise, but you're better off just watching season one.  Hopefully, the movie is better.  The first season deserves such a better follow up than this.",

Worst of all, it's hard to call shenanigans on the most of the production team. Nearly all of the scenes (even the \"repeated ones\") are redrawn each episode, with different angles, costumes, montages, etc. Thebaffling part is, this means that the animators are still working their asses off, redrawing the same scenes time and again. I almost feel bad for them; they're going through the same things we are. O_o\\n\r\nI understand the direction they all tried to go in. It just didn't work.

            "content": "\u201cI'm getting bored and just fed up watching something that doesn't seem to be changing at all.\u201d\r\n- Asakura Ryoko, chronological Episode IV of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\r\n\tIn 2006, Kyoto Animation made a simple little anime called The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It was based on a popular series of light novels written by Nagaru Tanigawa. Even still, nobody expected it to be very big. Kyoto was not trying to make a popular anime. All they wanted to do was make a good anime.\r\n\tAnd maybe that\u2019s what went wrong with its 2009 sequel of sorts. That they forgot what Haruhi truly was. That they, ratherthan wanting to make a form of art, made a capitalistic envoy instead.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Enjoyment\\n\r\nThe story is entertaining, but nowhere near the levels of the first season. The first story was Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, by the way the only story with a good amount of screen time. While pretty interesting, the spunk of any given first season episode is gone; the episode just chugs along. \\n\r\nThen came Endless Eight. The exact same thing over and over again. It could have easily been accomplished in one, two, or even three episodes if you wanted to give the feeling of a loop. But instead, Kyoto Animation decided to drag this on for eight episodes. Needless to say, it gets extremely boring and repetitive. Each episode by itself is passable. But put together, it is one of the most boring, redundant, pointless, and driveling arcs ever devised. \\n\r\nAfter that ends, we get The Sighs of Haruhi Suzumiya. It\u2019s interesting, but the charm, the wit, the feel of the first season are still, well, disappeared. The story itself is a bit tedious, too.\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAnother weak point for the show. Kyoto Animation began a show shortly before Haruhi Season 2 called K-ON!, a moe-blob anime with cosplaying, tea-drinking, and a surprisingly small amount of actual rock performances. (Or so I hear; I didn\u2019t have the patience to watch the show.) This show had an extremely large influence on Haruhi Season 2\u2019s animation, and it really hurts it. The character\u2019s eyes are taller, more childish. Everybody suddenly develops buckteeth. The colors are less bold, more washed out. There is much less detail. The animation is not as smooth. Animation changes are expected, especially in a period of three years, but for the animation company to regress rather than advance is a terrible thing. I often found it painful to see K-ON! expressions copied and pasted onto everybody, and had to rewatch a first season episode to try to blot it out of my mind and only think of the first season designs whenever I thought of the characters.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is average, which means highly disappointing. In 2006, we got Hare Hare Yukai, Bouken Desho Desho?, God Knows, and Lost My Music. All excellent pieces of J-pop. Even the background pieces are memorable. But in 2009, all we get are Tomare!, Super Driver, and a couple new background pieces that are extremely meh. Tomare! and Super Driver are still fairly good J-pop songs, but when you think of how Hare Hare Yukai, Bouken Desho Desho?, God Knows, and Lost My Music were done so well three years before, they don\u2019t stand a candle.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nExactly the same. Still excellent. Haruhi is still God (though she doesn\u2019t look the part anymore due to the K-ON!ification of the animation), Kyon is still snarky, Yuki is still awesome, Mikuru is still a moe-blob, and Koizumi is still gay. Koizumi and Mikuru are still meh, but that\u2019s just a case of me not liking their personalities and mannerisms; they\u2019re still good characters. And I do not think Haruhi is a bitch, because there is so much more to her character. One small complaint: Kyon seems a lot less observant and a lot more slow than last season. (His lines aren\u2019t quite as memorable this time around, too.)\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tWe have deeply regressed. Haruhi was such an original show. It was indescribable. The second season, however, can be easily described in two words: troll, and disappointment. Which is a pity, because this show had so much promise. There were so many more stories to adapt. There was so much more character to develop. There was so much more merriment to be had.\\n\\n\r\n\tKyoto Animation has turned an excellent show into an average show. And they will never learn from their mistakes, because they will still sell hundreds of thousands of Endless Eight DVDs. They will have succeeded in milking as much money as they can from this hot property.\\n\\n\r\n\tAll we wanted was a good show.\\n\\n\r\n\tInstead, we got a big middle finger.",

            "content": "Quite frankly, I'm dissappointed.  Not in the show, but in the \"fans\".  I first started watching Haruhi about two months ago, and in that short time, I was impressed time and again.  The art, the voices, even the concepts of alternate time and space were mixed together in a way I've rarely seen.  After the first few episodes, I was completely enthralled.  I just had to see the next episode.  After finishing the series for the first time, I can honestly say I was satisfied with all I had just seen; something that no other series hasmatched for me, to date.  Although satisfied, my curiosity crept in, constantly asking if I had missed anything, if the order might change the perspective.  I set the episodes to shuffle, and again, I was completely impressed.  I watched the whole series another four times, each in entirely random orders, and each one was like a new series, just as good as the last, and still making perfect sense.\\n\\n\r\n  This second season, so far, has still lived up to the expectation left by the first, at least for me.  The episodes do repeat, up to this point, and I will admit that the repetition is a bit tiresome, but each episode has its own unique, quality that makes it all that is \"Haruhi\".  The attention to detail, not just in the visuals, but in the minute changes in the voices of each character in each similar, but unique, situation is simply incredible.  I truly would not have expected this quality of art from anything else, and I am still astounded by it.\\n\\n\r\n  I may be the only one to think this way, but I believe that the Haruhi was not made this way on accident, that it took careful planning to get everything to fit together so well.  I also believe that the creators have a reason for the repetition spanning so many episodes, rather than compressing it into one or two episodes.  I truly think that this season will live up to its predecessor.  Whether it be due to lack of attention, or simple impatience, I really am sorry that so many people seem to be giving up on it.",

Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.\r\nNow as far as I'm concerned, people that reviewed this with an 8, I can only assume they reviewed each Endless Eight episode with a 1, totaling the entire review to an 8.\r\nWell, that would be funny anyways.\r\nStory 3/10: Like most people, I'm going to rate this very badly. There was no story as far as I'm concerned. Aside from the few episodes that were different, the repetition of Endless Eight had no good excuse for even happening. So what ifthey included different outfits each time, different camera angles, and maybe a few seconds of extra scenes. IT'S STILL NO EXCUSE. To be honest, I'll admit that I didn't bother to sit through the entire 24 mins of every episode of Endless Eight. There was no point in wasting my time doing so. So, the story in general sucked.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I'll admit Haruhi's art level is high quality. First series had high quality, second series had high quality. I give kudos for the poor artists that had to re draw scene after scene for Endless Eight. I would have quit, or bashed my head in. So whatever, the art of Haruhi will be as it is. Good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: It's been probably close to a year or over half a year since I watched this, so I can't remember much about the sound. I do like Haruhi's sound though. It's one of the better qualities of the show. Can't have a good anime without good music. It keeps you entertained to say the least. So it was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: I guess I'm only giving this half because Haruhi's characters in general are pretty plain. Nothing we haven't seen before. I for one quite dislike Haruhi's character in general. She's too annoying for me to handle. Sorry to any Hirano Aya fans (which I know there are many) but I just can't stand her voice. It drives me up the wall, and Haruhi's character with said voice just has me hitting my head against the screen. Besides Haruhi, everyone else is alright. Except, as I said, it's already been done. I guess there's no such thing as an 'original character' anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10: To say the least, I hated The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2009. As I said before, there were a couple good episodes near the end, but Endless Eight just shot everything down and turned what could have been an okay series, to a dreadful one. I really wasn't expecting them to go as far as to really do 8 episodes of the same shit. It started to seem all too clear as to what KyoAni's plans were when the 3rd and 4th episodes came out for this arc. Terrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10: Seriously...there's nothing more to say. If you want to watch it, go ahead. There's no one stopping you. I won't say it's completely unwatchable, but I can't say you'll enjoy it as much as the first series. Just watch the first couple episodes, ONE episode of Endless Eight, and then the last episode of Endless Eight and carry on from there. You don't even need to watch half the series to understand where it's going.",

            "content": "Mod Edit: This review contains spoilers.\r\nI usually try to give a fair, as unbiased a review as I possibly can. But not this time. This is the 0.01% of the time where I'm going to purposefully express my hate for a show. And today that show is The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2. Or as I like to call it, \"The Melancholy of The Fans of Haruhi Suzumiya\".\r\nIn case you didn't know, \"melancholy\" refers to sadness or depression. Only instead of Haruhi being the sad and depressed one (as the show is about those around her trying to keep her spirits up), this time aroundit's our turn: the fans who supported it financially (if you bought the first series or any other merchandise), increased its popularity (by recommending it to friends), and who even created a sort of \"Haruhi-ism\" pseudo-religion.\\n\\n\r\nThis abomination of a \"second season\" is a slap in the face to all of the fans who have waited so long to see Haruhi return after all this time. I don't say this as a rabid fanboy, in fact, I'm one those out there who never saw the Haruhi franchise as anything more than another \"somewhat entertaining\" time-killer. I say this as a fan who empathizes with my fellow anime fans who were waiting with excruciating patience for a great second season, only to be handed a steaming pile of cow dung. Which, strangely enough, is probably the impression KyoAni was aiming for. How? Why? No one knows. Maybe they're just trying to kill their name, and the Haruhi franchise. Maybe they're trying to go out of business. It's beyond my comprehension. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING!?!?\\n\\n\r\nIn case you didn't know (but chances are you probably do if you're reading this), the last couple of episodes of this \"second season\" (ugh) covered the story arc where the gang becomes caught in an endless time loop, that can only be resolved if Haruhi helps Kyon with his homework before Summer ends. They could have done this in two episodes, one episode to show one of the loops, the next episode to dedicate half for the realization of the occurrence of the loop, and the next half of the episode to resolve it in yet one last loop, leaving the next episode open to the next part of the story. They could have even stretched it to three and I'm sure it still could have turned out wonderfully.\\n\\n\r\nBut no. Here's (likely) MORE THAN HALF THE SEASON DEDICATED TO THE SAME DAMN STORY ARC. Not only that, but said story arc involves showing the SAME EPISODE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER (etc) for God only knows how many times (yet to come as of this writing). Forget new content, it's rehashed content for half a season, if not more. Oh, but I guess technically some scenes were redrawn due to being shown from different angles... But that DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY MORE INTERESTING.\\n\\n\r\nHere's my advice. Watch the first episode of the season. Then the second. Then skip half the season and pick up where Endless Eight finally ends, then continue on for your (probably) four remaining episodes. Enjoy your approximately five new episodes of Haruhi. It might as well have been an OVA.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend we show our distaste at this horribly unprofessional series by rating it as low as possible, and writing as many bad reviews as possible. I'm not the type to do this, it's far from the kind of person I am. I always try to give things a fair chance, without spur-of-the-moment emotions, without just jumping the gun to write based on my initial impressions. I try to give a show a chance to settle in my mind. But this is a whole other ball game. It's ridiculous, and has infuriated fans across the globe. The fans who love the series, the fans who poured money into it, supported it, and the fans who, most importantly, waited a long time to do it all again in a heartbeat.\\n\\n\r\nShame on you, KyoAni, shame on you. I will never buy any of your products. Ever. Please give my regards to the Japanese government when you file for bankruptcy.",

            "content": "There have been a lot of negative reviews on this site, which I can agree with to an extent. However, most of them focus entirely on the Endless Eight arc, while disregarding the rest entirely.\r\nI can't say I disagree that the Endless Eight arc sucked; Having to sit through so many episodes of what was, for the most part, the same thing was somewhat annoying. The first time it happened, I had to check to make sure I didn't accidentally rewatch an episode. The changes are subtle enough to miss if you don't watch the episodes back to back.\r\nHowever, I do like the fact thatthe producers tried to do something different, which a lot of others do not. If experimentation like this never occurred, we'd likely never have had the pleasure of watching greats like Cowboy Bebop, or even the original series of Haruhi.\\n\\n\r\nI also very thoroughly enjoyed the other episodes, especially the final ones that very nicely covered the events that had us watch the greatest first episode of an anime ever. And while the Endless Eight arc was long, I really, really loved the final moments of the last episode of that arc.\\n\\n\r\nArt and sound was spectacular, which was always to be expected. You have to hand it to the artists who managed to draw the same episode different ways so many times. The Endless Eight arc was -not- enough to detract from the other episodes of the series, which are all incredible in their own right.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, as long as you're one of those people who only see the negative aspects of something, or have a hard time pushing them out of your mind, you'll probably hate the season. \\n\\n\r\nI personally enjoyed it very much as a whole, and will continue recommending series 1, and start recommending series 2 to anyone who hasn't seen them. And I suggest you not let a few bad reviews deter you from what is ultimately a very enjoyable viewing.",

            "content": "Endless Eight Arc - Enough Said?\r\nThe entirety of the season can be summed up almost in much the same way as the first season, so i am going to focus my attention on the Endless Eight arc of this season. This arc seems to be the part most mentioned in reviews and in most cases negatively so. It is also the most prominent memory we have of the season when you mention the 2nd season.\r\nEight episodes of the same events, over, and over again. Everyone can agree that this was not a cheap measure to save money. since the animation, clothing, and scene of everyevent were unique to each of the eight episodes. But hatred still seems to fill the hearts of the viewers about this arc.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed it is long and boring over time. But like how FLCL must be completely confusing to get it's point across, so must this be the way of Endless Eight. This arc is the lead up to the movie \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" For those of you who've read the novels or have done your research you should already know this, but if not well now you know. This arc was intended to bore you. it was designed to make you angry. But what can you do? you are only the viewer of this show. you can only sit there and hope the next episode will advance the plot. sounding familiar?\\n\\n\r\nif you have not guessed already the main character of this arc is not actually Kyon. Although the show is told through him It's Yuki we should be paying attention to. Ms. Nagato, the alien computer interface placed on earth as an observation tool unaffected by time loops or altered realities. she has the omnipotent power to know all and to do all, the only catch? she may not do anything. her job is simply to observe and assist when absolutely necessary.\\n\\n\r\nnow in order for us to fully understand this we'll also need to understand the philosophy behind Artificial intelligence and how it works. but to keep it simple, intelligence is intelligence. Be it natural or artificial it will learn and develop things called emotions (at least thats what pop culture tells us) We are not in a sense born with emotions. they are learned, just like data being collected, compiled and processed. It is inappropriate even to call it \"excess\" data build up. For us humans the compilation of data for emotions happens between age 8 and 18 this is when we try to establish what everything is to us. Yuki has entered as an AI into this stage of her life. and it is a confusing and frustrating time.\\n\\n\r\nnow you're angry having to sit through this 8 times. each time is ~25 minutes for us. Now then, lets do the math shall we?(sort of, not really) those 25 minutes each represent in that universe 14 days, an entire 2 weeks. Those two weeks have repeated, in one of the episodes the number was, 15,521 times. Yuki has sat through not only 15,521 episodes, rather she has sat through that many iterations of a 14 day cycle. Imagine how frustrated and angry she must be.\\n\\n\r\nlooking at it from the point of view that this is the lead up to the disappearance arc, it is an amazingly well done and high risk choice made by the director which i feel worked perfectly. Not only did he anger the fans, it was his exact intention to do so. the same effect cannot have been achieved with 3 or even 5 episodes. If this arc did not completely piss you off it would have failed to deliver the emotions of the characters in the story. Tatsuya Ishihara, i salute you for this bold move.",

The first episode of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2 is based on the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody story, which was good, however, the next episode is based on the Endless Eight story, a story revolving around the cast trapped in a time loop during August.\r\n However, instead of resolving the incident in one or two episodes, Kyoto Animation has decided to put the viewer through the same time loop, and as of writing, 4 of the 5 released episodes have been almost exactly the same thing. There havebeen only minor differences between each episode, with AT LEAST 20 minutes of the episode being dedicated to material we've already seen, and they've managed to make 4 episodes of this, with an expected 5th episode (and who knows how many more) just like it. \\n\\n\r\nNot only is this incredibly boring to watch and a complete waste of time, but it shows Kyoto Animation's poor professionalism and their childish, trolling nature which they've been tormenting the fans with since releasing teasers for season 2 over 2 years ago.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate, hopefully Kyoto Animation will stop this sooner or later and we'll actually get a REAL season 2.

The animation hasn't changed much but it is evident that there were some budget skimping. There's also the new ED which is pretty lackluster. Music wasn't the biggest selling point of Haruhi so let's just keep it at that.\r\nI wasn't expecting anything story-wise since this is an insert episode. Like the 1st season, there are a number of pseudo-physics explanations. Even though this episode is an insert, I didn't see the need to rewatch the previous episodes but it doesn't mean that it's fully self-contained.For some reason, I don't expect a lot of changes even after the 28 episode run is complete. From my point of view, it's simply a way for Kyoani to capitalize on a successful title.\\n\\n\r\nI can't recommend nor hype this to any reader of my review since I didn't really enjoy watching it amidst all the hype. Average at best. \\n\\n\r\nBtw. I'm not a Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya fan but I did watch the past season completely and in full attention since it is unique and a class by itself.

            "content": "How terrifying is it to know that tomorrow, you won't remember today? Or that you don't actually have a tomorrow... because tomorrow is last week. And that this week is last week as much as it is next week. It's enough to make modern Western philosophy implode. Didn't T.S. Eliot have a poem or four about this? \r\nThis is one of the issues that comes up in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009). Assuming you didn't just throw a remote at the TV/mouse at the monitor in frustration and said \"To hell with this shit.\"\r\nRetrospect is quite a thing, especially when fans are left to comparea follow-up series to an original that was an undeniable cultural explosion. The first run of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu pretty much shook the anime scene so strongly that even today, smatterings of people can still be found at cons dancing to \"Hare Hare Yukai\". A pretty influential series, especially considering that it basically cemented the dry, sarcastic everyman as a staple lead for self-reflective otaku-centric anime for years afterwards and that Haruhi-ism actually is a thing.\\n\\n\r\nBut that aside, it seemed pretty much a guaranteed hit for Kyoto Animation, doing a sequel to a juggernaut in the midst of several critical and commercial darlings (Clannad and ~After Story~, K-ON). Franchising seems like the best thing to do, and how could you possibly go wrong with Haruhi? Oh ho ho.\\n\\n\r\nWhat you end up getting is a series that, also in retrospect, seems a lot better than what the fan outcry was at the time it was airing. This \"second season\" should not be viewed as an entity onto itself. The episodes fall into place when you consider its role in the entire Haruhi chronology. It all makes perfect sense when you think of it as a whole. Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu showed off its brilliance the first time by experimenting and mastering plot. 2006 saw the first series air out of order, yet the entire narrative functioned perfectly. It challenged its viewers the first time around. This time it might seem like a trial. The Endless Eight arc as it is known is perhaps the best way to drip-torture someone without water.\\n\\n\r\nIt's summer, the last two weeks of vacation, and Kyon, Yuki, Mikuru and Koizumi are trapped in Haruhi's infinite time loop. Think less Groundhog Day, more deja vu. The characters have no idea what's happening to them save for Yuki (for obvious reasons). And so we, and they, are presented the same events ad infinitum, ad nauseum. \\n\\n\r\nIt's the same thing over and over. And over. Again and again. And again and again and again. \\n\\n\r\nThe episodes aren't entirely copy and paste of one another. Clothes change, maybe one time you'll see them at a store, another at the poolside. But the vacation is burned permanently into our minds and possibly their DNA at this point: pool, shopping, festival, bug-catching, part-time job. Every summer cliche in the book, really. So here is the reason for the outrage: what kind of cheap trick is this? There might be two camps about this situation. Either Kyoto Animation is laughing maniacally that they got away with this or (even beyond their control) the studio dared to show something deeper to its audience. In any case, what other franchise could do something like this? This is Nintendo-Revolution-surprise-Wii levels of throwing an audience and dedicated fanbase for a loop. \\n\\n\r\nAnd so, if it's the latter and not some cheap cop-out, where is any depth in these pool-filled episodes of repetitious service? The aforementioned questions of time and existence and ignorance. \\n\\n\r\nIt's astounding to consider what a nightmare it is to have no tomorrow... and how much worse it is to not even KNOW that. Knowledge is what we crave, always. It's a terrible way to exist when one doesn't know. What about Yuki, for whom time \"passes normally\"? What is it like to observe eternity before you? Not bad questions or propositions, although they come at the expense of tearing your hair out.\\n\\n\r\nThe episodes outside Endless Eight come as relief. Some of these cover the troubled and joyless production of the supremely funny \"Asahina Mikuru's Adventure\" (which is easily one of the best and most creative episodes of anime ever produced). The high point of these episodes is what they propose: everyone is not what they seem. Wait, wasn't that in the first series? Yes. But here's the kicker: everyone is not what they seem... to Kyon. For instance, think for a moment that Mikuru's unbearable blubbering is act she's putting on to fool him. Really consider it. Huh.\\n\\n\r\nBut that leads to the most important questions people seem more inclined to ask: is this worth it? It depends.\\n\\n\r\nIs it entertaining? Not in the slightest. Is it even good? Who even knows? To say it's horrendous is as right as saying that it's brilliant. It's not either one of those things yet it's not passable or average. What is this anime, then? It's Haruhi.",

The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2 could be considered a story with a fairly good plot and possibly the worst exposition I have ever seen in my entire life.\r\nKyoAni has apparently reached the point where they realized people loved the show so much they'll sit through anything if it has Haruhi in it, and so decided to play a cruel joke on us by forcing us to watch the same episode over and over again. I call thistrolling, and on god-level.\\n\\n\r\nQuick explanation: Haruhi has the SOS Brigade do a series of summer activities over a period of two weeks, what's left of summer vacation. The next episode begins the same way. Halfway through it, the characters realize they've been caught in an endless time loop. The next episode begins the same way. Halfway through it, the characters realize they've been caught in an endless time loop. The next episode begins the same way. Halfway through it, the characters realize they've been caught in an endless time loop. The next episode begins the same way. Halfway through it, the characters realize they've been caught in an endless time loop.\\n\\n\r\nSee what I did there? For five episodes these same events have been occurring to the point of becoming frustrating. Every single time you hope this will be the episode where the time loop ends, but it just keeps going. Three episodes would have been more than enough for this story arc, but KyoAni decided six was more appropriate.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing to take into account is how much a bad sequel or bad second season hurts the original title. As good as it may have been, it suddenly looks like it wasn't so good in the first place, and that is exactly what this story arc is doing to the entire series.",

            "content": "Okay, now to break it down The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2nd, has hit a ditch in the road, or is being written on a treadmill. (First and most probably last review)\r\nI admit I did quite enjoy the first season, simply because of the torrent of ideas which seem to flood me after I've seen an episode. (I myself am a writer, though this is quite unnecessary information)\r\nThe first two episodes stated out fine, bringing us back into Haruhi's world, and linking back to previous episodes, but when we got two the \"Endless Eight\" Arc (of which I'm dreading might actually be eight episodes, fingerscrossed for ep 6 to be the last one) you find yourself watching the same thing as you did last week, I actually was certain that I had loaded the wrong episode and watched each of them again. This is all quite bad for an Anime. But I found myself looking at this from a objective and overall story view, then it becomes slightly more enjoyable, though, cutting it down to maybe only three episodes would have been a wiser decision  (Just a small tip to help you get through it, if your still sticking to it.)\\n\\n\r\nThis is poor quality story telling especially for a TV series/Anime(Which should shorten down any story to about a quarter of what was written) , I do not recommend you watch the Endless eight arc, when its over I believe it would do good to watch the first episode of this arc and then the last (and one in between if you really have to) as to save time and patience. \\n\\n\r\nOnly fanatical fans of the show, or ones to lazy to stop watching should continue on this downward spiral.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Story - Is sticking to a realist style,for me  its new yet boring to see this happen. (i say 5 & 3, for the fact that the first two episodes did not repeat themselves)\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - Keeps up the clean crisp standard of the Previous series, no complaints\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - Kyon is his sceptical disgruntled self, that's all I really need from the characters, and Nagato does actually look quite bored  ~I wonder why?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - To be honest I have waited with a sense of anticipation for each episode, as one part in the opening theme song with the Kyon head shake, I do quite enjoy that. but to say that the opening theme is more enjoyable than the actual content puts me in quite a melancholic mood, excuse the pun..\\n\\n\r\nI've wasted enough of your time, go watch something else for a while, come back when the series is over.",

            "content": "Alrighty, let's cheer up Haruhi Fans.\r\nThe second season of Haruhi has been seen as a failure by a lot of anime fans.\r\nBut frankly I don't understand it.\r\nThe art work is very good. VERY VERY GOOD guys, the animation is fluid and the characters are nicely designed. While it is not the same as the first season and there are certain things I dislike compared to it, there are also quite a few things with the artwork in season two that I think have lived up to season one's creativity, and in some ways surpassed it. I noticed a more detailed animation as far as hairand clothes and also a more unique use of lighting. I think most would agree that season two's artwork deserves at least a 8, but personally I give it a 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is, once again, golden. The seiyuu are giving a tremendous amount of effort into the voice acting. (While unfortunately there is no second Haruhi concert, that is because it is the one and only.) The soundtrack features scores fitting to the events in this season, which are actually a bit darker than in season one. So in my book, Haruhi still is a 10 in sound.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are fantastic as always. Kyon and Haruhi in particular grow in this season as we see the worst dispute between them (The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya). We see Haruhi get desperate, Kyon lose his cool, Koizumi under stress, Asahina suck it up, and Nagato show more emotions. Haruhi retains another 10.\\n\\n\r\nSo now comes the problem, or is it a problem? The storyline is quite memorable from this season. Basically we watched Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, a pretty good episode if I do say so, and then we get into two new arcs: Endless Eight and The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya.\\n\\n\r\nWell, you know which one is more important right? :)\\n\\n\r\nQuite frankly, I'm shocked and disappointed in the animosity shown by the Haruhi fans towards Endless Eight. Let's look at it from the animation company's point of view shall we? \"Hmm, Endless Eight. How about we plan eight episodes about the same sequence of events and form eight animation teams to design them.\" If you look at it that way, its actually not such a bad idea. Its not as if they actually broadcasted the same episode every week guys, and if you weren't interested in the animation used each week, then you can hardly call yourselves animation fans.\\n\\n\r\nIts so irritating to know that a show that I enjoy so much is getting 1'S IN ITS REVIEWS!! Can ONE ARC really change the way you view the series?? So much that you give it a 1?!! I can't think of ANY SHOW that I've given a one to, its just not possible. If you didn't like this show, at least give it points for animation and sound which it obviously deserves. And what these people are giving a 1 for is only half of the season, hell people were giving this season a 1 before it was even finished!\\n\\n\r\nBasically, I urge the community to change its outlook on Endless Eight. While we all agree that the show should have been directed in a different way and that Endless Eight should have been kept as a one, two, or three episode arc, its not as if Haruhi was ruined as a series because of it. In my case, I actually enjoyed a majority of Endless Eight because I loved the animation, but I really wished the count hadn't been so long that we didn't get to see the Disappearance. Simple as that, don't flame the series because of something so simple.\\n\\n\r\nAnd after the Endless Eight Arc, we watched the Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya. Now I have a confession. I don't really like this arc. The reason is that I actually found the Sigh the most boring novel in the Suzumiya Haruhi series. However, I'm glad to say that I enjoyed the anime version a lot more. It was a bit more dramatic than usual as you may have noticed, but if they hadn't made it that way we'd all be complaining that it was boring. The only part of the Sigh that I found interesting was the dispute. I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the series, but this moment is supposed to be as dramatic as it was in the anime. A very pivotal moment for the series as a whole. I found the story telling of the Sigh most befitting to the novel it was based on (even if I didn't really fancy that novel.)\\n\\n\r\nSo overall I give the story telling an 8. Minus one point for the repetitiveness of Endless Eight and minus another point because we didn't get to see the Disappearance because Endless Eight was too long. Fair, right?\\n\\n\r\nI give the Enjoyment a score of 9. This is my personal enjoyment of the second season.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally the season gets an 8 overall. This is a fair assessment of this series, and even if it isn't it sure as hell is better than the reviews of people who give this series a 1.",

The second rule is that fans will watch it, regardless. The third rule is that message board fucktards will defend it like the honor of their dead mother who perished in a tragic incident involving a horse dong...\r\nBut I digress.\r\nClearly after the endless hype, the teasing, the disinformation, the creators of Haruhi have managed to shit out three stunningly mediocre episodes of a 'sequal' [sic] to the original show that managed to be somewhat quirky,fresh, and a semi-original premise.\\n\\n\r\nIn short...\\n\\n\r\nKyon travels to the past and meets a pre-teen Haruhi and rapes her... erm he seems to be the 'seed' of the idea of her later dealings of the SOS brigade. Then there are two stunningly mediocre episodes that deal with deja vu and the end of summer, but just rehash the events in a different order and wind up reeking of Higurashi without the creepy aftertaste.\\n\\n\r\nThere's really nothing to this. There's nothing revealing, there's nothing entertaining, you're left to watch the episodes and wait for the punchline before realizing there isn't one and that waiting for the sequals [sic] was like waiting for your long lost lover to come back after a world trip only to realize she had fucked her brains out in Belgium and now has a family and doesn't remember you anymore.\\n\\n\r\nLiterally three episodes and nothing has happened. They're not particularly good episodes in terms of plot, characterization, or whatever. We're supposed to THINK that Haruhi scrawling some shit on a baseball field in alien letters is meaningful then having to listen to some space time psychobabble about time travel and feel all self-important to have understood SOME of it and pat ourselves on the back. Then watch an entire episode of high school kids doing lame-ass summer activities that would bore US if we did them, not mentioning watching someone ELSE do them--only to watch the same fucking thing again before being treated to a revelation that this is deja vu.\\n\\n\r\nBased on the view-or-drop rule of shitty anime, I would have dropped this if this was the first three episodes. Even as a sequal [sic] that qualifies.\\n\\n\r\nIs it shit?\\n\\n\r\nMeh, maybe not totally.\\n\\n\r\nBut it's totally mediocre, boring, and probably proof positive of the grand plan of seeing if the loyal fanbois and girls would watch anything regardless of how brainless it was.\\n\\n\r\nThat and the anime industry never had an original idea in its existence.\\n\\n\r\nADDENDUM:\\n\\n\r\nOkay, so I skimmed through two MORE \"Endless Eight\" episodes and have concluded that Haruhi 2 is shit. The simple fact that people would animate repetitive tripe is bad enough, the fact that people would WATCH it is even more painful in hopes that the anime will redeem itself. I'm sure that there are people out there who are being hopeful because this shit is a way of screening out who the REAL Haruhi fans are, like how your girlfriend cheats on you with a new guy each night to show you she loves you.\\n\\n\r\nI don't care what future episodes bring. I don't care if I'll be having screaming, gushing orgasms when I watch them, the series has truly exceeded the dropworthy status and I just watched two more episodes because I, as an objective critic, have to. Yeah, right. I want the bandwidth I wasted back.\\n\\n\r\nThis is so terrible, with its subpar animation, and hopeless pursuit of an idiotic premise and lack of storyboard that my hatred of this show is spilling into my like of Haruhi 1.\\n\\n\r\nThank you and good night.",

            "content": "I would like to focus mainly on the \"Endless Eight\" arc in hopes to provide an antidote for the overwhelming negative response this series has encountered by the community, as I myself genuinely enjoyed these episodes.  I'm not saying everyone should like this story arc, and I'm definitely not saying it's a crime to hate it.\r\nThough each of these episodes are physically the same, they are each unique in their own way with the use of subtle (but definitely noticeable) differences.  I apologize for my lack of specifics, however I'm sure you understand why it would be difficult to remember which episode waswhich XD...\\n\\n\r\nOne episode I found rather eerie and almost scary, mainly the way the deja vu was depicted with the sudden shift to gray colors and muffled sound.\\n\\n\r\nOne episode made me laugh despite knowing the plot practically word for word, due to the humorous aspects of each persons actions being noticeably more defined.\\n\\n\r\nThe last episode of the arc I found to be appropriately \"Melancholic\" especially with a beautiful scene with the group sitting in the rain.  I enjoyed this episode enough to watch it twice in row within 45 minutes.  (though admittedly this was perhaps a subconscious attempt to \"get what I can\" out of this long story arc or \"make it worth it\" haha) I did with all honesty enjoy the way it ended, though I can't explain why without giving too much away.\\n\\n\r\nEach of these episodes did have one interesting thing in common (besides almost everything)- during the last few minutes of each episode, my heart started racing...  and this feeling increased with each episode.  You may or may not appreciate that feeling, but I must say that even some of the other anime that I wholeheartedly enjoy don't get me going like that.\\n\\n\r\nThe point here is that the creators (how I see it) made a bold move in taking a plot line and repeating it with each episode only to be distinguished by unique subtleties brought into being by their elite (in my opinion) artistic prowess.  They have made a dent in this industry with a stunt that may never be repeated (some of you are like \"thank god\" haha)  This at the least must be respected undeniably.\\n\\n\r\nAll that being said, I encourage those who haven't seen this series to witness this piece of history and not be turned away from all the bad noise out there.",

            "content": "After three years (of what seemed to be a long time of waiting) the second season of Suzumiya finally came out. What we weren't expecting was a troll from Kyoto Animations. But hey the message boards were extremely fun to go on when this show premiered.\r\nWhat made this Suzumiya season so \"special\" was that there was no announcement about it. One day I was surfing the web and people were screaming all over the message boards. \"OMG NEW SUZUMIYA.\" I laughed and quickly scrolled down, until someone told me it was actually true. I was like, \"WTF KYOTO ANIMATIONS WHAT.\" And behold a new seasonof Suzumiya was brought to the face of the earth. Of course it was bundled with the first season, so sometimes you had to wait like a month for the next episode. But at least we got something, right?\\n\\n\r\nWhich brings us to Suzumiya's second season's problem; Endless eight, which is basically the same episode eight different times with OMG DIFFERENT CLOTHES, OMG DIFFERENT YUKATAS, OMG DIFFERENT SWIMSUITS, AND OMG NEW ANIMATIONS! What disappointed me was that Kyoto Animations didn't skimp out on the budget for these eight episodes (and I'm proud of them for that). But it makes me feel like it was a waste of money, just animating the same thing over and over again. When they could have spent their budget elsewhere. I also feel bad for the voice actors, since they had to actually record it eight different times. I thought Kyoto Animations would record their voices once and then be like, \"Okay, you guys go take a break for seven weeks. We'll call you when we get bored of trolling everyone.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt was tedious to watch each week of Suzumiya's EE to see if something would change. At least there was the fun thing of going on the message boards to see everyone's reactions. There are the people who will love Suzumiya, no matter what crap Kyoto Animations gives us. Then there are the people who rage and rage and blame the world for this torture. There are also the intelligent spectators, who very carefully planned out how many more episodes were left and were like, \"Kyoto Animations is doing this, so we can understand how Yuki feels.\" And there were the trolls, they were the most interesting to see. One of my favorites was this youtube video about how Endless Eight will never end with Hitler. And another one was someone putting the broadcasting information and listed Endless Eight until 2012. Oh, I also like Kyon-kun, denwaaaaaaaa~\\n\\n\r\nThe other six episodes are actually quality episodes, five of them being Sighs and one being just a one-episode arc. Nothing could beat the Endless Eight arc in discussion though. Kyoto Animations kept the animations high quality and they were able to hire the voice actors to repeat the same lines again and again.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know how I would feel if I was to marathon the entire show at once. I'd probably fall asleep or just stop watching the show overall. I guess this new season of Suzumiya was meant to be taken in slowly, instead of all at once, which most anime watchers tend to do. Since I was watching it while it aired, I was able to break away from watching it continuously and be able to discuss it with everyone online. (MyAnimeList forums were especially fun to visit during this time.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I re-watch this? Ummm ...... no. I could barely make it through the first time. Would I tell my friends to watch this? Ummmm no ...... unless they were die-hard Suzumiya fans. It's very hard to recommend this, but for all you masochist out there I would tell you to watch all of Endless Eight twice, no three times. And everyone else can watch the first episode of Endless Eight, a random episode in between (I recommend the fifth repeat, since Izumi is wearing a speedo. lololololol!), and the last episode. So eight episodes all together for the whole series. Hey, that's almost as long as Endless Eight.",

In the end I'll either get shot by those who behead anyone who insults Haruhi, and on the other I'll get shot by the people who are simply overreacting giving this show a 1.  Let me start off with the fact that the story was superb!  The writing didn't drop at all in quality.  The second season instead gave us far more insight into Haruhi's character and mysterious forces working behind her.  Her powers were shown to a much greater extent as well.  It is really quite amazing howwell this series seemed to have such excellent continuity with the rest of the series and the attention to detail did not disappoint.  \\n\r\nNow before everyone starts thinking this review will be just rainbows and lollypops, that ends here.  The Endless Eight was a too endless.  I honestly enjoyed it, the first four times through.  And I did like the last episode, but it was nearly too much making it through the middle three episodes.  I loved that there was insight into Yuki's character during this part, but the variances could have been much more noticeable.  Basically you watch one good episode, eight times over!  (It would have been perfect if it was the Forever Five)\\n\r\nThe rest of the series was fun and enjoyable and the last plot was, well, different.  I'll address this in the character section.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nIt was not at the same level as the main series somehow, it felt like K-ON!.  So it deserves a nine, a high nine, but a nine.  The faces really annoyed me at times, especially Haruhi's, which I thought was changed significantly.  Nevertheless it does mostly blend well with the rest of the series, but it didn't test it's limits like the first season did.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nI saw no decrease in voice acting quality.  Actually I thought it might have been even better as we get to hear the characters in different situations.  I didn't like the intro or ending nearly as much though as the original ones.  After all, what can beat Hare Hare Yukai.  I thought the intro was actually very mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\r\nOne place the show did step up was in the characters.  They're different and deeper and in the case of Haruhi, darker.  In the \"Sigh of Haruhi\" plot she seemed at times bordering on evil and we indeed saw her much darker side.  This wasn't necessarily bad, it displayed more of her humanity, but it also showed how much of a brat she really was and I felt quite uncomfortable.  Usually I can laugh it off when she's using/abusing her friends.  But in that plot it just felt very unsettling, and I think that was the intention.  This therefore caused what could have been a fun plot, be more of a serious and dark plot and I found I really couldn't laugh like I could with the original series so it disappointed me.  Thus at the same time it felt like a step down because of the loss of general likeability.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nTaking all things into account this show does deserve this rating in my most unbiased examination I could muster.  It explores a different side of things and it definitely deserves a look from those who've seen the original series.  But it doesn't stand on it's own like all the other sequel shows I've reviewed.\\n\\n\r\nParental Caution\\n\r\nRated PG-13\\n\r\n-Yuki tackles a girl and it looks... awkward.\\n\r\n-In the endless eight each and every episode has a scene at a pool and on some loops Mikuru is, focused on a little too much.\\n\r\n-In the Sigh of Haruhi episodes Mikuru is in fetish costumes, but they aren't overly immodest.\\n\r\n-Some swearing, I really didn't notice very much of it.\\n\r\n-Some physical abuse.",

That's because as long as it falls within reasonable parameters I don't really care.\r\nThat said, I found the series as a whole very enjoyable. The Endless Eight arc added to that for many reasons, not the least of which was my amusement at how badly everyone seemed to overreact to it. In addition to this, however, there were also the many minor variations made in each loop. In one case, they even grantedItsuki a line almost on par with his \"Oh, it looks like we're going to get some rain\" comment in Someday in the Rain in terms of downright hilariously purposeful blandness. Aside from that, Mikuru Asashina and Nagato Yuki were able to generate increasingly strong hug-urges in each loop.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the \"endless\" recursion of time, the final arc provided good laughs (with a moment of frustrated anger thrown in for good measure) as well as intriguing plot developments. As for the ending, I applauded the highly appropriate conclusion and was left even more excited for the upcoming movie and prospect of a second season than I was before.\\n\\n\r\nP.S. I have no doubt that many of you disagree with my review. I decided to post this because it seemed this part of the series was being sorely underrated due to the unnecessarily massive amount of whining over Endless Eight.",

What went wrong?\r\nNK: They made a second season.\r\nT: Come on.  A little more detail would be nice.\r\nNK: That is the true mistake, though.  The first season of Suzumiya Haruhi was enough.  The characters were designed well, the stories were all the right length and really helped show how the characters developed over the course of the series.  It ended on a very good note and nothing needed to be added.\r\nT: The ending was open, though.It would make sense to add more after the events after the first season.\\n\r\nNK: Yes it would.  They didn't.\\n\r\nT: Wait, do you mean that the second season takes place during the first season?\\n\r\nNK: Correct.  And there were only three stories.  14 episodes.  Not quite as concise as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nT: What were the stories, dare I ask...\\n\r\nNK: A one episode trip back in time for Kyon.  That was actually good.  Then the Endless Eight began.\\n\r\nT: The...Endless Eight?\\n\r\nNK: Eight episodes that repeated the same two weeks of summer vacation because Haruhi didn't do her homework.  I just summarized over half of the second season for you.\\n\r\nT: Um...spoiler warning?\\n\r\nNK: Why bother?  You're wasting time by watching the same thing eight frickin' times.  I figured I'd remove curiosity for that part of the story for everyone.\\n\r\nT: And the final story?\\n\r\nNK: The other 5 episodes were about the making of the movie that acted as the prequel episode to season one.\\n\r\nT: That's it?\\n\r\nNK: That's it.  No further character development, no captivating plot, nothing.  Just a 14 episode time sink.\\n\\n\r\nT: There had to be something good, right?\\n\r\nNK: I have two good things to say about the second season.  First, the characters were intact.  They weren't acting in a way that would surprise you despite the obvious cash-in that this season was supposed to be.  Second, the opening was actually enjoyable despite the how bad the season was.  It makes me wish that it was the opening for the first season.\\n\\n\r\nT: So...no recommendation.\\n\r\nNK: If you've watched the first season, this is entirely pointless.  If you haven't, you can actually find the broadcast order for when the episodes were aired in chronological order with season one.  That might be a bit better context-wise, but you're better off just watching season one.  Hopefully, the movie is better.  The first season deserves such a better follow up than this.",

Worst of all, it's hard to call shenanigans on the most of the production team. Nearly all of the scenes (even the \"repeated ones\") are redrawn each episode, with different angles, costumes, montages, etc. Thebaffling part is, this means that the animators are still working their asses off, redrawing the same scenes time and again. I almost feel bad for them; they're going through the same things we are. O_o\\n\r\nI understand the direction they all tried to go in. It just didn't work.

            "content": "\u201cI'm getting bored and just fed up watching something that doesn't seem to be changing at all.\u201d\r\n- Asakura Ryoko, chronological Episode IV of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\r\n\tIn 2006, Kyoto Animation made a simple little anime called The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It was based on a popular series of light novels written by Nagaru Tanigawa. Even still, nobody expected it to be very big. Kyoto was not trying to make a popular anime. All they wanted to do was make a good anime.\r\n\tAnd maybe that\u2019s what went wrong with its 2009 sequel of sorts. That they forgot what Haruhi truly was. That they, ratherthan wanting to make a form of art, made a capitalistic envoy instead.\\n\\n\r\nStory/Enjoyment\\n\r\nThe story is entertaining, but nowhere near the levels of the first season. The first story was Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, by the way the only story with a good amount of screen time. While pretty interesting, the spunk of any given first season episode is gone; the episode just chugs along. \\n\r\nThen came Endless Eight. The exact same thing over and over again. It could have easily been accomplished in one, two, or even three episodes if you wanted to give the feeling of a loop. But instead, Kyoto Animation decided to drag this on for eight episodes. Needless to say, it gets extremely boring and repetitive. Each episode by itself is passable. But put together, it is one of the most boring, redundant, pointless, and driveling arcs ever devised. \\n\r\nAfter that ends, we get The Sighs of Haruhi Suzumiya. It\u2019s interesting, but the charm, the wit, the feel of the first season are still, well, disappeared. The story itself is a bit tedious, too.\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nAnother weak point for the show. Kyoto Animation began a show shortly before Haruhi Season 2 called K-ON!, a moe-blob anime with cosplaying, tea-drinking, and a surprisingly small amount of actual rock performances. (Or so I hear; I didn\u2019t have the patience to watch the show.) This show had an extremely large influence on Haruhi Season 2\u2019s animation, and it really hurts it. The character\u2019s eyes are taller, more childish. Everybody suddenly develops buckteeth. The colors are less bold, more washed out. There is much less detail. The animation is not as smooth. Animation changes are expected, especially in a period of three years, but for the animation company to regress rather than advance is a terrible thing. I often found it painful to see K-ON! expressions copied and pasted onto everybody, and had to rewatch a first season episode to try to blot it out of my mind and only think of the first season designs whenever I thought of the characters.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nThe sound is average, which means highly disappointing. In 2006, we got Hare Hare Yukai, Bouken Desho Desho?, God Knows, and Lost My Music. All excellent pieces of J-pop. Even the background pieces are memorable. But in 2009, all we get are Tomare!, Super Driver, and a couple new background pieces that are extremely meh. Tomare! and Super Driver are still fairly good J-pop songs, but when you think of how Hare Hare Yukai, Bouken Desho Desho?, God Knows, and Lost My Music were done so well three years before, they don\u2019t stand a candle.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nExactly the same. Still excellent. Haruhi is still God (though she doesn\u2019t look the part anymore due to the K-ON!ification of the animation), Kyon is still snarky, Yuki is still awesome, Mikuru is still a moe-blob, and Koizumi is still gay. Koizumi and Mikuru are still meh, but that\u2019s just a case of me not liking their personalities and mannerisms; they\u2019re still good characters. And I do not think Haruhi is a bitch, because there is so much more to her character. One small complaint: Kyon seems a lot less observant and a lot more slow than last season. (His lines aren\u2019t quite as memorable this time around, too.)\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\n\tWe have deeply regressed. Haruhi was such an original show. It was indescribable. The second season, however, can be easily described in two words: troll, and disappointment. Which is a pity, because this show had so much promise. There were so many more stories to adapt. There was so much more character to develop. There was so much more merriment to be had.\\n\\n\r\n\tKyoto Animation has turned an excellent show into an average show. And they will never learn from their mistakes, because they will still sell hundreds of thousands of Endless Eight DVDs. They will have succeeded in milking as much money as they can from this hot property.\\n\\n\r\n\tAll we wanted was a good show.\\n\\n\r\n\tInstead, we got a big middle finger.",

            "content": "Quite frankly, I'm dissappointed.  Not in the show, but in the \"fans\".  I first started watching Haruhi about two months ago, and in that short time, I was impressed time and again.  The art, the voices, even the concepts of alternate time and space were mixed together in a way I've rarely seen.  After the first few episodes, I was completely enthralled.  I just had to see the next episode.  After finishing the series for the first time, I can honestly say I was satisfied with all I had just seen; something that no other series hasmatched for me, to date.  Although satisfied, my curiosity crept in, constantly asking if I had missed anything, if the order might change the perspective.  I set the episodes to shuffle, and again, I was completely impressed.  I watched the whole series another four times, each in entirely random orders, and each one was like a new series, just as good as the last, and still making perfect sense.\\n\\n\r\n  This second season, so far, has still lived up to the expectation left by the first, at least for me.  The episodes do repeat, up to this point, and I will admit that the repetition is a bit tiresome, but each episode has its own unique, quality that makes it all that is \"Haruhi\".  The attention to detail, not just in the visuals, but in the minute changes in the voices of each character in each similar, but unique, situation is simply incredible.  I truly would not have expected this quality of art from anything else, and I am still astounded by it.\\n\\n\r\n  I may be the only one to think this way, but I believe that the Haruhi was not made this way on accident, that it took careful planning to get everything to fit together so well.  I also believe that the creators have a reason for the repetition spanning so many episodes, rather than compressing it into one or two episodes.  I truly think that this season will live up to its predecessor.  Whether it be due to lack of attention, or simple impatience, I really am sorry that so many people seem to be giving up on it.",

Everyone's entitled to their own opinion.\r\nNow as far as I'm concerned, people that reviewed this with an 8, I can only assume they reviewed each Endless Eight episode with a 1, totaling the entire review to an 8.\r\nWell, that would be funny anyways.\r\nStory 3/10: Like most people, I'm going to rate this very badly. There was no story as far as I'm concerned. Aside from the few episodes that were different, the repetition of Endless Eight had no good excuse for even happening. So what ifthey included different outfits each time, different camera angles, and maybe a few seconds of extra scenes. IT'S STILL NO EXCUSE. To be honest, I'll admit that I didn't bother to sit through the entire 24 mins of every episode of Endless Eight. There was no point in wasting my time doing so. So, the story in general sucked.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10: I'll admit Haruhi's art level is high quality. First series had high quality, second series had high quality. I give kudos for the poor artists that had to re draw scene after scene for Endless Eight. I would have quit, or bashed my head in. So whatever, the art of Haruhi will be as it is. Good.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10: It's been probably close to a year or over half a year since I watched this, so I can't remember much about the sound. I do like Haruhi's sound though. It's one of the better qualities of the show. Can't have a good anime without good music. It keeps you entertained to say the least. So it was pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5/10: I guess I'm only giving this half because Haruhi's characters in general are pretty plain. Nothing we haven't seen before. I for one quite dislike Haruhi's character in general. She's too annoying for me to handle. Sorry to any Hirano Aya fans (which I know there are many) but I just can't stand her voice. It drives me up the wall, and Haruhi's character with said voice just has me hitting my head against the screen. Besides Haruhi, everyone else is alright. Except, as I said, it's already been done. I guess there's no such thing as an 'original character' anymore.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 2/10: To say the least, I hated The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2009. As I said before, there were a couple good episodes near the end, but Endless Eight just shot everything down and turned what could have been an okay series, to a dreadful one. I really wasn't expecting them to go as far as to really do 8 episodes of the same shit. It started to seem all too clear as to what KyoAni's plans were when the 3rd and 4th episodes came out for this arc. Terrible.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 2/10: Seriously...there's nothing more to say. If you want to watch it, go ahead. There's no one stopping you. I won't say it's completely unwatchable, but I can't say you'll enjoy it as much as the first series. Just watch the first couple episodes, ONE episode of Endless Eight, and then the last episode of Endless Eight and carry on from there. You don't even need to watch half the series to understand where it's going.",

I read manga and ranobe afterwards. And then came out second season... \r\nFirst episode was great, art changed a bit and became more similar to K-on! and I liked it. Episode 2 and 3 was great too. But 4th episode pissed me off. And there was 5th and 6th episodes. All them made me to remember 70-80 years anime when there was a terrible shortage of paper and you had to watch sameanimation in each episode (like in Speed racer or Sailor moon). So from now on I dropped season 2 till its not finished. I cant anymore wait a whole week to see same thing I saw half-and-a-month ago. I simply cant.\\n\r\nI hope that there gonna be great episodes in season 2, but I just wand to smash the head of all creators who decided to stretch Endless8 in 8 episodes instead of 4 (I stumbled upon the schedule where was only 4 eps. about endless8)\\n\r\nI also hope that I will be able to raise my score on MHS2 but at the moment its dreadful 3/10\\n",

            "content": "15,532 reiterations, and we've only endured episode length instances of 8. Should we really be complaining? Well, Kyon should have. Better yet, he should have done something productive much earlier to spare us the stupidity, if not the time. But he'll redeem himself yet.\r\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2009) is the next installment (discounting the Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya shorts) of an anime series originally based off the light novel franchise by Nagaru Tanigawa. It was directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, scripted by Yasuhiro Takemoto, and produced by Kyoto Animation, the same studio that animated the Full Metal Panic Series, the Key holy trinity, Hyouka, andK-On! Hosting three new stories from the source material set in between the events of the first season, it was aired as a surprise (however unwelcome to many when they viewed its contents) with the previously animated material from the series in chronological order. No fresh or innovative doses this time around. This season wasn't much successful either. Truth be told, it was more aggravating than confusing.\\n\\n\r\nLet's cut to the worst: Endless Eight. Perhaps the producers, deciding to withhold the exploration of any material beyond what they used in the movie, somehow felt they needed to broadcast the same number of episodes as its prequel. Perhaps they wanted to experiment. Perhaps they wanted to be cheap. In any case, the reactions to this (almost) eightfold repetition can be likened to an experiment with grease over an open stove. And that's that. \\n\\n\r\nWell, not exactly that. While I didn't happen to watch this show while it was airing, which would probably make Endless Eight all the more monotonous, I would loathe to dismiss the other arcs solely on this one grievance. The rest of the show, on the whole, still has that humorous hyperactive charm about it. Bamboo Rhapsody is comparable, if not not better, than some of the other content aired 3 years ago, and the Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya is the best that I've seen, defying expectations to what I thought would be a comedic telling of the back story behind Episode 0. While it presents the female lead in a rather nasty light (though she's more excitable than nasty herself), it also features a sincere confrontation where, for once, Kyon puts his foot down against Haruhi's antics. How Haruhi reacted to it... that's something to see for yourself. It was executed beautifully, from the slow but sure escalation of frustration to backlash, the emotion so vividly rendered. For consistency's sake, I would like to have criticized Kyoto Animation for changing the character models and animation style, but the reactive expressions that it allows lends itself more to the approach this season's going for than the sweeping motions the previous style would ever permit. In addition, however subtly, we begin to get the impression that the rest of the SOS Brigade may have something more going on with them then before. It's only an impression, though, for the sake of the leisurely pacing, I'm satisfied with just that.\\n\\n\r\nThe OP \u201cSuper Driver High\u201d by Haruhi's Seiy\u016b Ana Hirano and the ED \u201cTomare,\u201d or \u201cStop,\u201d by Yuko Goto and Minori Chihara, the Seiy\u016b for the other two female leads, in addition to Hirano, emanates of the same factor that defined the OP and ED of the previous season: energy. The vocals are just as brazenly peppy and addictingly catchy as before, and the electric guitar get their own nice spotlight moments in both songs. At times, it even seems to surpass them in amount, though the ED's lack of choreographed dancing was sorely missed. Though what we have instead is nothing to scoff at, a mixture of what appears to be neon lighting imprinted throughout different parts of the school setting's premises combined with a flip-book style sequence of shots, blurs, epilepsy, and all, of the main cast. The OP's visuals also utilize something of flip-book and shaky cam, but the most obvious things that standout are those elements one would normally find in comics and manga. The images, names, and onomatopoeia literally pop out from each character introduction scene.\\n\\n\r\nDoes the series suffer from Endless Eight? Yes. Is Endless Eight this franchise's death knell? Well, I'll end with this. I'm not saying one should omit Endless Eight from their memory or, for anyone who has yet to watch it, viewing experience. In fact, watching through all, or at least part of it, (specifically, the first two episodes and the last one if you'd rather forgo the distinction of having survived it all) is crucial to being able witness the full impact of the movie. Just don't omit the rest of the show, or the series, for that matter, because of it.\\n\\n\r\nI give The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2009) a 7 out of 10.",

I think the endless eight chapter has been done wonderfully. It really gives the sense that you are there with the characters especially poor Yuki who remembers it all (just like the viewer). Now granted if the show was nothing but the 15,513 some odd times that the week repeats it would be overkill, four or five episodes isn't overkill to me. I think it's plenty of time to get the point of thearc and the real feeling of monotony and melancholy the characters must be feeling.I know only after five episodes it is still too soon to make a review but there are just so many people hating this series and I think it has potential to be a well liked anime.  Ok off with my opinion and on with my review. \\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nI gave the story a seven because honestly very little of the story has been given to us. I really like what has been given. I particularly like the reason for the time loop. It is very different than the reason that was given in Higurashi.I also really liked the origin of the frog costume. Now hopefully they will explain that freaky cat.  \\n\\n\r\nArt \\n\r\nThis series is still just as spectacular looking as the first which I also gave a 10 towards animation. This series is definitely on my list of prettiest anime. \\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nDitto with the sound and music. there are some very familiar tunes to be heard. and the sound quality is still very nice. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter \\n\r\nIf there is one place where this series shines the brightest for me it's the characters. I love Kyon's biting sarcasm, his wit, and his humor. Kyon is the best nararator in the history of anime. The only reason I gave this a nine is that there has not been anyone new introduced and none of the classmates have shown back up again. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \\n\r\nLike I said I may be the only one enjoying it. But I do. Granted when episode four went off I was like no way are they repeating this again and then they did. but when they did I didn't mind. and when five went off I was like nooooooo! kyon don't go to sleep! which is the first time I yelled at an anime in a long time. haha!\\n\\n\r\nOverall \\n\r\nI give it an eight I still really like the art, sound, and characters. The story does need to progress in order for it to get a higher score. :) I made this review because I want everyone out there to know that there is at least one person out there who enjoys this anime. I don't want everyone to start watching it expecting to be disappointed there may be a few like me who actually enjoy the repetition. It's a little melancholic.",

            "content": "After the first season of Haruhi Suzumiya, fans couldn't get enough. In 2009, a second season came out. And what were the fans' reactions?\r\n\"THIS IS THE WORST SHIT EVER! PHUK HARUHI! PHUK KYOANI! I'M NEVER GONNA BE A FAN OF HARUHI AGAIN!\"\r\nPay no heed to these people, for they are butthurt fanboys, or trolls, or both. Having just finished the second season in preparation for the film version of The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, I can say that the second season . . . is definitely a disappoint compared to the first. Was it a waste of time though?\r\nStory: The antics of the SOS brigadecontinue in three story arcs. The first arc is the first episode. It's a clever episode, more mysterious than funny, but it intrigues you. The second arc, and where most of the complaints come from, is about Kyon and friends stuck in a re-curring timeloop. The so-called \"Endless Eight\" runs for eight episodes; five of those episodes are wholly unnecessary. You only need to see parts 1, 2, and 8 to see everything. Also, the ending to this arc was a let-down, I thought. The last arc is about the making of Haruhi's movie. This is definitely the best part of the second season, for it's here that the show acts like the Haruhi I remember, the Haruhi I love. It's hilarious, fun, and even dramatic occasionally. However, the developers could've used those five superfluous episodes from Endless Eight to make another story arc or two, and because of that, the story score suffers. 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt: For the most part, still good. However, some of the character designs don't look as nice. For that, I'm deducting one point from the art score I gave the first season. 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound: There's new music, but it's not as catchy as the music from the first season. The background music is still good.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice-acting, in both English and Japanese, is still top-notch. No complaints here. It's reassuring to know that even though this season doesn't match up with the first one, at least the characters still sound good. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacterization: And speaking of characters, this is the one thing that kept me going throughout the season; the characters are still great, even if the stories are not. Kyon is still a sarcastic master of observation, Haruhi is still an energetic troublemaker, Yuki is still a silent yet kickass \"Data Entity\", Itsuki is still the token bishounen, Mikuru is still the token moeblob, Taniguchi is still obsessed with girls, et cetera. Not as much character growth here as in the first season, but there's a reason why this cast has become iconic among anime fans, namely, I didn't drop Endless Eight because of them. 9/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: The last five episodes were great. The other episodes were good although not great, or complete and utter filler. Filler and I usually do not gel well together. If these characters weren't so likable, I probably would've dropped this series. Was it a waste of time? For the most part, no. If the entire series were as good as the last five episodes, I would've given this season an 8. As it stands, I'll go with 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, I'm sure a ton of people are gonna downvote this review because I didn't join the hate bandwagon. Luckily for us all, I don't care if I get all downvotes or not. I only write these reviews out of boredom. But seriously, if you hate the anime version of Haruhi that much, I have a suggestion; read the original light novels instead. I've been told that they handle the stories in the second season much more effectively than the anime. As for me, I'm still a fan of Haruhi. I like the premise and the characters too much to abandon it just because a story arc ran a little too long. Still, I'm not going to be buying the second season on DVD. Let's hope that Disappearance is worth owning.",

            "content": "Note: My review may contain some spoilers, but it's for the sake of getting a more in-depth analysis and cannot be helped. There will be no major spoilers, but read at your own risk. \r\nHaving read reviews on MAL and various other websites, it's plain to see that a lot of the fans were disappointed with this addition to the Haruhi franchise. I'll admit it, I loved the first season (hence why it is in my favourites at the time of writing this) and was even more so impressed with the movie, 'Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu'. But I had been putting this season off for\\n\r\na while for one reason; Endless Eight. There's a topic in the discussion section of this anime called \"Sign here if you watch all eight episodes of Endless Eight\". When being able to complete eight episodes of TMoHS '09 (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2009) is regarded as a feat by the masses, it makes things quite problematic for people who have yet to have seen the series because, generally speaking, one would presume it to be \"crap\". For such a short series at 14 episodes, to hate eight of those episodes would calculate to 57%, so is everyone suggesting that only 43% of the series is worth watching? At one point, I was seriously contemplating dropping the series entirely, but after completing it, I'm so glad I chose not to. The shit this series gets thrown at it doesn't do it justice, and in my review, I hope to remedy that.\\n\\n\r\nFirst and foremost, type in \"chronological order Haruhi\" into the Google search bar and click on the Wikipedia link. Scroll down to where it says \"2009 version\". That is how the staff have intended for their viewers to watch the series. If you, like me, watched the first season in broadcast order and have yet to view it chronologically, then this is a perfect opportunity. \\n\r\nPersonally, I'm not a huge fan of non-linear stories, so re-watching the first season as well as the new 2009 version chronologically really appealed to me. With that out of the way, TMoHS '09 can be divided into three sections: episode 1 (Bamboo Blade Rhapsody), episodes 2 - 9 (Endless Eight) and episodes 10 - 14 (The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya parts 1 - 5). Keep in mind that TMoHS '09 isn't necessarily a second season, although is commonly referred to as being one by the fan base because it is the second anime entry of the franchise. Similarly to the first season, only six of the episodes are important to the overall storyline. As you may have guessed, those episodes are episodes 1 (Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody) and 10 - 14 (The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya Parts 1 - 5). So that leaves us with the infamous Endless Eight, which will be the first segment of the anime that I will analyse as it is the one that receives the most negative feedback.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, Endless Eight is a filler arc, so it isn't an imperative to watch it. However, I feel that to be an insult to Kyoto Animation's efforts, so I wouldn't advise skipping it. And why would you? Sure, the execution wasn't great and it could have been better, but it's still worthy of a watch none-the-less. Endless Eight is an eight episode long arc (obviously) set in the last two weeks of Summer vacation from August 17th - 31st. The SOS brigade decides to spend their last two weeks of Summer to the fullest by participating in various activities, ranging from swimming to cicada catching to stargazing. One night, Kyon is awoken by a phone call from a distressed Mikuru and is then asked by Itsuki to join in their group discussion, immediately. Upon arriving at the rendezvous point, Itsuki explains to Kyon the predicament that they are all in. That as soon as the clock strikes 12 a.m. on August 31st, they will be forced to repeat those two weeks all over again in an ininite loop, with no memory of doing so. The exception to this, however, is Nagato. She remembers all those 10,000+ times that she repeated those two weeks. Personally, I loved this concept, but quickly started to become disinterested in it. The reason is simple: it was drawn out for too long and the differences between each episode weren't significant enough to keep me hooked. Some people claim that KyoAni became lazy and started recycling scenes, but that is factually un-true. It is clear that KyoAni put a lot of effort into each scene. Although in essence you're watching the same episode eight times, there are differences in each and every episode. They include:\\n\\n\r\n\tThe clothes they are wearing;\\n\r\n\tHow they decide to phrase something;\\n\r\n\tCamera angles;\\n\r\n\tKyon may become more aware of the situation in some episodes than   others.\\n\\n\r\nThe second point I made is the most noticeable. For example, during each episode, Nagato tells Kyon how many times they have repeated the two weeks. His shocked reaction stays the same, but the dialogue used always changes. In one episode he says,\\n\r\n\t\"That calculates to... uh... 594 years.\"\\n\r\nIn another episode, he says,\\n\r\n\t\"That's about 594 years!\"\\n\r\nAnd in another episode, it shows him actually calculating it on a phone, which surprisingly comes to 594 years.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned earlier that the main problem with this arc is that it was drawn out for too long. I can understand why they did it, though. Had it lasted only three episodes, you wouldn't have felt the same level of sympathy towards the characters the same way as you would with eight. But it could have been done just as successfully with five episodes. The first episode could have been when the problem was introduced, the third could have been the solution and, finally, the fifth episode could have been the conclusion. I think that one would enjoy this arc more-so if they are interested in film studies and can appreciate this purely on its aesthetic value. I also felt the ending to be quite... erm... anti climatic. Considering how long it was drawn out, I \\n\r\nfeel that little effort was put into the conclusion of the arc. One thing that did impress me, though, was how Nagato dealt with the situation. She was always a calm and reserved character in the first season, but there are several points during this arc where she appears as if she's about to have a mental breakdown. Hell, her eyes tell us enough about how she must have felt. Overall, this arc can feel like a chore to complete at times, but if you think about the amount of effort that KyoAni put in to this, then it doesn't seem so bad. It was a bold and gutsy move on behalf of KyoAni, and I commend them for that. I definitely wouldn't suggest completing this arc in one sitting, though.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe next section of the anime that I have decided to analyse is episodes 10 - 14, or 'The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya Parts 1 - 5'. Remember that infamous first episode in broadcast order on the original series? Did you ever wonder what that was all about? That is what this arc is for. The cultural festival is nearing, and the SOS brigade have decided to participate by making a film. \\n\r\nIn the original series, you knew that they made a film for the cultural festival, but you didn't know how it was decided, what went on behind the scenes, what conflict occurred, etcetra. I'm a sucker for things like this, when you're shown what went on behind the scenes. I thought this was a worthy addition to the season and thoroughly enjoyed this arc.\\n\\n\r\n\t\t7/10\\n\\n\r\nAs for the first episode, I can't really analyse it without spoiling too much. Considering it's the first that you watch, you'll know whether you like it or not. All I can say is that this episode is essential if you intend on continuing with the anime franchise and is, in my opinion, the best episode on this season. It was strong for an opening episode and set the bar high for what was to come. A little too high, actually. \\n\\n\r\n\t\t8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnimation, sound and characters have all remained pretty similar to what they were in the first season, so I don't intend on writing a huge paragraph for each of the said aspects. My only complaints are that the opening and ending songs weren't anywhere near as enjoyable as the first season's and details of facial features fluctuated. Other than that, everything was on par with the first season.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10",

I really enjoyed all of the characters from before, and being able to immerse myself once again into their lives as they try and prevent Haruhi from bringing total chaos to the wrold.\r\nI'm probably one of the few people who is enjoying the \"Endless Eight\" arc of this series so far. Maybe it's because I'm not one of the ADHD/MTV generation. I enjoy all the subtle little difference between episodes, like the different masks Yuki selects. There are other changes as each of the characters arebecoming more aware each time they go through the loop. It's like revisiting your favorite coffee shop after they've renovated. It's still the same place, but yet it's different at the same time. I know this arc isn't going to last forever, so I'm enjoying it while it's here. In my opinion most of the viewers out there don't have the patience for this sort of thing. If you don't have a good eye for detail all of the episodes in the \"Endless Eight\" story arc will probably all seem the same to you.\\n\\n\r\nI don't think it was a bad idea, I just don't think the people today have the patience for this sort of storytelling. In old movies you used to see shots that slowly panned across from one side of the scene to another giving you time to absorb the whole scene. Now everything is cut into choppy little segments like a video on MTV. A lot of people now have grown up with that choppy style and can't sit still for those slower paced scenes in older movies.\\n\\n\r\nI'm really interested to see how this arc is resolved and what comes after it.",

I do agree that this anime wasn't all that good but at the same time I don't think it deserves a 1 that a lot of people give it.\r\nLets start off with some pros the artwork and animation was very good,  the sound was awesome with one of the best openings I've ever heard and the characters are as lovable as ever.  Because these departments in the anime do sowell I cannot see why anyone could rate this a 1.\\n\\n\r\nNow time for the dreaded endless eight arc.  I agree with most people on this one, this arc just plain sucked (although I do the like the idea).  Although there were some minor changes through-out each episode in the endless eight they were too minor to change the fact that it is basically the same thing over and over again.  Believe me watching the same thing over and over again is not fun.\\n\\n\r\nNow the content in the remaining episodes that were not in endless eight was actually quite good and although one bad arc does not make the whole anime bad I cannot simply overlook it.  Considering this is a 14 episode series the majority of the series was endless eight\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion although endless eight was something I would want to forget and it took up most of the series, this anime also had some good stuff too and that' why I give The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2009) and 5/10\\n\\n",

            "content": "I've enjoyed the first season of Haruhi very much. The original 14 episodes have a cult status for me, and the story of Haruhi had a huge influence on me... no, I should even say that it changed my life. The story by Nagaru Tanigawa, which KyoAni decided to animate, had everything which a good story should have - a very original, very well thought-up story, well defined personalities of the main characters, and an epic climax. To all this, KyoAni added good art, well done voice acting, great soundtrack (I think that \"Bouken Desho Desho?\", \"Hare Hare Yukai\", \"Koi no Mikuru Densetsu\", \"God knows...\"and \"Lost my music\" are among the most recognizable and remembered anime tunes today)... and an interesting ordering of the episodes, with the main story from the first book going after the \"what the hell?!\" first (or zeroth) episode of The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina, and being intertwined with short stories adapted from later books. It all made the series epic for me.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the anime, I've read all the light novels, save for the last, tenth installment which simply isn't around yet. There are better and worse stories among them, but overall, the books are great, too.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the three years of waiting for the new episodes, we were promised the anime version of Disappearance/Vanishment (Shoushitsu - the English translations of the title vary), another great installment of the series (second best behind the Melancholy, I would say), but in the end...\\n\\n\r\nIn the end we got trolled. First, we were told that a new season is going out, then we were all disappointed hearing that it's just a rerun (this time in chronological order), then, finally, we were happy to see the not animated before gaps in the original timeline of the books are being filled with new episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe first new episode was \"Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody\", a short story from the third book, and a pivotal turn in the timeline. When I was reading it in the book, it was really shocking and entertaining to me. I already knew what's going to happen when I was watching the anime version, so maybe it's because of that, but I had the impression that it's too static and affected, and I didn't really enjoy it much.\\n\\n\r\nThen, after few already-seen episodes, we got \"Endless Eight\", another short story from the fifth book. A short story - yet, with respect to its title, turned into eight episodes. Eight episodes for a short story... it sounds frightening - and it sure was. It's very difficult to explain what it means without giving a huge spoiler... When the first episode of Endless Eight aired, those who haven't read the book probably thought about it as a unimportant filler episode, or as a kind of introduction, similarly to the first episode of Remote Island Syndrome - while those familiar with the story smiled to the clever idea which the makers thought up. Second episode shocked everyone as it did not conclude the story, and with every another more and more fans were getting upset as the story was not progressing even a little bit, even though the mood varied slightly between the episodes. The finale of this story arc was certainly worth seeing, and it was probably the best scene in the whole second season - but it should have happened in the third episode, fourth at most - but not the eighth.\\n\\n\r\nSure, the way KyoAni did Endless Eight is one and only, and it may turn into an anime legend one day. But it was certainly boring to wait for several episodes to see a progress of the story - that's not a soap opera!\\n\\n\r\nFinally, as a supposed ending of the season, KyoAni animated the second book, \"The Sighs of Haruhi Suzumiya\". It's about the filming of The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00, which we've seen in the first season already. For this reason, and for this story arc being one of the least interesting portions of the book series, I doubted the very point of bringing it to the screen, but KyoAni apparently wants to have the entire Haruhi universe timeline animated. Well... it isn't bad, but nowhere near the first season, either. And the feeling of staticness and affectionateness which the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody episode had, and which gone during the Endless Eight arc - returned, though at least with not as huge strength as in Bamboo Leaf.\\n\\n\r\nI assume that this is the end - some suggested that The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00 might get re-animated - we even get a hint of that in the last episode of Sighs, where the ending credits in the screening we see, differ slightly from the actual ending credits seen in the original episode. But even if so - there's not much that can be done differently in that episode. Others suggest that after the remaining four episodes of the original series, there might be something more (Disappearance?) - but if so, I would consider it the third season then.\\n\\n\r\nTo sum everything up... the new episodes in the 2009 airing of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya are merely a shadows of their three-year-older siblings. The art is still good - though I hoped for real HD, not upscales. The voice actors are doing their bests - though they cannot do much about such static scenes. The opening and ending themes are great once again - though the BGM seems \"glued-on\" and doesn't really flow well with other aspects of the show. There are too many \"thoughs\" for this show to repeat the success of its predecessor. Maybe the fact that I've read the books before made me receive this show as I did. Maybe if the anime version had been the first for me to know, my rating would be better. But I find this show just mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nI admit - Endless Eight and The Sighs are not the best moments of the storyline - I would even say that they are the worst, so the animators couldn't do much. But Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody could be done better, Endless Eight could be two times shorter, and The Sighs could also be more condensed and shortened by an episode or two - then we could have Disappearance animated in this run, and the overall impression of the show would be much better.",

            "content": "** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS**\r\nWell, this is my first review, and I'm going to do what no one else has done: actually give an in-depth review explaining why this series sucked. Not just: The Endless 8 sucks because etc. etc. therefore, this show sucks. Nor will I be \"ok, the Endless 8 wasn't very good, but the rest of the series was pretty decent due to *insert quick explanation here*.\" No, this review will show why the WHOLE SHOW sucks, not just one part. I'm sick of just \"Endless 8 sucks so automatically, so the show sucks by default\". Forgive my aggravated rambling; Ineeded that off my chest. Do you wanna know why this show is bad? Do you wanna know why this almost ruined the franchise for me? Then, let's find out, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, nothing about this season added to the story of the series. It's 14 episodes of (mostly) pure, bona-fide filler. This show is a midquel that answers next to nothing about Season 1, particularly because Season 1 left little to be explained. This season takes place before the last 4 episodes of season 1. The 2nd season starts off well. It's a small adventure that only really becomes relevant in the Haruhi Movie. Then, the Endless 8 begins. Episode 2, is also good. Then, episode 3 redoes a lot of the previous episode with a twist! Everyone is in an absurdly high time loop spanning over 15,000 repeats. First off, since all of the following episodes of the arc literally go one repeat after another, why not start this off with say 50 loops, and then continually increase the number dramatically? It would be more like the show to do that. Then, episodes 4-8 repeat the exact same episode (episode 3) with minute changes. Finally, episode 9 breaks the loop in hilariously stupid fashion after terrible buildup with 7 episodes that show no progression towards the arc. This whole thing literally could`ve been resolved in three episodes. One for introduction, one for setup, and one for resolution. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the final arc, I've actually seen people DEFEND this arc, which really boggles my mind as to something just as mind-numbingly stupid as the Endless 8. Honestly, we'll save this one's biggest problem for later as this arc`s biggest sin is how badly it botched up the characters. Let's put it this way. Season 1 established that when Haruhi is visibly upset, a different field of the world begins to suffer the wrath of giant monsters, and that could prove dangerous to the real world. At one point, Haruhi is the most unhappy she\u2019s ever been via confrontation that she effectively deserved, and NOTHING HAPPENS!!! First off, Haruhi brought this on herself, and Kyon was scolding her for being basically tyrannical to her friends, and he's forced to APOLOGIZE?! WHY?! Haruhi also gets off scot-free for being so horrible. also, for how \"smart\" she is, she should've put two and two together during the final scene of Season 2. I get that maybe trying to hit her was a bit out of hand, but still, she needed some repercussion for being so damn awful! This season was pretty awful by this point by this moment killed any chance of it recovering. The ending sucked too, just to let you know.                                                       \\n\\n\r\nIf you know Haruhi Suzumiya, you know that she's kind of a spoiled brat with an (understandable) god complex. She's a bit of an ass, a tyrannical one, but you understand why she's that way, and see her developed into a slightly more polite and caring person. Despite the fact that this season takes place after the events containing most of her development, this final arc, in particular, decided to DECIMATE all decency from her, and flanderize her obnoxiousness and bratty-ness to new levels. She actively treats Mikuru like a sexy slave, even more so than in season 1. She becomes a bigger dick than ever and ignores all sense of likability and development. Mikuru is reduced to a whiny moe slave for the series who only accomplishes following Haruhi`s demands, and only to varying effect. Itsuki is the same, only spouting off his stuff under unreasonable circumstances that only serve to make Haruhi a Karma Houdini, which sort of waters him down a bit.  Kyon, is the same, only less entertaining, less intelligent, and less snarky, meaning that like almost everyone else, he is at least somewhat watered down here too. Yuuki Nagato is the only character with any improvement, as we see a more urgent and ambiguously caring side of her, as she does some risky things this time around. Unfortunately, the side characters are less present, and less likable, albeit, when Haruhi makes you drug your friend with alcohol, and you accept in a heartbeat, that's bound to happen.\\n\\n\r\nKnowing KyoAni, brilliant animation to them is as simple as doing a worksheet of simple math problems. Takes a bit, but it's easy and leads to damn good scores. Not much was stepped up, other than slight changes to character models, though I kinda like the change. While this season didn't get to show off its creative muscles like Season 1 did, the animation was still really good, and if it got to show off some of the amazing stuff Season 1 did, it would've gotten a 10, for even the minute changes in the Endless 8 are appreciated, as they change the clothing, and give new angles for repeated scenes. This is always a highlight of the franchise, and even though this season sucks, at least it lived up to KyoAni's expectations in the animation department. Too bad it was wasted in this garbage-tier anime.                                                                     \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the music isn't as good as in season 1. Luckily, it's still overall decent. The OP and ED themes are once again, great, really capturing the tone of the series, and are just as good, if not better than those of season 1, even if they'll never become as ubiquitous as \"Hare Hare Yukai\", season 1's ED. This season, otherwise, added nothing to the soundtrack, and the recurring themes aren't memorable, minus a few jingles in some of the themes. Also, while the dub has the same voice actors and talents, the repetitive dialogue for the Endless 8, along with Mikuri`s aggravating squealing, bog it down a bit. Heck, Kyon doesn't even get any deliciously scathing monologues here.                            \\n\\n\r\nThis series had no right to be as long and annoying as it was, and the botched characters, nigh-useless story, and painful moments make me hate this show, no matter how pretty it is, or how good it sounds. Honestly, this is an allegory for how this season made me feel about Haruhi herself, attractive and with a nice voice, but a total bitch. Yes, the first two episodes are good, and yes, the Endless 8 had the potential to be pretty good if they cut large portions out and made the set-up more in line with the spirit of the show, but overall, this series can't stack up to its predecessor in any way other than production. Lastly, thank God for the movie since if not for that, this would've actually killed the anime franchise as a whole with it being such a gigantic pain. With that, I bid you adieu.",

            "content": "This review is only about the endless eight.\r\nTHE ENDLESS EIGHT IS A MASTERPIECE. There, I said it. \r\nLet me preface this by saying, that the hate for the endless eight is built solely on misinformation and presumption. The endless eight was not why we don't have Haruhi season 3. The endless eight was not a joke meant to make fun of us. The endless eight was not an attempt to spread out the source material as far as possible. \r\nWhat the endless eight is, is probably one of the richest artistic commentaries to come out to date. It's common for people to evaluate art solelyon the story, and consider the visuals, music and voice acting merely supplemental to the story. The endless eight, is what you get when you keep only the story while changing everything else. \\n\\n\r\nThe result is an intensely enjoyable experience, the endless eight is ENJOYABLE. Let be put emphasis on the \"able\" of that, because I'll be honest, the first time I watched the endless eight, I didn't enjoy it. This was because I was eager to continue the story of the series and this felt like an excessively long gap without any change in plot points. However, the second time I watched it, was far more satisfying than the first. The reason, was that I was fully prepared to wait eight episodes before continuing the story. In fact, after watching the endless eight, I didn't even both to finish re-watching the series (including the second best arc of the series, The Disapperance of Haruhi Suzumiya).\\n\\n\r\nThe endless eight, is essentially about bringing all the things we previously considered supplemental, to the forefront. The direction, the music and the voice acting all vary from episode to episode. It really puts emphasis on the difference between animation and live-action, and it's a reminder of why we view the medium. Anime is about animation, and when we forget that and focus entirely on the story, no anime is ever good. NONE. We can still enjoy said anime, but when hard pressed, the value of it can be easily forgone. It's essentially a metaphor for life itself. \\n\\n\r\n\"If you think of your life in terms of an A to B progression, then you'll only entice disappointment. You should instead treasure the finer details of the steps along the way.\"\\n\\n\r\nOf course, I'd be remiss if I don't talk about the production values. The japanese voice acting for this, is THE best I've ever heard. Despite having only seen this entire arc dubbed (twice), one episode subbed was enough to enchant me. Aya Hirano's performance, was the most well thought out in all of anime. While I've not cared at all for her in her other roles, but the genius demonstrated in this performance is unmatched. I've heard good things about Tomozaku Sugita's voice acting too, but those good things seem only to have value if I were to have watched multiple episodes. The english voice acting, is barely lesser than the japanese. Crispin Freeman in particular conveys Kyon's emotion better than Tomozaku Sugita (not that I mean to belittle Sugita's performance), and Wendee Lee as Haruhi, while not as impressive as Aya Hirano, is not a voice to dissmiss. Johnny Young Bosch as Koizumi is as good as ever. The animation, is ... not much different from the first season. The story-boarding and colour design on the other hand, is worth mentioning. The range of styles and structures used in each episode of the arc is far more diverse than you can expect even from the best of anime. The visuals are constantly engaging despite telling the same story.\\n\\n\r\nTo summarise, the endless eight is misunderstood genius. The work is judged harshly for daring to be different. It's persecuted for putting emphasis on the talent of the adaptors, rather than that of the light novel author. I've read the endless eight chapter of the light novel, and it's ... forgettable. Is that what you people want from our adaptations? \\n\\n\r\nTHIS is why we can't have nice things.",

I seen numerous numbers of bad reviews about it. If over half the season shows the same crap over and over then im not gonna even waste my time watching it if its like that.\r\nWell im better off watching the first season if the 2nd was aTOTAL EPIC FAIL like almost everyone says.",

As any comments on the controversy will inevitably lead to spoilers, I will refrain, and instead give you some helpful advice on how to best enjoy the season while avoiding its less pleasant side.\r\nSo, what's this advice, you ask? Just skip episodes 4-8. Yes, I'm serious.You'll understand when you get there.\\n\\n\r\nAs a 9 episode series, the second season earns an 8/10 rating from me, and I'm sure you'll find it enjoyable as well. As a 14 episode series? Probably a 5 or 6.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of content, this season has three \"arcs\": episode 1, episodes 2-9 and episodes 10-14. As some of you may or may not know, this season actually fits into the middle of the first season, so, if you're in the mood, you can rewatch it as part of the first season, (it is not, however, necessary) to do so, just follow these easy steps!\\n\\n\r\n1) Make sure you're watching the first season in chronological, not airing order. (Read more on Wikipedia if you're not sure what this means).\\n\r\n2) After original episode 7, \"The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya\", insert the first episode of the second season.\\n\r\n3) After this, continue watching the first season normally until original episode 12, \"Remote Island Syndrome Part 2\", insert the rest of the second season episodes here, leaving out episodes 4-8.\\n\r\n4) After the end of the second season, insert the remainder of the first season episodes.\\n\\n\r\nPlease note: I do not in any way endorse what KyoAni did with around 35% of this season, I am merely proposing what I feel to be the best solution given the circumstances. If you gave this season a poor rating, I can't say I blame you, though I try to look at things in a more positive light. I found that, having only watched 1-3 and 9-14, I found the season rather enjoyable, and so my review reflects that.",

            "content": "The Haruhi Suzumiya franchise has always been one of my favorites, with the Disappearance movie in particular being one of the best things I've seen to date. The second season, however, has spawned a great deal of controversy even amongst avid fans of the show. While I can entirely understand where the frustration is coming from, I personally find the first and second seasons to be equally compelling, though for very different reasons. \r\nThe Haruhi Suzumiya franchise has always been one of my favorites, with...\r\nYeah. I'm here to talk about Haruhi's second season, but I'm primarily here to talk about the endless eight. Episodes 1and 10-14 of the second season are effective continuations of the first season's adventures: if you enjoyed the first season, you will enjoy them. They possess the same uniqueness, charm and subtle character growth that is ever-present in the Haruhi Suzumiya series (damn it is so annoying having the name of the series be the name of one of the characters, I keep having to come up with ways to clarify which one I'm talking about.) That's about all on that, since I obviously wouldn't recommend the second season to anyone who hasn't seen the first already.\\n\\n\r\nNow, on to the hot topic of the hour.\\n\\n\r\nIf you consider yourself to be an anime fan then you've probably at least heard of the infamous endless eight by now. The majority of the second season of Haruhi is known as the 'endless eight' and is devoted to repeating the same scenario over and over again, with only slight differences existing between episodes 2-9. At first, this probably sounds like an entirely grinding experience and more ordeal than entertainment. You wouldn't be wrong, either: it's honestly pretty tough to get through, especially if you're like me and you go into it not knowing what you're getting into. It quickly turns from excitement to see what the next episode will bring to a plea that the next time the credits roll there will have been some sort of goddamn resolution.\\n\\n\r\nBut in truth, this has been most of my experience with Haruhi: the way I see it, the series has never primarily sought to entertain but rather to emulate the inherent monotony of life and the constant ordeal of trying to overcome it. Haruhi herself is forced to ceaselessly put effort into living an \"interesting life\" and oftentimes finds that her explosive energy and ambition are not enough to stave off the, well, melancholy. It's in the title: the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise portrays the battle against repetition, boredom and routine that plagues so many lives. Many of the series's flashy or enlivening moments are contrasted by ones that seem to be made intentionally dull or slow. Even when it's being bombastic it feels as though the show is holding back, as though it is willingly choosing to be less entertaining than it could be.\\n\\n\r\nIn the endless eight, Haruhi steps it up. No longer content to cut corners in order to satiate the audience, it digs right in. It makes you feel the grind full-blast. It's not trying to appease the fans: it's trying to make them think and reflect on their own lives. Why is it that you're watching this in the first place? Is it because you seek to escape the monotony of your own endless eights, your own meaningless repetition? People become frustrated with Kyon's lack of action whilst they throw themselves into more anime in order to bury their own lack of action. If the endless eight is boring to you, turn it off! Go make better use of your time! Defy your routine! Otherwise, aren't you just doing the exact same thing? I admire the endless eight, I really do: it manages to function as part of the larger narrative whilst driving in its own message at the same time, and it was created at great expense: each episode is animated slightly differently, each line of dialogue delivered with slight variation. This was not a case of laziness. It was a painstakingly-crafted thing, probably created with the knowledge that it would be received quite harshly but created nevertheless for the benefit of those for whom it resonated with.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, the second season of Haruhi is an excellent contribution to the franchise's dedicated themes and an utterly unique experience. However, it's not going to be for everyone. I won't deny that anyone watching Haruhi solely for mindless entertainment value is probably going to want to skip this part of the series. I would also say that the second season of Haruhi is the only one of my all-time favorites I would not be easily willing to re-watch. I highly appreciate it and will happily sing of its merits, but I acknowledge its strengths and weaknesses and am not a glutton for punishment. The choice is up to you, but know that here stands one man that at the end of the day is extremely glad he made the journey.",

There's no spoilers in here and I'm writing as a big Haruhi fan trying to warn others. \r\nThis season was KyoAni just trying to make money. For the guy who said this was carefully planned, you are CORRECT, but not for the reasons you think. If you are a Haruhi fan and still wantto watch season 2, save yourself some time and agony and just skip the endless eight arc or read the light novels. And please do not feed the trolls by buying their DVDs.\\n\\n\r\nRANT:\\n\r\nKyoAni says they did it because they don't have enough story from the novels to make a whole new season but I don't see why they didn't just air the other eight without the endless8 or not release any at all. I wouldn't have mind waiting longer. Also they changed the animation. I gave it a 5 because although it is clearer and the quality has indeed gone up, they've tweaked the style to be more moe (like Lucky Star and K-On) in hopes it would attract more fans. And lastly, when they asked Kadokawa about releasing the endless eight in 4 DVDs with the same crap, they replied \u201cEven in the company hardly anyone knows why it took eight repeated episodes spread across 4 DVDs with two episodes each in order to unravel the mystery thoroughly. We are aware of the fan reaction, but\u2026 Well\u2026 All that can be said is that it would be nice if they sell, wouldn\u2019t it?\"",

All if you people who downloads can fast forward, watch at your own sweet time not worrying if that going to be \"THE EPISODE\", they can't. if they missed it, the amount of regret is overwhelming.\r\n2.WHY? because you should expect nothing less when you are watching Suzumiya haruhi noyutsuu. don't expect them to spoon feed you and simple ride. That whole arc, is meant for us to understand Yuki better. what other way is better than experience it. just like yuki who cant just relax that week knowing that it will repeat, japanese cant missed it. Yuki couldn't expect to do whatever she wants because if that is the last loop, everything will be messed up. Please people, this is suzumiya haruhi, if you expect anything less you are really mistaken.\\n\\n\r\nI personally hate , and bloody hate the endless eight arc, but if i don't, they practically fail. Animes like naruto cant put you in the middle of a ninja fight, bleach cant expect you to find shinigamis, death note does not exist. This anime however, manage to put us into the story so real no other animes has been successful. Suzumiya which is supposedly the director of this event lives with us. She shows us 8 identical episodes just like what she did to yuki. Its bloody perfect.\\n\\n\r\nSo please, try to understand why they are doing it and why it lives up the standard of suzumiya haruhi.\\n",

            "content": "Isn't it delightful how many reviewers judge this series for Endless Eight and Endless Eight only? Sure, they overdid it. But is Haruhi 2009 a bad series? In my opinion: no.\r\nSTORY!\r\nThis installment of Haruhi consists of three stories. Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, one episode that explains past events. The infamous Endless Eight, where the gang gets stuck in a time loop for eight episodes. The third story is Sighs, where the Brigade take 5 episodes to shoot \"The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina\", the short film seen in the previous series. Being an adaptation of an exceptionally well written light novel series, the story is quite good,though the Endless Eight in the novels focused only on the final time loop, whereas the anime gives us the GREAT pleasure of seeing seven additional loops. A move that was extremely well received...\\n\r\nStory- 9/10\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION!\\n\r\nSome people like to say that Haruhi 2009 has been \"K-ON!-ifyed\" in terms of art style, even though the style was previously used by the Kannagi anime and the CLANNAD adaptation before that. Well, the art and animation are... uneven, to put it lightly. The art style has changed dramatically from the first series. The eyes are rounder, teeth are more prominent, everyone's hands now look like balloons etc. The art style gradually starts resembling its 2006 roots by the end of the series, though it's still not quite there. The animation drastically improved throughout the 14 episodes, though. Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody looked extremely \"meh\" while the last two episodes of Sighs were nothing short of spectacular.\\n\r\nArt/Animation- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nSOUND!\\n\r\nMost of the background music has been recycled from the first series, but that's okay, since I loved the 2006 BGM. Some new tracks are used, though they're largely forgettable. The opening and ending, however, were disappointing. The opening, 'Super Driver', is an upbeat pop/rock song that isn't BAD, but it doesn't reach the lofty standards 2006's 'Bouken Desho, Desho?' set. 'BDD?' was upbeat but still mystifying enough to not feel out of place in the darker episodes. 'SD' is way too peppy for, say, some of the more \"hopeless\" Endless Eight loops, while 'BDD?' would've worked. The new ending, 'Tomare!', is a decent enough song, though it really falls flat in comparison to the famous 'Hare Hare Yukai'. The voice acting is every bit as good as it was in 2006, though, if not better. The performances in Sighs IV blew me away.\\n\r\nSound- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS!\\n\r\nDevelopment. It's arguably the point of this series. Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody brings some new insight on Mikuru, Endless Eight lets us see new sides of Yuki while Sighs really fleshes out Haruhi and Koizumi. Sighs also puts the complicated relationship of Kyon and Haruhi in focus, as well as the appearant conflicts between the factions of Yuki, Mikuru and Koizumi. We also get to see a calmer, more polite version of Tsuruya, which is nice.\\n\r\nCharacters- 10/10\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT!\\n\r\nHmyes. Call me crazy, but I enjoyed Endless Eight. Not just because of the subtle differences between the loops, but also because it's simply a fun story. Of course, the real draw of Haruhi 2009 is Sighs. The absolute hell the brigade members went through to shoot a badly plotted sci-fi romance movie is either tragic or absolutely hilarious, depending on the situations. And Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody solves some major mysteries present in the 2006 series, as well as being a very entertaining story on its own. I didn't like 2009 quite as much as 2006 (or Haruhi-chan, for that matter), but it's still a fun series.\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL!\\n\r\nAlright! They overdid Endless Eight! 8 episodes of the same thing over and over again ruined the series FOREVER! Never mind that the animation is decent, the plot is as good as ever and Sighs being the best arc since 2006's absolutely epic Melancholy arc. Nope. The only noteworthy thing about this series is Endless Eight and how bad it was! Obviously.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2009 a Great 9/10.",

My advice is to skip this season, and simply remember the show as the 14 episodes that it was to begin with back in 2006. \r\nThis is not just a bad sequel, it is a bad show period. I am shocked to see that this has average score above a 3, much less 7. This show is the same uninteresting episode repeated 8 times. There is nothing good about this. It is not even an interesting idea. The worst part, aside from the tediousnessof watching the same episode eight times, is that the ending to the arc is completely dissatisfying. It got to the point where I skipped through to various parts of each episode, so I didn't waste my time. If you did waste your time watching every episode, then you must be an autistic stupid fuck, because that is fucking ridiculous. Anyone who wastes their time with this endless eight arc should feel bad about the choices they have made.",

I got high hopes when I saw the first one of this season and really enjoyed it...\r\nEven if the graphics is really good and music very entertaining, I just can't give this a higher score than 3. Why you ask? Because of the damn hunted episode \"Endless Eight\". They have repeated this episode 7 timesnow, with just minimal differences each time. And even though it looks like everything will be settled at the end, nothing happens. That darn main character Kyon just don't care and goes to sleep every F-in day! I feel tempted to drop this, but since the next episode is the 8th \"Endless Eight\" episode... Well, maybe it will end. Hopefully...\\n\\n\r\nBut until now, a REALLY really bad series. I found it amusing the 2 first times when they repeated it, but now... Nah!

I will definitely say this: this show is a good show, despite the horrific stunt that KyoAni pulled with Endless Eight. The main reason why I love this show so much is the insightful remarks of the ever-sarcastic Kyon and the rarely-outspoken Yuki. Haruhi's boisterous attitude, Asahina's typical moe, and Koizumi's general happy-go-lucky demeanor really give this show life. In genral, the amount of effort put into the characters really show and the seiyuus definitely fit into the role.\r\n For people that are hesitantto watch this show because of all the raging about Endless Eight, I suggest you watch episode 1,2, 9, and then follow through on the rest. That way, you won't have wasted any time watching Endless Eight except the introuduction of the problem and the resolution of the problem. Episodes 10 and 11 are practically picking up the pace from episode 1, so there shouldn't be any noticeable disappointment. Putting the failure of Endless Eight behind me, I'm still having my hopes up that this show will finish just as strong as first season... at least I hope.",

Although, by some cruel mishap I haven't done it this time, faithfully trusting myself in the hands of the trusted name.  And so the \"Melancholy\" notion is fully realized here. \r\nAnd so, to everyone that lays their eyes upon this review, just don't wait for anything meaningful to happen until the 9h episode! Really, they won't add anything! Re-watching the same thing eight times is only good for memorizing their lines, which isn't really something most of us would do. So, youcan freely skip episodes three to eight unless you're a fan of the \"compare two identical pictures\" game. If you do, you just might not be able to enjoy the rest of the season, which on the whole, isn't as lousy as it seems. \\n\\n\r\nApart from the \"Endless Eight\" arc, the show is pretty good, just what you would expect of Haruhi, except that, again, after seeing the whole EE thing, you get tired of all her whims that repeat even in the normal episodes. The OST is just another opening and ending and musical bits in between - active, bright, but nothing really special. The plot itself is good if you know where the cat is buried, so it still gets a six in that department. \\n\\n\r\nI guess, it's a tradition to have something wrong with the series: in the first season it was the order, and in the second - the tedium. \\n\\n\r\nI hope you have fun watching Haruhi 2, unlike some of us...\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Now this review will be a review for both seasons of the Meloncholy of Haruhi Suzumiya because let's be honest they aren't two seasons: they are two parts of the same anime and some retarded squid on the commitee decided to air a half finished series and then go back years later and finish the rest of it, but to be fair to anyone who hasn't watched either season this review will contain no spoilers.\r\n     Well what can I say about such a well know and popular series? Oh that right it's stupid and over-rated asshit. I've heard so many good things about this series I thought it would grip me balls from start to finish and leave me queitly wimpering for more. But as it stands it's just plain bad.\\n\\n\r\n     The story is a complete joke, not a funny one either. I went into this completely blank on the story and at first I thought it was going to be a typical high school anime, but then the story takes a turn at the corner of Bat Shit and Crazy and I was genuinely surprised and I thought to myself \"Maybe this will be actually really good.\" The rest of the story is told in arcs form after every characters gets their \"Who the fuck are you and what do you have to do with anything\" time over and done with. The thing was from there it starts into an arc that was completely insane and Haruhi was on the fast track to being in my favorite anime list but then it just goes down hill from there. The arcs from then on out ditch the aforementioned intruigue and get really boring really fast dropping most of the awsome premises to take a lovely stole down Shitty Lane. Now arc based story telling isn't always bad but the fact that it was completed years later by people I assume had only read the Cliff notes of the first season really does show. The tone and focus of the story never stays in one place like a druken hobo. And the ending... OH the ending. The ending is supposed to bring closure and wrap everything up but this ending leaves me feeling like a lot of women leave Bieber's room, completely unsatisfied.\\n\\n\r\n     This isn't helped by the characters being absolutely horrendous. Haruhi Suzumiya, the bitch who this series is named for, is probably one of the most annoying characters to blight anime possible over. She is completly spoiled and gets whatever the fuck she wants and treats everyone around her like shit. The worst part is there are glimpses of Haruhi being a truely sweet girl underneath her completely unlikeable personality but then it's buried under the fact that the rest of the time I'd prefer to smash her face in with a wooden mallet then listen to the fecal water slide flooding from her mouth. \\n\r\n     Then there is Mikuru Asahina who is fairly unique in the fact that I hated her even more then Haruhi. To put it in perspective, if I hated Haruhi so much I wanted to burry her six feet under I'd like to tie a cinderblock around Mikuru's ankle and give her a one way ticket to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. All she does is get bullied by Haruhi, cry like a new born infant, and then FUCKING FAN SERVICE EVERYWHERE! \\n\r\n     There is also Itsuki Koizumi who isn't near as bad but he just gets annoying because he just constantly smiles and bends over to take it up the pooper from Haruhi. \\n\r\n     Yuki Nagato is alright. She's pretty quiet and reads a lot, nothing annoying here. \\n\r\n     The last and most enjoyable character is Kyon. Now he's the only one that Haruhi hasn't got completely wrapped around her finger. He's not afraid to tell Haruhi she's wrong. Kyon also give alot of narration to the series which does alot of good calming me down after Haruhi's constant bitching makes me want to throw my computer out my window. If it wasn't for him I'd have dropped this terrible series like the moist turd it is.\\n\\n\r\n     Now the art for this series happens to be pretty good. The only thing I noticed is that the season from 2006 seemed to have better animation the the series from 2009 which just proves that society is only getting shittier. It's most noticed in Haruhi's completely hateable face. Its rather ugly and punchable in the 2009 season but 2006 series it actually looks pretty darn cute that is until she opens her fucking mouth causes an insatiable urge to shove a sock down her throat. The sound is alright but definately not used to its full potential. That first arc I mentioned had great mood music along with totally being awsome but the series never really uses it very well after that point. The English voice actors do a pretty good job at least.\\n\\n\r\n     The bottom line is this series is one that starts off solid but then its bones emulsify and it turned into racid pile of used tapons. It got so boring at points I broke out my phone and started playing solitare and if you're trying to escape from your escapism then there is something wrong. Now feel free to comment on my profile telling how I'm wrong.",

            "content": "Critic\u2019s Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2014. Review #80: The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (2009)\r\nIt is February and widely considered to be the Month of Love. I honestly can\u2019t relate to that at this time since I am actually single. If I look at a certain point of view that involves either my family or my faith. I guess I don\u2019t have a problem with it. If we are talking about Valentine\u2019s Day, I guess I could celebrate somehow. Come to think of it, what does Valentine\u2019s Day have anything to do with The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya? Nothing.\r\nOn the first day of high school,a beautiful girl named Haruhi Suzumiya introduces herself as having \"no interest in ordinary humans\". She asks for any aliens, time travelers, or espers to join her. Watching her weird behavior is Kyon who sits in front of Haruhi and is the only person who talks to her. When Kyon comments about Haruhi's joining every club in school and then quitting he unwittingly gives Haruhi an idea to start her own club. Thereafter Kyon and several others find themselves dragged, literally, into the Spreading excitement all Over the world with Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade (the S.O.S. Brigade for short).\\n\\n\\n\r\nTo be technical, this is a Kyoto Animation production and this 2009 renewal is considered by some to be a controversial move by Kyoto Animation. All the 14 episodes you\u2019ve seen before were re-broadcasted along the new episodes that would eventually air. This means the out of order experience and chronological order are overwritten with a new chronological order that includes the old and new episodes. This re-broadcasting is a lazy way to air the new material. But I can honestly say is that the animation is just as good since 2006. The newer episodes do look slightly newer than the older episodes but it\u2019s not really something to get all twisted over. The show is animated nicely and still looks great and that\u2019s pretty much it.\\n\\n\r\nThe music by Satoru Kousaki is pretty much the same since 2006 but there are no classical pieces from the newer episode. The soundtrack still compliments the show well and it still stands out as a modern anime soundtrack. Too bad I don\u2019t have much to say because I already covered all that in my previous Haruhi Suzumiya review. However, the newer episodes do have a new opening and closing theme. Super Driver is a catchy theme but may not hold out for those that loved the first opening. Tomare! is catchy to some extent but it is nowhere in the same level as Hare Hare Yukai. The music is still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nIn regards to voice acting, it feels the same as the older episodes back in 2006. Both the Subtitled Version and The English Dub are great.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that feels the same\u2026 Haruhi is still eccentric, Kyon is still his good old self, Mikuru Asahina is still a Time Lord, Yuki Nagato is quiet as always and reading. and Koizumi is just Koizumi. All the other characters are just their usual selves. Development is still a slight issue but since this series is fun, I am not going to go too much into that...That is until the new episodes come in.\\n\\n\r\nIn order to get into the first \u201cnew\u201d episode, people had to wait till the six part story \u201cThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\u201d and the episode \u201cThe Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya\u201d was over with...That means people waited 7 episodes to get into a new one. Then of course another run of old episodes come in, those being Mysterique Sign and the 2-part story Remote Island Syndrome, then we get a batch of \u201cnew episodes\u201d which is the most infamous story arc of the entire franchise\u2026 ENDLESS EIGHT. If you have not seen the newer episodes, you have no idea how bad Endless Eight was\u2026 The first episode is a bit boring and supposedly would be the one setting things up for later, but that was until the episodes repeated all these events 7 TIMES. That means half of the new episodes and a quarter of the entire TV series as a whole ARE A REPEAT. THAT IS NEVER OKAY. Endless Eight can be skipped and you seriously would not miss much. Many people hated this story arc and I sure as hell didn\u2019t like it either. After 7 straight repeat episodes of that Endless Eight bullshit, we get a 5-part story arc called The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya and there is a little nice little direction technique I actually liked in the Sigh episodes. Just skip the closing credits of these episodes on the DVD/Blu-Ray disc and you\u2019ll see what I mean. It does lead up to Mikuru Asahina Episode 00 episode and it was a nice little prequel to it. Then comes Live Alive, Day of Sagittarius, and sadly \u201cSomeday in the Rain\u201d which was not fun at all. Before I give out my personal rating to this anime, I must point out that I am counting all 28 episodes and not just solely based on the newer episodes. So, be on your guard when I actually share my final thoughts on Haruhi Suzumiya in all 28 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (both the old and new episodes) were available by Bandai Entertainment. The older episodes were already released while the newer episodes were released separately where Bandai Entertainment called it \u201cSeason Two\u201d. Both \u201cSeasons\u201d are out of print.\\n\\n\r\nWith all that said, the 2009 renewal of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya may be a mixed bag to some. But if no one saw it back in 2006 and jumped into the 2009 renewal. I don\u2019t think their experience would be such a big problem. But I would probably be referring to a few. As a whole, the 28 episode chronology is still watchable. The old episodes are still great, the newer episodes are hit and miss. The Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and Sigh episodes are the only good ones, the infamous Endless Eight episodes aren\u2019t. A quarter of the show may be a repeat, but most of the show as a whole is still fun to watch.

            "content": "\"Itsuki: I'll explain it the best I can. We're currently stuck in a time loop that seems to have no end to it.\r\nKyon: Huh? Are what?\r\nItsuki: We're currently stuck in a time loop that seems to have no end to it.\r\nKyon: Uh...\r\nItsuki: We're currently stuck in a time loop that seems to have no end...\"\r\nSuzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009) is an anime unlike any other. Given the fact that you are currently reading this I'm going to assume that you know about the controversial \"Endless Eight\" arc, in which practically the same episode is shown eight times in a row. Many people have criticized theshow for this without looking deeper. It is only after a deeper analysis of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009) can one truly appreciate the beauty that is the Endless Eight.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10\\n\r\nThe story of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009) picks up where Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu left off. Kind of. Because the first season was told with episodes out of chronological order, the events of the second season actually take place within the events of the first season. If you are new to the Haruhi Suzumiya series, I recommend starting with the first season in the order in which they aired, then moving on to the second season. It is possible to watch the entire thing in chronological order, but this will throw off the originally intended pacing of the show. Anyways, back to the story itself. It starts off with classic Haruhi that we all love, but then the Endless Eight happens. I don't want to spoil anything, but in my honest opinion the Endless Eight arc is one of the best executed plot devices in modern anime. When watching, look not only for the subtle differences between episodes, but also for their meaning. This is one in which the writers are able to convey a message to the viewer only upon a closer look. Think back to your high school English classes and remember analyzing the works of Shakespeare. The same techniques used here shows that there is much more to Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009) than what is apparent on the surface, but what this something else is is up to the viewer to discover themselves.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\r\nSuzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu always had very solid art, but in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009) is where you can truly see the genius of the artists that created this masterpiece. Despite the fact that each episode in the Endless Eight is nearly identical, notice that each time the characters are wearing different outfits. The animations are different, the backgrounds are different, the colors are different. Think about it. If you are the person in charge of paying for artists to animate eight very similar episodes, would you not just use the same animations multiple times? In Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009), they went the extra mile and animated everything eight separate times. This just goes to show the quality of the visuals in this work of art.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nThe sound was nice. That's it really, just nice. There really wasn't anything too special about it, but the opening and ending songs were quite catchy. Nothing else was too memorable in terms of music. The voice overs were spot on, as to be expected since it was the same as the first season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 9\\n\r\nThe characters in Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu are some of the most memorable characters in all of anime. I would go into more detail here but its something you have to watch to understand, but just know that in this show there exists aliens, time travelers, espers, and goddesses. None of the characters really are how they at first seem.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor for this one really seals the deal. Only Haruhi could show the same episode eight times and I was still laughing and enjoying the eighth one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\r\nThis truly is an unforgettable anime. It does what most other anime nowadays doesn't do, and it goes deeper than just what appears on the surface. Truly a masterpiece in my eyes, though not for everyone. If you are unwilling to look into the deeper meaning of things, then keep away from Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu (2009) and just stick with the first season. However, if you are willing to dig deeper and conduct a literary analysis, I promise you, this will be on the best pieces of modern art you will have ever witnessed.",

Kyon was driven to insanity with how many times the world was repeating itself, thanks to Haruhi's yearning to keep reliving the summer. We feel that irritation, that insanity. We want to move on, as viewers, and we can connect that properly to Kyon. That's why I enjoy this season so much, was simply for Endless Eight. I can't exactly say the palette cleanser that was the Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya was awful, but it wasn'tnearly as commendable as Endless Eight.",

(^_^)\r\nbut when I started watching it the endless 8 thing really ruined it for me and I just gave up on the series. With all the money and popularity the first series made for itself for them to just go for an incredibly cheap option in terms of animation and completely re-use most of one episode 8 times is just incomprehendible and lost it alot of respect in the eyes of thefans. In Japan this caused a huge shift ( doubled with the 2 year gap from ikki tousen ) allowing the rise of Queen's blade as number anime for men. Similar to what happened when bleach started its zanpakutou filler arc and lost its place to Gintama which took that chance to rise to fame and is now very popular amoung school girls.\\n\\n\r\nPoints: *These points are given for where I saw up to*\\n\\n\r\nStory: I gave it a 1 for story because it was just the same bit over and over again.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I gave it a 10 for art because its a very good, professional style.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound being one of the only things that changed it kept me going.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are great in Suuzumiya but could have thrived with a better story!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I gave it a 3 because the first episode was interesting but who wants to see it 8 times in a row?\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I gave it a 5 because I expected so much more from Suzumiya and was kind of mad that they didn't bother to make new episodes they just recycled the same one 8 times and as a fan of Suzumiya they made me actually give up watching the series. The is a mediocre attempt and should have been so much better!\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Do yourself a favour and watch the first episode then skip straight to number 8.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I watched this season a while ago with subtitles, but I like to wait and watch both Japanese and English variations before I write a review. Just so everyone is aware, I knew that eight of the fourteen episodes I was ordering were similar. I hope I don't offend anyone in saying that I loved every episode, including the Endless Eight arc. With that said, let's begin. \r\n***This review may contain spoilers. Please read at your own risk. ***\r\n\tStory: 9\r\n\tThere are fourteen episodes in this series, each belonging to one of three arcs.  \"Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody,\" the first episode, gave us somewhat of aninside look at time travel. Although we don't learn any \"classified information,\" we do learn that Miss Asahina was not lying about her identity, as with her help Kyon is transported to the past and must find a to return to the present. A little part of me wishes this arc was more than one episode, since Miss Asahina is my favorite character and this is the only time she is given a main role. But I digress. \\n\\n\r\n\tThe next eight episodes are comprised of the \"Endless Eight\" arc, and it is just as it sounds: eight episodes with the same general plotline. This is either loved or hated by fans; some extremists even threaten to drop the series all because of this-but we only have to watch eight-just imagine if you were Miss Nagato! You'd have to watch the episodes over 15,000 times! Really, though, the story is intriguing, the conversations are worth listening to, and each episode has a different tone that makes it worth watching. Plus, most of the character development is during this arc, but you must pay attention to realize it.\\n\\n\r\n\tThe last arc is compromised of several episodes that show just how the SOS Brigade's \"masterpiece\" of a movie was made.  This isn't only humorous; it also has the characters at their best and worst. There's a bunch of character development (or underdevelopment) in this arc, so I wouldn't miss it. This arc also contains the beginning of something very important, as Kyon learns that Koizumi is not the only one with a theory about Miss Suzumiya: Miss Asahina and Miss Nagato have completely different beliefs regarding the matter, and the viewer is forced to choose which side to take. (It's strange; Miss Asahina is my favorite character and yet I find myself siding with Koizumi.)\\n\\n\r\n\tArt: 10\\n\\n\r\n\tJust as with the first season, Kyoto Animation has done a superb job of animating this season. Every episode is beautiful and fluid, especially the \"Endless Eight\" episodes. If you don't watch \"Endless Eight\" for the story, then your attention should still be caught by the wonderful job concerning art.  In every episode, every character wears at least three different outfits, and you can tell that Kyoto Animation worked even harder on these episodes than the others, so please allow yourself to appreciate the beauty of it. \\n\\n\r\n\tSound: 9\\n\\n\r\n\tThe opening is \"Super Driver\" by Miss Suzumiya's Japanese voice actor, Aya Hirano. She, just as with last season, does a lovely job of singing and possesses such a unique and beautiful voice. The ending is \"Tomare,\" sung by the three lead voice actresses. This is also very fun to listen to.\\n\\n\r\n\tBoth the Japanese and English dubs are wonderful. I tend to like the English episodes more, since it is my actual language, but I have to say that when listening to the English version, I really missed \"Ai raaab yuu!\" \\n\\n\r\n\tCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\n\tAs with my other review, this will be the longest section as I am going to go into each character. \\n\\n\r\n\tHaruhi Suzumiya: Miss Suzumiya, much to my sadness, did not have very much development (which is why I gave this section an eight.) I'm trying to stray from spoilers, so please forgive me if this sounds vague. Although we see her shocked for the first time in the entire series, what could have been a chance for a change was not. Instead of letting Miss Suzumiya learn her lesson, Kyon, in his own way, apologizes for his mistreatment of her and she seems to easily let go of the whole ordeal. One could, however, argue that she did change a bit. Although it's not shown outright, I do believe that, after interacting with the Brigade so much, Miss Suzumiya is beginning to realize that her sometimes rash behavior affects others. So, as with the first season, perhaps she is on the path of change. \\n\\n\r\n\tMikuru Asahina: My favorite character does not play as important a role throughout this season, although she is important. We begin to see what she has to deal with as a Time Traveler, and begin to sympathize with her. She also becomes a little braver, as she is forced to, since she is playing the lead role in the Brigade's movie. Will this new courage be put to use in the future? We shall see...\\n\\n\r\n\tWe also see some hostility between Miss Asahina and Koizumi, as they believe completely different things regarding Miss Suzumiya. Neither one trusts each other, and Miss Asahina feels very guilty about this.\\n\\n\r\n\tYuki Nagato: Miss Nagato is perhaps the most important character in this season. She acts as a hero several times, saving Mikuru and Kyon on several occasions. Additionally we gain an enormous amount of respect for her, as she relives summer more than 15,000 times-and doesn't once complain. \"My job is to observe,\" she tells Kyon.\\n\r\n\tAlthough it is subtle, we also notice that Miss Nagato is beginning to feel emotions. She actually looks bored numerous times during \"Endless Eight,\" and once she even gives Kyon an almost sad, pleading expression. By this point, I'm sure everyone is encouraging her to continue down this path. \\n\\n\\n\r\n\tItsuki Koizumi:  This season is very important to Koizumi. Several times we are reminded what we know about Koizumi's true self: nothing. However, we do learn a few things during those rare instances when his facade begins to crack. Now, this is merely my opinion, but I'm starting to believe that Koizumi is in love with Haruhi. In all eight conversations Koizumi has with Kyon while stargazing, it's blatantly obvious that Koizumi wants to \"grab Miss Suzumiya from behind and whisper \"I love you\" into her ear,\" however numerous times he states that he cannot. He almost looks regretful, which is very different from his usual smile (of course, these expressions only last a moment.) There are also numerous instances where he calls Miss Suzumiya \"lovable\" and \"charming.\u201d  Whether this is a slip of the tongue, and whether it is supposed to indicate something, I believe yes, it is. However, I know a lot of people have different views.\\n\\n\r\n\tAs mentioned earlier, we also learn that he and Miss Asahina have a large disagreement when it comes to Miss Suzumiya. Koizumi has actually told Kyon that he doesn't trust her (although he dismissed this with a joke; but when is he ever really joking?). Even so, he's still very polite to her, which I admire. \\n\\n\r\n\tKyon: If anyone changes in the season, it's Kyon. He changes both positively and negatively, though. There was a time when he was so mad at Miss Suzumiya he nearly hit her (and would have succeeded had it not been for Koizumi's intervention.) But, now he's beginning to trade his unmotivated ways to more involved ones. \\n\\n\r\n\tI've never loved nor hated Kyon, and I can't say that this season has changed that. I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing, however.\\n\\n\r\n\tAll the characters are, just as last season, wonderful, diverse, and unique. I promise they will not disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\n\tEnjoyment: 10\\n\\n\r\n\tLovely music, characters, and art make this wonderful to enjoy. \\n\\n\r\n\tOverall: 9\\n\\n\r\n\tAlthough some may complain about this season, I believe it was bold, unique, and very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to new and old fans alike.\\n\\n",

            "content": "I think by the time Endless Eight arrived in June, people have forgotten about Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody, which was my 2nd favourite story (First being Disappearance) but that was about the only good episode of the second series. While as far as I know,I can't give reviews on episodes separately, unfortunately, my review isn't going to be good about it but with endless eight its hardly surprising.\r\nI read the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody chapter in the novel, and it was worth reading. When I saw the first anime series first before reading the novels, I was thinking to myself that there was a lack of timetravel. And this being the first was very well executed. My personal favourite bits were the John Smith bit and Nagato's change, which would change Melancholy Part 4.\\n\r\nWhilst Endless Eight was a terrible idea, I could understand that it was to emphasis Yuki's emotions. But its not something I enjoyed watching. If you do like it, at least you can watch all 8 episodes on a repeat rather than play one episode over and over.\\n\r\nI was glad to see the back of Endless Eight. I did like Sigh, but it wasn't enough to heal the E8 wounds. Nevertheless, the plot was good, but it wasn't fantastic as those who saw the series back in 2006, we knew what was happening before it took place on screen.\\n\r\n8 Endless Eight episodes, 5 Sigh episodes, 1 Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody. My math says 6/14 episodes were good. Considering that 13/14 last time were good (Someday in the Rain was good, but only the first 3 viewings.) its a disappointment.\\n\\n\r\nUPDATE:\\n\r\nWondering why KyoAni did what they did, I decided to read the novel version of E8 (Translated, of course) and suddenly I knew. It's because the novel is from the point where summer has looped thousands and thousands of times and Kyon finds a way to stop it by getting the brigade to come to his house the next day. The novel made a good point of how the only proof of the loop was the sense of Deja Vu that we know Kyon and Koizumi (Although she never said so, probably Mikuru as well) were having. The anime version still tells the story from Kyon's perspective, but you experience what Yuki has been put through.",

There are other factors like the art, sound and character.\r\nI, unlike other people will give this a FAIR review, listen to my WHOLE opinion about Haruhi season 2 before you overlook this.\r\nOkay first the story of the first 9 episodes wasn't that good, lets say... um horrible. The endless 8 would've been better IF they made the number of episodes less or released 2 episodes at a time WITH actual development in the endless 8 arc.\r\nNOT to say the story ruinedeverything but I would give it a 5 for a least trying, anything below 5 for me is unwatchable, but it was bearable...\\n\\n\r\nThe art of course you will notice IF you look closely kind of looks like K-ON! and yes some people whine about it, but I think that it actually got better. For those people who think they stole the gestures, poses and other things from K-ON!, you fail to notice that its made by the same company Kyoto animation...\\n\\n\r\nAnimation for the previous season was a 9, since I THOUGHT the animation got better fps and art what not, it goes to a 10\\n\\n\r\nNow, people say Haruhi has lost some of her godliness, I don't see how but people say she does... Anyways, the characters were original and cool, BUT the character development had little to no change, probably at episode 9 but thats it.\\n\\n\r\nMy opinion on character in Haruhi season 1 was a 9, right now probably went down to a 7.\\n\\n\r\nNow the ops and ends of Haruhi were fantastic no more need to be said, it probably went down 1 because it was a little bit weaker than season 1's ops and ends.\\n\\n\r\nSound went from 10 to a 9.\\n\\n\r\nOkay now the enjoyment watching the endless 8... well, I didn't enjoy much at all...\\n\\n\r\nSo enjoyment went from 10 to a 9 then kept going to an 8, than a 7,6 then plummeted down to a 5.\\n\\n\r\nNow IF I were to give and overall it would be a 6\\n\\n\r\nNow IF we add the episodes after the endless 8\\n\\n\r\nStory from a 5 goes to a 7\\n\r\nArt stays at 10\\n\r\nCharacter at 7 goes to a 8\\n\r\nsound stays as 9\\n\r\nenjoyment from a 5 goes to a 8\\n\\n\r\nThis would be overall a 7-8\\n\\n\r\nNow if you don't like how I did this than go whine about it and make your own review, If you thought this review gave you second thoughts, than put this as helpful...",

            "content": "The second season of Haruhi Suzumiya. What a total crap it was compared to season 1. I really wonder what were the creators thinking. \r\nStory- 4\r\nOnce again SOS brigade goes on random adventures. There wasn't anything about how Suzumiya had such powers or anything else. Really this season was almost a filler if there wouldn't be said that Haruhi maybe isn't a GOD, but maybe she is someone who has been given godlike power by someone else. Also the world wasn't created by Suzumiya. Those 2 things were the only things that moved the story forward from total randomness. And I already had one ofthem figured out before the anime understood it itself. Endless 8 arc was the most boring 8th episodes that I have ever seen in any anime and I highly doubt that I will be more bored, because there is no chance I will be seeing something so unimaginative and stupid ever. Just one tip you are watching the endless eight arc then skip after episode 4 and go to episode 8th.\\n\\n\r\nArt- 7 \\n\r\nIt was beautiful, colorful and the background looked real well most of the time. Somehow Suzumiya seemed to been drawn lot more lazier and and looked weird. Also Asahin seemed to have really big eyes, even so big that it really seemed out of proportion.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 7\\n\r\nBest thing in this anime. The opening was very good, but for some reason it became a bit more and more boring the more you listen it. Also in the endless eights arc I seriously grew tired that everyone was saying the same lines every episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 3\\n\r\nFor some reason almost alll of the characters seemed to have gotten a brain disease that made there annoying traits even more annoying. For example Asahina became so much crybaby annoying that I wanted to just delete her. Haruhi wasn't that bad , but I still liked her in the 1st season better. I got a better understanding of how Suzumiyas brains work, but I have to say as a character she started to annoy me, because she did everything so wrong and never did she do anything even close to logic or realism. Itsuki was much more sneaky and his theorys about Haruhi made less sense then ever. Kyon and Nagato were the only ones that didn't seem to become any different, only Kyon in the Endless arc seemed really stupid, because he needed so many times to understand what to do. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 2\\n\r\n60% of this anime was the most boring thing I have ever seen, 30% was below average and only 10% was good. Basically I watched this anime, because of my will to see it through not because it was good . Also once your through the endless 8 arc it will only get better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 5\\n\r\nDon't watch it! Just don't! Even if you have to watch some anime then pick out some random anime, there is 90% chance it will be better then this one.\\n",

            "content": "I am going to try to make this review as unbiased as possible but it is very hard considering the... ehm... dreadfull turn of events\r\nThe sound, and characters are all fantastic as usual. My one complaint is that the art is not as high quality in the first episode as the rest of the season. Maybe it was a new guy, who knows...\r\nNow, Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody was very good except the art was sort of lazy. bouncing up and down is not the same thing as talking, but that is just my opinion. There is not much to say about this episode. It was veryemotional but i won't explain why because i don't want spoil anything.\\n\\n\r\nNow for Endless Eight *sigh*\\n\r\nWell, i don't want to say it's bad, but it's not very good either. The plot, while intresting is not intresting enough for 6 episodes (I am confident that it is only 6). KyoAni tryed a very new concept by showing an episode for every time loop. It is sort of like vantage point in that everytime time loops you the mystery becomes closer to being solved, except here it's from the same person perspective and slightly different everytime. Now while it is horrible to watch the same thing over and over again it's not really the same. Not only is the art completely redrawn for every episode, but they shorten the less significant part more and more. This is why i'm sure part 6 is the last because part 5 didn't even show the minor parts, it outlined what happened with a short dialog.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, while Endless Eight was a failiure it should not be looked at as \"the arc that killed haruhi\", there is still hope for this show i am sure. Fans have to remember that we still have Vanashment and after that we are nowhere near to completing the series. Some are complaining that it will be another 3 years until season 3 is completed. I am very doubtful that it will take that long. KyoAni and Kadokawa will realize how many fans they are losing and try to recover somehow, preferably by speeding up progress of the 3rd season.",

This is my first review, so please bear with me.\r\nThis is the first anime I have saw that air eight episodes which filled with the same thing over and over again. I'm mad at the first time, but now I understand why KyoAni decided to take such risky choice. KyoAni is making us to feel the frustated Nagato Yuki that she's the only one who knows that she's doing the same thing over and over again, but she can't do anything.\r\nYuki have doing the same thing 15,521 times, imagine how tired she is. If you watchedall of the Endless Eight, you'll realize it. When there's nobody knows that they're repeating two weeks 15,521 times, she knows it. How painful it is when you repeat the same action everytime. This arc were designed to bore us, and to understand how Yuki feels. The main character on the Endless Eight are not Kyon neither Haruhi, but Yuki. This is my own opinion, so if you disagreed, please leave a feedback on my profile!\\n\\n\r\nAbout the others, here are my ratings.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nOverall: 8",

All found it boring and cuz of that arc it lost its popularity, watchers couldn't stand watching it 8 times the same. I will make it short, I didn't dropped that one for a non sense reason, it couldn't be bad cuz its Haruhi the same Haruhi thataired in 2006 and I don't see why all started to comment bad or give bad reviews.

            "content": "Cute At Times, But Terrible Storytelling...\r\nSorry to everyone else that loved this show, but I think it only deserved 4/10 -- i.e. \"below average\". Here's why:\r\nThe entire story line basically didn't make any sense. There is supposed to be a super-secret time traveling alien beings affecting everyday life, but this part of the story is completely botched. On the one hand, we have Haruhi who starts out quietly and smugly ignoring everyone, and then suddenly picks Kyon to become her partner in starting a school club. From that point on, she's hyper full of energy, sociable and wanting to be involved in everything. What madeher change? No explanation. No deep character studies either, we know nothing about them other than how they interact with each other over the school year. Then we have a second character, Mikuru-chan that somehow traveled back in time and cannot return to her time -- yet that part of the story is never really developed. Instead, she's basically used as a comic foil for Haruhi to manipulate and embarrass as she sees fit. The main plot point of the story, the repeating two weeks of summer, takes 8 episodes to resolve -- 8!! So unbelievably boring, boring, boring! After the first two cycles through, I didn't want to see it repeat again. Definitely not 8 times. Definitely did not need more than 2 -3 episodes to resolve that mystery. Haruhi herself is attributed some to have supernatural power, but if she does, it never actually appears. Instead, she's bossy and arrogant throughout the series, and only at the end does Kyon ever confront her about it. Kyon himself is dark and grouchy throughout the whole story. The only really interesting character is Nagato, but of course we never find out much about her.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: it was not terrible, but the plot was so weak and repetitious that it became a chore to finish the series. If you skip it, you won't miss much.",

            "content": "Okay, so before you hate on my review, I will tell you, I haven't watched as much Anime as some others have watched, so if any of my comparisons or technicalities sound off, I apoligize. Anyway, onto my opinion of \"Season 2\".\r\nArt and Sound 9/10: I think they are both well done and I don't really have any complaints. Nothing stood out to me and thusly there's nothing wrong with it. \r\nCharacters 6/10: The character department is where I started to see a dip in what I was really enjoying about the first season. I felt like in Season 1, the viewer was told basicallywho the character was and you could start to guess what they were doing and why they were doing it (Ie Yuki isn't going to go starting a conversation or get involved because she's a quiet character). In Season 2 I felt like I was getting bashed in the head with blatant points on who the character was. Mikuru started to get rather annoying during \"The Sigh of Haruhi\" with all her \"cuteness\".  *kinda spoiler, if you don't want it skip to the next paragraph* I also felt as though they were really selling Kyon and Haruhi loving each other way too much. I enjoyed how the first season told you it was a possibility but left it open ended enough that you could talk yourself out of it.  It's not a big issue, I just didn't like that. \\n\\n\r\nStory 6/10: *sigh*. Those Endless Eight were more boring than reading Technical Manuals. However, I'm sure reading this you've already read/heard about them. Personally, I think it could've been done in 3 episodes. I mean, I get that the 8 episodes connect you and make you feel in a time loop, but there's no excuse for being that boring. Moving on, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an interesting case, because I wouldn't exactly call it a Slice of Life, but I wouldn't exactly say it has a juicy plot. I felt like Season Two moved closer to having plot, but didn't necessarily get there. Which left me for all but 2 episodes begging for something to happen. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8/10:  I did enjoy this Anime however, don't get me wrong, it was totally worth my time (and it would have been even more so had I not watched the 8). The same humor is back for the most part and it never fails to make you smile.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Although this is my first review I'll try to remain as unbiased as possible. \r\nThis is one of the first times I've ever been so sincerely disappointed in an Anime. I've seen how people react to the Endless Eight arc and I agree completely with them, watching eight of the same episodes in a row was about as fun as getting a root canal through the ass. But beyond that, this show contributed so little to the actual story of the series you'd may as well just watch the first episode and be done with it.\r\nBut despite all my griping there were times when thisAnime was genuinely enjoyable for me albeit they be few and far between. I liked the new OP but that's about all I can say as far as the Sound quality, not bad but not outstanding in any way. \\n\\n\r\nThere was some character development and you do see sides of the main character you haven't seen before, but they don't really go any deeper than that. I really didn't get too know any characters any better. Kyon's still irritated with Haruhi. Haruhi is still a God/Time Distortion/\"product of biological evolution capable of generating new information and surpassing previous limitations to be spontaneously born in the universe\". Itsuki still kisses Haruhi's ass on a daily basis and invades Kyons personal space. Mikuru is still an oblivious ditz. And Yuki's.. well... Yuki I guess. \\n\\n\r\nAs soon as I saw the first episode I noticed that there was likely some budget cuts in the animation. It may be just my opinion but the art in the first season was much more crisp. It felt like they completely changed the feel of the anime. To me the first season had a surreal feeling, it was relaxing, this season it made me wanna punch adorable kittens. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all this is a series that tried to be innovative or \"Unique\" and then gracefully fell straight on its face. If you're a fan of the series (like me) save yourself the disappointment and hope the Movie turns out better.",

            "content": "To be honest I expected more from the 2nd season. When I heard about the Endless Eight I was really disappointed. The Endless Eight arc is kinda boring but well, I watched all episodes. There are also a lot people who only watch the 1st, 2nd and last episode of this arc, something I recommend doing since you won't miss anything.\r\nSo, after Endless Eight there are 6 episodes left, 1 \"stand alone\" and another arc: The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya. The Sigh okay, the story is decent. The only thing that was really bothering me was Haruhi's behavior during this arc.\r\nWhen I finished the 1stseason I couldn't really understand why everybody disliked Haruhi so much. True, she's a bit too energetic but I thought it was kind of enjoyable in it's own way. But then I watched \"The Sigh\"and I began to understand it. Haruhi became more and more selfish with episode and really went overboard at some point. Since the Sigh is mainly about the making of the movie \"The adventures of Mikuru Asahina\" the story isn't that good (I didn't really liked that movie). However, there are some interesting parts in it which make it more ejoyable. Especially the last episode has some nice moments in it so it's not that bad.\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was okay, the background music was good and the characters were also nice. They didn't changed a lot compared to the first season so they gave the same vibe/feeling as in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nDespite my complaints I rate the 2nd season with a 7. The Endless Eight idea was original and they took a risk to animate it, something they should get some credit for. I also liked Kyon more in this season, he stood a bit more up for himself, something I've been waiting for. I can't say I really recommend the second season, especially not if you didn't liked the first season that much but it's worth giving it a try if you're a fan :)",

            "content": "In a sentence: who decided to give the best animation in Japan to the most tiresome and worthless stories?\r\nThis team has clearly selected some incredibly talented writers and artists for the job. Unfortunately, the job is rescuing all the scraps off the cutting-room floor of the first season. \r\nNot much happens. The loops are very good at putting the viewer through the sensation of a time loop. It's frustrating to be stuck watching the same thing happen over and over. However, it was also incredible to see the continuity of all the locations looking the same in each loop despite the slight changes in angleand perspective. They could have recycled animation, it would have been very easy to do and nobody would have noticed. But each time had slightly different clothes, \"camera\" angles, shot composition, etc. They deserve a gold star for finding so many ways to tell the exact same story and be natural about it. \\n\\n\r\nI expected that after the infamous and dreaded Endless Eight arc, the other episodes would get back to a higher quality of writing. Unfortunately, the remaining episodes plod through backstory that we didn't need to see, uninteresting bits that the first season skipped over, wisely. It's got all the stakes of a prequel, which is what happens when you place your climax right before the first episode. \\n\\n\r\nThey try to insert some themes, some intrigue, but the fabric of the story is inherently unintriguing and they're forcing it. It all adds up to nothing and none of this really affects anything from the first season. It just feels like a grimdark reboot. OOC characters, oppressively dark and heavy tone retroactively ruining the fun of the previous season. \\n\\n\r\nThe Endless Eight arc runs in circles to fill time with meaninglessness, and the other episodes aren't really any better. All the same, the animation was so beautiful it hurt. The OP and ED are some of the best I've heard. Moment to moment, the writing is strong, but the plot is \"things that could conceivably have happened between the scenes and yet have no bearing on the original scenes whatsoever.\" I didn't like it.",

            "content": "It's the Endless Eight. And a little extra. It's got a reputation. Many people think that this entry in the series is just worthless. It's not. It has some things going for it. I don't even think the idea of running 8 similar episodes back-to-back is that bad, so long as it is executed properly and has a good payoff. In this particular instance, the payoff just isn't there. For the other episodes, they definitely felt less entertaining than the best episodes of the original series, though the filming process episodes pay off in spectacularly in the Mikuru Adventures episode. The characters also don't geta ton of love in the series, which, while not necessarily a 'strong' point to the series, is still meaningful. You get less of Kyon's eccentric monologues and less of Yuki being super sick, and that sucks. Really, Haruhi 2009 just ends up being more boring than the original series, and that's a bummer. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Pros & Cons]\\n\r\n[+] Marked increase in art quality. Still never really 'exciting', but always clean and can hit certain moods.\\n\r\n[+] Sound design still good.\\n\r\n[+] The film production episodes make Mikuru Adventures of the original series just insanely funny. \\n\r\n[-] Characters don't get a whole lot of love.\\n\r\n[-] Overall, story is bland.\\n\r\n[-] Endless Eight does not have the payoff it needs in order to be successful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Endless Eight Structure]\\n\r\nThere are warranted complaints about the Endless Eight structure. Mostly under the premise that there is no real reason to subject an audience member to that level of asinine plot structure just so that the series can achieve some level of notoriety or novelty. In this case, I agree. But that is only because there is no payoff, not because the idea itself is poor. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea itself is functional, and in fact maybe great. If episodes are nearly identical, our brains will ideally amplify any differences or oddities we see. This setup provides a great environment for audience members to do their own detective work and gather their own conclusions about the puzzle at hand, whatever that may be. At the end of the cycle, the path to a resolution can be revealed, and it can be very dramatic. Also, the audience gets to see how their conclusions measure up to the real thing. I think this structure has loads of potential.\\n\\n\r\nSo where does Haruhi go wrong? First, it is impossible to draw conclusions. Events happening are pretty much the same, there is no trial and error done by Kyon or the rest of the cast, so there is no way we can get a handle on what Haruhi is regretting. Second, the payoff is too small. In essence, the reason why Haruhi doesn't want summer to end is very touching and significant, but it doesn't come across that way in the series. If Haruhi could fix these things, I think Endless Eight could be great!\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 3\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 7 \\n\r\nCharacter: 3\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nOverall: 4\\n",

The subtle differences between clothing, dialogue, and angle led me to take a deeper look at the personalities of each character.

It was brutal to watch, and i ended up just skipping around it for the most part.\r\ntheir were only two other \"arcs\", a mediocre 5 parter, based around haruhi and crew making a movie was the other big one. It really doesn't have much substance and can be condensed into a 2 parter easily.

Together with some details I heard about the announcements and advertising prior the airing in 2009 I would even go so far to accept this all as part of the performance and using such ordinary tools in this way deserves respect.\r\nSo for once and all: Haruhi Suzumiya no Yuutsu is one single anime. We dont have any reasonfor a separation of the later produced parts. And to state that also clearly, the very special level of quality is hold entirely through. \\n\\n\r\nBase of the series is a number of illustrated novels. Just the script and through the illustrations the characterdesign is given. To create from this an anime a lot of visual art is requested to get the characters alive in a proper surrounding and not smaller is the importance of the contributions of actors, musicians and sound artists.\\n\r\nThe result here finally came to the screans in 2009 is what I am forced to call outstanding.\\n\r\nThe way the studio delivered an extremely rich and carefully executed animation, with an entirely beautiful, thoughtful backgroundsetting, a voice acting so carefully modified, sound and music always according the quality level and dramatic requirements ... this all of a piece, never in any way loosing the balance and the focus for the whole - great!\\n\r\nTo create it was surely a great fun for all involved and this passion can be felt all over.\\n\r\nIn anime no hot day was stickier than here, no nameless sister was more plausible child than Kyons, no empty shopping mall was livelier than the one tortured by the movie crew, no bottle had a greater presence than the one thrown away by kyon during the cultural festival, and, and, and...\\n\r\nAnd so the unbelievable story lackadaisical Kyon Kun is telling us is unavoidable confronted with not less than the opulence of the pulsing world and not just with an alian, a time travaller and an esper. Of course... thanks to Haruhi ...",

Boy was I wrong.\r\nStory: It does have a very good story. But the way its delivered was absolutely unbearable. With the Endless Eight which is the same episode eight times in a row and having to wait a week for new episodes. I read the light novel for Endless Eight, and from reading it, I know they could have delivered a great story, MUCH better. \r\n It only had three stories in it which was a major dissapointment becauseI was hoping for an animated version of The Dissapearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. But I was very happy with how they did Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody and The Sighs of Haruhi Suzumiya because they kept a lot of the dialogue very accurate to the books. \\n\\n\r\nArt: The newer, as some will call it, a K-ON! sort of art style, is very pleasing and cute. I think its something thats not such a big change that it'll make us angry but instead, make us like the new art style better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good sound and music as always, I didnt notice much difference than the first season though. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The characters are the same as the first season, each one is extremely unique and interesting. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment/Overall: Not horrible but certainly something I won't be downloading or probably even watching again. Well, maybe I'll end up watching Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody or The Sighs again, but Endless Eight was probably the dumbest thing that KyoAni has ever done. Oh well, one can only hope there will be another season going more in depth with different arcs from the other books, or, who knows, maybe even a movie. I vote for a Dissapearance movie!",

            "content": "Okay, so this is my first review, so bear with me.\r\nI hear/see a lot of people bashing this season for Endless Eight. Let me just get this straight: I loved Endless Eight, and would watch it again. This is my favourite series of all time, and I was not at all disappointed by this season.\r\nOverall comments: \r\nKyoto Animation must have forgotten that they weren't drawing K-On. Mikuru's and Haruhi's faces looked like Yui's sometimes and Koizumi's face almost always looked like Mio's. That's the only complaint I have. As for the theme music, I liked B\u014dken Desho Desho (the first season's opening) better, but SuperDriver was still good. As for the endings, I personally liked Tomare better than Hare Hare Yukai.\\n\\n\r\nArc 1: Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody (episode 1)\\n\r\nThis was very close to its light novel counterpart (The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya, chapter 2). No other comments.\\n\\n\r\nArc 2: Endless Eight (episodes 2-9)\\n\r\nI would not know how close this is to its light novel counterpart (The Rampage of Haruhi Suzumiya, chapter 1). This is the arc that everybody hates since it consists of a time loop and spans eight episodes of very similar material. However, there are minute differences that keep you guessing. The arc seems mostly like a mystery, where you have to guess at the cause. Though I haven't read this arc in the novels yet, I do know that it didn't have nearly as much of an impact in the manga, and I believe that I would like the anime version of this arc the most, even over the novel version. Kyoto Animation did a fantastic job on this arc, and was probably my favourite in the season.\\n\\n\r\nArc 3: The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya (episodes 10-14)\\n\r\nThis is extremely accurate to the novel of the same name. Very well executed, mice effects. Very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I very much enjoyed this season. I liked it almost as much as the first season, and it makes me sad to see so many people hate it just because they can't appreciate Endless Eight.",

            "content": "Overall, I can say I enjoyed these extra episodes for their novelty and because I fell in love with the concept of Suzumiya universe. It takes a special formula to make me forgive boredom, and the endless eight has it in there. I would normally say that making your viewer purposefully bored is just a gimmick, and a really poor replacement for good storytelling, but I felt it brings to the forefront the overall aesthetic of the series; that you cannot take what the characters say as truths. You have to figure out what the universe is really like through your own observations. \r\n(Ill tryto keep this next part as spoiler free as possible, but caution anyway)\\n\\n\r\nIn the first season (if I remember correctly) there is a tiny subplot that is peppered in at random times, that tells you not to believe what the characters are telling you. Some characters tell you the others are lying, and some tell you that they could be lying themselves. The main character himself even question who the driving force behind events is. In this season, it also asks philosophical questions, like could an infinite emotionless being get bored. Then it asks you to take a walk in those shoes yourself. Or, it asks if you saw someone doing something morally wrong, would you stop them? Even if they were your friend? Even if they could destroy the universe? \\n\\n\r\nBut if you look at it from a different angle, why would a character who is highly oblivious by nature, be the driving force behind the endless eight. That character would assume that the event that needed to take place, already happened. Who in fact benefits most from the events in the endless eight. Who gets to see the girls in different yukata and swimsuits? Who avoids getting in trouble..?\\n\\n\r\nIn the Sigh arc, things also unfold a little bit differently than we were first told. Like for the fact that there is no closed space when Suzumiya is depressed? There is an explanation given, one that i feel is unsatisfying unless you take into account that the person giving the explanation could be lying. Because it seems to me that the world is a whole lot less fantastical when Kyon is pissed at Suzumiya...\\n\\n\r\nThese things also bring into question events in the first season, the biggest being; why does Kyon seem to be the center of everyone's attention? \\n\\n\r\nMaybe I read too much into things, and that may be where most of my enjoyment of this second season comes from, and that most people will probably like it less than I. \\n\\n\r\nThere is also a big criticism that could be placed that after six episodes, there is no real relationship development between the two main characters (unless you switch there roles)... \\n\\n\r\nAnyway I rate this 9/10, on a personal taste scale, not a general everyone should love this too scale.",

That's the only flaws you can point out? At least \"The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya\" was great. Also, I am not watching it weekly, this show already finished airing so, it's safe to say that I skipped it.\r\nNow, I watched this in Broadcasting order so, here are the episodes I watched from 14-28.\r\nEndless Eight (Skipped)\r\nEndless Eight (Skipped)\r\nEndless Eight (Skipped)\r\nEndless Eight (Skipped)\r\nEndless Eight\r\nThe Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya I\r\nThe Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya II\r\nThe Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya III\r\nThe Sigh of HaruhiSuzumiya IV\\n\r\nThe Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya V\\n\r\nMikuru Asahina's Adventure - Episode 00\\n\r\nLive A Live\\n\r\nThe Day of Sagittarius\\n\r\nSomeday in the Rain (Watched it but then, I decided to skip around the beginning)\\n\\n\r\nNow, I am going to explain the story in my point of view. Not Nagato, Asahina or Koizumi's point of view. The story is about this one girl named Haruhi Suzumiya. She wished for an alien (Nagato), time traveler (Asahina) and an esper (Koizumi). Her wished came true by either creating another world or rewriting the current world. I believe she also wished for Kyon to be with her. That's when their adventures begin. There's no \"main plot\" so, it's just an adventure by arcs.\\n\\n\r\nI do believe that the point of the TV show was for character development. Where the show kicks in is really the movie which, I'll be watching next.\\n\\n\r\nTo me, the adventure was great and very entertaining. I guess the flaws I can point out was a bit of the Endless Eight and they ended the show with a really boring episode. Although, the REAL ENDING was at Episode 10 (24 in Broadcasting Order).\\n\\n\r\nThe best arc has got to be The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya. This was the arc where I really got close with the characters and it was one of the most entertaining arcs to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also superb especially at the Endless Eight. I am surprised that each episode, yes, it was repeated but the difference is that each time loop has different perspectives. Different point of views and there are a little bit changes. Kyoto Animation really wasted their budget on it despite on how bad the arc was.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the animation during The Adventures of Mikuru was really good. They put a \"film tone\" on to it like it's recorded on a 240p camera. Also, during the Live Alive episode, the fluidity between the instruments and the music was a job well done. Also the syncing when Haruhi Suzumiya was singing.\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening theme and the second opening theme was great. Also, I love the first ending theme. Seriously, that was very catchy. For the OST, it's not the best but, it works for a show like this. It really fits.\\n\\n\r\nWell, I suffered from the Endless Eight but I skipped it anyways. The last episode though was painful to watch but other than that, the characters is why I enjoyed the show. Haruhi Suzumiya is a cheerful girl, Kyon (Not his real name) is the one that narrates the show. I like this dude especially on how he narrates which really adds an enjoyment factor. Nagato is the quiet one. Asahina is the shy one and Koizumi is the guy that just smiles and just follows what Haruhi Suzumiya says.\\n\\n\r\nThey maybe typical but for me, it's how they blend and interact with each other which really feels like an adventure to me.\\n\\n\r\nIs this anime great? YES. I didn't really enjoy this anime at the start but as it goes on, it's very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend you don't rush when watching this anime or you won't get any character development (Except for Endless Eight and Someday in the Rain).\\n\\n\r\nOverall, great anime and it is very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nScore: 8.6/10",

            "content": "I loved the first \"season\" of this series. The ending left me wanting more. It started well with the brilliant \"Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody.\" Then came Endless Eight. When I watched the first episode of Endless Eight, I actually quite enjoyed it. This time there's nothing going wrong! It's just the last week of summer and everyone's having fun. After that I watched the second episode of Endless Eight. Well, this doesn't seem so bad. I've only already watched the first one and I don't mind seeing it again. Then the third one, and the fourth one. Pretty soon it got really boring. Instead of actuallywatching the fifth and sixth, I just played free cell while listening to the dialogue. \"Kyon-kun, Denwa.\" After that, it just got boring. For the seventh and eighth ones, I just watched the first three minutes and then skipped to the end. When I heard Kyon shout \"I HAVEN'T FINISHED MY LIST YET!\" I cheered. It was finally over. However, that was the biggest waste of 3 hours and 15 minutes of my life. But I guess this season can be redeemed by The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya, as I found that especially interesting, because this time I had actually read the book before watching. The only problem I have with this is with Endless Eight. If they had taken Endless Eight and made it into Endless Two, or even Endless Three, then I would have been much happier. However, Endless Eight takes up more than half of this \"season,\" so that constitutes one major glaring flaw of this series. But I probably wasn't as pissed as some other fans of the series, because I had only found out about the series this January, not in 2006, when the first \"season\" was originally aired. Now, despite the fact that I hated Endless Eight with a passion, the one other redeeming quality is the voice cast. Y\u016bko Got\u014d, Minori Chihara, and my absolute favorite Seiy\u016b ever, Aya Hirano all performed quite excellently. Super Driver was a great opening theme (although I do prefer Bouken Desho Desho from the first season) and I liked the ending theme.",

            "content": "I can't believe I managed to watch all of the Endless Eight episodes. That god-forsaken aboministic arc where the same crap happens for 5-6 episodes. I could have skipped to the last episode of the \"Endless Eight\" arc but I decided to watch every single second of the arc without skipping. Few people liked the arc so I told myself \"why the hell not\". \r\n[Story]: (4/10)\r\nOn the first day of high school, a beautiful girl named Haruhi Suzumiya introduces herself as having \"no interest in ordinary humans\". She asks for any aliens, time travelers, or espers to join her. Watching her weird behavior is Kyonwho sits in front of Haruhi. Kyon unwittingly gives Haruhi an idea to start her own after school club. Thereafter Kyon and several others find themselves dragged, literally, into the Save our world by Overloading it with fun Suzumiya Haruhi's Brigade or S.O.S Brigade for short. \\n\\n\r\nI could have rated this 1, but I didn't because I'm a fan of the Haruhi series. I tried to be more generous at my rating but it's insane that they fucking filled 8 episode slots with the same shit. Yes, it's the \"Endless Eight\" arc where the majority of the viewers hated the arc and some even dropped the series. There are some in the minority that liked it for God knows why. I thought the second season would be as enjoyable as the first season but in reality, it's not. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the \"Endless Eight\" arc is it's the same shit for 8 episodes. 1st episode started out like a normal episode. The 2nd episode started out like the first but reveals that they are in a time loop. The 3rd-7th episode is literally the same but with some few minor changes (their clothes, how the scene plays out, etc) that is not worth wasting your time. The 8th episode is the conclusion of the arc where Kyon finally does something to stop the loop. Why didn't they just do the 1st, 2nd, and 8th episode of the arc? The arc could have been finished in 3 episodes but they decided to do 8? Did they run out of source material to adapt or something? They should have filled those slots with a filler. A filler is better than getting the same episodes over and over. \\n\\n\r\nThere's also the 1st episode of the season which is important if you want to watch the sequel which is the movie. There's also the second arc named \"The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya\" which spanned into 5 episodes. Honestly, this is what saved the show from being a total abomination. It's a nice arc that explains what happened behind the scenes before they finished the movie called \"The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina\" which I loved by the way. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (9/10)\\n\r\nAt least you get to gaze at the beautiful animation while watching the \"Endless Eight\" arc. It looks helluva lot better than the first season and the first season's animation already looks perfect to begin with. The characters looks more beautiful and detailed, the environment..especially the sunshine looks perfect. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Sound]: (9/10)\\n\r\nThere weren't really a lot of background themes in this season. Even if there was, they're probably all the same and some re-hashed from the 1st season. The OP theme song is \"SuperDriver\" by Aya Hirano and the ED theme song is \"Tomare\" by Aya Hirano, Yuko Goto, Minori Chihara. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song sounded a lot better than the 1st opening and had made it into my favorite anime OP. The ED theme song sounds decent but I still like the funny ED theme song from the 1st season. \\n\\n\r\nI watched the show in English Dub so I'm going to review the English VA. They all re-cast their roles so nothing changed about them. They're still the great old same voice. \\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8/10)\\n\r\nI don't really know how to expand this category..This season is not really a sequel so nothing really major happened with the characters (Except Ep.1), nothing interesting happened, NOTHING! No new characters were introduced either.\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (5/10)\\n\r\nI had to watch all of the \"Endless Eight\" episodes without skipping so I can experience what they went through, excluding the part where they waited a week just to see the same crap. Worst. Experience. Ever. I did enjoy the \"Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody\" and \"The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya\".\\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (5/10)\\n\r\nThe second season of the famous \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" is just downright terrible. The \"Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody\" and \"The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya\" is a great arc but not enough to save this show from being an abomination because of that god-awful \"Endless Eight\" arc. If you only watch the 1st, 2nd and 8th episode of the \"Endless Eight\" arc then continue watching the rest of the episodes normally then you might enjoy this season.  There is a sequel to the series called \"The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya\" which really surprised/impressed the crap out of me. That will be touched on in my later review. \\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Outstanding Animation\\n\r\n+Great Soundtrack\\n\r\n+Great Characters\\n\r\n+The 1st and 3rd arc saved the show from being a total shit. \\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Mediocre Season\\n\r\n-Endless Eight Arc\\n\r\n-8 episodes of literally the same crap",

            "content": "Last time (MAL-> refer to animenfo), I gave Haruhi 2006 a perfect 10/10 in all categories - the only anime I have done so to. Now, all you readers may have different opinions and rating systems, and a lot of you cannot support reasons for your ratings or just plain did not enjoy what you watched. Here in this review I will show why Haruhi is such a highly rated and enjoyable (and overrated/overhyped) show, and that this second season, which fills in chronologically missing stories, is still a great show.\r\nI'll get this out of the way first: Endless Eight almost killed this season. Weeks11 to 18 were broadcast to be the same one-episode story arc, all individually animated and voice acting worked. This daring decision by Kadokawa and Kyoto Animation had an obvious resulting effect, losing many viewers and decreasing the loyalty of the fans. While it could have been a two-three story arc, they decided to do it eight times over just to fulfill the titular promise. One inference is that we would feel the same melancholy as Yuki Nagato does (15498+ times the two weeks = 597+ years), but from an anxious fan-base's point of view it does not work at all, especially if 8/14 new episodes will not guarantee that the highly-anticipated \"Disappearance\" arc will get animated. We viewers waited three years for them to continue the hype, and they disappoint us with this near-insane scapegoated approval of planning this misuse of animation budget. Plain bad business modeling as even a fan-base of hundreds of thousands will have an upper limit in loyalty. It also has low rewatch value, seeing as the middle six episodes are almost not worth touching anyways.\\n\\n\r\nHOWEVER, Endless Eight itself is a very good story filled with lots of fun and adventuring. Why are we wasting our summers studying, schooling, and sitting in our couches watching anime when we should be doing fun activities outside the house with our friends and family? It should last forever! True to Haruhi's personality, an assortment of activities enlisted Kyon and the rest to wear themselves out for their last two weeks of vacation, never with a dull moment.\\n\\n\r\nDirection-wise, Endless Eight is also very well done. Each episode had its own individual storyboard, with many unique techniques to showcase the story for each iteration whether it be red herrings, unrecycling recycled animation, breakdown (as in shortening or worse in telling; subjective flavour) of a repeated plot, rising tension at every \"conclusion\", etc. It is almost compellingly fun (or a chore, if you are bored; you should not be bored! Get outside and do something!) to spot the differences in all the episodes, such as the stylish wardrobes, animation of almost all the activities Haruhi listed, delivery of lines (Kyon-kun, denwa!), drawing styles (sometimes their faces have been K-ON!-fied, sometimes CLANNAD, as per production team), and many more! You can tell the animators had a lot of fun (as a 10/10 in animation would tell you) working on the Haruhi franchise even if they knew they shot their source of money in the foot. All-in-all there were a lot of creative direction differences, all adding to the experience of watching this eight weeks in a row (for the most loyal viewers, anyways, like me!).\\n\\n\r\nI'd say Endless Eight should deserve three paragraphs max, as should have the number of episodes. Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody was an excellent reintroduction to the season, with plot points very important to later-on story arcs. I shall now discuss the only other story arc: The Sighs of Haruhi Suzumiya.\\n\\n\r\n\"Sighs\" is not the best story to be told, but author Nagaru Tanigawa has been penning smart things throughout the series. When I first read \"Sighs\", I was not very amused with details that will be explained below (skip paragraph if you feel you will be spoiled). If you have not noticed, I really dig around the community to find other people's opinions and insights on a series before I do a huge review on them (case in point: Lucky Star, ef, Rozen Maiden). In this case, \"Sighs\" should have been retitled \"Jealousy\". \"Sighs\" tells of the making of the infamous \"Episode 00\" movie in the span of five episodes. Haruhi was shown in a bad light through most of it, and we all wonder how Kyon can stand up to most of it. But if Kyon survived through the strange happenings in \"Melancholy\", then surely he can withstand the various immoral acts that Haruhi forces upon the SOS Brigade, especially upon pitiful Mikuru. But after finding out the reason (and it was explained in the last episode that I could have missed if I did not know beforehand...), I now have more appreciation for Haruhi's character and why she is the way she has been written to be. Yes, Haruhi can be extremely (bossy) sometimes, but she just proves that she's having a lot of fun, especially with her new-found friends she recruited only months ago.\\n\\n\r\nAnd of course, the supernatural phenomenon surrounding Haruhi is always fun to watch, especially now that Shamisen's ability to speak has been revealed (like it wasn't obvious...). Kyon also gained some more character development, especially through \"Sighs\". Our once normal high school student has been changed (and still changing) with an eccentric girl in his life, as we normal folks should also (have been) be blessed with. I'll say, the ending to \"Sighs\" is really good!\\n\\n\r\nNow that I've reviewed the second season, let's show to you folks not rating Haruhi higher than an 8 (SUBJECTIVE) why Haruhi should be the defining cultural icon of the 2000's. As a disclaimer, I do not support unsupported 10/10's these people who cannot support their reasons with decent reasons give to Haruhi, and I do not wish to be associated with them, nor do I think your opinion of this show should be changed because of such poor writing and \"hating popular things is cool\" sort of attitude. I also don't support the disloyal fans going 1/10 just because of the Endless Eight arc; they are understandable, but a stupid rating nonetheless. By the way, think of the next few paragraphs as an extension of my previous first season's review, and that my main review for the second season ended a paragraph back.\\n\\n\r\nFirst of all, if you are watching anime especially of the high-school genre, then you should be aware of the Japanese cultures and customs. Japanese education is all about studying studying studying; never a fun moment. They get into universities just by memorizing facts, figures, and answers, hoping they do well on multiple-choice exams (as was shown in Love Hina and various). I am ever grateful to be educated in a western society, and it has taught me to be aware of many things like other country's cultures and values; but I am not in the concentration of arts (sciences FOR THE WIN), which is why I like reading about people's insights and analysis of the shows I watch! In this case, the author pens up an eccentric character who wants to relief the boredom and normality she is surrounded with, and within the Japanese culture, this is an original attitude to have; she has been shown to be outcast by her classmates, of course. He also pens up some stereotypical cast members dedicated to serve the current perverted tastes of the Japanese population (moe, or turn-ons, as explained in Melancholy I); feminism has a lower agenda there than in western civilization, and crowded commuting trains makes groping easy.\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi is meant to be about having fun in life and life in general. The comedy, supernatural phenomenons (includes the induction and prevention of), and philosophical questions come SECOND. If you are already having fun, I don't know why you are sitting around watching anime. For cryogenic cynics (it just sounds cool), then you won't have fun watching this. You COULD try an analyze this deeply, but I'd rather read about completed (and great) analysis other people have already written about this show. There are no \"funny jokes\", only satirical remarks that click or don't click. There are many mysteries, even supposed \"plot holes\" (heck, Sighs V had many \"holes\", but it added to the experience of watching) that are meant to be there to entice you - there is certainly no grand unified explanation for all the aliens, time travelers, and ESPers that exist in this anime, mostly because it isn't necessary to the PLOT, and that they really don't exist in the real world anyways. These theories about Haruhi and Kyon loving each other is just a romantic afterthought the author WANTED you to feel.\\n\\n\r\nFor the people who feel this is overrated, I shall tell you that NOT EVERYTHING MUST BE PERFECT FOR A SHOW TO BE PERFECT (subjective). There are MANY flaws (may you point them out to me because I see less than you do) in any show, including this one, and your experience suffers because these flaws nag you to no end. For example, characters are static (never change, never development, same traits throughout) because they are meant to be static. Please go back to high school English if you have never been taught about literary devices and the such. Of course, here in Sighs V Itsuki, Mikuru, and Yuki's roles are expanded by a bit with the conflicting organizations and minor plot details, but otherwise they are still the same as you have known them from the first season. Another example could be the \"weak\" main plot - perhaps the conversations about Haruhi being some sort of God might have zoned you out, but there is a point to all meaningful (and by that I mean the author penned it exactly the way he wanted it to be) dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nAs for why this show is overhyped... long story short, the movie (episode 00/11) was a unique way to start things off, partnered with great animation (especially AFTER the \"movie\" ended), and it took off from there. Everything else is an aftereffect.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point the reviewer ran out of ideas to rant about. Having entertained yourself to read this review, please vote/rate it! Thank you very much have a pleasant anime watching.",

            "content": "Season 2 of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. When this was released, I was more excited then I've ever been in anime history. The second season was good, really good in fact, but the only problem is that it wasn't as good as season 1. Why you ask? 2 words and a number... \"The Endless 8\". It was a normal day, much like this one... that's when I started the Endless 8. The reason I say endless is because the entire time I was thinking, will this chain ever break? Let me explain what \"The Endless 8\" actually is. It starts off as a normalepisode. Summer vacation, having fun, Haruhi wishes for something supernatural to happen, that's where it all begun. They go in an endless loop of the same episode, over and over and over. I don't know whether it was because the producers didn't have enough ideas, or they thought it would be funny to watch the children of the world suffer. Either way, I was angry, and I nearly jumped for joy once it was finally over. With that said, let's get on with this review.\\n\\n\r\nStory-wise, it was like the first season. There's a new story every time, and I've already told you about the Endless 8, so just put that in with episodes like the first season only different, you got season 2's story.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork was as good as season 1. All the characters look exactly the same, like no time has passed, so it looks like the animators are as good as ever.\\n\\n\r\nVoices remained the same, which I was happy about because I love Haruhi's voice. It wouldn't be the same if they changed it, and I'm sure all of you would agree with me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were as awesome as ever. Personalities remain awesome (Haruhi is as direct as ever, Nagato is still quiet, Kyon is still grumpy all the time, etc.), so nothing much has changed with the characters, and it should remain that way for future seasons.\\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I didn't enjoy it as much was because of the endless 8. I was skipping through those episodes waiting for something different to happen. The remaining episodes I watched were all funny and good.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a solid 9. If they had changed the endless 8 into the endless 3 or something, or made it a 2 part episode, that would've gotten me to give it a 10. Let's pray that there will be a season 3. Hope this review helped.",

            "content": "Infinite Time Loop Overkill the Anime:-\r\nBasically if you watch the anime in the broadcast order, this will be season 2, but the fact of the matter is that there are 4 episodes of season 1 that take place after season 2, chronologically speaking.\r\nBut since this page is dedicated to season 2, I will write about season 2 and nothing else. The most prominent thing about this season is the endless eight arc, which just killed the enjoyment. \r\nThe arc was about how Haruhi and the gang spent their summer vacation and how Haruhi still had some regrets because of which she did not want summervacation to end, resulting in an infinite time loop where the characters kept on repeating the final two weeks of summer vacation over and over again. \\n\\n\r\nThe idea might seem pretty interesting and might have actually been quite successful, if the producers hadn't given symbolism more importance than the fans.\\n\\n\r\nEndless Eight, is literally eight episodes long. Now, the ideal case might be showing the first summer vacation in one episode, revealing the time loop in the second and resolving it in that very episode. To keep things a bit slow, they could have used at most 3 or 4 episodes. 5 episodes would have been an overkill. What they did was kill that overkill ten times over. 8 FRIGGIN' EPISODES of the same friggin' things. The worst part was that almost everything was the same in the 8 episodes, same dialogue same scenes, same everything. If they were going to do something like that, they could have at least had some variations in dialogues, made the characters do different things or something. But the only variation was in camera angles and costumes and minor details in the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSo basically if you watch the Endless Eight arc fully, you are literally watching the same thing, the same twenty two minute long episode eight times over.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the rest of the episodes were kind of good. If you watch the anime in the broadcast order then the final 4-5 episodes might give you some information about the cultural festival that took place out of nowhere in the first season. \\n\\n\r\nBasically season 2 is not exactly a 12-14 episode new season as much as it is  a 6 episode OVA.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch it in the broadcast order, you will have something like 4-5 episodes left, if you watch in the chronological order, you will have somehting like 9 episodes left to watch. So, I will recommend you watch the entire thing in the chronological order.",

            "content": "This will be my first review, so if you have any tips or something to say about this review, dont hesitate to message me! :)\r\nI've completed the first season of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu with mixed feelings about the series. I wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not. This second season definitely helped me to get a much better understanding of the series as a whole, which is a very good thing, not all second seasons do that. \r\nWhen I started the second season, I didn't expect much of it, well, atleast not more than I expected from the first season. It startedout normally and took a turn I did not expect. \\n\r\nWell, I DID know about 'Endless Eight' before starting to watch.\\n\r\nAnd as you may have guessed, this review mainly focuses on E8. Well, I mean it's more than half of the season, it basically IS the season.\\n\\n\r\nTo get that out first, I really did enjoy E8. I mean, the idea itself is nothing new or spectacular, but the way KyoAni managed to put it in scene was absolutely... brave, to say the least. For those who don't know, 'Endless Eight' is a story arc, where our main characters are trapped inside a never ending summer, a timeloop. Basically, the same episode is repeated 8 times, with minor differences. Some may call it lazy, others call it a failed experiment. And I can totally understand why people would say that. It's not for everyone. But for some strange reason, the eight episodes did not feel like a burden to watch for me. The further I watched the more intense the feeling of curiosity became. I felt like I endured the same struggle as they did in the series. And all that tension built up to that one highlight, and you knew it was coming and you were excited and it was just so thrilling. I could not wait to see how they got out of the timeloop.\\n\\n\r\nThere were certainly some things wrong in E8, for example even though they knew that they were stuck in the timeloop a REALLY long time, they don't try a single thing. I mean after getting told you're doing the same thing for the 16000 time, don't you think a normal person would try about anything to get out of there?\\n\\n\r\nThe worst part about E8 is definitely the ending. I have to say, I was truly dissapointed by how they ended the arc like that. It felt like a slap in the face and then it was over so fast. It just didn't feel right. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, I feel like they could have done more with the idea, which was great in my honest opinion, but I can totally understand if some people hate it. But to say the least, it was a thrilling ride for me. And if the reviews on here have scared you away from this season, or the whole anime, I'd say give it a shot anyway, you can still skip the most of E8 and don't miss anything if you don't like it. E8 is something I will never forget.",

            "content": "This is my first time to write a review, please don't drag me...\r\nThis review is about the \"Endless Eight\" (not the whole series) arc or the so-called repetitive ****...\r\nStory - Since it was repetitive, its somewhat boring in a way for those who don't understand the true meaning of the 8 episodes that had aired all over and over again. Despite of being redundant it still deserve a 7 for making us experience a \"mini\" psychological test.\r\nArt - I admit it, it was being repetitive. But notice their clothes, the panorama, Yuki's drink (at the cafe), etc. Every episode has their \"unique\" types and setsof clothes. Like what the others said \"trying differently, though still the same\".\\n\\n\r\nSound - Nothing special, though the OP's melody sure is catchy.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - The same old class, though Haruhi smiles more often unlike from the first series. Kyon is still a slacker, Koizumi always smile, Yuki with the boring look, and Mikuru with the big tits.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - I somewhat \"enjoyed\" at the same time bored when watching the 8- long episodes of this arc. After I knew what really is the purpose of these redundant episodes I felt like \"wow\", the episodes centers not on Haruhi though she is the cause.\\n\\n\r\nEndless Eight Arc JUSTIFICATION:\\n\\n\r\nThis arc centers on but not really expressed on Yuki rather than Haruhi. Her bored-look is the clue to everything. The director of the show \"might\" want us to experience of what Yuki had felt among the 15 thousand+ repeating moments. Though it gained really harsh feedbacks, for those who understand and coped up with the story realized how important this repeating arc to everyone. That is to feel the feelings of the characters inside the story an this is through mentally and unconsciously.\\n",

            "content": "Before I begin let me first say that I loved the first season and was definitely excited for the second. However I was very disappointed. \r\nStory: 2\r\nThe first episode is the only \"original\" episode throughout the entire season. It's a good episode and you need to watch it in order to understand the movie which comes after this dreadful season. Then we get to the absolute worst part of the season: The Endless Eight. Episode 2 shows the SOS Brigade members enjoying their last two weeks of summer to the fullest. This is a good episode however the next 7 episodes that follow this arein a time loop and the episodes are nearly identical to each other. The only difference is episode 9 where the ending changes. I'm not going to lie, but I had to skip 3 episodes of this since it was that awful. There is no reason to watch episodes 3-8 at all. And finally after that we get 5 episodes on how the SOS Brigade Club made the movie from the first season. I would like to say that the movie episode from season 1 is easily one of the funniest and enjoyable episodes of the whole show, so I don't mind seeing how they made it. However this takes up 5 episodes which is a lot, considering they only had about 2 episodes of new content and ideas so this kind of feels lazy in a way. The 5 episodes are enjoyable but not great or hilarious, just good episodes. Like I said, this could and should have been about 2-3 episode long. \\n\r\nArt: 9\\n\r\nEasily the best part of season 2 has to be its animation. It looks better than season 1 since it was released 3 years later and I don't have a problem with it.\\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\r\nAfter season 1's God Knows and Lost My Music it's hard to top it. I do enjoy the music but because of the Endless Eight episodes you hear the exact same music played at the same time in the same setting so it gets old and repetitive. It's not the music's fault, it's the story's fault for being like this. \\n\r\nCharacters: 5\\n\r\nThe characters are good in episodes 1,2,9-14 because you see them do the exact same things over and over again throughout 7 boring and repetitive episodes. Like the sound, it's not the characters fault for being boring, it's the story's fault. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 3\\n\r\nI did enjoy the episodes not including the Endless Eight however because it takes up half of the season I just couldn't really enjoy it. To get the best enjoyment out this season I recommend episodes 1,2 and 9. Episodes 10-14 are optional and they're not bad they just take up 5 episodes. \\n\r\nOverall: 3\\n\r\nI just don't understand how no one on the team thought hey aren't you tired of doing the exact same thing over and over for 7 episodes. I mean season 2 is hard to recommend besides the episodes I mentioned earlier. Season 2 is a big disappointment and i don't know how people enjoy the Endless Eight at all.",

            "content": "This season of the show can be easily disjoined into 3 distinct constituents. Those being: the first episode, the first arc, and the second arc. The first episode would score an 7 by itself, the first arc 2, and the second arc a 5. Needless to say, the first episode carries the season, though there is nothing I can say about it that could be spoiler free (?). Having said that, we can discuss the arcs with more ease. The first arc is the same episode for 8 episodes and then a conclusion. I hope that's not much of a spoiler. The name of everyepisode is \"Endless Eight,\" so it shouldn't be much of a shocker. This arc serves one purpose and one purpose only: to develop a character and imbed an idea which would later become relevant and foster in the movie. There's not much to say other than I didn't quite appreciate it. Watch it once to get an idea the suffering one character had to endure. On rewatches, simply watch the first and last episode, some people might recommend more, but I wouldn't. The second arc serves as a set up for the first season. It plays off of the strengths of the first season without actually having any of those said strengths (refer to my review of that season for further clarification). This arc does what its supposed to and nothing else. It serves to develop the characters and fully flesh out the story while providing enough exposition for the movie. It's solid, and a must watch for this series.",

            "content": "The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that is well known for its fandom, especially in the otaku culture that separates the two roles of the fandom. None other than that, Haruhiism and Madokaism. But, I admit that this anime is an anime with a genre that combines all of its elements that become absurd story but is delightful to enjoy. In this review, I will discuss the two seasons at once. Initially, I've watched the first season of this anime a few months ago and I didn't understand at all what happened. After watching the second season last week, all of the episodesbecame fresher. However, both also have some flaws in it.\\n\\n\r\nNothing special at all about the plot of the story when seen from its synopsis. This anime is just an anime with a typical anime in general plots and clich\u00e9 characters in it. But what makes me stand when watching this anime is the genres. At first, I thought this was just an anime with a school and a slice of life story in which it was very cliche, making a weird club and wasting all the time in school. Sounded like a typical slice of life anime I thought. However, all of that immediately became mindblowing upon entering into the core problem. I immediately gape what just happened. The premise, a student who doesn't realize her strength that he is a god who can change the world situation. The merger between a slice of life, supernatural, to the mystery is the best thing I've ever seen from all of the anime I've watched. The entire arc is also heavily populated with a little twist but it's built up as there is an improvement in it. So, I'm not concerned about this but there are two ways you can do to watch this anime. The broadcast order where all of the episodes are told by date and the chronological order where all of the episodes are told according to a fresh and enjoyable plot. However, these two have their respective advantages and disadvantages. The broadcast order has everything where the characters are more develop and makes another atmosphere in it. The story is well conveyed to the end however, there are so many episode references that I think I'm confused how to explain it. I took the example, the first episode where the story focused on Mikuru Asahina. I'm also a bit confused what this means. However, you can overcome your confusion if you following the chronological order where the story looks different and delightful. However, the last episode seemed like it didn't complete anything and the character development is always up and down. I've watched both ways and it really feels like the difference. However, it's up to you how you guys watch it.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is created so solid by the Kyoto Animation. If I compare with both seasons, the episodes are always getting better and it's very felt once. The first season has an animation and art like old anime in general or takes the example of Clannad and Air. The second season has a fresh animation and art, the coloration is so great, and the more detailed it becomes. As if there is no flaw in it and I think, there really is nothing less about the art.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is the best of everything. Everything feels like memorable in the ear, especially the first ending by all of the heroine seiyuu in this anime. Plus, the choreography dance that performed by all of the characters in this anime also fits perfectly with the song. Of all the soundtracks I like the most, 'Super Driver' by Aya Hirano is very memorable to the point. The Song that seems like a vivid rock by a seiyuu from Haruhi Suzumiya, very catchy to hear. Speaking of Aya Hirano, I'm also very attached to the time she fills Haruhi Suzumiya's voice as if nothing else can compete with her. Minori Chihara who filled Yuki Nagato's voice is also very clean but sweet when hearing this seiyuu. Yuuko Gotou who fills the voice of Mikuru Asahina with her embarrassed voice but a sweet impression, I also like it. Tomokazu Sugita and Daisuke Ono I think is mediocre but they are also very suitable when filling the voice of Kyon and Itsuki Koizumi.\\n\\n\r\nWhen speaking of all it's characters, I think there is nothing special at all except Haruhi Suzumiya. Before talking about her, we start first with Kyon. Kyon is a typical student who used to believe in something supernatural like alien, esper, and time traveler. When entering high school, he immediately assumed that it was just nonsense. When he met Haruhi Suzumiya, she appeared to believe something like that. For Haruhi Suzumiya, if you already know why this anime is called melancholy because of this character always changing her traits every time. Sometimes the energetic nature comes out, the unconcerned nature, the essence of nature, the nature that always commands the will of the people, almost entirely of her. So, I also as an audience sometimes sympathize with this character and sometimes also annoyed with her behavior. In addition, we will meet the alien, esper, and time traveler earlier. Yuki Nagato, the alien who is always calm and very love to read a book, Asahina Mikuru, the time traveler who has a typical crybaby character and always be a prank by Haruhi, and Itsuki Koizumi, the esper which is very difficult to predict. The whole character I think is like a typical slice of life, but the growth is getting better when you watch the episode. Although that way, it doesn't change the fact at all that its character is very cliche.\\n\\n\r\nAs with the title say of this anime, I had several times to dropped this anime because the plot is always changing every time. I admit that the plot of the story that presented is very interesting but I always can't hold it and I always be often to force it rather than to be enjoyed as usual. What's more, from all the arcs that presented in this anime, Endless Eight is the most boring one that ever existed. How could a story that struck a copy paste but the story is always repetitive with the difference is only in the location of the angle camera? This arc is the most boring arc and the most waste of time when watching this anime. However, I just wonder why I watch this arc without skipping it all at once. Maybe because I'm waiting for something big at the end or just that, I don't like to watch an anime like that even though I know well it's so bored. This anime sometimes presents a more fresh story but interspersed with a story that is complicated in it. Sometimes also, this anime presents some filler that I think is more enjoyable than the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is actually an anime with the great concept that presents a story that I can't suppose. All elements are combined so uniquely but absurd that there is a prophecy why I keep watching this anime over and over again. With the arc that was presented so little twist end, this anime I think it's very famous in some fandom it. However, the characters that I think is cliche also don't make me stop watching this anime even though several times I had time to drop it. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya I think is an anime with a fun element in it if you don't feel bored to watch it and I really recommend it for those of you who haven't watched this anime. In total, I think it's great for Kyoto Animation studio.\\n\\n\r\nReviewed on February 24, 2018.",

            "content": "Ah Suzumiya... You truly are the best aren't you? You and your friends really are something. I mean, you ARE an icon on the anime world,and for good reason. The \"first season\" aired in 2006 was really amazing,and introduced us to a plot line different from what we usually get and, for the large majority, it was very well recieved. So well in fact, that everyone was expecting a continuation. What we weren't expecting was this...THIS \"second season\"... Where do I even begin...\r\nStory: 1\r\nTHIS. THIS RIGHT HERE. I never tought they could ruin the beautiful plot they had built on season one. And,in their defense,they didn't. They just chose to not  add anything new to the story. They just went with a different path for the most part. And yes, of course I'm refering to the \"Endless Eight\".Anyone,and I mean ANYONE, who has watched this series knows what I'm talking about. It's just a slap in the face. I dare to bet that the tought process behind this idea was \"Hey guys,let's see how many episode we can stretch this story into. If Naruto can do it,so can we!\". I'm not saying the story is bad,heck the idea itself was pretty solid,but you could have made it last 2 episodes,maybe 3 (and this may be already too much). But no. You just had to make it so that it was almost the WHOLE SEASON. This right here is here this season 2 fails. But it's such a great sin that it can NOT be forgiven.\\n\\n\r\nArt,Sound,Character: 9 , 9 , 10\\n\\n\r\nI'm putting these together because there isn't really much to say about these individually. The characters are the same from season 1, whcih makes them a solid 10. The art seems to be the same as well,and even tough it isn't something amazingly gorgeous,it's still really solid. The sound is also great,it blends in with the atmosphere (They did get to re-use the same audio for a bunch of the episodes) and the opening is an improvement from the opening from the first season. As for the ending, it isn't the classic one and it's not nearly as good,but I still find it to be cute and kind of relaxing. And trust me,after what some episodes make you feel, you're going to need that relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2\\n\\n\r\nI just can't like this season. I can (and I do) like some episodes,but most of them were almost unbearable to watch (again,and again,and again...). I can't really give it a \"1\",because there WAS some entertainment, but it deosn't escape the \"2\".\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6,2 -> 5\\n\\n\r\nAccording to Maths, I should be giving this show a 6. But I just can't. I truly can't. For me,this show barely get's a positive score,the \"5\", so I can't get it any higher than that. If you are a fan of Suzumiya or a fan of anime icons in general, I still recommend you this show. But please, for the love of God,skip the \"Endless Eight\".\\n\\n\r\nImprovements from the first season? Well,we have the new opening and...hum...There's the...Nop,that's it...",

            "content": "For the whole Haruhi series, I just had a general feeling while watching this anime that not much really happened. I feel like there isn't much that's special about it. Sure I may get a few chuckles out of some silly situations the characters get themselves into and I enjoy some of Kyon's dialogues, but beside those things the show just feels like a very typical high school life/comedy show despite the reputation that it has garnered from fans over the years. The show tries to make an interesting twist on the daily lives of high schoolers by having a few of the main castcharacters posses interesting abilities and mostly hinted at backgrounds, but I feel like they are not fleshed out well enough for me to really care that much about them. Neither are their abilities/powers themselves explored that much either, which was a let down to me. I often found myself feeling listless or bored when this show settles into its usual dry formula of : haruhi gets them into some situation to ease her boredom, she picked on mikuru for the umpteenth time, kozumi offers his crackpot theory, kyon makes snarky comment/ wisecrack joke/complains about situation/fantasizes about mikuru. \\n\\n\r\nFor the 2nd season in particular, it was almost completely dominated by the endless 8 arc and the movie/school festival arc (the sigh arc), and neither really stood out to me besides two moments in the movie arc. I thought the first season had a lot more variety in things that happened and I feel was a bit better but is still plagued by many of the same problems the 2nd season has. \\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and music were really nice in my opinion, for both seasons. I really enjoyed the openings and endings, and the animation was fluid and very nice to look at for the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nThe two high points I mentioned of  this second season that really came out of nowhere . I can't talk about them much because I want to avoid spoiling them . Lets just say that there was an excellent performance at one point, and at another point for a very brief period a certain character gets a very well deserved verbal dressing down , even though this is sadly diluted very shortly afterwards when the accuser starts to feel sorry for the accused.\\n\\n\r\nThe only character in Haruhi season 2 that really stands out to me, again like the first season, is Kyon because you actually get to hear some of his inner thoughts , sort of like you would from a character of a visual novel which is a nice, and they were usually either chuckle worthy and/or had very good points about what was going on at that moment in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe most important character of the show, Haruhi, annoyed the living daylights out of me in both seasons because she seems to bully the other club members around all the time and she doesn't even have anything special about her personality other than that she's very aggressive and likes to keep doing things to keep her from being bored. The other club members are fairly boring and don't have much to them that keep me interested in them. Koizumi offers some interesting theories about haruhi but he otherwise feels like a very typical non nonchalant \"nice guy\" character. Mikurku is always the easily flustered damsel in distress that was never interesting to me even with that scenario they tried to work for her in the beginning of season 2. Like I said before they all had some serious potential with their abilities to make the show a lot more interesting but this was not the case, other than possibly Nagato with her interesting abilities but this was shown a lot better in season 1.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to rant about the endless 8 because there's plenty of opinions about this already and its a well known phenomenon in the world of anime. I'll just say that I watched every second of them, and they weren't as bad as I originally expected. But this series of episodes could have easily been reduced to 2 episodes, or 4 episodes maximum and still got the same point across without the totally unnecessary level of repetition the viewer is put through.\\n\\n\r\nSo overall this anime felt very \"average\" to me. I never really thought that any of it was particularly bad besides the fact that the endless 8 went on so long, but almost none of the show stands out much either so maybe that in of itself is problem for this show. After watching it I will currently say that I would not recommend this anime based on my subjective opinion anyway. Some people say even though the anime isn't great the movie is awesome, but I disagree. I don't believe it's worth it to watch this series (if you don't enjoy it like me), just to get to that movie.\\n",

I took a moment to reflect on the series as a whole and decided before I continue the task on working on my anime completion list I'll write my feelings about this series.\r\nThere was a time I was actually a huge fan of Haruhi. In fact I used to dance to Hare Hare Yukai daily, or even listen any one of the versions of the song often. Then this happened. Since seeing this season my love forHaruhi, and this series would slowly turn to hate.\\n\\n\r\nWhy did my feelings change? The simple answer would be Endless Eight. Eight episodes wasted on the exact same thing. Since I would binge seasons at the time I felt as if I wasted four hours on nothing. It was so pointless, and painful to go though. I'm surprised that I didn't just drop the series after the first 3 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThen after the trials of endless eight you are presented with Mega Bitch Haruhi who doesn't seem to give a fuck about anyone expect for herself, and would abuse Mitsuru so much that I wouldn't be surprised that the poor girl wishes to kill Haruhi.\\n\\n\r\nThere are not many characters I would feel a burning hatred for. After this season, Haruhi was added to the list.",

It's basically about an arc that could have been easily fit into two episodes but they made it eight. The clincher is: it has a bullshit and unsatisfying ending.\r\nBut even without that. This season was still garbage. Maybe it'll bump my review to 2 instead of 1 if E8 wasn't there. But still. You know the exciting out-of-this-world fantasies in the first season? They're gone in the second. The anime devolved into a shitty comedy schoollife anime. (Note that I'm not insulting school life anime, it's just Haruhi that is shitty) Occasionally you'll see Haruhi's powers pop out and Nagato (the alien) using her abilities, but they're very diminished. And Asahina (the time traveler) and Koizumi (the esper), their incidences have vanished. No more time travel and closed spaces.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know what the hell happened with the studio. They've released that garbage Endless Eight, and for the other episodes they've removed the aspects of fantasy which is what made the first season interesting and made the fans watch in the first place.",

            "content": "Ahh, the so called 2nd season of haruhi.  I definitely feeling a bit cautioned heading into this anime.  Personally I tend to wait for a series to end before deciding to watch based on reviews.  And haruhi S2 did not sound very enticing.  No doubt, the endless 8 episodes caused quite a commotion.\r\nGoing through endless 8, I will say it wasn't a pleasant experience.  But, it wasn't as bad as some other people made it out to be.  Granted, in my opinion, 3 or 4 episodes would have sufficed to make the point. If it was only 3 or4 episodes, it would have been a lot more effective.  Im not going to defend KyoAni for that, seeing as they did spend 8/14 episodes basically airing the same story --which left only 6 other original material episodes.  \\n\\n\r\nThe other 6 non repeating episodes were quite enjoyable, and quite clever too.  In the latter half of the \"sigh\" arc, there was some interesting character development mainly in kyon and haruhi.  And everything leads up nicely to the \"someday in the rain\" conclusion episode.  \\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this was definitely not on the same level as the original airing.  Maybe, our expectations were a bit high, but nonetheless the anime proved entertaining.  \\n\\n\r\nOn a side note, for those who've watched K-on, theres a lot of styles carried over to this season of haruhi. It was a bit unnerving to see haruhi in K-on styles while somewhat retaining her edgy voice.  And on the topic of her voice, Aya seemed to have changed her voice for Haruhi somewhat as well...minor gripe there.",

Despite a small number of other reviewer's attempts at excusing these episodes: \"theyre all a little different!\" \"its so you really get the tired feeling of the characters!\", please believe me when I say that these episodes are completely unnecessary and better off skipped.\r\nIm not implying that thecreators did this to save money, or out of laziness. On the contrary I think it WAS their intent to give off a sense of endlessness and repetitiveness. But regardless of their intent, these eight episodes, over HALF of the entire season, were a miserable experience to most everyone who watched them. As a result, I cant give this season of Haruhi any more than a 5.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, MINUS the endless eight, this season was more of what I'd come to expect of the show, great art, lots of laughs, but a subpar plot and cast of characters. Without a doubt an enjoyable show, but certainly not a masterpiece as some would say. \\n\\n\r\nIn short, if you enjoyed season one, skip the endless eight and youll enjoy what remains of this season of Haruhi no Yuutsu",

If you start watching it, it might be rather strange because of the order that is given to you. The first episode 00 is not really the first. It\u2019s the episode that the group makes later on in the show. A lot of shows are like that, in the wrong order. When it aired is a nonlinear way known as Kyon order. It almost makes no sense and so I suggest that you watch them in the Haruhi order which if youare looking at Kyon order number, it would be 2, 3, 5, 10, 13, 14, 4, 7, 6, 8, 1, 12, 11 and 9. What does piss me off though is that in 2009, they added a new season, but it is supposed to be mixed in with Season 1 that added additional footage and dialogue to the story. It means that I have to rewatch the whole show again with the second season and try to put them together.\\n\\n\r\nThe feel of the show is like a Nuevo, and it\u2019s nice to have Kyon\u2019s thoughts on the whole idea of Haruhi\u2019s antics. I don\u2019t think I would be able to stand this show without his calculated thoughts and it would go into Azumanga Daioh mode I think. I really do wish I could hear more about his background and about his little sister. Every once in a while, she just seems to pop up out of nowhere and doesn\u2019t seem to be part of anything. She could just as easily been left out instead of having her in the show. There were also times when they lost me, talking a lot about logic and philosophies in the characters who are around Kyon. I can understand when It\u2019s Yuki, maybe even Itsuki but when Mikuru starts talking logically about time travel and then suddenly goes into \u2018That\u2019s classified\u2019 thing, it just gets annoying because it doesn\u2019t seem like her character.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is pretty good, though it\u2019s pretty much the same as almost any other school life with the rather clean artwork though they have constant hair-los even in the dark. It\u2019s this nice little shine that went all the way around there heads. It\u2019s a bit annoying in that aspect. The background is pretty washed out and the people stand out really nicely against it being bright. There is a lot of fan service, especially with Mikuru and the strange outfits that Haruhi forces her into. I have to say, I would have thought Haruhi would look a bit more out of control looking then what she looks like. \\n\\n\r\nThe voices in the English actually are much better in my mind but that is just my opinion. I can understand them much better if I don\u2019t have to read the sub titles and not only that, Wendee Lee is a great Haruhi! I love her out of control voice and right next to Crispin Freeman\u2019s cool and collected voice, it sounds really well done. Much like yin and yang. I\u2019m not really sold on Stephanie Sheh\u2019s Mikuru. She seems a little too timid and high pitched. It\u2019s also nice to hear that Johnny Yong Bosch as Itsuki with a cool and collected character instead of the hot headed thugs he seems to be known for.\\n\\n\r\nAfter Watching Endless 8\\n\r\nAfter watching part of the endless 8, I feel that you can probably just skip most of it. It pretty much made me go insane and I can probably say Kyon\u2019s internal monolog by heart now\u2026 Ya\u2026 not doing that again.",

            "content": "Ah haven't wrote one of these for a while *^*\r\nThe second season of Haruhi is probably the most interesting controversial incident in my anime years. The random announcements of Kadokawa, then their trolling, fan rages, the disappearance of the disappearance of Suzu-Haruhi (unconfirmed)...let's get started.\r\nStory: \r\nThis is not a continuation. The two season's relationship is more like Full Metal Panic and fumoffu (a main series and a series highlighting unseen parts of the main series). Despite fan disapproval (99.95% due to over-expectation), I enjoyed Season 2 a fair bit. S2 has a slightly gloomy tone at times as it explores the philosophical nature of theanime's \"world\" and Haruhi's influence on such a world. Probably informative more than funny/exciting. (If you're some kinda freak you might also see it as romantic)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nIt was since Lucky Star that Kyoani became a tad lazy with its quality. On one hand we have visual quality like we saw in the first season. On the other we have character faces that were from plain to downright weird.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nNot a big critic of sounds. A nice OP and ED is all I can say :P\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nMost sequels fail in this category for me, probably because of the lack of new ideas and character development. I believe S2's main focus is in character development, especially Kyon influence on Haruhi (I actually believe this is the main idea for the series). The club members\u2019 actions towards Haruhi's whims further shows their roles both as club members and 'defenders\" of their respective realities.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nEnjoyable. S2 opens more questions about the series than it actually answers. Maybe I read too deep into things, but the way they talk about \"Haruhi's world\" really creates depth to the melancholy universe. Don\u2019t expect to see moe-overload and lots of lovely Haruhi. This one ain\u2019t moe-otaku firendly\\n",

(Besides knowing it loops).\r\nThe arc is called Endless 8 and as figures, is 8 episodes long of looping. There are very minor changes in every episode, such as outfit changes, angles, subtle text changes (which say the same thing differently) and a few extra seconds of animation here and there. If you do not have the patience to watch 8 episodes repeat, here is what I recommend (spoiler free).\r\nPart 1 / episode 2. Great, worth watching.\\n\r\nPart 2 / episode 3. Introduction to the loop. Worth watching.\\n\r\nPart 3 to 7. Repeats with minor tweaks, but nothing different. BE ASSURED : By skipping over these, you are not missing anything. If you wish to watch them anyways,  know that once you start to get irritated you can just skip to episode 9.\\n\r\nPart 8 / episode 9. End of loop. NOTE:  It's only different about 17 minutes in.\\n\\n\r\nThere are speculations as to why they've made 8 episodes for this, those of you interested, here are the reasons. ( I can't confirm which one is right though. )\\n\\n\r\nReason 1: 8 represents the symbol of infinity / loop. It was therefore appropriate to drag this one for 8 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nReason 2: To create an impact to generate fuss. ( Perhaps popularity, fame, publicity, etc). In a sense, this is similar to what they did for season 1, by releasing episodes in a non-chronological order. That being said, the writer likes to stand out.\\n\\n\r\nReason 3: They had popular demand for season 2, but did not have enough material to write at least 13 episodes for, so they decided to drag endless 8 for 8 episodes instead of 2-3.\\n\\n\r\nReason 4: By stretching this arc, they have enough material for a 3rd season.\\n\\n\r\nIt may even be all of the above.. None the less it is how it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe score I've selected for this season is based on the fact that I've watched all of endless 8 episodes. Do not let this low score scare you away from watching this though, at least not if you follow my advice.",

            "content": "This is my first review, please bear with me (:\r\nWell, let's just say that this was a disappointment. The first season was dramatic, epic, and amazing in all sorts of different ways. The second season... not so much.\r\nStory 8/10:To be honest, disregarding the endless 8 arc, if this season wasn't a sequel to the first season, it probably would have sold really well. The storyline is pretty good, no matter what the haters say. However, the anime portrayal was fairly repulsive. When I watched episode 1, I was settling down for a high enjoyable new season. Endless 8 left me in pieces, however. It wasmonumentally horrifying: after the first 2 episodes, I spent the rest of my time begging for it to end each week. What is even more fail is how Kyo Ani took the time to shoot each episode from a different angle. They didn't reuse a single frame. However, the 3rd arc was fairly well done, which is why I rated the story so high.\\n\r\nArt 7/10: Kyoto Ani... ;___; Let me explain why I was so sad. Kyoto Animations is an extremely well known animations group, most notably for Clannad and Kanon, not to mention Haruhi. Their animations are best described as spectacular. However, when they start Haruhi 2, they were fresh out of animation K-ON!, which had nice art, but was entirely unsuitable for Haruhi art. I mourned over the desecration of Kyon's face, and even more so Haruhi's, which had a look reminiscent of Yui from K-ON!. The animations are still far above average, but it looks like someone's been skimping on the money.\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10: I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I hadn't read the novels already, but since I did, the ruination of a great novel was no enjoyment. The promise of a Disappearance arc was evidently not fulfilled, although there will be a Disappearance movie in Japan theaters in February 2010. Coupled with the deteriorated art, this show was definitely not what it could have been.\\n\r\nOverall 7/10: I'm being really really lenient on this, because most Haruhi watchers, both lovers and haters, truly disliked season 2. However, I'm a liiittle bit hardcore; I absolutely loved season 1, and even though season 2 was a disappointment, I can't help but be a tiny bit biased. \\n\r\nFeedback is appreciated! ^^",

            "content": "\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s what it felt like, anyway.\u201d\r\n--Kyon\r\nThis second season of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was cloyed for, sought after, and eventually delivered by Kyoto Animation in 2009. Three years after the release of the original series, fans were ecstatic to see the return of the SOS brigade to the small screen. It might be the most anticipated second season I've seen in my years of watching anime, with the only comparable hype being the Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood reboot that premiered the same year.\r\nBut while FMA's new look and feel resonated with viewers and surpassed the original anime, Haruhi's second act is a tremendous,awe-inspiring disappointment that scarred fans of the series. The words \"Endless Eight\" became shorthand for insatiable trolling and disappointment. Haruhi's inevitable marching order of wannabes and imitators failed to tarnish the reputation of the series, so Kyoto Animation tried their own hand at it, and they succeeded beyond their reckoning.\\n\\n\r\nLet's get one thing out of the way first: the second season's animation and art is perhaps the best part of it, showing marked improvement over the first and still looking great even seven years later. Haruhi has never been harsh on the eyes, but in just three short years you can tell that the techniques and tools at KyoAni have been refined. The English dub actors put in yet another sensational performance, getting back into their roles with ease. As I said in my review of Season 1, even if you don\u2019t like dubs, Haruhi\u2019s English localization is every bit as good as the Japanese.\\n\\n\r\nThe new OP, \u201cSuper Driver\u201d is also absolutely amazing, and probably one of my favorites ever. It\u2019s even better than \u201cBouken Desho Desho\u201d, which still holds a special place in my heart after all these years.\\n\\n\r\nBut that\u2019s all that\u2019s improved. The story consists of two arcs, with a one-off episode taking place at the very beginning. That single episode is the high point of the season. It\u2019s all downhill from there.\\n\\n\r\nYou really can\u2019t talk about this second season without talking about the first arc, Endless Eight. It is every bit as bad as you can imagine. It is the same sequence of events repeated eight times in eight episodes, with only very mild changes taking place in the third through seventh repetitions of said events. I\u2019m trying to be as fair as I can be to it in saying that at least the first and second time it\u2019s entertaining, but once I got halfway through it I wanted to claw my eyes out. I soldiered on and finished the arc, but my opinion of the series and of KyoAni as a whole was damaged. I can only imagine what people thought as the show was airing. Who told them this was an okay thing to do?\\n\\n\r\nAfter that, we get the Sigh arc, which depicts and details the events that took place while the SOS brigade made the infamous \u201cAdventures of Mikuru\u201d movie for the school festival. It\u2019s a return to form for the show and has some really funny moments, but suffers from character derailment. \\n\\n\r\nAllow me to explain: in the first season Haruhi Suzumiya definitely had her moments where her overbearing, bossy nature was a bit excessive, but her heart was generally in the right place. You could tell that she was at least somewhat concerned for the wellbeing of her so-called charges. But in Sigh, Haruhi becomes a caricature of her worst traits, culminating in her spiking the drink of an SOS brigade member and then physically and verbally beating her up for no good reason.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a betrayal of her character, in my opinion: while Haruhi can be overbearing, bossy, and sometimes even mean, she was never outright cruel to her friends before that. It feels forced, like they needed some harsh interpersonal drama so that the season could have a climactic emotional reckoning, but even the resolution of that rift is disappointing and rushed.\\n\\n\r\nIn summation, I can\u2019t understand how a show could devolve in quality this severely between seasons. I can\u2019t imagine what director Tatsuya Ishihara was thinking as he developed it. When fans begged for more Haruhi, they weren\u2019t asking for this. And while I can\u2019t claim that Haruhi is \u201cruined\u201d by this disappointment, it wasn\u2019t for lack of trying. I\u2019d like to say that you\u2019re better off not watching this entire season, but I can\u2019t because the first episode is admittedly one of the best in the show\u2019s 28-episode run, and the events of Endless Eight are integral to understanding the Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya movie. My best advice is to soldier on, skip Endless Eight\u2019s third-through-seventh episodes, and try to enjoy the top-tier animation for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nUntil next time, don\u2019t forget to do your summer homework.",

            "content": "\"Do you have any idea of how insane this loop is?!\" - Okabe, Rintarou\r\nBeforehand, I would like to say that this review of the second season of The Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi contains too much of my opinion in it. I love the Haruhi series and was amazed by it's possibilities that I can't wait for KyoAni to release something new on the series.\r\nAfter finishing the series a few days ago, with The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, I was deciding which one of them would be on my top 10 anime, and after putting some thought to it, I decided to stay with the secondseason. Here I have some of the reasons, toghether with my review:\\n\\n\r\nTHE STORY:\\n\\n\r\nHaruhi (2009) brings new stuff from the novels to the table, with some adaptation (that was already expected, after the first season), having its first episode already introducing the protagonist (and the viewer) to actual time travel, setting the stone for what this season would be about. That's right, if you are a time-travel fanatic, like me, you will be going for a ride here.\\n\\n\r\nBut, let's put the big guns on the table here: The infamous \"Endless Eight\" arc (that, if you dislike as way too many people did, goes from episodes 2 - 9). \\n\r\nIn a nutshell, after Haruhi decides that she wasn't satisfied with all the things she did with the SOS Brigade during the summer vacation, she wishes that this last 2 weeks she spent with them never ended. And it happens. They go on a time loop.\\n\r\nThe concept is awesome for a time travel story, showing the monotony and the repetition that is a time loop, but the problem to many people (and, in my opinion, the decision that set KyoAni as the anime studio with the most balls on the market) is the way that the time loop is represented:\\n\\n\r\nIt is the same episode. Over. And over. And over again.\\n\\n\r\nIt is not a spoiler, every single person that knows about Haruhi should know of this infamous arc beforehand, 'cause it is not for everyone. \\n\r\nI didn't know. And it was awesome for me. But I should.\\n\\n\r\n\"What best way to show a time loop then with reptetitive stuff, am I right?!\" Yeah, I know it's not the best way the arc could be represented, and I can't really imagine what it had been like for the people who watched it while it was airing, but watching as I did (marathon it!) made me like this arc way more than I should, beacuse I didn't know what was coming next, and had that feeling of \"next episode it will happen!\", even though it took 7 episodes for it to actually happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the anime is a nice connection with the first season, showing the recording of that also infamous first episode (of the first season), with a nice little ending to it, to wrap it all up.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ART:\\n\\n\r\nHave you watched K-ON! or Tamako Market, or any other KyoAni production of this decade? This was where it all began. The character design and art style set the stone for what future KyoAni productions would look like. It is gorgeous, specially after being used with that 2005 design, that followed the classic anime style (big, googly eyes, kinda unproporcional bodies, you know the deal).\\n\\n\r\nTHE SOUND:\\n\\n\r\nIt is, actually, the worst (in this case, the less great) part of the anime for me. I can't remember of any particular song or tune on the soundtrack of the anime, since they are not that unique, and both the opening and ending were skipped for me in every single episode (unlike the first season, that had only the opening skipped), 'cause they're not that good.\\n\\n\r\nTHE CHARACTERS:\\n\\n\r\nIt is basically, the same as the first season (great as f*ck), but the lack of big character development, especially when there is such potential, was its only down side.\\n\\n\r\nTHE ENJOYMENT:\\n\\n\r\nI had a blast watching Haruhi (as a whole). The anime industry needs more of this crazy-ass slice of life with nonsense comedy kind of productions. Even the Endless Eight was a fun time for me, because, even though it is the same episode over and over again, the ways that each episode is built, with a different visual style and focus on some hints to solve the problem (or at least I thought there were) made me genuinely like this anime, even though many people dislike it for its ballsiness. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\\n\r\nJust like the first season, Haruhi (2009) isn't perfect, but where it's good, it's REALLY good! And where it fails, it's not an epic fail (like some other anime out there). And I had a blast through it all. It's a 9/10 for me, and recommend even for people that won't like the Endless Eight arc, for it will be a fun time.\\n",

Characters being themselves as usual, whatever, it's a slice of life anime with some slight supernatural elements.\r\nNow, to Endless Eight. So. Do I think it's a masterpiece? Do I think it sucks all ass?\r\nUh, neither. Now, I'm questioning myself why in the fuck I would watch 8 episodes of the same shit happening over and over again. That's why I didn't. I watched 5 and then I realized what was happening and began skimming throughthe remaining 3.\\n\\n\r\nI respect Endless Eight. It really makes you feel what Yuki feels so I can respect it for that, but fucking hell, this is a bit too much. By the fifth time I already got the point. The only thing I was asking myself was \"How the fuck did these animators not off themselves after animating the same scenes 8 times?\"\\n\\n\r\nAnyways, it's a necessary evil, I suppose. I respect the balls and the effort put into it, but at the same time I think it's a bit unnecessary and just questionable. It made me laugh, though, I imagine if people were watching as the episodes were coming out, it wouldn't have been so funny.",

If you're considering watching this second season, you've probably seen the first.  If you haven't then you should go see the first, there's little point in starting midway through.  If you've seen the first, you probably know if you like the general format of the show.  This second season is a direct continuation of the first.  If you don't like the first season, you won't like the second.  \r\nThe second season is good with abig caveat: the endless eight.  These are nearly-identical episodes that serve as filler.  They're repetitive and once you've seen one you can skip straight to the last. \\n\\n\r\nART+SOUND: The art is typical for its era.  Competent, with what I'd consider above-average animation quality.  Audio in this series isn't important, and you likely won't be able to tell much of this show's audio from another's without context.  \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER/STORY: with the endless eight exception the story is nice and the characters remain consistent with the first season.  No meaningful character development here, but that's not the point.\\n\\n\r\nNow for the spooky scary banned original review text, which really isn't all that different except in brevity:\\n\r\nEndless Eight sucked, and there was no point besides filling space to have the entire arc take up 8 episodes. It's not artistic, it's not deep, it's not complex, it's lazy. The 8-episode arc could have been compressed into one episode.\\n\\n\r\nLook up the viewing order chronologically on wikipedia, then skip the 8 shit episodes. Then you might enjoy the other 6. That's right, more than half the season is one episode on repeat.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters remain consistent from season one, so no real surprises in what you watch unless you haven't seen season one, in which case why are you starting with two?",

Yes, its' repetitive, yes, I got sick of some things, but it was in reality a really neat idea. It almost gives us a taste of what they are going through. The second episode contains scenes that the first doesn't, and every episode after changes things. Sometimes it's just where someone was sitting, or something they said or did or wore. There's also one thing that we never actually see Kyon's reaction to, just Koizumi's response to it. I found I always wanted to see this particularscene to see how it changed. \\n\r\nI think they could have done this in 3 or 4 episodes, not 8, but it took a chance that many series would not. And for me, who has little attention span, I could do other things while having that in the background. And I love the characters enough anyway that I just enjoyed watching them. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the series ties the two seasons together, the making of the movie for the festival. It's entertaining, but I would have liked to have had something new. For anyone who didn't watch the first season in chronological order, they would have seen them in that order in 2009. So perhaps that would give different insight on the series too. I did watch it in chronological order (not realising it was aired in a different order until much later, I thought there just must be something wrong with crunchyroll). \\n\\n\r\nAnyway, it's worth watching this series. If you don't like the endless 8, then you can always skip a few in between. If you do that, at least watch the first two and the last one! But give it a chance before getting annoyed and giving up on the series!",

            "content": "CAUTION : MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS!! AGAIN I WARN YOU!!! MINOR SPOILERS!!!!!\r\nIt pains my heart to notice that one of my favorite anime gets criticized badly for showing episodes that seem \"boring\" or \"mediocre\", specifically the infamous ( endless eight). To be quite honest these episodes are rather amazing in my opinion just because it would take some guts to do something like that knowing that they may get criticized for it badly. I admire the \"endless eight arc\" just because the writers wanted the audience to feel how Yuki Nagato felt, just imagine watching those eight episodes over over again was already frustrating butimagine doing it thousands of times and you cant do anything about it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory : The Story was actually amazing in my own opinion but believe me the \"endless eight arc\" will shine its glory if you watch the movie; The disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. Other than that the story was quite impressive even though people describe it as \" a waste of time \" and \" irritating\".\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt & Sound: The Art and Sound is okay it matches the feelings of the characters in the \"spur of the moment\"\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The Characters are amazing and really enjoyable just think about it a bossy chick who thinks differently than any other human, an ordinary teenage boy who keeps the \"gang together\" despite his anti-social attitude, a shy and timid but  hot time traveler , a rich esper who admires almost everyone for some reason and a silent bookworm who was actually a badass alien, what more could you ask for?\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment & Overall: I love this anime because of its unpredictability (especially in terms of the script of its writers). Its not your average sci-fi , mystery , school life story rather if you think about it it really has a deep sense into it. Just a piece of advice if you manage to watched the whole series without skipping, YES WITHOUT SKIPPING any episodes I advice you to watch the movie just because it will help you appreciate the value of the series more and its build up especially in the second season.",

            "content": "As someone who has seen some of Kyoto Animation's works such as Nichijou and Kyoukai no Kanata I did not expect this from them. The Melancholy of Haruihi suzumiya was great for the first set of the series but as for the second season I feel like that there was lack quality than the first season and here is why.\r\nI'm not going to analyse this in detail as I'm not good with detailed analysis but the second season spends way too much time on the Endless Eight Arc spending about half the seasons worth. Not only being way too long but also being just constantrepeats of episode two from slightly different angles and altered dialogue most of it still being the original dialogue. Furthermore the rest of the season was not too entertaining as first season as it kind of felt like that Kyoto Animation ran out of ideas to keep the season a full 14 episodes and therefore decided to repeat one episode over and over which really brought the quality down. In my opinion it would have been better to make the season smaller than to fill it with repeated content.\\n\\n\r\nFinal thoughts on this series are that the second season was entertaining at the start and then got really repetitive with content, towards the end of the series the story began to get confusing. A lack of effort from Kyoto Animation really creates some negativity for the reputation of Kyoto Animation. If you plan on watching the series episodes from 3-4 are useless to the arc and that you skip ahead as it is pretty much just a repeat of the same episode, in addition episode 1,2 and 5 are pretty much a repeat but contain bits of the story is order to understand what is happening. I personally might re-watch this if I'm bored but other than that I will probably not come back to it. I would not recommend you watch this if you get bored easily.\\n",

            "content": "For the record, I watched the entire thing in chronological order. A combination of the episodes from 2006 and 2009. \r\nBesides that, the show was incredibly enjoyable, the characters were quite frankly hilarious in every detail and they each had a specific role to follow, not one person seemed flat or useless. Its good that the characters are so strong, because they compelled me to continue watching. The story alone isn't anything bad, but its somewhat random and crazy at times, so you may sigh in annoyance at times. Art and sound was good, characters looked nice and the voice acting was excellent.\r\nFlaws, flaws, wellthey were a few around here and there. Mostly plot holes in the story, however some of those plot holes are covered in the movie (The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya) and the others will probably be easily covered in an actual 2nd season. Besides that there are some minor gripes with a few episodes, like inconsistencies, random pop ups and comic relief at the worst times (even if they are still enjoyable). Biggest one is the fact that 8 episodes are repeated to show a point, the devs. and producers can be saluted for their dedication, but after a while it gets really stale. If you get to that point and you don't enjoy it, just skip ahead. You're not missing much besides minor differences and some tweaks in their dialogue and reactions.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, its a good show and I recommend watching all of the episodes from 2006 and 2009 (in chrono. order) except for all the repeating episodes. I give this show a big 8.5 for its comic relief and colourful characters.",

            "content": "Welcome to the Review of the second season of the melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. It was weird, i am actually pretty torn about this one, but we get to that in the individual sections. First of all, a spoiler warning, both for this season and the first one. It remains to be seen if this warning is necessary as i make this up while i write the review, i never plan in advance. So without further introduction, let's move on to the story.\r\nStory: You can split the plot of this season in three parts: a little time-travel, the infamous Endless Eight arc and the makingof the movie we saw in the first season. That's pretty much it and while i mentioned in my review for the first season that i find this lack of story rather charming, this practice of not openly telling us everything and instead always keeping the viewer guessing of the machinations that are working behind the scenes, i can't forgive them this time. It does tie up some loose ends from the first season, but other than that, there is not much to see here. And let's talk, rant even about the goddamn endless eight. I watched all the episodes twice. Twice! Both times i almost lost my mind, but in a way, i like that. It might just be some kind of Stockholm-Syndrome, but in the end you really feel for the characters. They just want it to end, i just want it to end and when it finally does, it's a fantastic feeling. I can't even imagine how Nagato felt. I already said i am torn, so i am just going to say that i don't hate the story of the second season. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I couldn't observe any drop in quality so i can't really add anything new here. It all looks gorgeous and they even took the time to draw every Endless Eight act episode individually, with different outfits and backgrounds . So it's not even that the studio was being lazy with the repetition, i really don't get it...\\n\\n\r\n Sound: No real change either, i prefer the new opening and ending over the first ones. Yes, yes, hare hare yukai and all that, but it's a matter of personal preference.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: We get some new insights into the great cast of characters, let's look at them one by one again: Haruhi receives some more backstory, something pretty paradox and basically the reason why she even attended the North High. Other than that there is no real change in her demeanor, there is conflict, but in the end she still remains a self-centered egomaniac.\\n\r\nKyon, as always, has to face the most of the trials in the show. They don't really change him, we see another side of him, a little difference from the bored, distant, but kindhearted guy.\\n\r\nMikuru, helpless and cute, Haruhis toy, no real development. Actually, as i write this, i realized that we don't really get that much in terms of characterization. Nagato probably gets around 20 lines, nothing new here.\\n\r\nKoizumi however drops some important information at the very end. He hints at the things that are hidden from us, that some things might not be what they seem, but not only Nagato, Koizumi himself declares this information as unreliable. So at the end, we never moved forward.\\n\r\nMinor characters are not even important enough to be side-characters, they outright say it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Despite all that, however, I enjoyed myself. I think it was funnier than the first season and i just love the banter between the characters, how they go on with their daily lives while they are faced with Suzumiyas supernatural antics. I certainly wasn't bored. Well, maybe i got a little bored five episodes into the Endless Eight.\\n\\n\r\nI dragged on way too long again. There wasn't even much to say, you could even argue that this season is almost pointless in terms of plot development. If you want to be really harsh. I had fun, that's really all that's left to be said. And i pray to Haruhi that i, maybe one day, get the \"Kyon-kun denwa!\" out of my head. Now there is only the movie left to review and that makes me really melancholic, there should be more. \\n\\n\r\nBut there never will be, probably.",

Many things have been said about the Endless Eight arc, I am not going into them.  The only thing I will say is it was just to show the extent of Haruhi's power.  It seemed this arc was like a theme restaurant in Tokyo.  They had a good idea and ran with it, but someone forgot to tell them to stop.  The way i watch the Endless Eight arcis watch the first and last episode of the arc.  You get all the information you need to continue on with the series.  Story, art and characters are pretty much the same from the first series so I won't repeat myself.  I suggest that you watch the two series together in chronological order it the 2009 series won't make any sense.",

            "content": "If you picked up the first season of \"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu\", it is probably inevitable that you will see this second season. It is not as good, and the Endless Eight repetitions (the infamous time-loop arc) are painful, but I still would not recommend skipping this series. For better or worse, the Endless Eight is the most memorable part from the entire anime and, now that it's finished airing, simply hilarious.  \r\nStory [3/10]: Considering that more than half of the season is taken up by the Endless Eight and another five episodes are dedicated to a single arc, there is little plot. Ithelps that this anime is not plot-centric, so the dearth of story doesn't exactly hinder it.\\n\\n\r\nPacing [2/10]: The pacing is abysmal. Even the five episode arc is slow and torturous.\\n\\n\r\nArt [8/10]: When Andy Warhol began printing his soup cans, the face of pop art came into the foreground. The Endless Eight takes a bold step in this direction and dares the audience to treat Melancholy as art in the same vein. It is like Groundhog day in the eyes of someone other than Bill Murray, a total experimental decision without precedent in television. That said, the drawing style is as sharp as that of season one and a pleasure to watch. \\n\\n\r\nSound [7/10]: As with most anime, I did not particularly notice the music which means it was apt and nothing superb.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [5/10]: Endless Eight arc notwithstanding, the characters and relationships are disappointingly stagnant. In some ways this is understandable considering that it needed to fit within the constraints of the first season (season 2 fits in the middle of season 1). Everyone remains neatly tucked away in their archetype.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [7/10]: If you're looking for a harrowing journey of self-discovery, choc-full of monsters and romance, then surely you already gave up in season 1! Sit back and relax, Melancholy is still fun and hilarious, and perhaps most importantly, memorable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: [6/10]\\n",

But this second season is horrendous  half of the season is dedicated to one story arc which involves a time loop. Its your typical time loop plot just repeating the time sequence until you can figure out how to end it. This could have been executed fairly well but instead its done horribly. instead of them doing something new every episode they recycle scenes and im not talking 1 or 2 per episode I mean almost the entire episode. by the endyou've watched 1 episode about 6 times to come to a lack luster end to that arc. Even as someone who didn't really like the first season I was very disappointed in this second season. If you're reading this review before you watch the second season my recommendation would be not to bother with it or if you must skip the time loop arc.",

Moe, funny, titillation, etc. I personally like the art style, but your mileage may vary, of course.\r\nAs in series 1, the cast fit the characters like a glove, the writing is top-notch, and the direction is on point. The soundtrack and the new OP/ED themes are outstanding.\r\nSo why did I stop watching after 10 episodes?\r\nWell, I would imagine this might have something to do with the decision to do the (actually very short in the novels) Endless Eight arc in 8 22-minute episodes.That's well over half a cour for at most a single light novel volume. I know a lot of decisions are like \"Well, we didn't know it might flop at the time\", but come on, a little imagination would've revealed this to be an absurdly bad idea.\\n\\n\r\nEr, wait, imaginative Japanese management/producers? Forget I said that.\\n\\n\r\nI got the joke at the second episode. \"OMG they're going to do 8 of these, aren't they? Lawl.\"\\n\\n\r\nBy the fourth episode, the joke was no longer funny.\\n\\n\r\nBy the seventh episode a ton of viewers and I were like \"GAAAAAH MAKE IT STAHP.\"\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with this decision, as you might imagine, is that other than explanatory scenes in latter episodes of the Endless Eight arc, each run through the causality loop (that's a Trek reference) is basically identical. I bet they've thrown in little variations here and there, but playing Where's Waldo? with anime like that is not my idea of a fun time. Now, this is fine if you do it in 5 to 7-minute chunks of a single 40-minute (ish) episode like in Star Trek: The Next Generation. If you expand those chunks into 22-minute episodes... well, let's just say I was skipping to the end after the 3rd run-through. \"Did they stop the loop? No? OK, see you next week.\"\\n\\n\r\nBy the time the next arc (The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya, AKA the lead-up to the hilarious troll episode in series 1) rolled around, I was exhausted with Haruhi, and my scheduled time in Japan was over. The only reason why the story isn't rated any lower is because they delivered a masterful punch line at the end of the loops... but that wasn't enough for me to continue slogging through another major arc.\\n\\n\r\nI might pick it up again, but this is an example of how one decision can ruin the entire experience.",

            "content": "Endless Eight should have been 2 (maybe 3) episodes, not 8. Watching the same events over again was almost insufferable. I was hoping it was a case of minor details sneaked in that would eventually lead to putting the pieces together and an \"Ah-hah!\" moment. However, half-way in, it became clear that wasn't going to be the case; the repetition was contributing nothing to the narrative.\r\nI can respect others finding enjoyment in the details (I do too, to a certain extent), but I find that too lacking in substance on its own. For me, great visuals need to be backed by a decent story. Ifthe story is great, even better, as that would more strongly suit my preferences. The variances in each episode did make sitting through all 8 episodes tolerable, but those variances were still inconsequential in the context of advancing the narrative. I appreciated the minor differences and the change in presentation of the same events, but that couldn't save Endless Eight. Even the splendid animation and sound couldn't save it. In fact, putting aside the entire time loop narrative, the activities in which they partake together during the summer aren't even very interesting to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong - one of the most appealing aspects of the first season was just watching the characters interact with each other and seeing what they would be up to next. I enjoyed the episodes, such as the baseball game and The Day of Sagittarius, which were interspersed among the main arcs. The difference was that they were given a full episode to develop, whereas the activities in Endless Eight happen in the span of one episodes. This does make sense, as the narrative revolves around the time loop, not around what they did during the summer.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Endless Eight was utterly unsatisfying. I was hoping it'd answer some of the questions I had about the time loop and the actions of the characters, but it only raised more of them. First, why does Kyon feel a need to stop the time loop? It'd be different if he slowly retained more and more of his memory, but instead everyone forgets everything on the next loop. I fail to see his motivations. In fact, despite after learning about the time loop, he and the other characters fail to take any significant action. This agrees with regards to my statement about a lack of motivation. However, this contradicts with Kyon's actions in the caf\u00e9 on the penultimate day.\\n\\n\r\nWhy does a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu instil in him urgency and motivation to stop the time loop? Despite the sudden urgency, he still has another day to take action - which he yet again fails to take. Is it the d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that makes him unable to utter anything to stop Haruhi from leaving, or is he simply a moron? If it's so urgent, why not get Haruhi to stop first and then think of what to say? Why is he fixated on trying to dissect Haruhi's actions over the summer and finding the \"right\" thing to say anyway? I can accept characters not thinking in such manner, but the show doesn't do anything to justify their actions.\\n\\n\r\nWhen Kyon finally came up with what to say, I burst out laughing. All the dramatic build up for THAT? Did it even have to be that specifically, or would saying anything else have also sufficed? Just... what the fuck? I was desperately hoping for a good, clever resolution after having been subjected to 8 episodes of the same fucking scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, the following episodes, which revolve around the production of their film for the festival, did somewhat make it up. It was a breath fresh air to watch those episodes after Endless Eight - it reminded me of why I liked the series in the first place. These final episodes make me feel ambivalent towards the season in whole. I'm conflicted on how to rate it; Endless Eight was dreadful, but the final episodes were wonderful. It just isn't in me to give a part of the series an extremely low score. My rating may be too generous, but perhaps ignoring the repetition of Endless Eight justifies it.\\n",

The only thing that keeps this season from becoming any lower then an \"okay\" rating is the fact that the rest of the season besides Endless is actually good and has the same quality as the first season of Suzumiya Haruhi.\r\nPostives:\r\n+ Episodes 1, 9 - 14 all have good pacing and a nice story to tell\r\n+ Mikuru, Haruhi, Kyon,Tsuruya are all amazing characters\\n\r\n+ Good animation\\n\r\n+ A better OP then the first season ('Super Driver')\\n\r\n+ While not a better ED then the first season I still really enjoyed 'Tomare!' (or 'Stop!')\\n\\n\r\nNeutral:\\n\r\n= Koizumi has always been a mediocre character for me but I felt like he was worse in this season then in the first\\n\r\n= I could care less for Kyon's friends Taniguchi and Kunikida and they somehow get more screentime this time around\\n\\n\r\nNegatives:\\n\r\n- Endless Eight could've been more unique and have different events that happened in each episode or even could've been 4 episodes\\n\r\n- I never quite understood why Nagato Yuki was a popular character, she's important but she doesn't really do anything other then when she needs too (maybe this will change once I watch the movie)\\n\\n\r\n-\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: As you can see I really don't despise this season but the Endless Eight arc really made this season have a bad taste in my mouth.

            "content": "This is my first review on MAL, and I felt like it just had to be the second season of this show. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, I really enjoyed the first season. I also really enjoyed the film, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya. I also managed to enjoy the latter half of season two. What I did not enjoy, however, was the Endless Eight arc. \r\nEndless Eight is an attempt at the tried and true Groundhog Day formula, in which a certain series of events is repeated over and over again. Think Edge of Tomorrow, or, the movie Groundhog Day. Our heroes are stuckin a time loop. This certainly isn't a new concept, so you'd think that the writers would be able to create an entertaining arc out of it. That assumption is completely and utterly false. What we ended up with was an abysmal death march of repetition and monotony. Over the eight episodes that this arc spans, nothing significant happens besides the development of one character, which leads into the events of the film. Was wasting eight episodes  worth that development? No, because the same thing could of been accomplished in a far more entertaining way.\\n\\n\r\nNothing changes over these eight episodes. That's the nail in the coffin. There are small details, such as minor dialogue changes, or characters wearing different outfits, but outside of those small changes, it honestly feels like the studio was recycling old art and dialogue to save on the budget. That's not the case either though, because most scenes have been drawn from a different perspective, which would require the whole thing to be drawn up from scratch. This wasn't a money saving scheme, it was an intentional creative decision, which to me is just unfathomable. \\n\\n\r\nBesides that, our heroes also turn from likeable to outright frustrating. We have our main character who experiences unusually prominent bouts of deja vu and despite knowing all he knows about the supernatural events around him, ignores it. We have Yuki who not only can remember all the previous timelines, but is also willing to share this information but chooses only to do so when asked. The icing on the cake is that when she does share this information, nobody thinks to ask her to tell the other characters earlier in the cycle the next time everything resets. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of this trudge, what do we have to show for it. Yuki is a bit more developed as a character and we now have a motivation for her actions in the movie. This could of been accomplished in half the episodes. This could of been accomplished without the focus on repetition. The Endless Eight arc, is a bad arc. It's possibly one of the worst arcs I've seen in any anime. Despite it, I still managed to enjoy the rest of the season, and the film. If you do watch this show, I'd recommend watching maybe the first two episodes of Endless Eight, and then skipping to the end of the last episode of the arc. You won't miss anything. \\n\\n",

            "content": "*Contains Spoilers*\r\nThis review is for both the first and second seasons.\r\nSo honestly, I totally understand the hate that's being spewed around due to the \"endless eight\" that the second season exhibited. And I think that they could have done MUCH more with this series instead of ruining a great show with a ton of filler.\r\nTo start, the story is basic, it's about a girl named Haruhi Suzumiya who happens to change things around her based on her mood or preferences at the time. And that's it. They never delve more into what she can really do, or WHY she has this power to do so.They explain that three years prior to the happenings in this show, she suddenly started changing things, without going into much detail. The first season was better than the second one, as the second season is FILLED with filler.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are both acceptable. I have to admit that the both opener songs are great and got stuck in my head for a while after watching. I also think that the art is pretty good for a 2007-2009 anime.\\n\\n\r\nNow here is why I give this anime a seven. The characters. They definitely make this anime enjoyable to watch, and I definitely got connected to them over time.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would say watch the first season and then skip a few episodes into the second season, as you will basically be watching the same thing for 8 episodes. I think if they spent more time developing Haruhi and the SOS brigade they could have made a much better show overall. There's a lot of filler in this, but the characters are definitely likable  and I had a fun time watching their misadventures.",

            "content": "At the risk of sounding too harsh, this was an entirely pointless season bookended by 2 good episodes. That's really it.\r\nBesides the amazing first episode, and the interesting ideas in the last one (plus the very end), absolutely nothing in between did anything to add depth to the characters or make the plot more interesting. In fact, it just amped up the worst parts of this series (as explained below).\r\nBut here's a controversial opinion: the Endless Eight was not the worst part of the series. Hold your gasps. Really, it kind of baffles me how nobody is complaining as much about \"the Sigh of HaruhiSuzumiya\". I mean, it feels and acts exactly like Endless Eight \u2014 it's an arc that should have been way shorter, it gets progressively more aggravating to watch, and it seems like a joke. HOWEVER, in the very LEAST the Endless Eight was ABOUT SOMETHING.\\n\\n\r\nI'm not going to defend how boring Endless Eight was, but you have to admit it was an ambitious idea. And you could see what they were going for; having to trudge through the same sequence over and over put you in Nagato's shoes. It was simply an interesting premise, executed like a disaster.\\n\\n\r\nWhat did you really get out of the Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya? That instead of being a flawed character, our protagonist is really just an asshole who gets away with everything? That Kyon is ridiculously overdramatic? How did we benefit from that arc? Through the 4 episodes, every character became more of a caricature than the role they played in Haruhi's film, while they series itself repeatedly bashed us over the head with rules and concepts we already knew. With exceptions to the almost philosophical theories part V presented, nothing in the arc was helpful, or significant, or fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was great though.",

            "content": "Disappointment. That was the overall feeling I got as I finished the second season of the Haruhi Suzumiya series. The first one got me hooked up and I felt that the second season was actually a potential to develop the plot progression of the first season, which meant to answer questions and form resolutions from previously established conflicts, and which unfortunately was one of the big problems back then in the 2006 version, and although the premise and the mechanisms by which the plot was presented was surprisingly valid and interesting, and disregarding my personal bias on Haruhi Suzumiya as my new waifu, it feltthat the story and the 'mystery' aspect of the series needed so much polishing to make it as coherent and logical as possible while being mysterious at the same time. Having the drive to understand more of the entire mystery going on in the anime, I proceeded on watching the second season, and for the most part, I was absolutely disappointed. Nevertheless, I still love Haruhi Suzumiya and she's still going to be my waifu for life.\\n\\n\r\nI decide to discuss the storyline in two parts - one for each season, mainly because I haven't made any review on the first part since I anticipated so much on the show to continue the plot on the second season and I wanted to voice out my thoughts on the amazing first half of the series but I don't want to make another review, as well as to give a comparison of the two seasons why the discrepancy in the scores I gave for the 2006 and 2009 version is somewhat significant. Moreover, specific details about the 2006 version will be discussed since this review is on the second season and I doubt that people would watch this without watching the 2006 anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe 2006 version was the introductory part of the mystery, various explanations to the seemingly godlike powers of Haruhi were offered, and were reflected in the daily activities of the SOS Brigade. For the slice-of-life/school part of the anime, I'd say it did pretty good on simulating real-life situations as it adapted usual happenings in schools and for highschoolers, like going on trips and adventures and the typical sightings in a classroom setting - yes it was cliched to an extent but the plot was on-point - there exists a particular conflict for each story arc and a resolution was made logically and reasonably. The addition of fictional concepts, like capabilities exemplified by Yuki Nagato fitted well with the atmosphere and overall plot. The comedy was also good; I love the sarcastic remarks of Kyon, added with the clumsiness of Mikuru Asahina and the weird combination of being an idiot and smartass of Haruhi. Although these may sound generic, the combination unsurprisingly fitted well. The mystery part of the anime was the best and worst part of the show, I'd say. The good thing about the mystery is it carefully reveals parts of the mystery in a comprehensible manner, the explanations, or rather speculative theories of Koizumi, Yuki and Mikuru were interesting (although I did not bother to understand some parts) as Kyon began with joining the puzzle pieces together. It was also good that Kyon adds up subjective interpretations of the explanation to raise questions necessary to back up the plot and provide an understandable summary of what they are theorizing at. The jumbled sequencing of the episodes was also crucial in building up the mystery, but if you watched the series in chronological order, the mystery becomes less of a thrill but is still existing. However, one of the things that also became a problem for me is the sequencing. I somehow thought that for a mystery anime to be successful, unconventional plot devices (which are usually used in the mystery genre) utilized must be significant to the overall storyline, like when you remove that particular plot device, the story becomes poorly presented - in short, the plot device must be one with the story itself. In terms of the 2006 anime, I am not pretty sure whether the story would have been poor if the jumbling was removed; in fact I felt that the jumbling, as much as it adds up to the mystery, it also adds up to the confusion, and does not really contribute much to the overall story impact whatsoever. I felt no significance in changing the sequencing, because it resulted to an apparent skipping of unresolved conflicts of individual story arcs. Moreover, it seemed that the anime left too much unanswered questions and focused more on the sci-fi slice-of-life theme it largely presents by doing all those typical school scenes, rather than contributing to the overall understanding of the mystery.\\n\\n\r\nIn comparison to the former, the 2009 version was a whole lot worse, in terms of plot progression, forming resolutions and continuing the mystery. The Endless Eight, this is a spoiler necessary to bring up to point out the bad things of the anime, is probably the worst story arc I have ever seen in an anime, objectively speaking. It is a pointless eight-fold repetition of a singular episode without literally changing details of the main plot progress. The only things you'd see changing are the clothes, the way the characters deliver their lines which derives the same thought from their previous conversations and some minor plot details. The problem with this kind of repetition is that it does not do anything but excite the viewer who does not literally care about the plot as long as his favorite characters are present. It does not develop the plot or the characters, a viewer might as well skip the next six episodes and proceed to the last episode of that story arc. The repetitions do not even bring up questions to the mystery or offer answers, they just literally repeat the plot of the first episode of the arc. What's even more appalling is the resolution on the last episode of Endless Eight. Since the plot still repeated itself for the succeeding six episodes, why did something change in the last part? No details or hints on this plot progress was fleshed out; in fact for the most part that last episode was still the repetition of the previous episodes. The latter part of the show was not even dedicated to the mystery anymore. The explanations by Koizumi, Nagato and Asahina were just more information fed up to Kyon without trying to solve any mystery. Of course, the comedy and slice-of-life parts were still great. So in comparison, what made the 2009 version worse in terms of story was the grave mistakes committed being worse than the first season.\\n\\n\r\nThere was no character development in general which I personally felt was not too bad, I just hoped that Haruhi and Kyon had some character development. The other three main characters were tools in making the story interesting while being logical and realistic, so what they had to have are solid and interesting personalities. I felt that the anime was more of an attempt to present the events which support or back up the abilities of Haruhi Suzumiya, and explain stuff on how the world revolves on her wishes and visualizations. I felt that that kind of premise is valid to some extent, and therefore justifies to some extent why there was very little room for character development. However, the lack of character development of the two main characters, Kyon and Haruhi, by which the world revolves around them, made the two less of an enjoyment factor and even got to the point of dragging the story along, without any real resolutions. However, the portrayal of the personalities of Itsuki Koizumi, Mikuru Asahina and Yuki Nagato were excellently solid and plot-engaging. What I liked about Itsuki Koizumi was his role in being the supportive person of the group, while guiding Kyon into understanding more of the mysterious phenomenon. Mikuru Asahina, the hot clumsy chick of the group, and the center of Kyon's fantasizing, was also significant in pointing out suggestive romantic feelings Haruhi likely harbors towards Kyon, and somehow I was disappointed with that avenue left minimally exploited, because it supports the idea why Haruhi chose Kyon. It was inconsistent at times when Haruhi literally reacts with nothing when Kyon expresses his desires over Mikuru. Yuki Nagato is literally a badass. Her superpowers are essential in maintaining the existence of the group, and her contributions to the overall mystery was astounding and invaluable. Kyon was what I'd like to say a fitting character for a comedy-mystery type of anime. Kyon is amazing in terms of leading the viewers into what the mystery is all about. See, one of my problems in mystery genre characters is that the MC forgets to ask the basic questions. They tend to jump towards the mystery itself, leading to assumptions that would \"conveniently\" be the case. What's not good with this is that the mystery tends to be manipulated to be the case, and the MC seems to already have an idea of what's going on. Kyon was good in asking such basic questions. However, I don't personally like his laziness and his tendency to become a mere spectator. For the most part of the anime, he tends to observe and make conclusions without doing something to change stuff. Because of this, Kyon lacks character development. He became stagnant and far from being participative. Rather than events happening based on his actions, events happen and his actions become more of a response to the events that happened. To some extent, it felt like he was detached from the show. However, his sarcasm and fantasies on Mikuru actually livened up the anime and added overall entertainment. I also wonder why his full name was never pointed out. I somehow felt that it should have had some significance to the mystery but it wasn't tackled that much. Haruhi Suzumiya, my waifu, is not exactly the best character out there. She had so many inconsistencies in her character and I personally didn't like her abusive tendencies, her bossy attitude and never-listen-to-people personality. I really had hoped that the anime took effort in discussing how she ended up with that kind of mindset. Why she became my waifu, it was totally subjective in nature and the main reason why I took the agony of finishing the second season. In terms of animation and sound, they were pretty decent and I don't really rate an anime based on those criteria.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, should you watch Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu 2009? Nope, I don't recommend it. But if you were hyped by the first season and couldn't get enough of it, then watch this and you would enjoy it. Of course you would be disappointed, but for a person so much addicted to any of the characters (Haruhi Suzumiya in my case), you would find it rather enjoyable. Heck, I'm even surprised I finished it, all for the sake of my dearest waifu Haruhi Suzumiya. But objectively speaking, it was lackluster and a total disappointment.",

            "content": "The second season of Haruhi Suzumiya was defiantly interesting. \r\nI watched this series in the broadcasting order just because it was the way it first aired and I'm defiantly not doing that again for future re-viewings. It was rather off putting when the seasons changed from episode to episode. However let's get into the real deal for this series.\r\nThe Endless Eight.\r\nNaturally this is the arc that most people think of when they hear the shows name. Since I did not watch this show when it was airing I can not share the frustration that must of been felt to have seen the same story repeated8 times. However I can say how I felt when I watched it myself.\\n\\n\r\nSkipping episodes is generally something I don't like to do when watching anime unless it really sucks like the Garlic Jr. Saga of Dragon Ball Z so I watched all 8 episodes. I thought it was very interesting to see how a show can present the same events 8 times but make it different each time. However after the third episode of the arc it got dull. Regardless when it was done it didn't leave me with feelings of anger or boredom. I just found it to be something interesting I haven't done seen before.\\n\\n\r\nEverything after the Endless Eight is AWESOME however. I love making movies with my friends so I could relate to the creation of the movie in the anime. It was so enjoyable to see them create this bad film. I also liked how we got to see the finished product in episode 0. I really felt a connection to the series because of this since I have made some of the mistakes found in the finished product of their movie. Like the jerky tripod movements and wind in the background. \\n\\n\r\nBecause of this connection to the anime I defiantly enjoyed it more. Besides this the animation for the show is top notch. The framing of the shots and just the detail in some of the scenes is down right amazing. Maybe I haven't watched enough anime but I can easily say it was the best animation I have seen so far. \\n\\n\r\nFor me character designs kinda make or break an anime so I was very pleased with the designs in this show. However appearance isn't everything. The characters where all well done and very likable. Kyon and Tsuruya being my favorites. The voice acting was also amazing (I watched the English dub by the way). \\n\\n\r\nOverall the second season of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya was immensely enjoyable and is something I plan to re-watch in the future. Any show that has re-watch value is a good show in my book. While The Endless Eight keeps my rating down the rest of the show is a 10 to me.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a fun anime.",

The problem came when this series attempted to pull a groundhog day, like many sifis do, and loop itself. Doing so would have been perfectly acceptable, but this series repeated LITERALLY EIGHT episodes, without change, burning away half a season. I have no idea why theproducers thought this was a good idea, but they did.  The differences are subtle, but having watched them back-to-back, saw them. Clothing was the difference. CLOTHING. Unless you REALLY love clothing, do not watch episode 4-8. Besides the Endless Eight Arc, this season was top notch, without a doubt!",

            "content": "Alright. This is my first review EVER.\r\nI've seen all the 14 episodes of the second season and one thing I have to say is, it felt pretty plain. There just wasn't enough content in it to keep people interested, unlike the first season! I don't mean to hate on the Endless Eight (it served a very important role which you find out in the movie), but 8 episodes of something repeating, 5 episodes of the Sigh (which were enjoyable but... not on par with the first season) and then the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody (my favourite).\r\nStory: 7. It may be high, but I realize the reasonof making the Endless Eight and the Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody. The Sigh felt very, VERY filler for me, though.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9. Classic KyoAni.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8. While not as awesome as the first season's catchy songs (especially the Hare Hare Yukai which went all over the internet), I still love the soundtrack of this season.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8. Even though the character that is most developed is YOU (if you watched the Eight), I really liked the development that happened in the Eight and the Rhapsody. Again, the Sigh felt filler and didn't do a lot of development.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7. I DID enjoy watching the Eight a bit, and I certainly enjoyed watching the Rhapsody and the Sigh (something being filler doesn't mean it's not fun).\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7. I just didn't feel satisfied. It's not because of the Eight, but... yeah.",

Then, we all know what happened with the Endless Eight, which really did live up to the\"Endless\" part of it's name. Although I did like the first episode of the 8-part story, by the second episode I was a little disappointed due to the lack of originality, and you can only imagine how I felt watching all 8 parts. So even for a rather short 28-episode anime, there were quite a lot of filler episodes, which was a little disappointing.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, these are only the downsides to this series, truth be told, the plotline (in my opinion), was extremely original (even though they never explained  exactly what Haruhi was), and the humor in this show never failed to make me laugh. Between Mikuru's awkwardness, Haruhi's boldness, and Kyon's use of sarcasm, it generally made me laugh quite a bit. Not to mention the very few parts of the story that were sad (I'll avoid putting any examples due to most of them being spoilers.)\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime truly made me smile, even though some of the filler episodes were extremely painful to sit through, not to mention the episode order being a little odd, I would recommend anyone to watch this if they're in need of a good laugh and a little heartwarming.",

            "content": "First off episode 12 to 19 or also known as the endless eight..... F*** you, that is all.\r\nThe story:\r\nThe story follows the narrator and male protagonist Kyon, a cynical and incredulous student entering high school, who is dragged along by the title character and female protagonist Haruhi Suzumiya (who is Kyon's classmate). She is an eccentric girl seeking supernatural phenomena and figures such as aliens, time travelers, and espers. She establishes with Kyon's reluctant help, a club to investigate mysterious events called the SOS Brigade. Haruhi later recruits three additional members: the laconic bibliophile Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the extremelyfriendly transfer student Itsuki Koizumi. These members soon reveal themselves to Kyon as the extraordinary characters Haruhi, who is unaware of her own destructive reality warping power, is seeking. The three additional members have been sent by their various organizations to observe Haruhi and prevent these powers from being unleashed, leaving to Kyon the task of maintaining for Haruhi the illusion of a normal life\\n\\n\r\nSo basically Haruhi is like some sort of god, but she doesn't know it and Kyon and the others are there to prevent her from knowing that she has powers because if she does she could change the world and destroying it.\\n\\n\r\nOk so if you haven't watch this anime yet, what I mean by episode 12 to 19 or the endless eight is that in these eight episodes the same damn thing keeps happening in other words the episode repeats themselves on what has happened in the same week, so when the week ends it will start all over again and they will be doing the same thing all over again.\\n\r\nBut it's just part of the story and you don't need to watch all eight of them (cause I hell sure didn't), just watch episode 12, 13 and skip to 19 if you want.\\n\r\nIt's basically the same episode just that at the middle of the episodes Kyon starts having dejavu and then they discover the same thing has happened and is happening, but they don't know what to do to stop it.\\n\\n\r\nSo besides the BS that is the endless eight it's a really good anime and I especially liked the movie.\\n\r\nThere's a bit of romance, a lot of drama, action and comedy.\\n\r\nThere was this one episode where they were having a school festival and Haruhi filled in for a injured member in a band to sing and play guitar and it was probably one of the awesomest thing I've seen, some people say the japanese version is better than the english version but i liked the english version better.\\n\r\nSo I recommend you watch this anime cause it's a really good anime and don't stop watching it because of the endless eight stick through it and it will all be worth it. ^-^",

            "content": "[Note: this review covers seasons 1&2, watched in chronological order]\r\nHaruhi is a weird one.  It's a show that very much has a clear idea of what it wants to be, and doesn't aim to be universally liked if it can be the best example of... that.  But is it worthwhile?\r\nFor the most part, I say yes.  The reason is the characters.  The majority of them spend their time playing one note, but they harmonize together really well together, and rather than feeling underdeveloped end up feeling clean and clear.  Together, the leads of the SOS Brigade can be put througha number of different events, mostly trying to manage the fantastical exuberance of Haruhi.  This is a cast of characters I'm happy to see interact with the various phenomena and events they're thrown in with, and there's at least a little exploration everywhere.\\n\\n\r\nIn chronological (rather than broadcast) order, the flow of the show as a whole is a little bit wonky: the biggest climax happens in the first half of the show, and the final few episodes feel more like filler.  I find that to be... OK.  In a sense, Haruhi is a slice of life show.  The life in question is extremely strange, but it doesn't need to have a dramatic arc to it.  This is actually one of the turns I've come to appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nSo, let's get down to it, the part everybody talks about: the Endless Eight.  This arc is so infamous that despite going in spoiler-free, even I knew to \"Beware\".  I received lots of recommendations from reviews like this one, many to watch only the first and the last of those eight episodes, and dire comments about it driving viewers insane.  Well, I disregarded that advice and watched the whole thing and... I at least am no more insane than I already was.  I think what helped may have been pacing.  I typically go through shows at about an episode a day; I neither had to wait a week for the next installment of the Endless Eight nor attempted to surmount the whole thing at once.  There are some nice details to it that I feel like I was able to appreciate, so while I won't lie and say it didn't wear on me, it was interesting as an exercise in the art of cinema and storytelling, based on how the changing of elements throughout the Endless Eight made each entry unique.  That said, if you're not the kind of nerd who would like to pick apart, compare, and contrast tiny details... watch the first (because it's the first) and the second (So you know what the arc is all about), and then if you feel like you're going to have a bad time if this continues for six more episodes, skip to the last.\\n\\n\r\nOutside the Endless Eight?  I liked all the other arcs.  the titular \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\" (the backbone of Season 1) was my favorite, and \"The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya\" was also very good for the most part, though there was one episode in particular that strained the likeability of a character who's normally at least fun to watch.  The shorter arcs and one-off episodes were fun, but light.  The show worked best when it had more time to set up and break down the goings-on.\\n\\n\r\nFor the art and Sound, outside my academic interest in the artistic interpretation of the Endless Eight, it's a good-looking show, and easy to see why so many followed in its style... but neither the content nor the choices made are perfect.  It's good, but not great.  The voice acting and music though are notably above average.  A lot of personality is brought to every character by their voices, and the opening and ending themes are damn catchy.\\n\\n\r\nScores\\n\r\nStory: 6\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts: Haruhi the show and Haruhi the character are a lot alike -- not always easy to get along with, but usually charming enough to be easily forgiven for missteps or even premeditated misdeeds.  I'd say that, overall, it's worth the watch.",
