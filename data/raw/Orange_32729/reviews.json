            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nIt\u2019s a well known fact that shoujo anime have never been the most original pieces of work. They follow a very basic and straightforward structure, and more often than not end up feeling way too dramatized and overly-melodramatic for no apparent reason. Once you've seen one you've seen them all, right? Some people would beg to differ, and as to disprove my claim the adaptation of Orange reared its ugly head out of the deepest depths of shoujo hell itself to quickly rise to the top of this season's charts, smirking all the while it does it. Watch as the magnificent story of Orangeunfolds, giving us deep insight into taboo topics like depression and suicide, viewed in distasteful shoujo fashion. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Orange revolves around Naho, a carefree girl in her second year of highschool. One day, she stumbles upon a magical letter that is able to foresee her near future. The letter was sent from Naho to Naho 10 years in the past in hopes of her younger self being able to correct the mistakes she once made in highschool. How did the letter get there? Err.. A black hole in the Pacific ocean.. n' stuff.. I couldn't make this shit up even if I tried, could I? Anyhow, it's up to Naho to correct her past mistakes by saving the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, from taking his own life. As convoluted as the plot may seem, it's not bad straight off the bat for lacking a sense of realism. Instead, Orange's problem is that even that which is supposed to be grounded in reality feels like it isn't. What I'm referring to is the lousy presentation the series decided to resort to when tackling both the internal and external conflicts of the characters, like Kakeru being depressed for the sake of it and Naho being the weakest and most helpless creature on planet earth, thus making it unbearable to watch her interactions with Kakeru as she hopelessly tries to undo the regrets that the letter spoke of.\\n\\n\r\nAdding on to that, to say that Naho is not a very outgoing girl would be an understatement. At certain times she appears to be completely and utterly socially inept, despite seemingly being a part of and having a decently-sized group of friends. Such a protagonist works great for Orange though, as having anyone other be the lead instead of such an indecisive girl would bring about a rather quick and uneventful resolution to things as no mind-mindbogglingly unnecessary conflict would ever arise. The fact that Naho prioritizes the most trivial of things over changing the future is also a huge problem. She finds out that there\u2019s a way to undo one of her regrets simply by writing \u201cNo\u201d on a piece of paper. And what does she do? She messes it up by postponing it to go and clean the classroom. And even when she isn\u2019t caught up in anything and has a clear resolution of what she\u2019s supposed to do, she doesn\u2019t do it simply due to reluctance. I understand that she\u2019s a refined girl and all but that doesn\u2019t mean that she should constantly refrain from going out of her comfort zone every once in a while due to her shy demeanor when her actions will literally dictate whether a person lives or dies.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the cursed traditions of the shoujo genre, it is a given that emotion beats out logic in 99% of cases. And as such, logic and rationality completely cease to exist within the relationships between the main cast. Fuck magical letters that bend the space time continuum, Suwa's attitude towards Naho and Kakeru's relationship is where the real supernatural stuff kicks in. I don't care if he's the nicest guy on the face of the planet, no person has the ability to undermine their own feelings like that solely for someone else's sake, especially seeing as he knows Kakeru for like, what, a month? I'd have a difficult time believing it even if the two knew each other since birth, but at the start of the series they're not even buddy-buddy entry level yet. The relationship between Naho and Kakeru itself often tends to fall into unbelievable territory as well. How unrealistically oblivious these characters are to each other's feelings for a handful of episodes is what makes the series feel so stretched out at times since instead of going from A to B, their relationship has a bad habit of going on detours and wandering off to C,D and F. The \"Oblivious teenagers\" trope in romance anime has been oversatured beyond repair and it doesn't help when the anime at hand has a set premise that it can't seem to get to the point of because it's too busy playing a game of ring around the rosy with its' romance. Nevermind that they saw the fireworks together or held hands, that's just what friends of the opposite sex enjoy doing. No implications what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in Orange aren\u2019t good or bad, but rather painfully average as they tend to play into various cookie cutter tropes due to the genre at hand. Starting from the bottom in a literal sense, we\u2019ve got Naho. She\u2019s weak, inattentive to an unhealthy degree, lacks the confidence to say a single sentence without stuttering, crying or running away and has no defying personality what so ever. All of these things when combined essentially just make her an all-around terrible character, with her only redeeming quality being the fact that she's relatively cute. You remember that one time you were at the shopping mall and walked by that small child that was very clearly lost? That's Naho in a nutshell. She's got absolutely no clue how to act or even think on her own and while her constant blunders keep the story moving forward, her lack of resolve ultimately makes her an extremely unlikable character.\\n\\n\r\nI know it may seem like I'm nagging on her simply because she is a flawed human being, something that's supposed to make her more realistic and/or relatable. Brief rundown: A character is (not) complex when he or she is not a perfect human being or close relative of Jesus-kun. Whether a character is complex or not is simply the aftermath of good writing, something that Orange lacks entirely. Comparing her to Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion would be good practice of that. Shinji, at the end of the day, is a well-written, multilayered and sympathetic character. Granted, he is not a likable character, but his personality is entirely justified during the course of the series and the anime makes the viewer very well aware of that. Naho, on the other hand is also unlikable, but her personality is not justified in the slightest, nor is she the least bit sympathetic. She is presented as a mentally-handicapped schoolgirl that can't be bothered stepping out of her comfort zone when her actions literally dictate whether the person she loves lives or dies, and that just makes her a cunt.\\n\\n\r\nAngsty Teenager-kun (Angst-kun for short) first enrolls into the story appearing as a mystery figure, as for a good duration of the story we don\u2019t know much of anything about him. This is totally acceptable though, because by the time the nature of his character comes to light, you'll be wishing he had just remained angsty for no apparent reason. After many not-so-subtle hints throughout the anime, it is then revealed that Angst-kun suffers from clinical depression. I liked you Kakeru, I really did. Due to Naho's over-incompetence in every situation, I had come to view you as the hero who takes the initiative, thus making this story move if but a single inch further. Unfortunately, Orange seems to have a very falsified perception of depression and suicide and for that, Angst-kun had to be the scapegoat and embodiment of the writer's complete and utter lack of knowledge on this subject. There's also no real way to feel sympathy for him either, seeing as his other attributes consist of being heavily controlling and having severe anger-management issues. I can see why him and Naho get along so well. Here's how Kakeru's cycle of depression tends to play out:\\n\\n\r\nStep 1: In case everything is going well, make sure to bring up your dead mother for no apparent reason other than to kill the mood\\n\r\nStep 2: Get pissed off about friends trying to cheer you up and unnecessarily lash out at them (preferably Naho)\\n\r\nStep 3: Quick, make a run for it!\\n\r\nStep 4: Regret doing so & turn suicidal :'(\\n\r\nStep 5: Rinse and repeat\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't enough, they top it all off by demonizing the relationship between his mother in order to victimize him further, until pulling a Shigatsu where it actually turns out his mother was a living saint the whole time! You know, they were just taking her bad deeds out of context, when in actuality she really cared about him.. Fuck off. Moving on, Suwa is easily the most likeable and respectable character in the entire story. However, while you can tell that unlike Kakeru, he genuinely cares about his friends' wellbeing, his stance on Naho and Kakeru's relationship is far too idealistic to be real. While his goody-two-shoes persona does make him prevail over the likes of Kakeru, it also makes his character all too stale and predictable. His best moments are easily the ones in which he feels conflicted whether or not to act upon his intuition and snatch Naho for himself instead of undermining his feelings. Unfortunately, they are very few and far in between, as for the overwhelming majority of the show he simply acts as Kakeru's wingman without bothering to intervene. No one else in their group stands out.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside their heavy resemblance to puddle-toads, the character designs are somewhat visually-pleasing and even help the aesthetic in a sense. The animation doesn\u2019t really have any opportunities to shine as the most intense it ever gets is just the characters running away from each other (I just made myself giggle).The opening looks decent for what it is and the ending is mostly just a slideshow of still images, but the directing is really where the technical department of Orange shines. I was skeptical to see the poor guy  behind Steins;Gate and Texhnolyze be reduced to directing Orange, but alas, he once again successfully utilizes many different editing tricks in order to enhance the atmosphere and the various emotions displayed throughout, shrugging aside any previous doubts of mine. If anything, it just proves his talent is being entirely wasted on a project like this, as a few directing tricks ain't nearly enough to pull it back on its' feet.\\n\\n\r\nYuck. The happy-go-lucky J-pop feel of the opening and ending made me nauseous. OST and voice acting aren't anything too impressive but get the job done. KanaHana going \"Eh?\" 20 times per episode made me want to nom on a handgun. \\n\\n\r\nIt's been made very evident to me that I'm not the target demographic for this show. Orange is like my antithesis in every sense of the word, from the obnoxious cast and generic plot, to the subpar theme exploration and lacklustre pacing. Trying to complete this series was excruciating in every sense of the word. There was no light at the end of this dark, desolate tunnel. After finishing it, my psyche feels like it's been violently flushed down the toilet, head-first and everything. What was it all for? For the credibility of this review? Definitely not worth it. Apart from the directing choice, there was not a single enjoyable element in Orange to be found. Even the driving force of the show - The drama which all fans of the show (fujoshi, mainly just fujoshi) gush over felt surreal and managed to miss its mark entirely. Muh depression :<\\n\\n\r\nAt its core Orange is an extremely character-driven show and as such, a weak cast is the biggest detriment it can possibly have. Poor characterization accompanied by constant, God-awful melodrama and a false perception on serious subjects like depression and suicide drag the series through the dirt, when it could have been much, much more. While the themes themselves are fairly intriguing as they are rarely ever brought up within the medium, the lack of proper execution doesn't give them much of anything to stand on, and as such, they tend to violently tumble over and fall into the realm of boring impracticality, where they'll soon after be forgotten. It prioritizes constant melodrama over everything else, and suffers heavily because of it. Every weaker aspect is subsequently amplified as the show progresses, and the only way it can be fully appreciated is if the doctor's prescription of sleeping pills is currently at a standstill.",

            "content": "[CONTAIN SPOILERS]\r\n_INTRO_\r\nSchool life is so fascinating and a typical shojo romance without a setting in high school isn't common, \"orange\" is no different but there's a lot more to it than just being your every day's anime.\r\n                                             __PLOT___\r\nThe plot is quite open from the first episode itself,nothing much of suspense.we're being introduced to Naho a 16-year-old girl,about to attend her secondyear of high school abruptly receives letters while on her way to school,the letters are from Naho herself, but ten years into future, who ask her youngest self to prevent her \"biggest regret\" from happening and that is to save Kakeru from dying.\\n\r\nThough initially skeptical, Naho eventually begins to read the letters as they predict some of the events that would happen in her time, the foremost being the enrollment of Kakeru (the main character), a transfer student from Tokyo, to her class. Kakeru is quickly befriended by Naho and her friends.\\n\r\nThrough the letters, Naho also learns that something bad will happen to Kakeru. She decides to do the opposite of the events detailed in the letters in hopes of averting it. At the same time, in future,Naho is now married and has a baby with Suwa, visits Kakeru's former home together with her friends, where it is revealed that they are attending a memorial for the long-dead Kakeru. What surprises them, however, is the revelation that Kakeru died not because of an accident, but suicide.\\n\r\nNow it's up to Naho and her friends to save Kakeru of this timeline where the future of their selves failed.\\n\\n\r\nMostly,we've been talking about how greatly the show touches our heart and I'm no different, but nothing is flawless and at some point,we've to be practical while judging a work as wholly and can't let our emotions get the better of us,the biggest mystery remains in this show is the execution of time travel mechanism.\\n\r\nIt's not like Doraemon use the time machine and deliver the letter to their respectively past selves from the future.\\n\r\nAlthough we're told that they used the theory of black hole to interact with their past selves but we would never know how they did it,this part is so mess up and I wouldn't have complained if it was just a regular romance shoujo but it's a sci-fiction as well,we got all the rights to know and all other aspects can't overshadow it,Something things are better left untouched rather than bringing up unrealistic logics.\\n\\n\r\n                            ___CHARACTERS___\\n\r\nThe story mainly revolves around these three Kakeru, Naho and Suwa,although we can't deny the fact the others characters are less important,but they didn't get much spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru-I considers him the most realistic character of the show,it's not often that an issue like depression is highlighted in the story these days, but over here it's done precisely in the form of Kakeru.\\n\r\nHe's the type of guy who would never show the pain in front of others and will bear it all alone from inside.\\n\\n\r\nNaho- she's like any other girl of her age who believe in first-time love,she was deeply committed to saving Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa-The most cheerful guy in the crew,despite his feelings toward Naho he tried his best to keep her happy and help Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nHagita- A creepy character but he did something good at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa-The official bread girl.\\n\\n\r\nTakako-A friend,I really don't know what else to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWho doesn't like a love triangle?Probably many but still I would like to bring up.\\n\\n\r\nIn the future timeline, Naho fell in love with Kakeru but things didn't work out right and had much lesser interaction,meanwhile, Suwa couldn't control his feelings anymore,confessed to her,Kakeru died and they end up together but a feeling of regret always remained in Naho which hurt Suwa seeing her like this\\n\\n\r\nIn the parallel timeline, Naho fell in love with Kakeru as usual and was able to understand him better and spend more time,while Suwa deeply in love with Naho knew the outcome if he was to confess his feelings,so he didn't let himself become a bother to their relation and ended up acting as the selfless good guy but no one is certain of the future.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why so much hatred towards Kakeru,everyone got their fair chance in both the timelines.\\n\\n\r\n                                 ______ART_______\\n\r\nAnother breakthrough point for an anime besides the plot is the animation and over here,it's pretty mediocre.\\n\r\nAlthough the background seems to be quite up to the mark but the characters design,movements are so sluggish and imperfect,it's really disappointing to see.\\n\\n\r\n                                     _____SOUND____\\n\r\nThe opening 'Hikari no Hahen\" by Yu Takahashi is really splendid and set the mood for the next  20 minutes of the show while the ending \"Mirai\" by Kobukuro act as a catalyst to all those feelings we go through.\\n\r\nAnd it's a anime with deep emotion and with the right tone,it did justice to the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                     _____ENJOYMENT________\\n\r\nI did enjoy it and each episode was an emotionally roller coastal ride for me, but I somehow felt that the manga was better in depicting each aspect to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\n                     ___________OVERALL________\\n\\n\r\nEmotion is something that fuels us,as everything we do is fueled by love,hate,passion,sadness;thus opening up an infinite number of paths which will inevitably change the way we see thing forever as every second goes by,Positive or negative there will be changes and that gamble of nature is thrilling.So get ready to ride on the feel train.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be the best adaptation right now but as a whole, it was worth watching and one of the best, the summer has to offer.",

            "content": "Adorned with lush textures of green and wrapped up in the endless blue horizon of the summer sky, Orange rests softly on the lips like a faint drop of nostalgia just waiting to be recollected. Approaching the quiet slice of countryside that remained dormant over many winters, we're flung back ten years to where it all began. The place where two paths collided but only one was allowed to move forward. A place tucked away behind walls of foliage, cradled in a valley older than time itself. There it resides, a small town that carries with it a sense of cultural simplicity that only theexclusion of the outside world could allow. Under cover of low hanging branches, the sun pierces its way through, lighting the path where a group of friends walks side by side to a future that lays bare before them. And in this huddle of jovial faces, we find Naho; a soft-spoken girl that has within her grasp a letter. A letter that will forever alter the course she takes and the fate of the ones huddled around her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with the arrival of a new student named Kakeru from Tokyo, this quiet little town perks up, and so does the latent curiosity residing within Naho. A spark ignites as these two worlds collide, their fates forever becoming intertwined in the process. And so begins the tale that unravels before us. A tale of bittersweet consequence, regret, and seeking solace in the embrace of others.  \\n\\n\r\nBreathing new life into what many would consider being a worn out formula, Orange proves that any set-piece could be spun into something wholly immersive under the right care. By only giving events a gentle push when needed, this anime found a way to offer freedom too noticeably absent in other works. A way to let things run their course. To give characters chances to emote in ways that feel at home with who they are and not what the screenplay strongarm them into being. To let what must be, be. With acclaimed director, Hiroshi Hamasaki, the man behind such works as Steins;Gate and Texhnolyze, taking the helm, this is immediately expressed with the first soft brushstroke that gives the world of Orange life, as things come into focus and we're formally introduced to the story it wishes to convey. \\n\\n\r\nAfter opening a letter addressed to her, Naho is rendered speechless by the contents written inside:\\n\r\n\"I'm writing this letter ten years in your future.\"\\n\r\nWas it a practical joke? Her friends leading her on for harmless fun? Or perhaps it was something more profound... and maybe, just maybe, the words addressed to herself, from herself, was real? And as the day transpired the unlikely answer became truth and any doubt that might have lingered faded away with the realization of what she held in her hand. This letter was no mere trick; this was real. \\n\r\n\"This is the one day I don't want you to invite Kakeru,\" she didn't listen before, but now she heeds those words. Now she knows that this far-fetched truth isn't something to disregard. Whether it be something as grand as divine prophecy or merely an elaborate setup she's incapable of figuring out, what is for certain is that the letter wasn't wrong\u2014a window into the future was given. A truth beyond comprehension.\\n\\n\r\nBut what she does understand is her friends. The clique that always welcomes her with open arms. Free to look on at their antics in silent bliss:\\n\r\nHitaga's larger than life persona, as he fends off comments, being playfully antagonized constantly by the quick-witted Azu, taking pleasure in seeing him fluster behind his thick-framed glasses, while Suwa towers over them amused by the \"married couple\" squabble taking place. Takako hanging back instigating with Azu complying gleefully, as they all crack a smile enjoying each others company. Trailing behind them with a small gesture of content, Naho doesn't ask for anything more than this. These are the moments that she lives for. The moments that Naho feel at home. And with Kakeru being brought into the mix, it's these moments she never wants to let go of. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being indoctrinated into the group with ease, Kakeru remains the anomaly. He flashes a reserved smile, accepts their gestures of friendship, humors them when they tease each other, and even participate on occasion. But just behind his gentle expression, there's a feeling of distance. A wall that keeps them outside from the truth that's eating away within. A mind that's off somewhere else, a lonely place that only his thoughts are allowed to occupy. And staring back at him is Naho, fixated on the truth behind the smoke and mirrors.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth she now possesses. Kakeru isn't going to be around for long if he follows this path, an idea that saddens her to the core.\\n\\n\r\nThe pain of carrying that burden alone. A life resting in her hands. A life she cares for immensely, yet can't express without the fear of rejection, or perhaps even more unnerving, the fear of being loved in return. Determined to save him, she's forced to open up. A girl who's not confident in her self-worth having to muster up enough courage for both of them. And though she may fumble over her words, go about nervously even to make eye contact, afraid of being adored by another, scared to death at the thought of being yearned for, she still presses on. Whether she manages to surpass the regret of her future-self at one minute only to fail by the next, every fiber of her being wants to keep Kakeru alive. A love that's equal parts selfish and unquestionable; a love she feels guilty for, ashamed at the thought of pressing for answers that she knows will hurt him to express. A pain of caring too much to see him go but being too bashful to say what's needed to make him stay. \\n\\n\r\nRegret. Suicidal tendencies. Adolescence. Young love. Life-altering decisions. Self-acceptance. Self-awareness. Selfish desire. Deceit. Earning trust. Learning to let go. Accepting defeat. Perseverance.\\n\\n\r\nA whirlwind of dilemmas heaped onto her lap the moment she decided to take action to stop the inevitable.\\n\\n\r\nBut is it alright to change the future, to listen to herself ten years ahead? A 26-year-old Naho, willing to change the decision of her reserved younger self for a future that would rob her of the life of a newborn child, nestled in the bosom of a loving mother's arms and a man who's in his own right the right match for her? This decision becomes about much more than saving someone, it becomes about weighed sacrifices. Nothing could be gained without the loss of something else. Is it right to gamble the happiness of others, and possible life of another, just to fulfill a want to preserve someone else's? Even the most trivial of occurrences could tip the scales in one side's favor. Fate doesn't choose favorites. The slightest swing of the pendulum determining the outcome and love of those involved. A fragile web that's only held in place by the desire to mend wounds not yet made and save a life that's not yet lost. \\n\\n\r\nThe summer breeze caressing her cheek, sunburnt hair fluttering ever so gently, with eyes of emerald looking outward to the unforeseen outcome of her actions. Was it right for her to challenge destiny? Was it her call to make? Pensive feelings only interrupted by the presence of a partner. Resting his steady hand on her shoulder, a caring look of reassurance offered, Suwa eases the burden; don't worry, I'm on your side, no matter the decision\u2014A silent exchange that says everything.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the moments that are brought to life by the talented team staffed with seeing the vision through. With vibrant earth tones protruding through brushstrokes of greenery, a rustic, yet polish look that's acid washed in Hiroshi's unique stylistic choices; everything displays a delicate touch, fine-tuned by people who care about the projects they're working on. With character design credit given to Nobuteru Yuuki, the same man that lent his talent to Kids on the Slope and Paradise Kiss, it all comes together into one cohesive piece. Carrying this off is a soundtrack that gently chimes in, with the soft stroke of an acoustic guitar, the gentle thumping rhythm of drums, and doled out piano keys that occasionally makes its presence known when the time calls for it; everything here has its place. It's a soundtrack that doesn't drown out the actions on screen but instead works in synchronicity with it. Choosing to be a supporting actor than the main attraction. \\n\r\nThis aspect was also true with the opening and ending themes, with \"Hikari no Hahen\" by Yu Takahashi capturing the essence of what's seen when you visit the world of Orange, and \"Mirai\" by Kobukuro capping it off with a bittersweet performance that embodies the underlying emotions that makes itself more apparent the further you venture in. The two\u2014art and audio\u2014found a space that they both occupy with complete acceptance of the other, creating a true sense of symbiosis. This wasn't to say that the presentation was always consistent, there were certainly moments that faltered, but when it counted the most, it found a way to drive things home. \\n\\n\r\nOrange takes school rom-com setups and elevates it beyond the stereotypical trappings and downright formulaic reactionary content it's usually infamous for. Where most school-orientated anime see fit to typecast characters with a small stock selection of personalities to choose from, often being identified by garishly colorful hairstyles and borderline caricature appearances; Orange broke away from this cast-iron mold, going against typing and the very notion of limited range for what's supposed to be considered as \"relatable\" characters. Instead, we're given teenagers that look and act as teenagers should. There's no token tsundere or mullet-sporting high-school delinquents, only different people with their mannerisms and personalities being brought together under one roof. This unit all compliment each other, in a manner that's done without so much as outright stating it. \\n\\n\r\nWe simply see it in their daily interactions. The socially inept know-it-all Hitaga's stubborn outward gestures against Azu's teasing, the two practically joined at the hip, refusing to address the source of their partnership. Takako's level-headed outlook on her friends, eons ahead of them all in maturity but won't hesitate to join in on \"girl talk\" if the chance presents itself. Naho's reserved nature, a person too kind to say no, satisfied with just being able to see others happy. And then there's Suwa's adopted role as big brother, putting aside his happiness to aid the happiness of others. He willingly becomes the anchor and bearer of unrequited love, harboring his feelings to allow another to blossom, all while doing it with a smile on his face. \\n\\n\r\nEach of these friends existing independently of each other but choosing to pool together where they have others that complete whatever they lack. Good on their own but better when there's a shoulder to lean on, someone to share their happiness, troubles, and existence with. The very idea that frightens the outsider being accepted within their circle. \\n\\n\r\nKakeru admires but fears the very idea of their friendship. A lingering thought that he carries with him, afraid to open up to let others in:\\n\r\n\"I don't deserve it. I haven't earned it. I'm not good enough. No one understands me. If I get too close, I will only hurt them in the end. How could anyone care for me after what I've done? I shouldn't be allowed happiness.\"\\n\\n\r\nHe sits there, eating away, wanting to reach out but pulling away out of fear. Out of guilt. But whenever he's had enough, ready to end it all, there's always a voice ringing out in the distance. His name being called out by the short-statured girl with sunburnt hair. A girl that tugs at him to stay. A girl he wants nothing but the best for. \\n\\n\r\nOrange isn't filled with characters spouting out summations of themselves, nor does it bother to hammer home points not expressed explicitly through dialogue. It lets the actions, the expressions, the mannerisms, the scenes, the camera, the color, the music, the very nature of the show itself, to do all the talking in its place. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while I've expressed nothing but the utmost praise for Orange, there's still a lot of issues that plague it. For one, details about the conflict itself.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the romance aspect can get clumsy at times. There are occasions where it's awkward, and that doesn't count scenes when it was done so on purpose. With the density of some characters pushing it, especially when considering their giant progressive leaps forward in the latter half of the show, it does wane on you a bit, if only temporarily. A big confessional scene could be truncated for awkward teenage crushing by the next episode. A kind of regression that felt like it served just to pad out the schedule running time than it did to service the material at hand. While some of these issues could have been credited with the fact that they're teenagers and are not fully capable of expressing themselves to the best of their capabilities, it still doesn't magically make the feeling disappear. But of course, that's an excuse I'm sure many have grown tired of hearing, despite the fact that it inherently holds a great deal of truth about any youth in the middle of their teenage years. It's not always an answer we like, but it's still one that's acceptable for the sake of immersion. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then some viewers would address the issue regarding time-travel. Let it be known that there wasn't any need to try to explain the mechanics of the time-travel used since time-travel was nothing but a narrative tool to set in motion what mattered: the characters. But even with that being said, it doesn't negate the fact that that element of the show was never adequately explained in a meaningful way. Given the fact that this aspect of the show came in the form of a letter required some suspension of disbelief as to why more wasn't done to take full advantage of it. However, I believe downplaying the time-travel aspect as something that's not needed to drive its narrative or be used as a means to reset mistakes if they fail to follow through on the words written the first time, was the best decision to make. Had they been able to repeat critical events constantly, it would have diminished the regret and success of their efforts throughout the course of the show. The letter was merely a timeline for them to follow, but the actual legwork, struggle, pain, happiness, lessons learned, and obstacle conquered, was done of their own accord. And when their efforts, or lack thereof, diverge from what's written on the letter, it disproves any omniscience to control the course of time or predict it flawlessly, which makes this an example of a plot device not being readily abused. And when accounted for how often that isn't the case for anime that include time-travel, or other forms of media for that matter, that's a great accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in a nutshell, that's Orange's greatest strength; taking things that are quickly disregarded, such as school rom-coms and time-travel setups, and turning them into something that could be engaging and level-headed. \\n\\n\r\nIf time-travel is readily abused in most stories, don't make it a central focus of your narrative, use it as a guideline instead. If school rom-coms are infamous for having color-coordinated dimensionless personas, take a subdued approach that pulls from the same core values yet brought to life with personalities that feel far more believable. Orange takes the basics and proves that with enough care it could be reacknowledged as a viable means of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nWith the right amount of passion interjected, what would usually stop as just characters on-screen, backdrops for 23 minutes of entertainment, and a quick conversation of some piece of media, can now be transformed into a lasting impression that people could carry with them. One that could offer fond experiences for moments you've wished for, and passing instances of nostalgia you've never had. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as we depart, leaving the world of Orange behind us, zooming past the aged walkways, green linen jackets worn by adolescence; back through the cracks of the skyline hidden behind a wall of leaves hanging above, we know that we're leaving a place with a memory to take away from it. And as we become less aware of its existence, going about our routines, the world of Orange and its inhabitants continues on, living their day to day lives, making memories of their own and looking up in bewilderment at the endless blue, pondering as to what their future may hold.",

            "content": "\"Sometimes it's better to learn from the past than to try and go back changing it all... But if given the chance, what would we really do?\"\r\n-Anonymous\r\nHave you ever regretted something so much you'd do anything possible to change the outcome? Maybe it was something as trivial as not asking that one person out, forever leaving the question out there of \"what if?\" Or perhaps you even knew of someone hurting internally from depression, and didn't give your best effort to help them cope, with the worst possible outcome reaching fruition. At times, this can make us feel helpless, responsible or even apathetic. Hindsight is20/20, but what if that retrospective approach could be realized? What if you could alter your previous regrets and change the outcome of the future? Would you finally get a chance to forgive yourself? Would this corrective measure spawn even worse implications? In the end, are things are better left as they are, or fixed to fit our own perception of \"correct\"?\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is, there may not be a single correct answer.\\n\\n\r\nOBLIGATORY SPOILERS WARNING :D\\n\\n\r\nOrange is a series that had me intrigued since I first heard about it. Personally, the premise was irrelevant based on director Hiroshi Hamasaki's previous works as the lead on Steins;Gate and Texhnolyze. The Slice of Life genre can be so hit and miss with me, so I had no idea what to expect coming into it. Orange focuses less on the day to day lulls of everyday life and more on love, loss and the importance of relationships. Mix in the ever ambiguous element of time travel for good measure and you've got a series destined for some great table talk, if nothing else. It's not the most \"exciting\" show around, and will stumble along the way, but in the end will give viewers a new outlook on the Slice of Life genre entirely.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the first anime I could compare Orange to is that of Anohana- The Flower We Saw That Day due to the subject matter of premature loss. Granted the death in that anime was purely accidental, the retrospective grief exhibited by the main characters here is reminiscent of the series. Another difference between the two are the plot devices. For some reason, everyone seems to have their own take on how time travel works. Although it's never actually been completed on record, some have formulated rather complex technicalities regarding the theory. Of course, Orange exposed its own narrative to these figurative pencil-pushers when it introduced the element into its story, and even I'll admit it is done rather half-assed. Did you know that throwing letters into a black hole somewhere near the Bermuda Triangle could, betwixt space and time, send them 10 years into the past? No? Me either. \\n\\n\r\nIn order to actually enjoy Orange, this is the time I ask you to put your critical thinking caps back on the shelf, and focus on its important aspects. It's easy to become distracted by such melancholy narratives and skim over glaring plot holes, but this is best in Orange's case... or you might miss a rather enjoyable anime. Forget about how much you think you know about time travel and experience the series for what it truly is, a drama slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a multitude of \"little things\" Orange nails with its direction. The way Naho and Kakeru act toward each other is a perfect snapshot of teenage romance. Everything is awkward, there's lots of dead air in conversation and enough blushing to make any weeaboo giddy with excitement. This relationship is a seed, gently nurtured a little each episode, inelegant in all facets but eventually blossoms into a unique thing of beauty. This is pretty spot on for what real love looks like. The writers also do a fine job showcasing the sour side of love when Naho gets pushed to the side or showing Suwa contemplate his own feelings in secret regarding her. This is a very important part of the show, and I must say Suwa has quite the iron will for everything he let pass him by along the way. This genre of anime can often be melodramatic or exaggerated immensely, so it's refreshing to see an anime like Orange create a high school atmosphere we can all identify with instead of one with unrealistic, heavily endowed 16 year olds and scrappy Tsunderes flying around.\\n\\n\r\nAnother well written aspect of the series is the pacing. There are many instances in SoLs where \"things are happening, things are happening.... BAM! Insert major timeline jump or plot twist with no foreshadowing\". The series slowly builds up over time, with the eventual conclusion offered as a reward for patience as a viewer and honestly it felt rather satisfying. Rewatching the first few episodes of Orange kind of made me smirk due to the many intricate foreshadowing elements sprinkled around each episode. It's certainly something I didn't expect from this genre of anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can imagine how difficult it would be to tackle heavy-hearted subjects in anime such as suicide or mourning. Most anime often treat death as something that happened in the past and default to flashbacks and scenes with the shrine of the deceased loved one. Orange places you in the moment, and truly builds up your own relationship with Kakeru, making the realization of his fate that much more impactful. It isn't delicate with its approach, and shows both sides of the coin with its description. I can say it left an impression on me and changed my outlook on suicide in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Orange, or rather the final 3 episodes caught me off guard. I was initially assuming the viewers wouldn't get a take of Kakeru's side of the story. On the surface, it was hard to fathom why anyone would actually kill themselves the way he did, with the reasons he did. It's obvious as a viewer that his mother's death wasn't his fault, yet he bares the entire load himself. The anime from his side of the story is eye opening, and builds into a fine ending with appropriate closure (something we don't see often enough in anime). I personally appreciated it's honesty, and it wasn't necessarily a \"rose colored\" ending we were probably all hoping for but it was real. Well, except for all that time travel jargon.\\n\\n\r\nI've already professed the relatability the characters in Orange exude. They act like high schoolers without an over-dramatized personality, they interrupt each other's sentences and there are few to no tropes present overall (something I was excited about). Naho is a very \"real\" main protagonist. As much as I wanted to shake her through my tv screen at times, it reminded me of how stupid I must have seemed at similar points during my own high school life. It does seem odd that this group of friends rarely argue or have moments of strife within their click, but I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing. The final episodes tied up the loose ends I had with Kakeru as a character and it couldn't have been presented any better. Those of you shelving this series before the last 3 episodes... I urge you to pick it back up and try again.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Orange is produced by Telecom Animation Film, a relatively unsuccessful studio. This leads to rather inconsistent or sloppy animation at times, but not quite enough to affect the show's overall atmosphere. The directing was a gleaming fault I can bring up as well. Aside from the positives I mentioned, it's rather lackluster. I understand this is one of the first popular manga adaptations for this studio, but even so, there are some portions of scenes that felt rather dull or ill-envisioned. The best part of the directing? It doesn't really ruin it for me. In Re Zero, the plot was weak but good directing made it rather enjoyable while with Orange the good plot isn't ruined by bad directing. It was a crucial lifesaver for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hated the OP the first couple of weeks with its odd animation and music, but it actually grew on me by the final episode. The ED is also fitting for the series, atmosphere wise. The soundtrack was average, but I often didn't notice background tracks. This can be a double edged sword from an enjoyment perspective but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt here. Voice acting is very good with Kana Hanazawa (Black Rock Shooter, Onodera from Nisekoi) nailing another solid performance as Naho.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Orange? Well, if you can live with my added disclaimer regarding the time travel concept, the series has quite a bit more to offer. Sure it stumbles along and deals with very touchy subject matter, but it is something I truly believe anyone could enjoy. Realistic characters with great pacing and a beautifully crafted ending works to overshadow the time travel eyesore and subpar directing and Ill say it does so quite well. I am impressed with how much I ended up liking it in the end and would recommend it to any anime fan. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Summer '16 anime reviews!",

            "content": "Tell me, dear reader, why do you think this series is called Orange? Is it because of the symbolic orange juice from episode three? Is it because the main character\u2019s hair looks rather orange in the sunlight? Both are interesting and passable theories, but I would like to present my own:\r\nIt\u2019s because the main character has the intelligence of an orange.\r\nOrange is one of those common scenarios where the show starts off pretty well but then fizzles out towards the end, but not really because it has strong drama in the beginning that falls apart later--in fact, the first episodes are not particularly overwhelming. Butrather, Orange was natural, organic, and fresh with its cast and even its setting, until the latter half of the series, where things don\u2019t exactly fall off the tree altogether\u2026 they just grow rotten. \\n\\n\r\nFRUIT PUNS.\\n\\n\r\nTime travel is a difficult concept to tackle; it\u2019s a quick attention-grabber that will draw in a large audience, but screwing it up just a little bit can cause all hype to ERASE. I was skeptical of Orange\u2019s concept myself, for these questions.\\n\\n\r\n1. Why do the people in this anime have the ability to send letters into the past when their only life problem seems to be losing a single friend? Why not give it to the MC of 91 Days so that he can prevent his parents from getting shot? I think that guy deserves it a little more.\\n\r\n2. How does it work? Are there certain limitations, such as what you can and can\u2019t send? Can you send yourself a bunch of money and tell yourself to put it in the bank to be super rich in the future and not start getting into cocaine early on? Maybe if the latter happens, you can send a bomb and just end it quickly. Wait, would killing yourself in the past count as suicide? ...Sorry, I\u2019ll get back to the point.\\n\r\n3. Why are they using this amazing gift just to potentially save someone\u2019s life instead of something more noble and grand, such as preventing a massive tragedy, like the death of Harambe? Or Berserk fans?\\n\\n\r\nThe last question isn\u2019t exactly a criticism of what goes on in the story, just a point that this concept could be used in way more interesting ways. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, this concept just leaves a weird taste in my mouth. Future Naho has a bunch of friends surrounding her, a great husband, and a beautiful child\u2026 so she thinks \u201cthis fucking sucks\u201d and just writes to herself in the past so she can change it? Alright. Granted, this is somewhat remedied in the future, but it\u2019s pretty far down the line so this kinda bugged me for a while.\\n\\n\r\nOn a bit of a plus, the concept of the time travel letters was done pretty well for a while. It makes a lot of sense for Naho to be skeptical of them at first, because Future Naho apparently hadn\u2019t considered that it's at least slightly weird to say that she's her from the future and that she knows all this shit that's gonna happen. So, naturally, Naho ignores the first thing or two, and there are consequences to obeying or disobeying the letters, but these consequences aren\u2019t usually seen right away. This is great! It's not a quick and obvious story, therefore reducing predictability. They also naturally cause a chain reaction, with the influence of certain, early decisions continuing to make an impact many episodes deep into the show. \\n\\n\r\nBut eventually, the reader of a time travelled letter is gonna figure out that it\u2019s not bullshit and start obeying every rule made; therefore, there can\u2019t be any drama for disobeying them because there\u2019s no disobeying to be done. How is this overcome in Orange?\\n\\n\r\nWell, to being with, the main character, Naho, is--and let\u2019s be reasonable here--a complete fizzlefuck with a brain having the consistency of mashed potatoes. I mean, my Arceus, her social ineptness goes to the point where I considered her to have some sort of mental deficit. She kinda sort of maybe tries to possibly form a relationship or so with Kakeru, the person she and her much more socially competent friends are trying to save, but when it comes to actually doing anything, her awkwardness and clumsiness don\u2019t help out much, if at all. It comes off as normal at first, sure, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any learning curve over the course of the series--if anything, her incompetence goes up.\\n\\n\r\nA bigger problem is the weird lack of drama in this show. Since the letters lay the plot out perfectly, there\u2019s not much room for drama outside of Naho having a mushy brain. Naho needs a good rival. Someone who comes in to swoop Kakeru awa--oh wait, that actually happens! For a brief moment. The drama caused by That One Bitch (that\u2019s her name) is cleaned up pretty quickly because of the letters, and then she disappears from the show completely. I wish she didn\u2019t, and that the drama wasn\u2019t solved so quickly. Having some sort of dramatic subplot would\u2019ve been a nice break from the constant focus of the letters--or even better, someone could potentially steal the letters and use them against them instead. Wouldn\u2019t that be something.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem with the drama and the time travel is the character of Kakeru. He\u2019s\u2026 boring. Too boring. In fact, the only personality trait he seems to have is that he\u2019s depressed. This is the guy who needs to be saved, the person everything in the show revolves around, but I don't actually care about him that much. Just because a character is depressed doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll automatically like them. I like to be entertained. I want characters to be fun or interesting in some way. Someone is depressed and gloomy all the time? Oh. Well, have fun being sad, I guess. Just slapping the trait of depression on someone seems like a really lazy way to write an emotional story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since this is a romance anime, guess what? The two most boring characters in the show, Naho and Kakeru, are supposed to get together. You can kinda imagine how this goes, even moreso with Naho\u2019s clumsiness. But see, that doesn\u2019t bother me too much. I could just not really care about that shipping in the end. But it bothers me instead, because Future Naho\u2019s husband, Suwa, is a major character in this show, who has feelings for her. This is a WAY better ship, because Suwa is a much more interesting character than Cockeru and actually does things other than be depressed. He was someone I was actually rooting for in the end. And I'm not alone--go on forums, go on Reddit. Many other people were rooting for Suwa in the end. When you have a show that\u2019s destined to pair two characters together, but the audience is rooting for a different possibility that completely contradicts the story\u2026 that\u2019s not a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the explanation of the time travel\u2026 holy shit. Maybe they call it Orange because that's what Makise Kurisu would be shitting if she heard about this. Remember when in ERASED, it was a problem that they never explained the main character\u2019s power? Now I feel like it might\u2019ve been for the better, because Orange is so painfully dumb with its own idea that I wish they didn\u2019t share it at all. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a spoiler to post it or not, but it involves a really basic urban legend, and\u2026 nothing. That\u2019s it. Someone in Future Naho\u2019s group of friends connects it to a completely random class they had once (which was actually shown, to be fair), because everyone remembers random classes they had ten years ago, and\u2026 nothing. That\u2019s it. They all completely believe this crazy legend that has absolutely no conclusive proof to it, and apparently make a huge effort to take a vacation wherever they need to go in order to perform it. The fact that it actually works annoys me, I wish these fuckers got lost at sea trying to attempt this stupid plan.\\n\\n\r\nBut if there\u2019s any consolation, it\u2019s not until very close to the end of the series where they actually explain this, so it isn\u2019t a huge focus. It\u2019s just kinda there to say that there\u2019s a reason for it to work, I guess, even if that reason is retarded.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of the negatives for now, though. Why was I a little impressed with the show at first, outside of the concept? Because it sells its setting, and to an extent it\u2019s characters (despite what I said), very well. It\u2019s a school, which automatically sounds generic, but it really feels like an actual high school. There\u2019s always something going on, some people talking and moving and doing something in the background. Just a few details like some random stock characters saying a couple lines make it feel lively. And Naho\u2019s group of friends really seem like a group of people who are friends. They each have great chemistry with each other, teasing each other by saying a bunch of dumb shit and playing off of their lines, always having a good time and being there for each other. The people not named Nah, Ho and Cock-a-doodle-do are quite fun to watch and breathe a lot of life into Orange\u2019s natural environment.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Orange is not completely tinted Orange, so it gets a 1/10 in the art department. But it does, at least, have some pretty strong lighting; that\u2019s what stands out to me the most in the early episodes, as there isn\u2019t a whole lot to do in terms of animation or even character design, which is about average\u2026 in the early episodes. Later on, the show almost completely falls apart at points, with character models looking completely sloppy, like the studio only had five minutes to animate the episode. After all, TMS Entertainment did like every show this season that J.C. Staff didn\u2019t have a hand in, or something. But, it\u2019s still driven forward by what I said about the environment being lively, with a lot of things going on in the back. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn\u2019t memorable at all, though. By episode four, I wrote a note saying \u201cevery song is acoustic guitar\u201d and didn\u2019t seem to keep track of it beyond that. Oh. The OP is okay, though\u2026 I don\u2019t like the singer very much, but the song is very mellow and pretty well-written. The ED is pretty boring with its even more mellow, dreary tone, but it at least has some decent art of the gang together. And there aren\u2019t any post-credit scenes, so it\u2019s easy to skip anyway.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Orange to those looking for teenage melodrama, but do know that it\u2019s not too interesting due to its overall lack of drama and really basic motivations for the characters. Perhaps if you\u2019re into time travel and some consequences of it, Orange kinda taps into that, but not too much. I do wish they could\u2019ve done with the letters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, Orange was\u2026 eh. It was okay, I guess. It wasn\u2019t horrible; I\u2019m not even sure if I can say that it was flat-out bad. I wish a lot more could\u2019ve been done, though. It plays itself almost unconfidently, with its basic lead characters and lack of drama. It\u2019s too safe.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nEntertainment - 4/10\\n\r\nJuice - Tangy/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4.25/10 (Range: 3.75-5.5)\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 1, 3\\n\r\nFavorite character - Suwa\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium-low",

            "content": "Aw, those sweet teenage years, your first crush, those sunny afternoons hanging out with friends, that hot suicidal boy your future self told you to hook up with\u2026 Wait, wut?\r\nIntroducing Orange, an anime that will challenge your patience with a super original game of Will they, won\u2019t they? and ultimately makes you wish that not only the angsty-but-kind-at-heart Kakeru, but all the rest of the cast dies in the end.\r\nStory\r\nI have to admit, I really enjoyed the first two episodes of the show. We\u2019re introduced to a bunch of friends and their sweet dynamics, everything feels super sweet and lovely. The main character, Naho, receivesa letter from her future self giving instructions to prevent her from living a life of regrets, 10 years in the future. Ok, everything makes sense \u2019til now, it\u2019s actually a super beautiful concept. BUT\u2026 Where the first episode leaves you with \u201cKakeru might not be there in 10 years\u201d, the second episode ends with \u201cKakeru killed himself\u201d. And this is where things start to go down. First of all, you\u2019re living a full beautiful life 10 years in the future, you\u2019re married to your best friend from high school (seriously, isn\u2019t that awesome?), yet you reunite all your friends (including your husband and father of your son) and decide to write a letter to your former self, giving her instructions to basically prevent someone\u2019s death and end up with him. Seriously, this is so wrong on so many different levels. You\u2019ve known the guy for like two days, yet you hate yourself so much that you want to tell your former self to spend the rest of her life with a suicidal boy who might end up becoming incredibly harmful to all the people around him. Right, it\u2019s a shojo. Damn, I keep forgetting the shojo rules. And apparently your husband is on board, so who cares? Not only that, but the pacing of each subsequent episode becomes a slow and painful ride that leads us right to the most absurd and stupid ending I\u2019ve seen in years (and I\u2019ve watched How I met your mother, mind you). So, the story is a big no-no for me. Good idea, terrible execution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI can\u2019t expect a beautiful mindfuck a la Steins;Gate from a shojo, so, even if the plot feels more simplistic, at least it should rely on solid characters. Nope. Not the case. \\n\\n\r\nIntroducing:\\n\r\nAmoeba - our main character. She\u2019s really hot. Like, really really hot. I think it\u2019s the only single reason why people would want to be her friends. I also suspect she might be somehow \u201cspecial\u201d, I seriously can\u2019t understand how a girl can be so dumb.\\n\r\nKakeru aka \u201cAwkward looks in the camera\u201d - the (suicidal) love interest. A character so unlikeable that you\u2019ll wonder why every girl seems to start ovulating around him. He doesn\u2019t have a solid background, he just acts super randomly cause \u201cdepression\u201d. I mean, when I was in school I\u2019ve always wanted that friend I had to be careful what I said when he was around in order to prevent him from jumping in front of a truck (whoops, spoiler!).\\n\r\nSuwa \u201cGingers-have-souls\u201d - the only decent human being in the show. Maybe too decent. Grow a pair Suwa, seriously, you just don\u2019t give up on your love cause you made a new soccer buddy. \\n\r\nUgly nerd with glasses/Hot boy without glasses - someone that had to be there to make sure there were enough characters.\\n\r\nThe evil twins from The Shining - annoying girl friends who show up just to make uncomfortable comments about Amoeba holding hands (whoa, you can get pregnant with that!) with Kakeru.\\n\r\nRegina George - Kakeru\u2019s love interest for a bunch of episodes. She\u2019s there mainly to pick up on Amoeba. If this anime was told from her point of view, I\u2019m sure it would be way better.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nNot bad, the character design is nothing special but it works good. I really like the blushing effect on everyone\u2019s cheeks (3/4 of the show). The backgrounds are quite ok. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nI think that the OP is one of the worst I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Seriously, it\u2019s so bad it made me skip the opening pretty much everytime. ED was nothing special but better. Voices were a lot of \u201cawww\u201d and stuff like that. Kakeru\u2019s soothing depressed voice made me want to hang myself to the ceiling. The OST throughout the show was nothing too impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe premise of the show was really good, the cast, at first, looked really fun and nice but turned out to be incredibly flat and boring soon after. I seriously have a problem with the story itself, you can\u2019t save someone from depression/attempting suicide by telling him \u201cHey, you look hawt, wanna hook up?\u201d. No, that\u2019s just stupid, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t accept it. Not to mention that this kind of anime really portrays women like helpless puppies looking for directions and willing to do whatever their alpha male says. No, this is just stupid and offensive to women imo. Sorry Orange, you suck.\\n",

            "content": "\"Life comes in twists and turns\" - a line from Orange\r\nLA couldn't said it any better...\r\nOrange was one of the more prominent and known drama anime to come out of Summer 2016 and for the most part, the popularity of this show is justified, however there were something that irked LA by the halfway point to it, as most media do, they have subjective and objective flaws no matter what.\r\nOrange is another one of the anime with the trend of \"time travel\" used, but for the majority of Orange, the \"time travel\" is a small element and \"speculation\" to the plot that a major focusto it, Orange focuses on regret, drama and youth rather than the \"power to change the future\" scthick with the time travel element.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters and their development, the main cast do get their developments due to the main cast being in a group and there are some romantic tensions here and there from Kakeru Naruse voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita and Naho Takamiya voiced by Kana Hanazawa which is one of the main crux of the anime. Their romantic development is sweet at best, frustrating at worst but it being the main couple of this anime, it's obvious that the focus goes to those two the most. Due to the rest of the main cast in the group, Hiroto Suwa voiced by Makoto Furukawa, Saku Hagita voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu and Azusa Murasaka voiced by Natsumi Takamori were at least developed alongside the main couple. The least developed character in the main cast would have been Takako Chino voiced by Rika Kinugawa. In terms of individual development, Kakeru gets the most focus as the plot is mainly about him, Naho and Suwa also gets developed in different ways but mainly coincide with Kakeru's dilemma. Naho gets further developed with Kakeru romantically though it get rocky with some annoyances LA saw on LA's part...on speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nRomantically there really is only three you can root for, Naho and Kakeru, Naho and Suwa and the beta coupling of Hagita and Azusa. There is just one problem with the main couple's relationship and yes at the start it's because Naho is shy about telling her true feelings to Kakeru but the letters help her push this relationship as well as the main reason the letter's function to the story as a whole furthers this relationship and opens both Naho and Kakeru, so what's the problem.....no matter what happens Kakeru ALWAYS PUSHES Naho away because of his \"destiny\" sure we realize WHY he does it and the final episode redeemed Kakeru for LA, but he just snaps at any moment pushing Naho further away before all this and it got to the point LA was rooting for the beta couple or hell Naho and Suwa than this main coupling. it was aggravating to say the least and bleed into the story as melodrama and \"can't fight fate\".\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of this anime, using the \"time travel letter\" but in the drama genre, the time travel gimmick is nothing more than element and plot device in the drama genre and even the time travel letter gets a small plot hole LA found. (What was it?...well considering the letters are written a day of paper, does the time travel letter have an entire booksworth of information???...but yeah, small minor plot hole). Nonetheless the further the anime goes the less it focuses on the time travel letter, which brings in the entirety of \"fate\" and \"changing the future\". On speaking of \"plot holes\"...next is LA's flaws on Orange...\\n\\n\r\nLA's own problems with this anime comes rather easy, romance-wise LA already told LA's grievances and annoyance with that. Come the halfway point (or to be more precise, the School Sports Festival) was that the sentiments and message of \"friendship\" was by far heavy-handed and all the more in your face and if a message is in your face throughout roughly 40 minutes is became disgruntly annoying, LA got the sentiments as to what it was trying to do, but trying too hard just became annoying. The other obvious problem is that with Kakeru's dilemma as well as the simultaneous Naho trying to get together goes into typical melodrama, mainly on Kakeru's part and that's where the majority of LA's annoyances comes from. Where Orange felt like it jumped the shark was the entire \"method\" of how the letter was even transported back to the past, sure their future selves were in a rut and just thought up some ideas and sure Orange has a bit of supernatural element with the concept of letters being transported back into the past but really finding out how they \"did it\" is one of the most baffling moments in Orange PERIOD.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well even though this is a romance drama anime, LA felt like most of the voice actors were on auto-pilot, sure they were pretty great for the first half of the anime, but it felt like they started to not care (besides the more dramatic moments anyways). If there was a voice actor LA liked in Orange, it would have to go to Natsumi Takamori as the genki Azusa Murasaka as well as Kana Hanazawa as Naho in second.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Telecom Animation Film, the animation was consistent throughout and the visuals on how the camera were used were used to great effect, such as sudden transitions on weird differing angles, made a rather mundane occurrence, intense at times, huge praise goes to it's backgrounding artwork as it was utterly gorgeous at the best of times (mainly outside the school). The character designs at best are typical at best and has rare times when it bring sup slightly lower quality facial features, nonetheless. The animation quality was overall consistent and of high quality and seriously, the backgrounding needs that special mention and a huge highlight to Orange.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the final 2 episodes of Orange, it FINALLY changed perspective to Kakeru and like LA said in LA's romance section we get to see Kakeru's perspective and it was refreshing and very dramatic and really made us feel his \"sins\" he's cause onto himself which lead him down the road he went to that really started the plot of Orange and seeing this did open LA up to Kakeru as a character, romantically his involvement was annoying, as a character, it's one of the best developments as a character and a very depressing one at that. The \"one hour long finale\" of Orange however quite frankly utterly redeemed Orange from all the flaws Orange had compounded through the course of it's runtime by making the ending both give an intense dramatic climax and a great payoff (as well as redeeming Kakeru both in plot and as a character for LA). The ending honed into it's sole focus of Kakeru and the MAIN POINT of Orange and LA thinks that the \"one hour finale\" was utterly needed to make this happen and LA praise Orange for this ending. it did EVERYTHING right to make this ending satisfying and dramatic with the right tone, not much else to say but that.\\n\\n\r\nOrange has it's annoying character and plot flaws and LA nearly lost interest in Orange when they started focusing too much on the central theme and messages shoving it in our faces, the time travel element is a plot device than actually part of the plot and is more focused on it's dramatic and melodramatic events to crank up the character development or relationship problems and Orange even jumped the shark at one point which completely baffled LA. Orange as an anime is a great drama anime and LA acknowledges this, but LA also sees the flaws it has and LA just can't ignore it due to how prevalent they are especially in the later half however there has never been a time but to put this statement to work but \"the ending must be paramount\" and it succeeded in doing so utterly making LA accept the flaws of Orange and still see Orange as a GREAT anime.\\n\\n\r\nLA wouldn't might seeing Orange but with it's perspective on Suwa as that would be VERY interesting to see...*cough* *cough*.\\n\\n\r\nThe quote at the top of this review, \"Life comes in twists and turns\" might as well be applied to how LA felt about Orange as well!. Great job Orange, you REALLY pulled through by the end to deliver a GREAT anime...melodrama and all.",

            "content": "You know, I thought I was immune to being disappointed by anime at this point of my life, but apparently the medium still hasn't lost it when it comes to getting my hopes up, only to crash them back down with more impact than Icarus hitting the ocean after he flew too close to the sun. I mean obviously I'm not a fan of the manga having never read it, but Orange really looked promising based on the limited research I did. A shoujo romance that was only five volumes long and critical acclaims across the board with a premise that goes beyond the usualshoujo tropes found in...well...pick any shoujo anime or live-action drama that got made in the last few years? Sounds like my cup of tea, especially since it deals with suicide: an issue that is still very prevalent in Japan as well as the basis for several very good fictional works from the country.\\n\\n\r\nThe start was pretty good as well. Nothing amazing, but at least you understand where it's going by the time the premiere ends. Orange is a show about a young girl named Naho, who starts receiving mysterious letters from her future self regarding a new kid named Kakeru - and because there'd be no plot otherwise, said letters don't specify that if she and her friends invite him for a night out on the town, they'll inadvertently cause his mother to commit suicide. So his mom dies and the letters start to warn Naho that she'll fall in love with the dude whilst warning that he ends up committing suicide in the future, meaning that it's up to her and the Scooby-Doo gang that always seem to be in shoujo romances to save him. Throughout this journey, we occasionally cut to the future timeline where Naho and her friends reminisce about the dude and the regrets they had in regards to saving him, leading up to the moment when they discover the ability to send letters to the past. So here we've got a typical shoujo romance flavored by themes of regret, second-chances, and highschool problems that are more grounded in reality than most anime showcase, in addition to all the suicide stuff. And at the very start of the series too. Sounds great, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell it's not like Orange didn't have problems at the very start either. It is still a shoujo romance anime, so of course that means an insecure female lead and lot of annoying will they or won't they situations, not exactly helped by the fact that we see in the future that Naho married the other male friend, Suwa. And shortly through the show, you'd definitely be supporting that side, because like most male protagonists in this genre, Kakeru is more of a cipher than an actual character. Most of his story is told through the other characters' observations of him without any real input on his end, and while none of the characters really transcend their stereotypes either, we at least are able to understand where most of them come from and why they act the way they do. Which is kind of impressive in of itself given how the other half of the main six are completely unimportant to the plot to the point, even by the usual standards of ensemble romances. The only thing they ever do is encourage the main trio or prevent contrived problems from occurring when they decide they want to have a go at making things more lively, and even when a later plot twist gets them more involved, they still come off as supplementary as those three non-plot important girls in a visual novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show mostly gets through the cockblock padding by having a bit of self-awareness regarding how stupid it is whilst also highlighting some legitimate teenage issues in the process. Okay, it's no John Hughes film, but at least it raises some interesting points regarding how there's a difference between knowing what's going to happen and actually doing something about it, along with guilt when you discover that you're an accessory to someone else's problems. I was always a bit iffy on the whole love triangle thing that happened when Kakeru ended up dating a female senpai who is - and let's be reasonable about this - a massive cunt, though. Yeah, I don't like using that c-word, but there's really no better way to encompass how completely unlikable she is. While the idea that Kakeru just dated her for her looks was kinda cool, she never gives up on him even after they break up, always showing up out of nowhere to give Naho a hard time whilst having no personality traits or story importance beyond her cunty nature. I don't even think she's very pretty. If I was given the same hypnotism Jack Black got in Shallow Hal, I'm pretty sure I'd see her as a gray-haired hunchback with broken teeth and a trick foot.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, nothing is perfect, and I can get past some bullying if the overall story is good, even if it's a cliche I'm never going to accept in fiction. Unfortunately, as seems to be the running theme for 2016 anime in general, you should never believe a good anime will stay good until the very end. And dear god, did Orange stop being good really fast around the halfway point. TMS Entertainment had put out four shows that very season, so of course I knew that they were spreading themselves a little thin, but that did not initially come through with this show at the very start, because it had some pretty kickass visual direction to the point that you wondered how they were going to keep it up for an entire season. The short answer is they don't, and they seemed to have dragged down the storytelling quality along with it. There's a school festival arc in the second half of the show that only exists as buildup for the sake of buildup, making the characters have fun with each other so that the \"save Kakeru\" flag will get triggered. It's like how the first movie of that new Harry Potter spinoff series consisted of nothing but introducing the characters and the rules of the world whilst saving all the meaty stuff that's not guaranteed to deliver for the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone please explain to me the appeal of watching setup to a major plot direction when you don't have anything to support it but curiosity regarding the future and likable characters, because I don't see it. It's completely boring, and even if the curiosity is enough to carry you the first time, it's not going to be around on rewatch, leaving you with absolutely nothing. No amount of likability is going to help a character if they're not given anything interesting to do. Most people with a soul love the cast in animated Disney movies, but most people with a brain wouldn't call those direct-to-DVD sequels good. And the less said about Kingdom Hearts until I inevitably review one of the upcoming games, the better.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's really funny is that despite the artificial lengthening and worsening production values later on, the final episode ended up going double-length, which makes me wonder what the point of it all was. You could have easily cut out twenty two minutes of fluff, split the finale into two weekly chunks, and just run with that. I don't keep up with anime news so I couldn't say for sure, but it feels like there were some creative differences halfway through production and the anime we ended up getting was the result of a bunch of bitter compromises. You know, kind of like what Kare Kano went through when Anno was booted off the set, only not nearly as unique and definitely not something that would fly by today's standards. Oh, and you want to know how the show actually ends? Well I hate to spoil things, but I can't sum up my full opinion on the show without talking about it, so skip the next paragraph if you haven't finished the show yet.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru ends up realizing that his friends are too important to him to go through with killing himself, he and Naho are still in their \"will they or won't they\" phase, the future characters smile at the thought of a changed past that they'll never feel the results of, and all I could think was \"wow that was lame\". Why is friendship and love always the goddamn solution to these sorts of serious issues in anime-land? Yes it's important for depressed people to be surrounded by folks who care about them, but there's more to suicide prevention than that. When you have it on its own rather than just as a tool, it's basically nothing more than a psychology student who failed to get his degree trying to make it into the storytelling business. Most medical professionals would be clueless regarding how to deal with Kakeru, and Orange handles his situation with such a simplistically optimistic tone that not only is the solution bullshit, but we don't really get much of an insight into Kakeru's psychology either. All the shoujo cliches kept getting in the way, trying so hard to lighten up the substance that it ended up forgetting the substance even existed in the process. And everything the characters say or do is too obvious, so that when the substance is empty, their actions are even emptier. No, this show isn't exactly Welcome to the NHK or Aku no Hana, is it?\\n\\n\r\nOrange never really got to the point where I'd consider it an amazing show, but it still saddened me to finish it because of how close it came to transcending its genre at times, only to gets its kneecaps shot off ant a moment when it really couldn't afford to be put on life support. The animation went to shit, ruining key emotional moments to the point that the characters might as well have been wearing clown masks the entire time. The suicide themes devolved into generic go-nowhere shoujo cliches and fucking retarded \"as long as you have friends, you shouldn't throw away your life\" PSA bullshit. And the time travel stuff ended up being another pointless gimmick that exists for the plot to function a certain way without getting any real acknowledgement until the very end, and of course it's done in a saccharine way that I don't even want to elaborate on. Just trust me when I say that ERASED's usage of it wasn't as conveniently contrived and let's call it a day, shall we?",

            "content": "Orange strikes me as a typical over-dramatic romance Shoujo with a bit of spicy added to it. \r\nSTORY\r\nOrange starts off a bit different when comparing it to other Shoujos. One evening, our MC Naho gets a letter with information written to herself from her future self. The letter contains the exact events of the day, including the fact that there will be a new transfer student in her class. The Naho of the future gives the present Naho plenty of instructions on what to do, so that she will have no regrets. \r\nMy first problem begins with the time traveling aspect. If the future isever-changing, then eventually the letters will cease to be helpful. When that happens what will stop Naho from making different mistakes? While the time traveling mechanic was explained, it was done poorly with very obvious info dumping. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the letters, this show is your typical run of the mil Shoujo. The main character does a ton of silly mistakes in an attempt to hide her love for the edgy new student. Nothing new at all, but what really bothers me is that someone else already loves her. You can tell by the very first episode. Suwa (the other guy) seems to be very aware of Naho's feelings for the new transfer student. So in words he is willing to be the rebound guy for the main character, which is just really shitty in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nMy second main problem is how everything seems forced. Nothing in the show feels truly organic, rather everything feels like a poorly placed contrivance. Examples of questions I had about the plot:\\n\\n\r\n1. Why does Naho not ask her friends for help?\\n\r\n2. Why didn\u2019t the future gang just write a detailed letter together and then copy it over?\\n\r\n3. Why does Suwa pickup on Naho\u2019s emotions the fastest?\\n\r\n4. What ever happen to \u201cgirl-talk\u201d? Like seriously there\u2019s two other girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are many more as the story continues. I will not list anymore as they do spoil part of the series. It\u2019s like the story tries up the ante of its melodramatic aspects every episode. Outside of the plot conveniences, the story is way too slow. Every episode contains too much empty space, which leads to an overly boring tone. I honestly wished more things would happen, but most episodes contain nothing but Naho monologuing to herself.  \\n\\n\r\nDIALOGUE \\n\\n\r\nNow you would think that for a dialogue heavy show, that this would be its selling point. This is not the case. Most of the dialogue feels awkward or forced. The awkwardness typically stems from the joke. Most of the jokes don\u2019t seem that funny, yet the cast still laughs at the jokes. Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing, but my guess is that the writer doesn\u2019t understand the younger crowd much. The rest of dialogue is driven by melodrama. Other than that there is not much dialogue. Majority of the series is spent on Naho\u2019s monologues. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe pain in my foot will go away eventually. But the regret won't.\u201d- Takamiya Naho\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are very typical and 1 dimensional. Suwa seems to be the only fleshed out and organic feeling character of the series. The rest are bland one hit wonders. At first they seem likable, but eventually they begin to become annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa: Suwa, a natural born leader, acts as the ringleader of their little group. He is very tall, outgoing, handsome and good at sports. He puts others before himself and doesn't seem selfish or petty whatsoever. Overall he\u2019s a great guy, so I\u2019m not sure why Naho doesn't like him. He clearly likes Naho from the very first episode, but also knows her feelings for Naruse. Most of his development happens slowly throughout the series. He makes for an awesome character, but unfortunately he is placed within a bad series. \\n\\n\r\nNaruse: Naruse is just the edgy new boy that the main girl falls for. The writers seem bend on creating a scenario, where we feel obligated to pity him. His relationship with his mother seems completely contrived for plot convenience, and he acts completely depressed the entire time. Depression creates a very atmosphere when done correctly; however, the subtlety of depression is lost in this series. \\n\\n\r\nNaho: She is the main character of the series. She\u2019s your typical Mary-sue with nothing that sets her apart from the dozens of other main character within the Shoujo genre. She is painfully stupid to any situation at hand. You can easily count her talents on one hand, and overall she feels bland and unimportant (despite being the MC of the series).\\n\\n\r\nHagita: The nerdy friend who\u2019s kinda funny. In all honestly it is easy to forget he exist within the series sometimes. He lightens the mood usually, but overall he gains no character development. \\n\\n\r\nTaka: The tomboy of the group. She's honestly just a tomboy. \\n\\n\r\nAzu: The short girl of group. She brings them bread, and laughs a lot when nothing is funny. She seems to have a crush on Hagita. \\n\\n\r\nAUDIO & VISUAL\\n\\n\r\nThe animation overall is decent. There are a lot of random cut angles and horrible freeze frames. The director sticks to the typical shojo directing style (lots of randomly panning and jump scenes). The character designs seem uninspiring, but overall the animation is the best part of this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is bland and very forgettable. The opening seems very fitting; however, the ending track carry over a melancholy feeling. Outside of the opening, the OST does not make much an impact either.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nRegret is a powerful thing, but only when used correctly. If characters fail to move pass their arctypes, then it renders the theme of regret useless. Even when we approach the end, it feels like the series accomplishes nothing. It fails to show the future that many wanted and leaves the audience with a blank and questionable ending. Overall you would be better off watching something like Ano Hana or My Little Monster. Both of those series handle their story, characters and plot much better. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL GRADE\\n\r\nD\\n",

            "content": "What if one day you recieved information about a certain tragic event that will take place in the future, you know it's gonna happen..how are you gonna change it? what if something you do only makes it worse? what if changing it affects someone else? there is no way to know for sure, you never what could happen unless you act...maybe that's why the show is called \"Orange\" (?) you know it has a taste but it is unpredictable, it could sweet,sour..you never know unless you take a bite. I don't know, I could very well be wrong here.\r\nThis is story of \"Orange\", One morningNaho recieves a letter from her future self warning her about her own regrets and requesting her to fix those regrets and save Kakeru. So can Naho save Kakeru? It's all there in the letter, right? shouldn't it be easy? No, saving this guy is a more complex and monumental task than it sounds.\\n\r\nThere are many things I really appreciate about this show. It's boldness to use Time elements and keeping the science fiction to a minimum and just concentrate on lighthearted storytelling. The story is simple and built on very good character development. Each episode focuses on Naho trying to erase or avoid regrets, which is very interesting to watch. It's starts off really well and first 6 episodes are really really good, after that it somewhat didn't feel right, the quality in animation started to drop and dialouge was a little cringy. But that was only for a couple of episodes, it just felt like *what is so great about this show?* and then it slowly became better and the greatness kicks in, in the second last episode and the 40 minute finale was nothing short of absolute brilliance. A masterpiece in writing,dialouge and development. The Animation in this episode is sublime as well, maybe the okayish animation in the middle was just the studio saving up for this one. The story revolves around a small group of characters who are unique and relatable and they're fun to watch. \\n\r\nBut what i really appreciate about this show is *may contain very minor spoilers* how they display the trauma of a person who has suicidal thoughts, They create an atmosphere and show you what it feels like to be that person, putting us in those final moments and showings us their final thoughts before dying, those scenes are just beyond terrifying and give you the chills. I can't describe how well done that is, Hats off to the writer for that!\\n\r\nIt does have some minor flaws, like i mentioned earlier the animation screwed up a little, some scenes are overly melodramatic and cringy. the biggest problem i have is how they send the letters, *may contain very minor spoilers* five regular people sending letters through a Black hole is hard to buy, they just gave us that infodump than anything in detail. maybe they'll cover that in the upcoming movie but I can judge only based on what they've given us.\\n\r\nwith that being said, i would give my final rating to show with an Overall score of \\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nwhich makes \"Orange\" my anime of the season: Summer (2016)\\n\r\n\"Orange\" is an amazing show that overcomes it's flaws with it's brilliant writing and development, Definitely a show to check out, especially for those who are a fan of slice of life and romance.",

            "content": "Often times, the shoujo genre focuses a lot on the romance, relationships, and drama. Orange doesn\u2019t exactly stray from that either considering romance is part of the show. However, the series adds a bit more of a twist in the form of time travel. You heard right. Time travel. It\u2019s a plot element used in the series to forge the overall story as we see how events of the past really can affect events in the future.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, this series seemed overdue given the context and something that can easily fit within the anime medium. It has already receiveda drama adaptation so an anime was expected. As a manga reader, I am thankful that the adaptation is mostly faithful. There\u2019s honestly not many chapters anyway so a 1-cour length show (13 episodes) fits well. But does Orange really live up to expectations? That\u2019s the bigger question.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is exactly how it plays out. From the beginning, it\u2019s obvious that Naho has a crush on Kakeru and she shows it early on with many hints. However, what really happens will make the audience realize how there\u2019s future events that takes place with the main cast. Futuristic segments are shown from the first episode of characters in their adult ages. Furthermore, it\u2019s implied that a tragic event happens in the future that affects the lives of the characters in the present timeline forever. After all, everyone has regrets or wish they can take back a decision they once made before. This actually gives the characters a more miserable hope for the future. As they know that Kakeru suffered a tragedy, they feel sorrow will strike in their lives as well. Meanwhile, the show does a fairly well job at getting the story flowing from the start. Indeed, Orange uses time travel gimmicks as a way of storytelling. Naho receives a letter from her future self and in it, it predicts everything she experiences on that particular day. The latter not only contain details about the future but also the fate of Kakeru, something that will tragically end his life. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the story itself feels like a time travel plot similar to Steins;Gate or Erased. However, that\u2019s also not entirely on point as Orange has its own principles that strays far from just a sci-fi series. At its core, the show is a drama tale. It chronicles the lives of characters with the most prominent ones being Naho and Kakeru. Of course, they have friends as well and it\u2019s easy to recognize their meaningful values. What makes Orange really special is perhaps the many themes found in the show. There\u2019s social alienation, regret, doubt, friendship, love, fate, and trust, just to name a few. In addition, the series takes daily social problems to bring the realism out at its best. Remember that time when you had a crush on someone but just couldn\u2019t find the right time to confess? Or being in a love triangle but wishes for the best for your friend rather than yourself? That\u2019s the type of realism that I think we can all relate. Similarly, Orange takes love triangles to explore relationships between certain characters. The most prominent in the series is between Naho, Kakeru, and Suwa. There is obvious attraction between Naho and Kakeru although Suwa also harbors hidden feelings for Naho, something that she hardly recognizes. However, because of circumstances, Naho often is hesitant to act on her own feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThe title of the show is Orange, which is actually the flavor of the first juice that Kakeru bought for Naho. In a way, it\u2019s symbolic for her own love for him as she describes her crush as being \u201cbittersweet\u201d. From my perspective, the love relationship between Kakeru and Naho does have a bittersweet feel to it. The letters brings doubt for Naho as she fears about Kakeru\u2019s fate. Not only that, but her friends also share that fear, the fear that they may not be able to save Kakeru. The show often teases around with how the characters attempt to fight against fate with the knowledge from the letters. However, time paradox has its role as well as they learn how difficult it is to change the future. Not being able to save someone\u2019s life may be considered one\u2019s greatest regret after all. Do note that the show explores sensitive topics such as suicide as well and in later episodes, we learn how dark the plot can be from a realistic point of view.\\n\\n\r\nAs the manga is concluded, the anime itself adapts the majority of the anime and in essence, it satisfies a complete adaptation. This will give a sigh of relief for both anime original viewer and manga readers. In addition, character personalities are mostly on par what expectations. Naho, Kakeru, Hagita, Azusa, Takako, and Suwa all represent what high school teenagers are like of their age. They have social lives and strives to build relationships with others to make them happy including themselves. However, I would say that Orange\u2019s romance dynamics aren\u2019t exactly worth praising. For instance, there\u2019s the stereotypical girl outside of the main circle that gets into the main female protagonist\u2019s way. I\u2019m talking about the type that acts like a bully towards their love rival to make them feel as miserable as possible. Being the kind person that she is, Naho often struggles to stand up for herself so others have to step in. And my goodness, some of those moments are difficult to watch. In addition, the slow pacing of the story with its romance development feels scarce and will really test the patience of the viewers. Finally, the romance teasing between other characters such as Hagita and Azusa almost feels like comic relief, especially compared to Naho and Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Orange shines in storytelling and characters, its animation isn\u2019t always delivering its expectations. It\u2019s adapted by a studio cooperation between Telecom Animation Film and TMS Entertainment. While early episodes didn\u2019t have much problem with its quality, some of the latter episodes seems to lack budget especially with the still frames and awkward character faces. I do have to admit though, Orange\u2019s animation style has a matching way with its realism. The slow moving pacing fits well in conjunction with body movements and in particular, it expresses character reactions quite realistically from many angles.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show like Orange, the soundtrack is also very important because many segments can be quite emotional. In this case, the lighthearted OST works well to give the show its atmospheric feel. The OP and ED theme songs are harmonious with bittersweet rhythms. Still, the real praise should be given to the voice actors and actresses. Kana Hanazawa deserves some particular praise with her role as Naho. After all, she is an emotional girl and it\u2019s not always easy to step into the shoes of such a character. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished Orange, I breathed in and out. It\u2019s a sigh of \u201cdamn, it\u2019s over now?\u201d Of course, being an 1-cour adaptation that doesn\u2019t need to be any shorter or longer. Any more of that would honestly hold back or overextend the show. That being said, Orange explores many social problems that we can find realiable in our lives. The high school days are an era that most of us have experienced and it\u2019s something valuable to treasure. For Naho and her friends, it\u2019s an era where they make the most of it for themselves and trying to do a good deed. While most shows seems to rely on clich\u00e9 time travel gimmicks to attract an audience, Orange goes beyond that combines its themes with the story. That story is like a treasure and I\u2019m glad it was an experience that is more than bittersweet.\\n",

            "content": "Suicide and other mental conditions like it are a difficult subject to comprehend when you aren't the person who is having the thought or desire to kill yourself thinking that the world would be better off if your existence was wiped from it.  It's something that many people face and it becomes a difficult barrier to overcome when one doesn't have someone there to try and help.  So, we have Orange, a...confusing series that despite having such themes and a plotline revolving around it, doesn't actually do it very well.\r\nStory: Takamiya Naho one day finds a strange letter addressed to her in herdesk that details a set of events involving a new student at her school named Naruse Kakeru.  Initially thinking that the letter is more or less full of sh*t, she finds out that the events in the letter apparently written from her 10 years into the future are starting to come true, finding out that if the events in the letter come to fruition, Kakeru will die.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, as you can guess, the entire story of Orange revolves around the main cast of the series attempting to help Kakeru with his problems and stop him from his probably stoppable demise.  On paper, the series has a pretty solid plotline, but...that's not really the case.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first and probably most glaring problem that I find is the fact that the series relies far too heavily on the 'letter' concept.  The show did nothing wrong with trying to make a future/past story to try to avoid a calamity, as many time-travel related stories do, but the characters and the story relate and go back to the letters and what's in the letters so many times that none, and I mean none of the characters that want to save this poor boy actually have any proper character traits aside from maybe a few base ones.  None of the characters really feel like they're actually attempting to solve the problem themselves and grow as characters, but instead rely on a tutorial letter cheat sheet in order to move the plot along.  They're just following what the letters say, and the show mentions that a lot too with the characters' dialogue, resulting in faux character development and a story that feels less than genuine.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem that I see is the fact that the story never seems to decide what it wants to be.  It's like a...rom-com/emotional rollercoaster/time traveling paradox story that really doesn't work out too well.  The romance is kind of irritating, especially with the characters in play, and the time-traveling part was probably the most unneeded part of the series.  Orange goes out of its way to actually try and explain how the letters got to their past selves and it's just...no.  Of course that would've left a plot hole if they didn't try and explain it, but I feel like that's better than dragging in the Bermuda Triangle or Parallel World Theory into this story.  (Yes, they actually do reference those things.)\\n\\n\r\nThe only worthwhile thing that I would say that this series has is regarding the emotional rollercoaster part, which only comes in the second to last episode of the series.  Throughout the show, you don't get much about Kakeru and his regrets up until that point, at which point you get hit full force in some actually informative and well-written story and character.  It's a shame we didn't get more story of that quality because that was probably the only redeemable part of the show in terms of story.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Orange is rotting tree with only one good fruit hanging down from the top of the tree.  Its good qualities is overshadowed by the show's false-feeling nature with how the characters are just doing whatever the letters tell them to without any of their own thought input and the fact that the show tried to do a lot of other things than focus on Kakeru and the problems that he has.  Also, the romantic subplots.  Goddamn the romantic subplots were annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Touches and has good content on the touchy subject of suicide\\n\r\n-  Characters don't have any real development to them\\n\r\n-  Too many unnecessary subplots\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As a result of the letters, the characters of Orange don't really feel all that well-made.  Of course there is some growth to a good chunk of the characters, but the problem also arises from the fact that they didn't grow because they wanted to, they pretty much grew because the plot demanded it.\\n\\n\r\nTakamiya Naho is our main protagonist and by god is she a piece of work.  Naho plays off the shy and timid girl from your typical shoujo series.  Normally meek and softspoken, the gentle Naho is a creature that the series never seems to know what to do with.  On one hand, Naho has this letter that tells her that her new friend/crush is going to die, so she tries to go up and talk to him in order to try and save him from his fate.  Then on the other hand, in a scene that's probably in the exact same episode, Naho pulls back and retreats back to her shell without any rhyme or reason as to why.  This gap in logic and writing makes Naho probably the most annoying character in the series simply because she only seems to do something worthwhile when the series demands it.  She never truly comes out of her shell and whenever she does, it's always because of the damn letter or when the other characters are around.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Naruse Kakeru, the whole reason why this series pretty much exists.  As the new kid in the school, Kakeru is a mysterious and gentle character that hides a lot to himself.  Admittedly, I can't really fault Kakeru too much as a character because his actions that of the behavior of someone going through such stages.  He feels regret, guilt, and most of all, is reluctant to tell people of his problems, which is sprinkled pretty well in the series up to the last few episodes where they go whole hog as expected of the climax.  His push/pull dynamic with his character however does get irritating at times, but it doesn't really come as often as Naho does, yet it still is pretty annoying.  My biggest complaint with Kakeru however comes with the fact that the series never fully explains the events that led up to what has made him such a broken and suicidal individual.  You get a taste of what, but it just doesn't feel like enough since we never get a full-on backstory of his memories or anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast are admittedly...not really all that important save for Suwa.  Suwa's role in the series is to act as the 'wingman' character who secretly likes the main girl but will never confess cause he's a nice guy, hence why he's nicknamed as the series's \"Best Bro\" character.  Aside from Suwa, however, the other three members of the main cast, Azu, Hagita, and Takako really don't have much of a purpose.  They're mostly there to fill up space and make it seem like this cast is a lot bigger than it actually is since they're never focused on in the series and most of the heavy lifting or lifting at all for Kakeru is done by either Suwa or Naho which negates any and all worth that the rest of the cast has.  The only noticeable side character is this b*tch senpai who becomes irrelevant post-episode 5 who's only there to create romantic tension/drama that really wasn't even there in the first place.  (Also, how dare you make me think of her every time I go back and see anything relating to Merry Nightmare or Tomori Nao.  Never gonna unhear that now.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Kakeru being more or less true to that kind of character\\n\r\n-  Character development never feels genuine and only plot-related\\n\r\n-  Pretty much every character except Naho and Suwa are redundant\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Telecom Animation Film, Orange...admittedly, given how virtually unknown the company is, is just...well to put it bluntly, it's downright ugly.  First off, the animation of the whole series has these nightmarish and unnatural character designs, especially in the faces, that make them look more like demons than people.  The eyes are unnaturally detailed and have this scary white dot in the middle of them that makes them look demented, and the lip motions, smiles, and overall look of the characters' mouths just don't look right.  The female characters are even worse offenders of this because they have much rounder eye designs, which let you see into their ghoulish eyes even more.  (Also, close-ups do NOT make this series look any better.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothers me is how muted the colors are.  None of the colors used look remotely half-decent and everything has this gray/brown muted shade to them that makes even the happy colors of yellow and orange look dull and boring.  Even better, that's not even the worse thing about the art in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing I have to say is the series's consistency.  The art on very common occasions look lazy with no quality check, and off to the point it feels like a character's eyes were drawn by two separate people trying to draw them at the same time next to each other.  This is sprinkled in every now and then especially during zoom outs of the whole cast where eyes are basically uneven lines at that point, but the place that this happens is during the athletic meet episode where the quality tanked so hard that almost every frame of the episode had issues.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Unnatural-looking art\\n\r\n-  Quality control failures\\n\r\n-  Terrible color palette\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Orange is...average, I'd say.  The OP \"Hikari no Hahen\" is pretty nice and has heavy use of the guitar to that both sounds cheerful and melancholic which is a good listen even if the actual song itself isn't really all that memorable.  The ED on the other hand is a song that's in a similar style, but it kinda...drolls on to the point that it doesn't even seem worth to listen to.  Bad songs?  No.  Memorable songs?  Not really.\\n\\n\r\nOn the note of sound though, the voice acting I have to say is...subpar.  There's nothing of significance that can be said about the voice acting so...yeah, moving on.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent tracks?\\n\r\n-  Nothing memorable\\n\r\n-  Voice acting is average\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Ok, I had high hopes for this series.  Admittedly, I was on board with the Orange hype train thinking that this show was going to give us a great story and be a decent watch that I would recommend to people.  But boy was I wrong.  Ironically, it was the letters, the whole instigator for this series, that was the main culprit to why I think it failed.  Because of the letters, none of the characters got any growth to themselves because they always went \"Oh, we can refer back to the letters no problem and the letters have all of the answers we need\" rather than try and actively change the future without using some writing on paper-ex-machina to drive the story for them.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nNot...not really.  The problems that arose from this series really put a hamper on my enjoyment, and because the characters constantly kept talking about the letters rather than solve the damn situation by themselves, none of their actions seemed like they would progress them as a character and ultimately detached me as a viewer since nothing they did gave me that feeling to care for them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nThe simple answer would be...probably everything.  Yeah, I'll go with that.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, no.  Orange's plotline had merit to it but ultimately decided to turn the other way and do other things that hurt the series as a whole.  It didn't seem like anyone actually gave a damn about Kakeru's story because everyone was basically just following a set of instructions to save this one man and I couldn't bring myself to like such shoddy characters with even shoddier character motivations.  In my opinion, Orange has far too many problems that led to little care for its characters and plotline, focusing solely on Deus-ex-machinas in the form of future letters with a paper thin explanation, ultimately leading to a series that squandered its possible potential.",

            "content": "In a world where tragedy happens, do you think you could change it?\r\nThe final episode was just released so I wanted to write a review while it was still fresh in my mind. I should also note that this is my first review.\r\nLets get right into the story. Orange, in my opinion, is much more than a typical romance, high school drama. It tackles the touchy subject of death, and how it can effect even the smallest thing. From the beginning you learn that something tragic happens in the future, so with this in mind you are rooting for the MC (Naho) the entire time,wanting her to succeed in fulfilling her future self's wishes via a letter. Now, I know that can sound confusing but this is all mentioned in the first episode, and this anime is not hard to fallow. In all i give the story an (8).\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the characters.  I give this a ranking of an (8) because some characters where more developed than others. For example you truly only care about 3 of the 6 MC's because the other 3 seem to just be there for support. honestly I don't even remember the black haired girls name -_-. But, I did enjoy an anime for once where the characters didn't over react over every little thing, they just seemed like normal teenagers. (Also, I thought hagita's personality was hilarious.)\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was pretty, nice and bright colors that fit the mood. Also, something good this anime had going for it was the characters faces. They defined their lips, which is rare in most anime, which helped in the characters expressions. It kinda reminded me of the art in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. (9)\\n\\n\r\nSound was good, nothing more to say (9)\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion I gave this anime an (8) simply because I enjoyed it. I recommend that you watch this if you like crying, laughing, or even getting a little mad all in one episode. And I will say that I was satisfied with the ending, and was left smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"It felt as if watching Usain Bolt running a marathon\"\r\nThe anime which had the potential to be a masterpiece of a shoujo anime in a short run, but instead tried to become too dragged out and everything just fell apart. Much like how Usain Bolt would start to slow down and stumble during such a long run.\r\n|contains minor spoilers which are indicated beforehand|\r\n|Story|\r\nOrange could have been such a great story. It uses great story-telling mechanics to build up the story and give the characters the opportunity to evolve and grow. But instead of building off of the foundation it set for itself, it just walksaway from it. \\n\\n\r\nRight from the beginning, we see how cleverly the creators of Orange slowly unveil the mysteries regarding the \"future\" and the letter. Initially, they have a great pace, and everything looks perfect for a good anime. We have a great mystery, with decent starting characters and a clear end-goal. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, after the initial setup, the anime just slows down ridiculously and tries to drag out everything and this just totally wrecks almost every aspect of this anime as they try to waste time. Let's look at those in a little bit more in detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance line just gets shattered, as they try to find at first irrational reasons and later on just straight up illogical reasons to drag out the way to the romance of Kakeru and Naho. The whole plot/story would only need one event to really happen to finally progress/finish, but they just keep on delaying it. In order to do so, they use multiple cliches, unneeded drama and conflicts which just become too plain and cringe after awhile. (SPOILER: Naho being unable to do literally anything on multiple occasions and being just so incredibly slow to help the plot develop)\\n\\n\r\nTo say something really positive, the anime uses very clever techniques to create opportunists. For example, the use of letter is brilliant. The way they use it really gives a chance to evolve the characters.(SPOILER: in the beginning it gives specific orders, after awhile it only says the goal and leaves the execution to Naho). It has great plot twists and has multiple huge reveals that can be shocking to the viewer as well as giving a chance to the side characters to shine (SPOILER: for example the reveal of multiple letters, and the very end twist). Not to mention a great use of time perspective shifting which really could have helped the anime in terms of expanding the depth of characters (which Orange didn't really utilize in the end...)\\n\\n\r\nIf only the story could have been condensed more, avoiding the unnecessary time wasting, then the story could have been intriguing, with a great story telling and amazing twists.\\n\r\nStory - 5 \\n\\n\r\n|Characters|\\n\r\nMost characters are quite one layered and basic stereotypes at the beginning, but that's absolutely fine for starters. The problem is, that most of them never really evolve into something more deep. The only good character was Suwa. Throughout his relationship with Naho, he really becomes someone else than what he started with, sharing great thoughts throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, main characters like Naho, were just handled terribly. This mostly comes down to the issue that the creators wanted to waste time. This totally wrecked Naho's character. To begin with, she was already one of the densest of the densest, not to mention that it would be an understatement that she is shy. The Plot techniques used set her up to really get a character development (SPOLER in the beginning she relies on the letter, but later on she tries to become herself and pave her own path instead of being a \"puppet\"), but because that would solve the main plot problem, they just find excuses and leave her (SPOLER: she then fails and goes back to the letter and remains a \"puppet\"). Not to mention that she literally cannot do anything on her own and always relied on her friends and that didn't change at all, not even once. The last straw was when she actually became worse than the initial character (SPOILER: When she tells Kakeru to stay with her and abandon his granny, which was literally her telling him that she doesn't care about his feelings. Way worse than what she said in the other world).\\n\r\nCharacter Score - 6\\n\\n\r\n|Art|\\n\r\nThe art style is quite different than most other animes. It's a lot more clearer and the lineart is more visible and sharp. It all comes down to preferences, but it was actually quite refreshing to see this type of art. The animation overall for fairly smooth and consistent.\\n\r\nArt Score - 8\\n\\n\r\n|Sound|\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good. It felt realistic, and i could feel the characters behind them. Each individual had their own speaking style which was a nice touch.\\n\r\nSound Score - 7\\n\\n\r\n|Overall Package|\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime really could have been great if it didn't sacrifice characters, cliches and good moments only to get to that 13 episode number. Although in it's current form it's not easy to recommend it, but if we discard those useless parts earlier described, then we get one of the best shoujo anime. If you like some good and tense drama that really gets you on the edge of your seat, then this is for you.\\n\r\nOverall Score - 6 (but could very easily be 9 if you put up with the frustrating parts)\\n\\n\r\n|Subjective review (rant)| (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nI was so frustrated with how they handled the romance, dramas and the main couple. Because i saw so many textbook usages of conflicts (in the beginning) and symbols (the letters or the hairpin). You will be able to read up in more details about the story-telling techniques in Orange. \\n\r\nSubjective Score - Want to give it a 9 but have to settle with a 5",

            "content": "Everyone has the desire to turn back time to do things that they should have done instead. The future self filled with regret vs. the present self filled with ignorance. What happens when the two collide? Enter the story of Orange, presented as a romance drama with a time-travel twist yet it finds a good balance between them.\r\nThe story starts out with Naho receiving a letter from herself 10 years in the future. It details about the incoming arrival of Kakeru in her life and how she must save him because he\u2019ll die in the future. What I like about this predicament is that Nahodoesn\u2019t always follow what the letter asks her to do all the time. It might be from suspension of disbelief or just awkwardness but it shows that she isn\u2019t just a plot device following orders. She shows doubt despite the fact that what is stated in the letter comes into reality which is a nice way of showing an internal struggle. There is the problem of the ever changing future and it\u2019s good that she doesn\u2019t entirely depend on the letters for her to save Kakeru. Overall there is a constant struggle between the present self who wants to do it on her own terms and the future self who wants to do it strictly in a sequence of events ensuring that there will be a change of outcome. Other characters in the story include Suwa, Hagita, Takako, and Azu. While some of them could really use some character development and more significance story-wise, they have stand out personalities that adds life to the show. They even somewhat contribute to the story later on as the story also deals with friendship and their unified feelings toward Kakeru. \\n\\n\r\nNow, Kakeru seems to be too reserved for a character to have a story revolve around him. He acts like everything\u2019s okay but he hides a lot of suppressed thoughts. I do like the idea since it\u2019s a good way for the characters to unveil him but every time someone like Naho attempts it, he just pushes the person back. He eventually opens up later on but the process can be frustrating. He\u2019s like a walking fragile plot device that one mistake done on him can ultimately lead to his inevitable death. Monologues are dedicated to him but they always seem to be not too revealing despite being full of resentment. With every revelation, it\u2019s like there is more to it and the bigger picture is really sought after. I know the story doesn\u2019t want to give it all away immediately but it\u2019s like a dripping faucet gradually being opened.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we get to the time-travel aspect of the show. I know that some are turned off with the explanation how they managed to send letters to the past but I personally don\u2019t give it too much attention. Sure it can make or break shows that explore time-manipulation but for a show that deals with second chances while still being conscious of the consequence of changing the future, I can look over it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Orange is a show recommended to viewers who can deeply connect with its theme of regret. The romance and drama revolving around it can be inconsistent at times due to its sporadic change of events but it all leads to a fulfilling conclusion. Hidden amidst a world of bright colors are bleak thoughts that await catharsis, it\u2019s a story about love and friendship.\\n",

            "content": "So for the past three months or so, I have been watching Orange every Sunday. At first, it was an enjoyable experience- bittersweet- like the plot intends for it to be. After Episode 5 or 6, however, things begin to take a weird turn. You see, I read the manga a few months before the anime started airing because I wanted to see the story unfold in its original creative form and enjoy the characters, plot, etc, just in case the anime adaptation ruined it. \r\nDid it? \r\nIn a way, yes.\r\n~~ Story (8/10): ~~\r\nAs far as the story goes, it stays the same as themanga. Five high schoolers: Naho Takamiya, Hiroto Suwa, Azusa Murasaka, Takako Chino and Saku Hagita receive letters from addressed to them and it turns out that they come from themselves ten years in the future. They are told to save their new friend Kakeru Naruse who is, in fact, no longer with them in ten years time. \\n\r\nThe anime followed the manga very closely and I saw hardly any original content which I can really appreciate when adaptations are made. If you like romance that's kind of similar to Ao Haru Ride then look no further, this one is for you. Orange also has supernatural elements to it, dealing with parallel universes and such. This kind of genre has been done to death so far in 2016, but it's a bit of a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Art (7/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of art and animation throughout all 13 episodes is quite consistent. In a few episodes, the detail can be quite poor due to the show's budget and whatnot, but apart from that, there's nothing too noticeable. The art is very nice to look at. \\n\r\nBUT. \\n\r\nHalf-way through the series, there are one or two episodes that serve as comedy relief in a way. In these two episodes, there are facial expressions drawn onto the characters that you DO NOT see in the manga. These faces are the kind of over-exaggerated faces you'd see in a comedy anime or something. Orange is not a comedy, although there are comedic moments here and there (mostly involving Suwa and Hagita), the facial expressions made in these episodes can be very offputting. That is the only warning I can possibly give you. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Sound (9/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is brilliant and there are some top-quality seiyuu's involved in this show. Kana Hanazawa voices Naho and does a brilliant job, Makoto Furukawa voices Suwa and consistently pulls off his masculine, upbeat voice and as for Kakeru, well, he sounded like your average male MC so I can't comment much. I'll cut his seiyuu some slack though as he hasn't been in the industry for very long. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroaki Tsutsumi, is beautiful. The sad tracks are a delight to listen to and all the other tracks are excellent too. He also worked on Ao Haru Ride, which is probably why I relate the two shows so much.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Characters (6/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing the anime adaptation does wrong, it's the character development. In one group, all six characters shine in one way or another. However, if you separate them and make them individuals then they have no interesting qualities whatsoever. Kakeru is the bland male MC who has depression, Naho is dense, even more, bland female MC who has a crush on Kakeru but won't ever say anything about it, Azusa is a happy-go-lucky gal who goes as a double act with Takako. Takako? She gets no attention whatsoever. Hagita is the low-key otaku nerd of the group who is often teased about something. The only character I can give praise for is Suwa because of his undying dedication to the instructions in the letters, his genuine friendship towards the others and his general, all-around likeableness. \\n\r\nBut yeah, this adaptation does a good job of making Naho even more romantically retarded than she is in the manga, and they take Kakeru's jerkiness a step too far. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Enjoyment (7/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nI had fun watching this show. At times, the build-up of tension and feels works to more effect than the manga did, but most of the time it didn't. If you really want to enjoy the story for what it is then I highly recommend you go and read the manga, penned by Takano Ichigo. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, and I'll probably forget most of it in a year's time. \\n\r\nI'll never forget Suwa though. \\n\r\n#suwabestgrill #neverforgetti \\n\\n\r\n~~ OVERALL (7/10) ~~",

It's not about Naho and Kakeru; it's about helping a friend with depression. And we all know how severe depression can be. Yes, Naho sometimes acts dense, insensitive, and stupid, but remember, she's just a highschool student, and you can't expect a highschooler to be the most rational person all the time. I think it's great that this anime showsus how one mistake and how our words can affect a person's whole life. Character development may not be outstanding, but then again, they're young people desperately saving a precious friend. It's good to see friends working together and not giving up to make someone happy. Don't you all feel touched after all that they did for Kakeru?",

            "content": "Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! Orange (the dub) for me was a powerhouse of emotions and led me to some very touching moments. I know I'm a sucker for the 'feels' as it is, and I know this review will not be as eloquent or as moving as say Zeph's there, but I do want to share my experiences with this anime and my time with it. The quick of it is, it doesn't really break any new ground, though it's a bit more original than some, it is still both forlorn and refreshing at the same time. I recommend for sure if youare like me and enjoy emotional-based anime. Will time travel bring the gang to the RTLR wall, or will the future remain set in stone? Let's weave this tale of time and see what we get!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nYes there are some cliche characters, and the overall feel is not unfamiliar to anyone with any experience with the slice of life genre, but yet we get a twist: the things the group of friends do have a HUGE impact on one particular member of the group. This impact is revealed and driven by a plot device that must be mentioned. The female lead of the show receives a letter from 10 years in her future telling her that the newest friend in the group has died, and the circumstances of his death. It begs her to change the things that the future self believes caused this tragedy to occur. Through the letter the girl makes changes, sometimes doesn't make changes, and tries as much as she can to prevent the tragedy in which she is warned about. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the story is wrapped in this angle, presenting slice of life familiarity only with the twist of her seeking a certain resolution to each event. The story flashes back and forth between the 'present' her and her attempts to save the main guy, and the group together ten years after his passing. These jumps can be confusing sometimes, but for the most part are well handled. There are also jumps to alternate timelines, but only a few, possibly only one if I remember right, where we see what happens to our main man if not for the friends that reach out to him. \\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the time travelling letters is never truly explained, and I don't feel like the story suffers much for it. For whatever reason they were able to communicate with their past selves and tried their best to remove the regrets they feel in regards to their actions, and lack thereof. The only issue becomes something of a science-y situation: you cannot change the past. They present the multiverse angle, where when the letters go back in time, they create an entire different parallel universe where the changes they enact have an effect. But the starting timeline, the one where the friends lose the main guy, and suffer from their regrets, is not changed. This avoids the 'grandfather paradox'. The multiverse view just means that another world gets a chance to save the boy, but their boy will never come back. In fact they will never know for sure if their letters even reach another timeline or have any effect on them. But they come to all care for the main guy to the point they are willing to try. \\n\\n\r\nThey gloss over the mechanics, mentioning black holes and the Bermuda Triangle, but there are some things that need not be explained. They get letters to their past selves, technically in a different timeline, in which their younger selves can act on. \\n\\n\r\nIts these changes, some small, and some not so small that lead to the bulk of the story. The gang tries so hard to change the main guy's life for the better, and for the most part they do it, he falls in love with the right girl, he wins the tournament like he wants to, yet at the very end, with the finishing line in sight, there's a HUGE stumble and nearly all their work is undone, leading me to a gasping horror moment as I watched, reducing me to tears. This kinds of movement in the story tug at my heartstrings and lead me to enjoy the series so much more than I might have if it was just a pure slice of life. The feelings, the emotions are there, and even when hope is on the horizon, darkness still lingers. An agonizing feeling, but a wonderful viewing experience nonetheless. I will try my best not to reveal if the darkness wins, but let's say this: the set that sent the letters back never get their regrets undone, and never get their guy back. \\n\\n\r\nIt is this emotional movement, and the fact that the group is somewhat aware of how they all turn out in the timeline where the main guy dies, drives the action. For example, in the 'dead' timeline two of the group marry and have kids. Yet in the potential timeline, the one they are trying to fix, she falls in love with the main guy. How is the guy knowing he was to be her husband someday take this? How hard must that be? It's this rollercoaster that really caught my heart and sent me soaring through the otherwise standard storyline. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe characters all look well enough, and the animation is fine, but there's a bit of 'sameness' to the appearance that I found distracting. They look like any number of other characters. The guys are especially bad about this. The main girl is either dead faced or blushing with little other expressions to be had. The dark headed girl looks almost evil and the last girl actually is pretty well drawn and interesting. But of six characters with only one standing out, it's a bit of a letdown. It's not bad, it's just 'been there, done that'. I didn't notice any animation problems, though I tend to be too wrapped in the story for such things, but everything looked acceptable to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI grew to love the intro theme, and the closer wasn't bad either, but neither were really tight enough to have me add to my collection of anime based music playlists. The background music was acceptable, as that's one thing that can be hard to mess up. Airy sounds for normal stuff, quiet tension in dramatic moments, ect. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were a mixed bag. The VA playing the primary girl is about as interesting as watching paint dry. She's just not convincing to me in her delivery. Even though I can see past that with the emotional story, I was annoyed by her stammering and less than enthusiastic delivery a lot of times. The VA playing the unique looking girl was pretty good, the guys were all acceptable, especially the 'nerdy' one. So knock one on the sound for Naho being irritating. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe main male, the one every one is trying to save, seems at times to understand what they are doing, and seems clueless at other times. His entire story comes down to one pivotal moment, and it's a biggie. I cannot imagine the pain they lay on his character, and the trials he faces. The themes of darkness and suicide play through him and really caused a resonance with me. Perhaps that's because I am bipolar and have been suicidal before myself (though I've never attempted the act). Its so easy to forget how much such a thing would affect all of those around you, how many lives would be destroyed, and the poor kid has to suffer through his loss. His final motivations are completely understandable and to me relate greatly to how a real life person would react. \\n\\n\r\nThe main girl, besides sounding terrible and looking a little rough, tries to save the main guy so hard, but sometimes ends up making everything worse. She's a sympathetic character in a manner. She doesn't understand the pain the main guy is going through, not truly, but still does what she can to help him make it through. She stumbles through emotions she doesn't understand, but with the intention of helping all she can so that in her timeline the main guy can be saved. Whether or not her flailing is successful is up to you to see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast basically exist to brainstorm ideas on how to save the main guy and how to set up situations that prevent the problems presented in the future letters. The guy that would become the main girl's husband does offer a little resentment, but quickly gets over it. Probably a lot more quickly than I would have. Not that I would wish a friend to death, but I might fight harder to find a way to save him yet get the girl I loved too. \\n\\n\r\nOf course in the original timeline, he does get the girl and has a kid with her, because as I said, they cannot change their own timeline because of the paradox situation. The only way time travel is achieved is to send the letters to an alternate universe, so in a way, both guys win. The hubby gets her heart in the original time, and the main guy they are saving wins her heart as they attempt to keep him from his fate. Otherwise our cast is somewhat thin, but acceptably so. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis show has so many moments that made me tear up and really feel moved that you guys knew I would rate this part highly. I am a feelings person, one of the perks (downfalls?) of suffering from an emotional disorder like bipolar. The entire suicide angle relating to one of the cast members had me bawling my eyes out, and understanding yet feeling so angry at the same time. It was a wonderfully moving experience for me, and so much more than the sum of its parts. A good story, where they focus on the little things, and leave the major questions such as how they sent the letters, etc, for the viewers imagination worked out very well. By focusing on the little things they need to do to try to save the main guy, and if their bid is successful or not, is all the story elements I needed. They do mess up, they do fail at moments, and they might not even save the guy in the end, but the point is they care enough to try. If someone found out I was going to die in a way that could be prevented beforehand, would they care enough to try to save me? Do I have friends like that? What a question to ask!\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Azusa and her cool earrings. She's the girl with the spunk and the fun, even though she seems almost destined to marry the nerdy guy. She's a great character!\\n\\n\r\nIf you like emotional dramas, things that might put a sniffle or two out there, I highly recommend Orange. Let the big questions handle themselves, and watch out for the last few episodes, as it might not down in the manner it seems to. Remember too, in the original timeline, he's dead, he stays dead, and they will never be beyond their regrets. Will history repeat itself? It has a tendency to do that. Or will love conquer all and save the poor kid from his own fate? I recommend you watch and find out. Only one new RTLR pic, that's of Azusa smiling. The other girls just didn't do it for me, not even the main girl. I guess now I'm going to have to start posting anime pics on the ceiling as wall space is quickly running out. All thumbs up!",

Really...\r\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious, the anime revolves around kakeru, about saving Kakeru and we barely know a thing about him right until the end. The only thing that made this watchable was the relationship the 5 friends have and the way they interact with each other and yet again, we know absolutely nothing about any ofthem.\\n\\n\r\nHalf the show is about Naho been shy and Naho fighting with herself and NAho reading the same thing on the letter, I\u2019m truly bored of this kind of Characters completely done with them, the only Character like this I was able to stand was Sawako on Kimi ni todoke, she was funny, her reactions were amazing, anyways\u2026the rest is just more of the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make it worst, the theory to make the letter time travel!

            "content": "[Spoiler Warning]\r\nIt\u2019s a well known fact that shoujo anime have never been the most original pieces of work. They follow a very basic and straightforward structure, and more often than not end up feeling way too dramatized and overly-melodramatic for no apparent reason. Once you've seen one you've seen them all, right? Some people would beg to differ, and as to disprove my claim the adaptation of Orange reared its ugly head out of the deepest depths of shoujo hell itself to quickly rise to the top of this season's charts, smirking all the while it does it. Watch as the magnificent story of Orangeunfolds, giving us deep insight into taboo topics like depression and suicide, viewed in distasteful shoujo fashion. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of Orange revolves around Naho, a carefree girl in her second year of highschool. One day, she stumbles upon a magical letter that is able to foresee her near future. The letter was sent from Naho to Naho 10 years in the past in hopes of her younger self being able to correct the mistakes she once made in highschool. How did the letter get there? Err.. A black hole in the Pacific ocean.. n' stuff.. I couldn't make this shit up even if I tried, could I? Anyhow, it's up to Naho to correct her past mistakes by saving the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, from taking his own life. As convoluted as the plot may seem, it's not bad straight off the bat for lacking a sense of realism. Instead, Orange's problem is that even that which is supposed to be grounded in reality feels like it isn't. What I'm referring to is the lousy presentation the series decided to resort to when tackling both the internal and external conflicts of the characters, like Kakeru being depressed for the sake of it and Naho being the weakest and most helpless creature on planet earth, thus making it unbearable to watch her interactions with Kakeru as she hopelessly tries to undo the regrets that the letter spoke of.\\n\\n\r\nAdding on to that, to say that Naho is not a very outgoing girl would be an understatement. At certain times she appears to be completely and utterly socially inept, despite seemingly being a part of and having a decently-sized group of friends. Such a protagonist works great for Orange though, as having anyone other be the lead instead of such an indecisive girl would bring about a rather quick and uneventful resolution to things as no mind-mindbogglingly unnecessary conflict would ever arise. The fact that Naho prioritizes the most trivial of things over changing the future is also a huge problem. She finds out that there\u2019s a way to undo one of her regrets simply by writing \u201cNo\u201d on a piece of paper. And what does she do? She messes it up by postponing it to go and clean the classroom. And even when she isn\u2019t caught up in anything and has a clear resolution of what she\u2019s supposed to do, she doesn\u2019t do it simply due to reluctance. I understand that she\u2019s a refined girl and all but that doesn\u2019t mean that she should constantly refrain from going out of her comfort zone every once in a while due to her shy demeanor when her actions will literally dictate whether a person lives or dies.\\n\\n\r\nFollowing the cursed traditions of the shoujo genre, it is a given that emotion beats out logic in 99% of cases. And as such, logic and rationality completely cease to exist within the relationships between the main cast. Fuck magical letters that bend the space time continuum, Suwa's attitude towards Naho and Kakeru's relationship is where the real supernatural stuff kicks in. I don't care if he's the nicest guy on the face of the planet, no person has the ability to undermine their own feelings like that solely for someone else's sake, especially seeing as he knows Kakeru for like, what, a month? I'd have a difficult time believing it even if the two knew each other since birth, but at the start of the series they're not even buddy-buddy entry level yet. The relationship between Naho and Kakeru itself often tends to fall into unbelievable territory as well. How unrealistically oblivious these characters are to each other's feelings for a handful of episodes is what makes the series feel so stretched out at times since instead of going from A to B, their relationship has a bad habit of going on detours and wandering off to C,D and F. The \"Oblivious teenagers\" trope in romance anime has been oversatured beyond repair and it doesn't help when the anime at hand has a set premise that it can't seem to get to the point of because it's too busy playing a game of ring around the rosy with its' romance. Nevermind that they saw the fireworks together or held hands, that's just what friends of the opposite sex enjoy doing. No implications what so ever.\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters in Orange aren\u2019t good or bad, but rather painfully average as they tend to play into various cookie cutter tropes due to the genre at hand. Starting from the bottom in a literal sense, we\u2019ve got Naho. She\u2019s weak, inattentive to an unhealthy degree, lacks the confidence to say a single sentence without stuttering, crying or running away and has no defying personality what so ever. All of these things when combined essentially just make her an all-around terrible character, with her only redeeming quality being the fact that she's relatively cute. You remember that one time you were at the shopping mall and walked by that small child that was very clearly lost? That's Naho in a nutshell. She's got absolutely no clue how to act or even think on her own and while her constant blunders keep the story moving forward, her lack of resolve ultimately makes her an extremely unlikable character.\\n\\n\r\nI know it may seem like I'm nagging on her simply because she is a flawed human being, something that's supposed to make her more realistic and/or relatable. Brief rundown: A character is (not) complex when he or she is not a perfect human being or close relative of Jesus-kun. Whether a character is complex or not is simply the aftermath of good writing, something that Orange lacks entirely. Comparing her to Shinji Ikari from Neon Genesis Evangelion would be good practice of that. Shinji, at the end of the day, is a well-written, multilayered and sympathetic character. Granted, he is not a likable character, but his personality is entirely justified during the course of the series and the anime makes the viewer very well aware of that. Naho, on the other hand is also unlikable, but her personality is not justified in the slightest, nor is she the least bit sympathetic. She is presented as a mentally-handicapped schoolgirl that can't be bothered stepping out of her comfort zone when her actions literally dictate whether the person she loves lives or dies, and that just makes her a cunt.\\n\\n\r\nAngsty Teenager-kun (Angst-kun for short) first enrolls into the story appearing as a mystery figure, as for a good duration of the story we don\u2019t know much of anything about him. This is totally acceptable though, because by the time the nature of his character comes to light, you'll be wishing he had just remained angsty for no apparent reason. After many not-so-subtle hints throughout the anime, it is then revealed that Angst-kun suffers from clinical depression. I liked you Kakeru, I really did. Due to Naho's over-incompetence in every situation, I had come to view you as the hero who takes the initiative, thus making this story move if but a single inch further. Unfortunately, Orange seems to have a very falsified perception of depression and suicide and for that, Angst-kun had to be the scapegoat and embodiment of the writer's complete and utter lack of knowledge on this subject. There's also no real way to feel sympathy for him either, seeing as his other attributes consist of being heavily controlling and having severe anger-management issues. I can see why him and Naho get along so well. Here's how Kakeru's cycle of depression tends to play out:\\n\\n\r\nStep 1: In case everything is going well, make sure to bring up your dead mother for no apparent reason other than to kill the mood\\n\r\nStep 2: Get pissed off about friends trying to cheer you up and unnecessarily lash out at them (preferably Naho)\\n\r\nStep 3: Quick, make a run for it!\\n\r\nStep 4: Regret doing so & turn suicidal :'(\\n\r\nStep 5: Rinse and repeat\\n\\n\r\nIf that wasn't enough, they top it all off by demonizing the relationship between his mother in order to victimize him further, until pulling a Shigatsu where it actually turns out his mother was a living saint the whole time! You know, they were just taking her bad deeds out of context, when in actuality she really cared about him.. Fuck off. Moving on, Suwa is easily the most likeable and respectable character in the entire story. However, while you can tell that unlike Kakeru, he genuinely cares about his friends' wellbeing, his stance on Naho and Kakeru's relationship is far too idealistic to be real. While his goody-two-shoes persona does make him prevail over the likes of Kakeru, it also makes his character all too stale and predictable. His best moments are easily the ones in which he feels conflicted whether or not to act upon his intuition and snatch Naho for himself instead of undermining his feelings. Unfortunately, they are very few and far in between, as for the overwhelming majority of the show he simply acts as Kakeru's wingman without bothering to intervene. No one else in their group stands out.\\n\\n\r\nSetting aside their heavy resemblance to puddle-toads, the character designs are somewhat visually-pleasing and even help the aesthetic in a sense. The animation doesn\u2019t really have any opportunities to shine as the most intense it ever gets is just the characters running away from each other (I just made myself giggle).The opening looks decent for what it is and the ending is mostly just a slideshow of still images, but the directing is really where the technical department of Orange shines. I was skeptical to see the poor guy  behind Steins;Gate and Texhnolyze be reduced to directing Orange, but alas, he once again successfully utilizes many different editing tricks in order to enhance the atmosphere and the various emotions displayed throughout, shrugging aside any previous doubts of mine. If anything, it just proves his talent is being entirely wasted on a project like this, as a few directing tricks ain't nearly enough to pull it back on its' feet.\\n\\n\r\nYuck. The happy-go-lucky J-pop feel of the opening and ending made me nauseous. OST and voice acting aren't anything too impressive but get the job done. KanaHana going \"Eh?\" 20 times per episode made me want to nom on a handgun. \\n\\n\r\nIt's been made very evident to me that I'm not the target demographic for this show. Orange is like my antithesis in every sense of the word, from the obnoxious cast and generic plot, to the subpar theme exploration and lacklustre pacing. Trying to complete this series was excruciating in every sense of the word. There was no light at the end of this dark, desolate tunnel. After finishing it, my psyche feels like it's been violently flushed down the toilet, head-first and everything. What was it all for? For the credibility of this review? Definitely not worth it. Apart from the directing choice, there was not a single enjoyable element in Orange to be found. Even the driving force of the show - The drama which all fans of the show (fujoshi, mainly just fujoshi) gush over felt surreal and managed to miss its mark entirely. Muh depression :<\\n\\n\r\nAt its core Orange is an extremely character-driven show and as such, a weak cast is the biggest detriment it can possibly have. Poor characterization accompanied by constant, God-awful melodrama and a false perception on serious subjects like depression and suicide drag the series through the dirt, when it could have been much, much more. While the themes themselves are fairly intriguing as they are rarely ever brought up within the medium, the lack of proper execution doesn't give them much of anything to stand on, and as such, they tend to violently tumble over and fall into the realm of boring impracticality, where they'll soon after be forgotten. It prioritizes constant melodrama over everything else, and suffers heavily because of it. Every weaker aspect is subsequently amplified as the show progresses, and the only way it can be fully appreciated is if the doctor's prescription of sleeping pills is currently at a standstill.",

Kakeru is quickly befriended by Naho and her friends.\\n\r\nThrough the letters, Naho also learns that something bad will happen to Kakeru. She decides to do the opposite of the events detailed in the letters in hopes of averting it. At the same time, in future,Naho is now married and has a baby with Suwa, visits Kakeru's former home together with her friends, where it is revealed that they are attending a memorial for the long-dead Kakeru. What surprises them, however, is the revelation that Kakeru died not because of an accident, but suicide.\\n\r\nNow it's up to Naho and her friends to save Kakeru of this timeline where the future of their selves failed.\\n\\n\r\nMostly,we've been talking about how greatly the show touches our heart and I'm no different, but nothing is flawless and at some point,we've to be practical while judging a work as wholly and can't let our emotions get the better of us,the biggest mystery remains in this show is the execution of time travel mechanism.\\n\r\nIt's not like Doraemon use the time machine and deliver the letter to their respectively past selves from the future.\\n\r\nAlthough we're told that they used the theory of black hole to interact with their past selves but we would never know how they did it,this part is so mess up and I wouldn't have complained if it was just a regular romance shoujo but it's a sci-fiction as well,we got all the rights to know and all other aspects can't overshadow it,Something things are better left untouched rather than bringing up unrealistic logics.\\n\\n\r\n                            ___CHARACTERS___\\n\r\nThe story mainly revolves around these three Kakeru, Naho and Suwa,although we can't deny the fact the others characters are less important,but they didn't get much spotlight.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru-I considers him the most realistic character of the show,it's not often that an issue like depression is highlighted in the story these days, but over here it's done precisely in the form of Kakeru.\\n\r\nHe's the type of guy who would never show the pain in front of others and will bear it all alone from inside.\\n\\n\r\nNaho- she's like any other girl of her age who believe in first-time love,she was deeply committed to saving Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa-The most cheerful guy in the crew,despite his feelings toward Naho he tried his best to keep her happy and help Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nHagita- A creepy character but he did something good at the end.\\n\\n\r\nAzusa-The official bread girl.\\n\\n\r\nTakako-A friend,I really don't know what else to say.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWho doesn't like a love triangle?Probably many but still I would like to bring up.\\n\\n\r\nIn the future timeline, Naho fell in love with Kakeru but things didn't work out right and had much lesser interaction,meanwhile, Suwa couldn't control his feelings anymore,confessed to her,Kakeru died and they end up together but a feeling of regret always remained in Naho which hurt Suwa seeing her like this\\n\\n\r\nIn the parallel timeline, Naho fell in love with Kakeru as usual and was able to understand him better and spend more time,while Suwa deeply in love with Naho knew the outcome if he was to confess his feelings,so he didn't let himself become a bother to their relation and ended up acting as the selfless good guy but no one is certain of the future.\\n\\n\r\nI don't know why so much hatred towards Kakeru,everyone got their fair chance in both the timelines.\\n\\n\r\n                                 ______ART_______\\n\r\nAnother breakthrough point for an anime besides the plot is the animation and over here,it's pretty mediocre.\\n\r\nAlthough the background seems to be quite up to the mark but the characters design,movements are so sluggish and imperfect,it's really disappointing to see.\\n\\n\r\n                                     _____SOUND____\\n\r\nThe opening 'Hikari no Hahen\" by Yu Takahashi is really splendid and set the mood for the next  20 minutes of the show while the ending \"Mirai\" by Kobukuro act as a catalyst to all those feelings we go through.\\n\r\nAnd it's a anime with deep emotion and with the right tone,it did justice to the show.\\n\\n\\n\r\n                     _____ENJOYMENT________\\n\r\nI did enjoy it and each episode was an emotionally roller coastal ride for me, but I somehow felt that the manga was better in depicting each aspect to the fullest.\\n\\n\r\n                     ___________OVERALL________\\n\\n\r\nEmotion is something that fuels us,as everything we do is fueled by love,hate,passion,sadness;thus opening up an infinite number of paths which will inevitably change the way we see thing forever as every second goes by,Positive or negative there will be changes and that gamble of nature is thrilling.So get ready to ride on the feel train.\\n\\n\r\nIt may not be the best adaptation right now but as a whole, it was worth watching and one of the best, the summer has to offer.",

            "content": "Adorned with lush textures of green and wrapped up in the endless blue horizon of the summer sky, Orange rests softly on the lips like a faint drop of nostalgia just waiting to be recollected. Approaching the quiet slice of countryside that remained dormant over many winters, we're flung back ten years to where it all began. The place where two paths collided but only one was allowed to move forward. A place tucked away behind walls of foliage, cradled in a valley older than time itself. There it resides, a small town that carries with it a sense of cultural simplicity that only theexclusion of the outside world could allow. Under cover of low hanging branches, the sun pierces its way through, lighting the path where a group of friends walks side by side to a future that lays bare before them. And in this huddle of jovial faces, we find Naho; a soft-spoken girl that has within her grasp a letter. A letter that will forever alter the course she takes and the fate of the ones huddled around her.\\n\\n\r\nAnd with the arrival of a new student named Kakeru from Tokyo, this quiet little town perks up, and so does the latent curiosity residing within Naho. A spark ignites as these two worlds collide, their fates forever becoming intertwined in the process. And so begins the tale that unravels before us. A tale of bittersweet consequence, regret, and seeking solace in the embrace of others.  \\n\\n\r\nBreathing new life into what many would consider being a worn out formula, Orange proves that any set-piece could be spun into something wholly immersive under the right care. By only giving events a gentle push when needed, this anime found a way to offer freedom too noticeably absent in other works. A way to let things run their course. To give characters chances to emote in ways that feel at home with who they are and not what the screenplay strongarm them into being. To let what must be, be. With acclaimed director, Hiroshi Hamasaki, the man behind such works as Steins;Gate and Texhnolyze, taking the helm, this is immediately expressed with the first soft brushstroke that gives the world of Orange life, as things come into focus and we're formally introduced to the story it wishes to convey. \\n\\n\r\nAfter opening a letter addressed to her, Naho is rendered speechless by the contents written inside:\\n\r\n\"I'm writing this letter ten years in your future.\"\\n\r\nWas it a practical joke? Her friends leading her on for harmless fun? Or perhaps it was something more profound... and maybe, just maybe, the words addressed to herself, from herself, was real? And as the day transpired the unlikely answer became truth and any doubt that might have lingered faded away with the realization of what she held in her hand. This letter was no mere trick; this was real. \\n\r\n\"This is the one day I don't want you to invite Kakeru,\" she didn't listen before, but now she heeds those words. Now she knows that this far-fetched truth isn't something to disregard. Whether it be something as grand as divine prophecy or merely an elaborate setup she's incapable of figuring out, what is for certain is that the letter wasn't wrong\u2014a window into the future was given. A truth beyond comprehension.\\n\\n\r\nBut what she does understand is her friends. The clique that always welcomes her with open arms. Free to look on at their antics in silent bliss:\\n\r\nHitaga's larger than life persona, as he fends off comments, being playfully antagonized constantly by the quick-witted Azu, taking pleasure in seeing him fluster behind his thick-framed glasses, while Suwa towers over them amused by the \"married couple\" squabble taking place. Takako hanging back instigating with Azu complying gleefully, as they all crack a smile enjoying each others company. Trailing behind them with a small gesture of content, Naho doesn't ask for anything more than this. These are the moments that she lives for. The moments that Naho feel at home. And with Kakeru being brought into the mix, it's these moments she never wants to let go of. \\n\\n\r\nDespite being indoctrinated into the group with ease, Kakeru remains the anomaly. He flashes a reserved smile, accepts their gestures of friendship, humors them when they tease each other, and even participate on occasion. But just behind his gentle expression, there's a feeling of distance. A wall that keeps them outside from the truth that's eating away within. A mind that's off somewhere else, a lonely place that only his thoughts are allowed to occupy. And staring back at him is Naho, fixated on the truth behind the smoke and mirrors.\\n\\n\r\nThe truth she now possesses. Kakeru isn't going to be around for long if he follows this path, an idea that saddens her to the core.\\n\\n\r\nThe pain of carrying that burden alone. A life resting in her hands. A life she cares for immensely, yet can't express without the fear of rejection, or perhaps even more unnerving, the fear of being loved in return. Determined to save him, she's forced to open up. A girl who's not confident in her self-worth having to muster up enough courage for both of them. And though she may fumble over her words, go about nervously even to make eye contact, afraid of being adored by another, scared to death at the thought of being yearned for, she still presses on. Whether she manages to surpass the regret of her future-self at one minute only to fail by the next, every fiber of her being wants to keep Kakeru alive. A love that's equal parts selfish and unquestionable; a love she feels guilty for, ashamed at the thought of pressing for answers that she knows will hurt him to express. A pain of caring too much to see him go but being too bashful to say what's needed to make him stay. \\n\\n\r\nRegret. Suicidal tendencies. Adolescence. Young love. Life-altering decisions. Self-acceptance. Self-awareness. Selfish desire. Deceit. Earning trust. Learning to let go. Accepting defeat. Perseverance.\\n\\n\r\nA whirlwind of dilemmas heaped onto her lap the moment she decided to take action to stop the inevitable.\\n\\n\r\nBut is it alright to change the future, to listen to herself ten years ahead? A 26-year-old Naho, willing to change the decision of her reserved younger self for a future that would rob her of the life of a newborn child, nestled in the bosom of a loving mother's arms and a man who's in his own right the right match for her? This decision becomes about much more than saving someone, it becomes about weighed sacrifices. Nothing could be gained without the loss of something else. Is it right to gamble the happiness of others, and possible life of another, just to fulfill a want to preserve someone else's? Even the most trivial of occurrences could tip the scales in one side's favor. Fate doesn't choose favorites. The slightest swing of the pendulum determining the outcome and love of those involved. A fragile web that's only held in place by the desire to mend wounds not yet made and save a life that's not yet lost. \\n\\n\r\nThe summer breeze caressing her cheek, sunburnt hair fluttering ever so gently, with eyes of emerald looking outward to the unforeseen outcome of her actions. Was it right for her to challenge destiny? Was it her call to make? Pensive feelings only interrupted by the presence of a partner. Resting his steady hand on her shoulder, a caring look of reassurance offered, Suwa eases the burden; don't worry, I'm on your side, no matter the decision\u2014A silent exchange that says everything.\\n\\n\r\nThese are the moments that are brought to life by the talented team staffed with seeing the vision through. With vibrant earth tones protruding through brushstrokes of greenery, a rustic, yet polish look that's acid washed in Hiroshi's unique stylistic choices; everything displays a delicate touch, fine-tuned by people who care about the projects they're working on. With character design credit given to Nobuteru Yuuki, the same man that lent his talent to Kids on the Slope and Paradise Kiss, it all comes together into one cohesive piece. Carrying this off is a soundtrack that gently chimes in, with the soft stroke of an acoustic guitar, the gentle thumping rhythm of drums, and doled out piano keys that occasionally makes its presence known when the time calls for it; everything here has its place. It's a soundtrack that doesn't drown out the actions on screen but instead works in synchronicity with it. Choosing to be a supporting actor than the main attraction. \\n\r\nThis aspect was also true with the opening and ending themes, with \"Hikari no Hahen\" by Yu Takahashi capturing the essence of what's seen when you visit the world of Orange, and \"Mirai\" by Kobukuro capping it off with a bittersweet performance that embodies the underlying emotions that makes itself more apparent the further you venture in. The two\u2014art and audio\u2014found a space that they both occupy with complete acceptance of the other, creating a true sense of symbiosis. This wasn't to say that the presentation was always consistent, there were certainly moments that faltered, but when it counted the most, it found a way to drive things home. \\n\\n\r\nOrange takes school rom-com setups and elevates it beyond the stereotypical trappings and downright formulaic reactionary content it's usually infamous for. Where most school-orientated anime see fit to typecast characters with a small stock selection of personalities to choose from, often being identified by garishly colorful hairstyles and borderline caricature appearances; Orange broke away from this cast-iron mold, going against typing and the very notion of limited range for what's supposed to be considered as \"relatable\" characters. Instead, we're given teenagers that look and act as teenagers should. There's no token tsundere or mullet-sporting high-school delinquents, only different people with their mannerisms and personalities being brought together under one roof. This unit all compliment each other, in a manner that's done without so much as outright stating it. \\n\\n\r\nWe simply see it in their daily interactions. The socially inept know-it-all Hitaga's stubborn outward gestures against Azu's teasing, the two practically joined at the hip, refusing to address the source of their partnership. Takako's level-headed outlook on her friends, eons ahead of them all in maturity but won't hesitate to join in on \"girl talk\" if the chance presents itself. Naho's reserved nature, a person too kind to say no, satisfied with just being able to see others happy. And then there's Suwa's adopted role as big brother, putting aside his happiness to aid the happiness of others. He willingly becomes the anchor and bearer of unrequited love, harboring his feelings to allow another to blossom, all while doing it with a smile on his face. \\n\\n\r\nEach of these friends existing independently of each other but choosing to pool together where they have others that complete whatever they lack. Good on their own but better when there's a shoulder to lean on, someone to share their happiness, troubles, and existence with. The very idea that frightens the outsider being accepted within their circle. \\n\\n\r\nKakeru admires but fears the very idea of their friendship. A lingering thought that he carries with him, afraid to open up to let others in:\\n\r\n\"I don't deserve it. I haven't earned it. I'm not good enough. No one understands me. If I get too close, I will only hurt them in the end. How could anyone care for me after what I've done? I shouldn't be allowed happiness.\"\\n\\n\r\nHe sits there, eating away, wanting to reach out but pulling away out of fear. Out of guilt. But whenever he's had enough, ready to end it all, there's always a voice ringing out in the distance. His name being called out by the short-statured girl with sunburnt hair. A girl that tugs at him to stay. A girl he wants nothing but the best for. \\n\\n\r\nOrange isn't filled with characters spouting out summations of themselves, nor does it bother to hammer home points not expressed explicitly through dialogue. It lets the actions, the expressions, the mannerisms, the scenes, the camera, the color, the music, the very nature of the show itself, to do all the talking in its place. \\n\\n\r\nAnd while I've expressed nothing but the utmost praise for Orange, there's still a lot of issues that plague it. For one, details about the conflict itself.\\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the romance aspect can get clumsy at times. There are occasions where it's awkward, and that doesn't count scenes when it was done so on purpose. With the density of some characters pushing it, especially when considering their giant progressive leaps forward in the latter half of the show, it does wane on you a bit, if only temporarily. A big confessional scene could be truncated for awkward teenage crushing by the next episode. A kind of regression that felt like it served just to pad out the schedule running time than it did to service the material at hand. While some of these issues could have been credited with the fact that they're teenagers and are not fully capable of expressing themselves to the best of their capabilities, it still doesn't magically make the feeling disappear. But of course, that's an excuse I'm sure many have grown tired of hearing, despite the fact that it inherently holds a great deal of truth about any youth in the middle of their teenage years. It's not always an answer we like, but it's still one that's acceptable for the sake of immersion. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then some viewers would address the issue regarding time-travel. Let it be known that there wasn't any need to try to explain the mechanics of the time-travel used since time-travel was nothing but a narrative tool to set in motion what mattered: the characters. But even with that being said, it doesn't negate the fact that that element of the show was never adequately explained in a meaningful way. Given the fact that this aspect of the show came in the form of a letter required some suspension of disbelief as to why more wasn't done to take full advantage of it. However, I believe downplaying the time-travel aspect as something that's not needed to drive its narrative or be used as a means to reset mistakes if they fail to follow through on the words written the first time, was the best decision to make. Had they been able to repeat critical events constantly, it would have diminished the regret and success of their efforts throughout the course of the show. The letter was merely a timeline for them to follow, but the actual legwork, struggle, pain, happiness, lessons learned, and obstacle conquered, was done of their own accord. And when their efforts, or lack thereof, diverge from what's written on the letter, it disproves any omniscience to control the course of time or predict it flawlessly, which makes this an example of a plot device not being readily abused. And when accounted for how often that isn't the case for anime that include time-travel, or other forms of media for that matter, that's a great accomplishment.\\n\\n\r\nAnd in a nutshell, that's Orange's greatest strength; taking things that are quickly disregarded, such as school rom-coms and time-travel setups, and turning them into something that could be engaging and level-headed. \\n\\n\r\nIf time-travel is readily abused in most stories, don't make it a central focus of your narrative, use it as a guideline instead. If school rom-coms are infamous for having color-coordinated dimensionless personas, take a subdued approach that pulls from the same core values yet brought to life with personalities that feel far more believable. Orange takes the basics and proves that with enough care it could be reacknowledged as a viable means of storytelling. \\n\\n\r\nWith the right amount of passion interjected, what would usually stop as just characters on-screen, backdrops for 23 minutes of entertainment, and a quick conversation of some piece of media, can now be transformed into a lasting impression that people could carry with them. One that could offer fond experiences for moments you've wished for, and passing instances of nostalgia you've never had. \\n\\n\r\nAnd as we depart, leaving the world of Orange behind us, zooming past the aged walkways, green linen jackets worn by adolescence; back through the cracks of the skyline hidden behind a wall of leaves hanging above, we know that we're leaving a place with a memory to take away from it. And as we become less aware of its existence, going about our routines, the world of Orange and its inhabitants continues on, living their day to day lives, making memories of their own and looking up in bewilderment at the endless blue, pondering as to what their future may hold.",

            "content": "\"Sometimes it's better to learn from the past than to try and go back changing it all... But if given the chance, what would we really do?\"\r\n-Anonymous\r\nHave you ever regretted something so much you'd do anything possible to change the outcome? Maybe it was something as trivial as not asking that one person out, forever leaving the question out there of \"what if?\" Or perhaps you even knew of someone hurting internally from depression, and didn't give your best effort to help them cope, with the worst possible outcome reaching fruition. At times, this can make us feel helpless, responsible or even apathetic. Hindsight is20/20, but what if that retrospective approach could be realized? What if you could alter your previous regrets and change the outcome of the future? Would you finally get a chance to forgive yourself? Would this corrective measure spawn even worse implications? In the end, are things are better left as they are, or fixed to fit our own perception of \"correct\"?\\n\\n\r\nThe truth is, there may not be a single correct answer.\\n\\n\r\nOBLIGATORY SPOILERS WARNING :D\\n\\n\r\nOrange is a series that had me intrigued since I first heard about it. Personally, the premise was irrelevant based on director Hiroshi Hamasaki's previous works as the lead on Steins;Gate and Texhnolyze. The Slice of Life genre can be so hit and miss with me, so I had no idea what to expect coming into it. Orange focuses less on the day to day lulls of everyday life and more on love, loss and the importance of relationships. Mix in the ever ambiguous element of time travel for good measure and you've got a series destined for some great table talk, if nothing else. It's not the most \"exciting\" show around, and will stumble along the way, but in the end will give viewers a new outlook on the Slice of Life genre entirely.\\n\\n\r\nNaturally, the first anime I could compare Orange to is that of Anohana- The Flower We Saw That Day due to the subject matter of premature loss. Granted the death in that anime was purely accidental, the retrospective grief exhibited by the main characters here is reminiscent of the series. Another difference between the two are the plot devices. For some reason, everyone seems to have their own take on how time travel works. Although it's never actually been completed on record, some have formulated rather complex technicalities regarding the theory. Of course, Orange exposed its own narrative to these figurative pencil-pushers when it introduced the element into its story, and even I'll admit it is done rather half-assed. Did you know that throwing letters into a black hole somewhere near the Bermuda Triangle could, betwixt space and time, send them 10 years into the past? No? Me either. \\n\\n\r\nIn order to actually enjoy Orange, this is the time I ask you to put your critical thinking caps back on the shelf, and focus on its important aspects. It's easy to become distracted by such melancholy narratives and skim over glaring plot holes, but this is best in Orange's case... or you might miss a rather enjoyable anime. Forget about how much you think you know about time travel and experience the series for what it truly is, a drama slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a multitude of \"little things\" Orange nails with its direction. The way Naho and Kakeru act toward each other is a perfect snapshot of teenage romance. Everything is awkward, there's lots of dead air in conversation and enough blushing to make any weeaboo giddy with excitement. This relationship is a seed, gently nurtured a little each episode, inelegant in all facets but eventually blossoms into a unique thing of beauty. This is pretty spot on for what real love looks like. The writers also do a fine job showcasing the sour side of love when Naho gets pushed to the side or showing Suwa contemplate his own feelings in secret regarding her. This is a very important part of the show, and I must say Suwa has quite the iron will for everything he let pass him by along the way. This genre of anime can often be melodramatic or exaggerated immensely, so it's refreshing to see an anime like Orange create a high school atmosphere we can all identify with instead of one with unrealistic, heavily endowed 16 year olds and scrappy Tsunderes flying around.\\n\\n\r\nAnother well written aspect of the series is the pacing. There are many instances in SoLs where \"things are happening, things are happening.... BAM! Insert major timeline jump or plot twist with no foreshadowing\". The series slowly builds up over time, with the eventual conclusion offered as a reward for patience as a viewer and honestly it felt rather satisfying. Rewatching the first few episodes of Orange kind of made me smirk due to the many intricate foreshadowing elements sprinkled around each episode. It's certainly something I didn't expect from this genre of anime.\\n\\n\r\nI can imagine how difficult it would be to tackle heavy-hearted subjects in anime such as suicide or mourning. Most anime often treat death as something that happened in the past and default to flashbacks and scenes with the shrine of the deceased loved one. Orange places you in the moment, and truly builds up your own relationship with Kakeru, making the realization of his fate that much more impactful. It isn't delicate with its approach, and shows both sides of the coin with its description. I can say it left an impression on me and changed my outlook on suicide in general.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending of Orange, or rather the final 3 episodes caught me off guard. I was initially assuming the viewers wouldn't get a take of Kakeru's side of the story. On the surface, it was hard to fathom why anyone would actually kill themselves the way he did, with the reasons he did. It's obvious as a viewer that his mother's death wasn't his fault, yet he bares the entire load himself. The anime from his side of the story is eye opening, and builds into a fine ending with appropriate closure (something we don't see often enough in anime). I personally appreciated it's honesty, and it wasn't necessarily a \"rose colored\" ending we were probably all hoping for but it was real. Well, except for all that time travel jargon.\\n\\n\r\nI've already professed the relatability the characters in Orange exude. They act like high schoolers without an over-dramatized personality, they interrupt each other's sentences and there are few to no tropes present overall (something I was excited about). Naho is a very \"real\" main protagonist. As much as I wanted to shake her through my tv screen at times, it reminded me of how stupid I must have seemed at similar points during my own high school life. It does seem odd that this group of friends rarely argue or have moments of strife within their click, but I guess that's not necessarily a bad thing. The final episodes tied up the loose ends I had with Kakeru as a character and it couldn't have been presented any better. Those of you shelving this series before the last 3 episodes... I urge you to pick it back up and try again.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, Orange is produced by Telecom Animation Film, a relatively unsuccessful studio. This leads to rather inconsistent or sloppy animation at times, but not quite enough to affect the show's overall atmosphere. The directing was a gleaming fault I can bring up as well. Aside from the positives I mentioned, it's rather lackluster. I understand this is one of the first popular manga adaptations for this studio, but even so, there are some portions of scenes that felt rather dull or ill-envisioned. The best part of the directing? It doesn't really ruin it for me. In Re Zero, the plot was weak but good directing made it rather enjoyable while with Orange the good plot isn't ruined by bad directing. It was a crucial lifesaver for this anime.\\n\\n\r\nI hated the OP the first couple of weeks with its odd animation and music, but it actually grew on me by the final episode. The ED is also fitting for the series, atmosphere wise. The soundtrack was average, but I often didn't notice background tracks. This can be a double edged sword from an enjoyment perspective but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt here. Voice acting is very good with Kana Hanazawa (Black Rock Shooter, Onodera from Nisekoi) nailing another solid performance as Naho.\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Orange? Well, if you can live with my added disclaimer regarding the time travel concept, the series has quite a bit more to offer. Sure it stumbles along and deals with very touchy subject matter, but it is something I truly believe anyone could enjoy. Realistic characters with great pacing and a beautifully crafted ending works to overshadow the time travel eyesore and subpar directing and Ill say it does so quite well. I am impressed with how much I ended up liking it in the end and would recommend it to any anime fan. As always, thanks for reading and be sure to check out the rest of my Summer '16 anime reviews!",

            "content": "Tell me, dear reader, why do you think this series is called Orange? Is it because of the symbolic orange juice from episode three? Is it because the main character\u2019s hair looks rather orange in the sunlight? Both are interesting and passable theories, but I would like to present my own:\r\nIt\u2019s because the main character has the intelligence of an orange.\r\nOrange is one of those common scenarios where the show starts off pretty well but then fizzles out towards the end, but not really because it has strong drama in the beginning that falls apart later--in fact, the first episodes are not particularly overwhelming. Butrather, Orange was natural, organic, and fresh with its cast and even its setting, until the latter half of the series, where things don\u2019t exactly fall off the tree altogether\u2026 they just grow rotten. \\n\\n\r\nFRUIT PUNS.\\n\\n\r\nTime travel is a difficult concept to tackle; it\u2019s a quick attention-grabber that will draw in a large audience, but screwing it up just a little bit can cause all hype to ERASE. I was skeptical of Orange\u2019s concept myself, for these questions.\\n\\n\r\n1. Why do the people in this anime have the ability to send letters into the past when their only life problem seems to be losing a single friend? Why not give it to the MC of 91 Days so that he can prevent his parents from getting shot? I think that guy deserves it a little more.\\n\r\n2. How does it work? Are there certain limitations, such as what you can and can\u2019t send? Can you send yourself a bunch of money and tell yourself to put it in the bank to be super rich in the future and not start getting into cocaine early on? Maybe if the latter happens, you can send a bomb and just end it quickly. Wait, would killing yourself in the past count as suicide? ...Sorry, I\u2019ll get back to the point.\\n\r\n3. Why are they using this amazing gift just to potentially save someone\u2019s life instead of something more noble and grand, such as preventing a massive tragedy, like the death of Harambe? Or Berserk fans?\\n\\n\r\nThe last question isn\u2019t exactly a criticism of what goes on in the story, just a point that this concept could be used in way more interesting ways. \\n\\n\r\nPlus, this concept just leaves a weird taste in my mouth. Future Naho has a bunch of friends surrounding her, a great husband, and a beautiful child\u2026 so she thinks \u201cthis fucking sucks\u201d and just writes to herself in the past so she can change it? Alright. Granted, this is somewhat remedied in the future, but it\u2019s pretty far down the line so this kinda bugged me for a while.\\n\\n\r\nOn a bit of a plus, the concept of the time travel letters was done pretty well for a while. It makes a lot of sense for Naho to be skeptical of them at first, because Future Naho apparently hadn\u2019t considered that it's at least slightly weird to say that she's her from the future and that she knows all this shit that's gonna happen. So, naturally, Naho ignores the first thing or two, and there are consequences to obeying or disobeying the letters, but these consequences aren\u2019t usually seen right away. This is great! It's not a quick and obvious story, therefore reducing predictability. They also naturally cause a chain reaction, with the influence of certain, early decisions continuing to make an impact many episodes deep into the show. \\n\\n\r\nBut eventually, the reader of a time travelled letter is gonna figure out that it\u2019s not bullshit and start obeying every rule made; therefore, there can\u2019t be any drama for disobeying them because there\u2019s no disobeying to be done. How is this overcome in Orange?\\n\\n\r\nWell, to being with, the main character, Naho, is--and let\u2019s be reasonable here--a complete fizzlefuck with a brain having the consistency of mashed potatoes. I mean, my Arceus, her social ineptness goes to the point where I considered her to have some sort of mental deficit. She kinda sort of maybe tries to possibly form a relationship or so with Kakeru, the person she and her much more socially competent friends are trying to save, but when it comes to actually doing anything, her awkwardness and clumsiness don\u2019t help out much, if at all. It comes off as normal at first, sure, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any learning curve over the course of the series--if anything, her incompetence goes up.\\n\\n\r\nA bigger problem is the weird lack of drama in this show. Since the letters lay the plot out perfectly, there\u2019s not much room for drama outside of Naho having a mushy brain. Naho needs a good rival. Someone who comes in to swoop Kakeru awa--oh wait, that actually happens! For a brief moment. The drama caused by That One Bitch (that\u2019s her name) is cleaned up pretty quickly because of the letters, and then she disappears from the show completely. I wish she didn\u2019t, and that the drama wasn\u2019t solved so quickly. Having some sort of dramatic subplot would\u2019ve been a nice break from the constant focus of the letters--or even better, someone could potentially steal the letters and use them against them instead. Wouldn\u2019t that be something.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem with the drama and the time travel is the character of Kakeru. He\u2019s\u2026 boring. Too boring. In fact, the only personality trait he seems to have is that he\u2019s depressed. This is the guy who needs to be saved, the person everything in the show revolves around, but I don't actually care about him that much. Just because a character is depressed doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll automatically like them. I like to be entertained. I want characters to be fun or interesting in some way. Someone is depressed and gloomy all the time? Oh. Well, have fun being sad, I guess. Just slapping the trait of depression on someone seems like a really lazy way to write an emotional story.\\n\\n\r\nAnd since this is a romance anime, guess what? The two most boring characters in the show, Naho and Kakeru, are supposed to get together. You can kinda imagine how this goes, even moreso with Naho\u2019s clumsiness. But see, that doesn\u2019t bother me too much. I could just not really care about that shipping in the end. But it bothers me instead, because Future Naho\u2019s husband, Suwa, is a major character in this show, who has feelings for her. This is a WAY better ship, because Suwa is a much more interesting character than Cockeru and actually does things other than be depressed. He was someone I was actually rooting for in the end. And I'm not alone--go on forums, go on Reddit. Many other people were rooting for Suwa in the end. When you have a show that\u2019s destined to pair two characters together, but the audience is rooting for a different possibility that completely contradicts the story\u2026 that\u2019s not a good thing.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the explanation of the time travel\u2026 holy shit. Maybe they call it Orange because that's what Makise Kurisu would be shitting if she heard about this. Remember when in ERASED, it was a problem that they never explained the main character\u2019s power? Now I feel like it might\u2019ve been for the better, because Orange is so painfully dumb with its own idea that I wish they didn\u2019t share it at all. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a spoiler to post it or not, but it involves a really basic urban legend, and\u2026 nothing. That\u2019s it. Someone in Future Naho\u2019s group of friends connects it to a completely random class they had once (which was actually shown, to be fair), because everyone remembers random classes they had ten years ago, and\u2026 nothing. That\u2019s it. They all completely believe this crazy legend that has absolutely no conclusive proof to it, and apparently make a huge effort to take a vacation wherever they need to go in order to perform it. The fact that it actually works annoys me, I wish these fuckers got lost at sea trying to attempt this stupid plan.\\n\\n\r\nBut if there\u2019s any consolation, it\u2019s not until very close to the end of the series where they actually explain this, so it isn\u2019t a huge focus. It\u2019s just kinda there to say that there\u2019s a reason for it to work, I guess, even if that reason is retarded.\\n\\n\r\nEnough of the negatives for now, though. Why was I a little impressed with the show at first, outside of the concept? Because it sells its setting, and to an extent it\u2019s characters (despite what I said), very well. It\u2019s a school, which automatically sounds generic, but it really feels like an actual high school. There\u2019s always something going on, some people talking and moving and doing something in the background. Just a few details like some random stock characters saying a couple lines make it feel lively. And Naho\u2019s group of friends really seem like a group of people who are friends. They each have great chemistry with each other, teasing each other by saying a bunch of dumb shit and playing off of their lines, always having a good time and being there for each other. The people not named Nah, Ho and Cock-a-doodle-do are quite fun to watch and breathe a lot of life into Orange\u2019s natural environment.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, Orange is not completely tinted Orange, so it gets a 1/10 in the art department. But it does, at least, have some pretty strong lighting; that\u2019s what stands out to me the most in the early episodes, as there isn\u2019t a whole lot to do in terms of animation or even character design, which is about average\u2026 in the early episodes. Later on, the show almost completely falls apart at points, with character models looking completely sloppy, like the studio only had five minutes to animate the episode. After all, TMS Entertainment did like every show this season that J.C. Staff didn\u2019t have a hand in, or something. But, it\u2019s still driven forward by what I said about the environment being lively, with a lot of things going on in the back. \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn\u2019t memorable at all, though. By episode four, I wrote a note saying \u201cevery song is acoustic guitar\u201d and didn\u2019t seem to keep track of it beyond that. Oh. The OP is okay, though\u2026 I don\u2019t like the singer very much, but the song is very mellow and pretty well-written. The ED is pretty boring with its even more mellow, dreary tone, but it at least has some decent art of the gang together. And there aren\u2019t any post-credit scenes, so it\u2019s easy to skip anyway.\\n\\n\r\nI recommend Orange to those looking for teenage melodrama, but do know that it\u2019s not too interesting due to its overall lack of drama and really basic motivations for the characters. Perhaps if you\u2019re into time travel and some consequences of it, Orange kinda taps into that, but not too much. I do wish they could\u2019ve done with the letters\u2026\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, Orange was\u2026 eh. It was okay, I guess. It wasn\u2019t horrible; I\u2019m not even sure if I can say that it was flat-out bad. I wish a lot more could\u2019ve been done, though. It plays itself almost unconfidently, with its basic lead characters and lack of drama. It\u2019s too safe.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 5/10\\n\r\nArt - 5/10\\n\r\nSound - 4/10\\n\r\nCharacter - 4/10\\n\r\nEntertainment - 4/10\\n\r\nJuice - Tangy/10\\n\r\nOverall - 4.25/10 (Range: 3.75-5.5)\\n\r\nFavorite episodes - 1, 3\\n\r\nFavorite character - Suwa\\n\r\nRecommendation level - Medium-low",

            "content": "Aw, those sweet teenage years, your first crush, those sunny afternoons hanging out with friends, that hot suicidal boy your future self told you to hook up with\u2026 Wait, wut?\r\nIntroducing Orange, an anime that will challenge your patience with a super original game of Will they, won\u2019t they? and ultimately makes you wish that not only the angsty-but-kind-at-heart Kakeru, but all the rest of the cast dies in the end.\r\nStory\r\nI have to admit, I really enjoyed the first two episodes of the show. We\u2019re introduced to a bunch of friends and their sweet dynamics, everything feels super sweet and lovely. The main character, Naho, receivesa letter from her future self giving instructions to prevent her from living a life of regrets, 10 years in the future. Ok, everything makes sense \u2019til now, it\u2019s actually a super beautiful concept. BUT\u2026 Where the first episode leaves you with \u201cKakeru might not be there in 10 years\u201d, the second episode ends with \u201cKakeru killed himself\u201d. And this is where things start to go down. First of all, you\u2019re living a full beautiful life 10 years in the future, you\u2019re married to your best friend from high school (seriously, isn\u2019t that awesome?), yet you reunite all your friends (including your husband and father of your son) and decide to write a letter to your former self, giving her instructions to basically prevent someone\u2019s death and end up with him. Seriously, this is so wrong on so many different levels. You\u2019ve known the guy for like two days, yet you hate yourself so much that you want to tell your former self to spend the rest of her life with a suicidal boy who might end up becoming incredibly harmful to all the people around him. Right, it\u2019s a shojo. Damn, I keep forgetting the shojo rules. And apparently your husband is on board, so who cares? Not only that, but the pacing of each subsequent episode becomes a slow and painful ride that leads us right to the most absurd and stupid ending I\u2019ve seen in years (and I\u2019ve watched How I met your mother, mind you). So, the story is a big no-no for me. Good idea, terrible execution.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nI can\u2019t expect a beautiful mindfuck a la Steins;Gate from a shojo, so, even if the plot feels more simplistic, at least it should rely on solid characters. Nope. Not the case. \\n\\n\r\nIntroducing:\\n\r\nAmoeba - our main character. She\u2019s really hot. Like, really really hot. I think it\u2019s the only single reason why people would want to be her friends. I also suspect she might be somehow \u201cspecial\u201d, I seriously can\u2019t understand how a girl can be so dumb.\\n\r\nKakeru aka \u201cAwkward looks in the camera\u201d - the (suicidal) love interest. A character so unlikeable that you\u2019ll wonder why every girl seems to start ovulating around him. He doesn\u2019t have a solid background, he just acts super randomly cause \u201cdepression\u201d. I mean, when I was in school I\u2019ve always wanted that friend I had to be careful what I said when he was around in order to prevent him from jumping in front of a truck (whoops, spoiler!).\\n\r\nSuwa \u201cGingers-have-souls\u201d - the only decent human being in the show. Maybe too decent. Grow a pair Suwa, seriously, you just don\u2019t give up on your love cause you made a new soccer buddy. \\n\r\nUgly nerd with glasses/Hot boy without glasses - someone that had to be there to make sure there were enough characters.\\n\r\nThe evil twins from The Shining - annoying girl friends who show up just to make uncomfortable comments about Amoeba holding hands (whoa, you can get pregnant with that!) with Kakeru.\\n\r\nRegina George - Kakeru\u2019s love interest for a bunch of episodes. She\u2019s there mainly to pick up on Amoeba. If this anime was told from her point of view, I\u2019m sure it would be way better.\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation\\n\r\nNot bad, the character design is nothing special but it works good. I really like the blushing effect on everyone\u2019s cheeks (3/4 of the show). The backgrounds are quite ok. \\n\\n\r\nMusic\\n\r\nI think that the OP is one of the worst I\u2019ve heard in a long time. Seriously, it\u2019s so bad it made me skip the opening pretty much everytime. ED was nothing special but better. Voices were a lot of \u201cawww\u201d and stuff like that. Kakeru\u2019s soothing depressed voice made me want to hang myself to the ceiling. The OST throughout the show was nothing too impressive.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nThe premise of the show was really good, the cast, at first, looked really fun and nice but turned out to be incredibly flat and boring soon after. I seriously have a problem with the story itself, you can\u2019t save someone from depression/attempting suicide by telling him \u201cHey, you look hawt, wanna hook up?\u201d. No, that\u2019s just stupid, I\u2019m sorry, I won\u2019t accept it. Not to mention that this kind of anime really portrays women like helpless puppies looking for directions and willing to do whatever their alpha male says. No, this is just stupid and offensive to women imo. Sorry Orange, you suck.\\n",

            "content": "\"Life comes in twists and turns\" - a line from Orange\r\nLA couldn't said it any better...\r\nOrange was one of the more prominent and known drama anime to come out of Summer 2016 and for the most part, the popularity of this show is justified, however there were something that irked LA by the halfway point to it, as most media do, they have subjective and objective flaws no matter what.\r\nOrange is another one of the anime with the trend of \"time travel\" used, but for the majority of Orange, the \"time travel\" is a small element and \"speculation\" to the plot that a major focusto it, Orange focuses on regret, drama and youth rather than the \"power to change the future\" scthick with the time travel element.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters and their development, the main cast do get their developments due to the main cast being in a group and there are some romantic tensions here and there from Kakeru Naruse voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita and Naho Takamiya voiced by Kana Hanazawa which is one of the main crux of the anime. Their romantic development is sweet at best, frustrating at worst but it being the main couple of this anime, it's obvious that the focus goes to those two the most. Due to the rest of the main cast in the group, Hiroto Suwa voiced by Makoto Furukawa, Saku Hagita voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu and Azusa Murasaka voiced by Natsumi Takamori were at least developed alongside the main couple. The least developed character in the main cast would have been Takako Chino voiced by Rika Kinugawa. In terms of individual development, Kakeru gets the most focus as the plot is mainly about him, Naho and Suwa also gets developed in different ways but mainly coincide with Kakeru's dilemma. Naho gets further developed with Kakeru romantically though it get rocky with some annoyances LA saw on LA's part...on speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nRomantically there really is only three you can root for, Naho and Kakeru, Naho and Suwa and the beta coupling of Hagita and Azusa. There is just one problem with the main couple's relationship and yes at the start it's because Naho is shy about telling her true feelings to Kakeru but the letters help her push this relationship as well as the main reason the letter's function to the story as a whole furthers this relationship and opens both Naho and Kakeru, so what's the problem.....no matter what happens Kakeru ALWAYS PUSHES Naho away because of his \"destiny\" sure we realize WHY he does it and the final episode redeemed Kakeru for LA, but he just snaps at any moment pushing Naho further away before all this and it got to the point LA was rooting for the beta couple or hell Naho and Suwa than this main coupling. it was aggravating to say the least and bleed into the story as melodrama and \"can't fight fate\".\\n\\n\r\nDue to the nature of this anime, using the \"time travel letter\" but in the drama genre, the time travel gimmick is nothing more than element and plot device in the drama genre and even the time travel letter gets a small plot hole LA found. (What was it?...well considering the letters are written a day of paper, does the time travel letter have an entire booksworth of information???...but yeah, small minor plot hole). Nonetheless the further the anime goes the less it focuses on the time travel letter, which brings in the entirety of \"fate\" and \"changing the future\". On speaking of \"plot holes\"...next is LA's flaws on Orange...\\n\\n\r\nLA's own problems with this anime comes rather easy, romance-wise LA already told LA's grievances and annoyance with that. Come the halfway point (or to be more precise, the School Sports Festival) was that the sentiments and message of \"friendship\" was by far heavy-handed and all the more in your face and if a message is in your face throughout roughly 40 minutes is became disgruntly annoying, LA got the sentiments as to what it was trying to do, but trying too hard just became annoying. The other obvious problem is that with Kakeru's dilemma as well as the simultaneous Naho trying to get together goes into typical melodrama, mainly on Kakeru's part and that's where the majority of LA's annoyances comes from. Where Orange felt like it jumped the shark was the entire \"method\" of how the letter was even transported back to the past, sure their future selves were in a rut and just thought up some ideas and sure Orange has a bit of supernatural element with the concept of letters being transported back into the past but really finding out how they \"did it\" is one of the most baffling moments in Orange PERIOD.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, well even though this is a romance drama anime, LA felt like most of the voice actors were on auto-pilot, sure they were pretty great for the first half of the anime, but it felt like they started to not care (besides the more dramatic moments anyways). If there was a voice actor LA liked in Orange, it would have to go to Natsumi Takamori as the genki Azusa Murasaka as well as Kana Hanazawa as Naho in second.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by Telecom Animation Film, the animation was consistent throughout and the visuals on how the camera were used were used to great effect, such as sudden transitions on weird differing angles, made a rather mundane occurrence, intense at times, huge praise goes to it's backgrounding artwork as it was utterly gorgeous at the best of times (mainly outside the school). The character designs at best are typical at best and has rare times when it bring sup slightly lower quality facial features, nonetheless. The animation quality was overall consistent and of high quality and seriously, the backgrounding needs that special mention and a huge highlight to Orange.\\n\\n\r\nDuring the final 2 episodes of Orange, it FINALLY changed perspective to Kakeru and like LA said in LA's romance section we get to see Kakeru's perspective and it was refreshing and very dramatic and really made us feel his \"sins\" he's cause onto himself which lead him down the road he went to that really started the plot of Orange and seeing this did open LA up to Kakeru as a character, romantically his involvement was annoying, as a character, it's one of the best developments as a character and a very depressing one at that. The \"one hour long finale\" of Orange however quite frankly utterly redeemed Orange from all the flaws Orange had compounded through the course of it's runtime by making the ending both give an intense dramatic climax and a great payoff (as well as redeeming Kakeru both in plot and as a character for LA). The ending honed into it's sole focus of Kakeru and the MAIN POINT of Orange and LA thinks that the \"one hour finale\" was utterly needed to make this happen and LA praise Orange for this ending. it did EVERYTHING right to make this ending satisfying and dramatic with the right tone, not much else to say but that.\\n\\n\r\nOrange has it's annoying character and plot flaws and LA nearly lost interest in Orange when they started focusing too much on the central theme and messages shoving it in our faces, the time travel element is a plot device than actually part of the plot and is more focused on it's dramatic and melodramatic events to crank up the character development or relationship problems and Orange even jumped the shark at one point which completely baffled LA. Orange as an anime is a great drama anime and LA acknowledges this, but LA also sees the flaws it has and LA just can't ignore it due to how prevalent they are especially in the later half however there has never been a time but to put this statement to work but \"the ending must be paramount\" and it succeeded in doing so utterly making LA accept the flaws of Orange and still see Orange as a GREAT anime.\\n\\n\r\nLA wouldn't might seeing Orange but with it's perspective on Suwa as that would be VERY interesting to see...*cough* *cough*.\\n\\n\r\nThe quote at the top of this review, \"Life comes in twists and turns\" might as well be applied to how LA felt about Orange as well!. Great job Orange, you REALLY pulled through by the end to deliver a GREAT anime...melodrama and all.",

            "content": "You know, I thought I was immune to being disappointed by anime at this point of my life, but apparently the medium still hasn't lost it when it comes to getting my hopes up, only to crash them back down with more impact than Icarus hitting the ocean after he flew too close to the sun. I mean obviously I'm not a fan of the manga having never read it, but Orange really looked promising based on the limited research I did. A shoujo romance that was only five volumes long and critical acclaims across the board with a premise that goes beyond the usualshoujo tropes found in...well...pick any shoujo anime or live-action drama that got made in the last few years? Sounds like my cup of tea, especially since it deals with suicide: an issue that is still very prevalent in Japan as well as the basis for several very good fictional works from the country.\\n\\n\r\nThe start was pretty good as well. Nothing amazing, but at least you understand where it's going by the time the premiere ends. Orange is a show about a young girl named Naho, who starts receiving mysterious letters from her future self regarding a new kid named Kakeru - and because there'd be no plot otherwise, said letters don't specify that if she and her friends invite him for a night out on the town, they'll inadvertently cause his mother to commit suicide. So his mom dies and the letters start to warn Naho that she'll fall in love with the dude whilst warning that he ends up committing suicide in the future, meaning that it's up to her and the Scooby-Doo gang that always seem to be in shoujo romances to save him. Throughout this journey, we occasionally cut to the future timeline where Naho and her friends reminisce about the dude and the regrets they had in regards to saving him, leading up to the moment when they discover the ability to send letters to the past. So here we've got a typical shoujo romance flavored by themes of regret, second-chances, and highschool problems that are more grounded in reality than most anime showcase, in addition to all the suicide stuff. And at the very start of the series too. Sounds great, right?\\n\\n\r\nWell it's not like Orange didn't have problems at the very start either. It is still a shoujo romance anime, so of course that means an insecure female lead and lot of annoying will they or won't they situations, not exactly helped by the fact that we see in the future that Naho married the other male friend, Suwa. And shortly through the show, you'd definitely be supporting that side, because like most male protagonists in this genre, Kakeru is more of a cipher than an actual character. Most of his story is told through the other characters' observations of him without any real input on his end, and while none of the characters really transcend their stereotypes either, we at least are able to understand where most of them come from and why they act the way they do. Which is kind of impressive in of itself given how the other half of the main six are completely unimportant to the plot to the point, even by the usual standards of ensemble romances. The only thing they ever do is encourage the main trio or prevent contrived problems from occurring when they decide they want to have a go at making things more lively, and even when a later plot twist gets them more involved, they still come off as supplementary as those three non-plot important girls in a visual novel adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nThe show mostly gets through the cockblock padding by having a bit of self-awareness regarding how stupid it is whilst also highlighting some legitimate teenage issues in the process. Okay, it's no John Hughes film, but at least it raises some interesting points regarding how there's a difference between knowing what's going to happen and actually doing something about it, along with guilt when you discover that you're an accessory to someone else's problems. I was always a bit iffy on the whole love triangle thing that happened when Kakeru ended up dating a female senpai who is - and let's be reasonable about this - a massive cunt, though. Yeah, I don't like using that c-word, but there's really no better way to encompass how completely unlikable she is. While the idea that Kakeru just dated her for her looks was kinda cool, she never gives up on him even after they break up, always showing up out of nowhere to give Naho a hard time whilst having no personality traits or story importance beyond her cunty nature. I don't even think she's very pretty. If I was given the same hypnotism Jack Black got in Shallow Hal, I'm pretty sure I'd see her as a gray-haired hunchback with broken teeth and a trick foot.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, nothing is perfect, and I can get past some bullying if the overall story is good, even if it's a cliche I'm never going to accept in fiction. Unfortunately, as seems to be the running theme for 2016 anime in general, you should never believe a good anime will stay good until the very end. And dear god, did Orange stop being good really fast around the halfway point. TMS Entertainment had put out four shows that very season, so of course I knew that they were spreading themselves a little thin, but that did not initially come through with this show at the very start, because it had some pretty kickass visual direction to the point that you wondered how they were going to keep it up for an entire season. The short answer is they don't, and they seemed to have dragged down the storytelling quality along with it. There's a school festival arc in the second half of the show that only exists as buildup for the sake of buildup, making the characters have fun with each other so that the \"save Kakeru\" flag will get triggered. It's like how the first movie of that new Harry Potter spinoff series consisted of nothing but introducing the characters and the rules of the world whilst saving all the meaty stuff that's not guaranteed to deliver for the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nSomeone please explain to me the appeal of watching setup to a major plot direction when you don't have anything to support it but curiosity regarding the future and likable characters, because I don't see it. It's completely boring, and even if the curiosity is enough to carry you the first time, it's not going to be around on rewatch, leaving you with absolutely nothing. No amount of likability is going to help a character if they're not given anything interesting to do. Most people with a soul love the cast in animated Disney movies, but most people with a brain wouldn't call those direct-to-DVD sequels good. And the less said about Kingdom Hearts until I inevitably review one of the upcoming games, the better.\\n\\n\r\nWhat's really funny is that despite the artificial lengthening and worsening production values later on, the final episode ended up going double-length, which makes me wonder what the point of it all was. You could have easily cut out twenty two minutes of fluff, split the finale into two weekly chunks, and just run with that. I don't keep up with anime news so I couldn't say for sure, but it feels like there were some creative differences halfway through production and the anime we ended up getting was the result of a bunch of bitter compromises. You know, kind of like what Kare Kano went through when Anno was booted off the set, only not nearly as unique and definitely not something that would fly by today's standards. Oh, and you want to know how the show actually ends? Well I hate to spoil things, but I can't sum up my full opinion on the show without talking about it, so skip the next paragraph if you haven't finished the show yet.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru ends up realizing that his friends are too important to him to go through with killing himself, he and Naho are still in their \"will they or won't they\" phase, the future characters smile at the thought of a changed past that they'll never feel the results of, and all I could think was \"wow that was lame\". Why is friendship and love always the goddamn solution to these sorts of serious issues in anime-land? Yes it's important for depressed people to be surrounded by folks who care about them, but there's more to suicide prevention than that. When you have it on its own rather than just as a tool, it's basically nothing more than a psychology student who failed to get his degree trying to make it into the storytelling business. Most medical professionals would be clueless regarding how to deal with Kakeru, and Orange handles his situation with such a simplistically optimistic tone that not only is the solution bullshit, but we don't really get much of an insight into Kakeru's psychology either. All the shoujo cliches kept getting in the way, trying so hard to lighten up the substance that it ended up forgetting the substance even existed in the process. And everything the characters say or do is too obvious, so that when the substance is empty, their actions are even emptier. No, this show isn't exactly Welcome to the NHK or Aku no Hana, is it?\\n\\n\r\nOrange never really got to the point where I'd consider it an amazing show, but it still saddened me to finish it because of how close it came to transcending its genre at times, only to gets its kneecaps shot off ant a moment when it really couldn't afford to be put on life support. The animation went to shit, ruining key emotional moments to the point that the characters might as well have been wearing clown masks the entire time. The suicide themes devolved into generic go-nowhere shoujo cliches and fucking retarded \"as long as you have friends, you shouldn't throw away your life\" PSA bullshit. And the time travel stuff ended up being another pointless gimmick that exists for the plot to function a certain way without getting any real acknowledgement until the very end, and of course it's done in a saccharine way that I don't even want to elaborate on. Just trust me when I say that ERASED's usage of it wasn't as conveniently contrived and let's call it a day, shall we?",

            "content": "Orange strikes me as a typical over-dramatic romance Shoujo with a bit of spicy added to it. \r\nSTORY\r\nOrange starts off a bit different when comparing it to other Shoujos. One evening, our MC Naho gets a letter with information written to herself from her future self. The letter contains the exact events of the day, including the fact that there will be a new transfer student in her class. The Naho of the future gives the present Naho plenty of instructions on what to do, so that she will have no regrets. \r\nMy first problem begins with the time traveling aspect. If the future isever-changing, then eventually the letters will cease to be helpful. When that happens what will stop Naho from making different mistakes? While the time traveling mechanic was explained, it was done poorly with very obvious info dumping. \\n\\n\r\nOutside of the letters, this show is your typical run of the mil Shoujo. The main character does a ton of silly mistakes in an attempt to hide her love for the edgy new student. Nothing new at all, but what really bothers me is that someone else already loves her. You can tell by the very first episode. Suwa (the other guy) seems to be very aware of Naho's feelings for the new transfer student. So in words he is willing to be the rebound guy for the main character, which is just really shitty in my opinion. \\n\\n\r\nMy second main problem is how everything seems forced. Nothing in the show feels truly organic, rather everything feels like a poorly placed contrivance. Examples of questions I had about the plot:\\n\\n\r\n1. Why does Naho not ask her friends for help?\\n\r\n2. Why didn\u2019t the future gang just write a detailed letter together and then copy it over?\\n\r\n3. Why does Suwa pickup on Naho\u2019s emotions the fastest?\\n\r\n4. What ever happen to \u201cgirl-talk\u201d? Like seriously there\u2019s two other girls.\\n\\n\r\nAnd there are many more as the story continues. I will not list anymore as they do spoil part of the series. It\u2019s like the story tries up the ante of its melodramatic aspects every episode. Outside of the plot conveniences, the story is way too slow. Every episode contains too much empty space, which leads to an overly boring tone. I honestly wished more things would happen, but most episodes contain nothing but Naho monologuing to herself.  \\n\\n\r\nDIALOGUE \\n\\n\r\nNow you would think that for a dialogue heavy show, that this would be its selling point. This is not the case. Most of the dialogue feels awkward or forced. The awkwardness typically stems from the joke. Most of the jokes don\u2019t seem that funny, yet the cast still laughs at the jokes. Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing, but my guess is that the writer doesn\u2019t understand the younger crowd much. The rest of dialogue is driven by melodrama. Other than that there is not much dialogue. Majority of the series is spent on Naho\u2019s monologues. \\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe pain in my foot will go away eventually. But the regret won't.\u201d- Takamiya Naho\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nMost of the characters are very typical and 1 dimensional. Suwa seems to be the only fleshed out and organic feeling character of the series. The rest are bland one hit wonders. At first they seem likable, but eventually they begin to become annoying.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa: Suwa, a natural born leader, acts as the ringleader of their little group. He is very tall, outgoing, handsome and good at sports. He puts others before himself and doesn't seem selfish or petty whatsoever. Overall he\u2019s a great guy, so I\u2019m not sure why Naho doesn't like him. He clearly likes Naho from the very first episode, but also knows her feelings for Naruse. Most of his development happens slowly throughout the series. He makes for an awesome character, but unfortunately he is placed within a bad series. \\n\\n\r\nNaruse: Naruse is just the edgy new boy that the main girl falls for. The writers seem bend on creating a scenario, where we feel obligated to pity him. His relationship with his mother seems completely contrived for plot convenience, and he acts completely depressed the entire time. Depression creates a very atmosphere when done correctly; however, the subtlety of depression is lost in this series. \\n\\n\r\nNaho: She is the main character of the series. She\u2019s your typical Mary-sue with nothing that sets her apart from the dozens of other main character within the Shoujo genre. She is painfully stupid to any situation at hand. You can easily count her talents on one hand, and overall she feels bland and unimportant (despite being the MC of the series).\\n\\n\r\nHagita: The nerdy friend who\u2019s kinda funny. In all honestly it is easy to forget he exist within the series sometimes. He lightens the mood usually, but overall he gains no character development. \\n\\n\r\nTaka: The tomboy of the group. She's honestly just a tomboy. \\n\\n\r\nAzu: The short girl of group. She brings them bread, and laughs a lot when nothing is funny. She seems to have a crush on Hagita. \\n\\n\r\nAUDIO & VISUAL\\n\\n\r\nThe animation overall is decent. There are a lot of random cut angles and horrible freeze frames. The director sticks to the typical shojo directing style (lots of randomly panning and jump scenes). The character designs seem uninspiring, but overall the animation is the best part of this show. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is bland and very forgettable. The opening seems very fitting; however, the ending track carry over a melancholy feeling. Outside of the opening, the OST does not make much an impact either.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\r\nRegret is a powerful thing, but only when used correctly. If characters fail to move pass their arctypes, then it renders the theme of regret useless. Even when we approach the end, it feels like the series accomplishes nothing. It fails to show the future that many wanted and leaves the audience with a blank and questionable ending. Overall you would be better off watching something like Ano Hana or My Little Monster. Both of those series handle their story, characters and plot much better. \\n\\n\r\nFINAL GRADE\\n\r\nD\\n",

I don't know, I could very well be wrong here.\r\nThis is story of \"Orange\", One morningNaho recieves a letter from her future self warning her about her own regrets and requesting her to fix those regrets and save Kakeru. So can Naho save Kakeru? It's all there in the letter, right? shouldn't it be easy? No, saving this guy is a more complex and monumental task than it sounds.\\n\r\nThere are many things I really appreciate about this show. It's boldness to use Time elements and keeping the science fiction to a minimum and just concentrate on lighthearted storytelling. The story is simple and built on very good character development. Each episode focuses on Naho trying to erase or avoid regrets, which is very interesting to watch. It's starts off really well and first 6 episodes are really really good, after that it somewhat didn't feel right, the quality in animation started to drop and dialouge was a little cringy. But that was only for a couple of episodes, it just felt like *what is so great about this show?* and then it slowly became better and the greatness kicks in, in the second last episode and the 40 minute finale was nothing short of absolute brilliance. A masterpiece in writing,dialouge and development. The Animation in this episode is sublime as well, maybe the okayish animation in the middle was just the studio saving up for this one. The story revolves around a small group of characters who are unique and relatable and they're fun to watch. \\n\r\nBut what i really appreciate about this show is *may contain very minor spoilers* how they display the trauma of a person who has suicidal thoughts, They create an atmosphere and show you what it feels like to be that person, putting us in those final moments and showings us their final thoughts before dying, those scenes are just beyond terrifying and give you the chills. I can't describe how well done that is, Hats off to the writer for that!\\n\r\nIt does have some minor flaws, like i mentioned earlier the animation screwed up a little, some scenes are overly melodramatic and cringy. the biggest problem i have is how they send the letters, *may contain very minor spoilers* five regular people sending letters through a Black hole is hard to buy, they just gave us that infodump than anything in detail. maybe they'll cover that in the upcoming movie but I can judge only based on what they've given us.\\n\r\nwith that being said, i would give my final rating to show with an Overall score of \\n\r\n9/10\\n\r\nwhich makes \"Orange\" my anime of the season: Summer (2016)\\n\r\n\"Orange\" is an amazing show that overcomes it's flaws with it's brilliant writing and development, Definitely a show to check out, especially for those who are a fan of slice of life and romance.",

Orange doesn\u2019t exactly stray from that either considering romance is part of the show. However, the series adds a bit more of a twist in the form of time travel. You heard right. Time travel. It\u2019s a plot element used in the series to forge the overall story as we see how events of the past really can affect events in the future.\r\nAdapted from the manga of the same name, this series seemed overdue given the context and something that can easily fit within the anime medium. It has already receiveda drama adaptation so an anime was expected. As a manga reader, I am thankful that the adaptation is mostly faithful. There\u2019s honestly not many chapters anyway so a 1-cour length show (13 episodes) fits well. But does Orange really live up to expectations? That\u2019s the bigger question.\\n\\n\r\nThe premise is exactly how it plays out. From the beginning, it\u2019s obvious that Naho has a crush on Kakeru and she shows it early on with many hints. However, what really happens will make the audience realize how there\u2019s future events that takes place with the main cast. Futuristic segments are shown from the first episode of characters in their adult ages. Furthermore, it\u2019s implied that a tragic event happens in the future that affects the lives of the characters in the present timeline forever. After all, everyone has regrets or wish they can take back a decision they once made before. This actually gives the characters a more miserable hope for the future. As they know that Kakeru suffered a tragedy, they feel sorrow will strike in their lives as well. Meanwhile, the show does a fairly well job at getting the story flowing from the start. Indeed, Orange uses time travel gimmicks as a way of storytelling. Naho receives a letter from her future self and in it, it predicts everything she experiences on that particular day. The latter not only contain details about the future but also the fate of Kakeru, something that will tragically end his life. \\n\\n\r\nAs you can see, the story itself feels like a time travel plot similar to Steins;Gate or Erased. However, that\u2019s also not entirely on point as Orange has its own principles that strays far from just a sci-fi series. At its core, the show is a drama tale. It chronicles the lives of characters with the most prominent ones being Naho and Kakeru. Of course, they have friends as well and it\u2019s easy to recognize their meaningful values. What makes Orange really special is perhaps the many themes found in the show. There\u2019s social alienation, regret, doubt, friendship, love, fate, and trust, just to name a few. In addition, the series takes daily social problems to bring the realism out at its best. Remember that time when you had a crush on someone but just couldn\u2019t find the right time to confess? Or being in a love triangle but wishes for the best for your friend rather than yourself? That\u2019s the type of realism that I think we can all relate. Similarly, Orange takes love triangles to explore relationships between certain characters. The most prominent in the series is between Naho, Kakeru, and Suwa. There is obvious attraction between Naho and Kakeru although Suwa also harbors hidden feelings for Naho, something that she hardly recognizes. However, because of circumstances, Naho often is hesitant to act on her own feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThe title of the show is Orange, which is actually the flavor of the first juice that Kakeru bought for Naho. In a way, it\u2019s symbolic for her own love for him as she describes her crush as being \u201cbittersweet\u201d. From my perspective, the love relationship between Kakeru and Naho does have a bittersweet feel to it. The letters brings doubt for Naho as she fears about Kakeru\u2019s fate. Not only that, but her friends also share that fear, the fear that they may not be able to save Kakeru. The show often teases around with how the characters attempt to fight against fate with the knowledge from the letters. However, time paradox has its role as well as they learn how difficult it is to change the future. Not being able to save someone\u2019s life may be considered one\u2019s greatest regret after all. Do note that the show explores sensitive topics such as suicide as well and in later episodes, we learn how dark the plot can be from a realistic point of view.\\n\\n\r\nAs the manga is concluded, the anime itself adapts the majority of the anime and in essence, it satisfies a complete adaptation. This will give a sigh of relief for both anime original viewer and manga readers. In addition, character personalities are mostly on par what expectations. Naho, Kakeru, Hagita, Azusa, Takako, and Suwa all represent what high school teenagers are like of their age. They have social lives and strives to build relationships with others to make them happy including themselves. However, I would say that Orange\u2019s romance dynamics aren\u2019t exactly worth praising. For instance, there\u2019s the stereotypical girl outside of the main circle that gets into the main female protagonist\u2019s way. I\u2019m talking about the type that acts like a bully towards their love rival to make them feel as miserable as possible. Being the kind person that she is, Naho often struggles to stand up for herself so others have to step in. And my goodness, some of those moments are difficult to watch. In addition, the slow pacing of the story with its romance development feels scarce and will really test the patience of the viewers. Finally, the romance teasing between other characters such as Hagita and Azusa almost feels like comic relief, especially compared to Naho and Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nWhere Orange shines in storytelling and characters, its animation isn\u2019t always delivering its expectations. It\u2019s adapted by a studio cooperation between Telecom Animation Film and TMS Entertainment. While early episodes didn\u2019t have much problem with its quality, some of the latter episodes seems to lack budget especially with the still frames and awkward character faces. I do have to admit though, Orange\u2019s animation style has a matching way with its realism. The slow moving pacing fits well in conjunction with body movements and in particular, it expresses character reactions quite realistically from many angles.\\n\\n\r\nFor a show like Orange, the soundtrack is also very important because many segments can be quite emotional. In this case, the lighthearted OST works well to give the show its atmospheric feel. The OP and ED theme songs are harmonious with bittersweet rhythms. Still, the real praise should be given to the voice actors and actresses. Kana Hanazawa deserves some particular praise with her role as Naho. After all, she is an emotional girl and it\u2019s not always easy to step into the shoes of such a character. \\n\\n\r\nBy the time I finished Orange, I breathed in and out. It\u2019s a sigh of \u201cdamn, it\u2019s over now?\u201d Of course, being an 1-cour adaptation that doesn\u2019t need to be any shorter or longer. Any more of that would honestly hold back or overextend the show. That being said, Orange explores many social problems that we can find realiable in our lives. The high school days are an era that most of us have experienced and it\u2019s something valuable to treasure. For Naho and her friends, it\u2019s an era where they make the most of it for themselves and trying to do a good deed. While most shows seems to rely on clich\u00e9 time travel gimmicks to attract an audience, Orange goes beyond that combines its themes with the story. That story is like a treasure and I\u2019m glad it was an experience that is more than bittersweet.\\n",

            "content": "Suicide and other mental conditions like it are a difficult subject to comprehend when you aren't the person who is having the thought or desire to kill yourself thinking that the world would be better off if your existence was wiped from it.  It's something that many people face and it becomes a difficult barrier to overcome when one doesn't have someone there to try and help.  So, we have Orange, a...confusing series that despite having such themes and a plotline revolving around it, doesn't actually do it very well.\r\nStory: Takamiya Naho one day finds a strange letter addressed to her in herdesk that details a set of events involving a new student at her school named Naruse Kakeru.  Initially thinking that the letter is more or less full of sh*t, she finds out that the events in the letter apparently written from her 10 years into the future are starting to come true, finding out that if the events in the letter come to fruition, Kakeru will die.  \\n\\n\r\nSo, as you can guess, the entire story of Orange revolves around the main cast of the series attempting to help Kakeru with his problems and stop him from his probably stoppable demise.  On paper, the series has a pretty solid plotline, but...that's not really the case.  \\n\\n\r\nThe first and probably most glaring problem that I find is the fact that the series relies far too heavily on the 'letter' concept.  The show did nothing wrong with trying to make a future/past story to try to avoid a calamity, as many time-travel related stories do, but the characters and the story relate and go back to the letters and what's in the letters so many times that none, and I mean none of the characters that want to save this poor boy actually have any proper character traits aside from maybe a few base ones.  None of the characters really feel like they're actually attempting to solve the problem themselves and grow as characters, but instead rely on a tutorial letter cheat sheet in order to move the plot along.  They're just following what the letters say, and the show mentions that a lot too with the characters' dialogue, resulting in faux character development and a story that feels less than genuine.\\n\\n\r\nThe other problem that I see is the fact that the story never seems to decide what it wants to be.  It's like a...rom-com/emotional rollercoaster/time traveling paradox story that really doesn't work out too well.  The romance is kind of irritating, especially with the characters in play, and the time-traveling part was probably the most unneeded part of the series.  Orange goes out of its way to actually try and explain how the letters got to their past selves and it's just...no.  Of course that would've left a plot hole if they didn't try and explain it, but I feel like that's better than dragging in the Bermuda Triangle or Parallel World Theory into this story.  (Yes, they actually do reference those things.)\\n\\n\r\nThe only worthwhile thing that I would say that this series has is regarding the emotional rollercoaster part, which only comes in the second to last episode of the series.  Throughout the show, you don't get much about Kakeru and his regrets up until that point, at which point you get hit full force in some actually informative and well-written story and character.  It's a shame we didn't get more story of that quality because that was probably the only redeemable part of the show in terms of story.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Orange is rotting tree with only one good fruit hanging down from the top of the tree.  Its good qualities is overshadowed by the show's false-feeling nature with how the characters are just doing whatever the letters tell them to without any of their own thought input and the fact that the show tried to do a lot of other things than focus on Kakeru and the problems that he has.  Also, the romantic subplots.  Goddamn the romantic subplots were annoying.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Touches and has good content on the touchy subject of suicide\\n\r\n-  Characters don't have any real development to them\\n\r\n-  Too many unnecessary subplots\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As a result of the letters, the characters of Orange don't really feel all that well-made.  Of course there is some growth to a good chunk of the characters, but the problem also arises from the fact that they didn't grow because they wanted to, they pretty much grew because the plot demanded it.\\n\\n\r\nTakamiya Naho is our main protagonist and by god is she a piece of work.  Naho plays off the shy and timid girl from your typical shoujo series.  Normally meek and softspoken, the gentle Naho is a creature that the series never seems to know what to do with.  On one hand, Naho has this letter that tells her that her new friend/crush is going to die, so she tries to go up and talk to him in order to try and save him from his fate.  Then on the other hand, in a scene that's probably in the exact same episode, Naho pulls back and retreats back to her shell without any rhyme or reason as to why.  This gap in logic and writing makes Naho probably the most annoying character in the series simply because she only seems to do something worthwhile when the series demands it.  She never truly comes out of her shell and whenever she does, it's always because of the damn letter or when the other characters are around.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Naruse Kakeru, the whole reason why this series pretty much exists.  As the new kid in the school, Kakeru is a mysterious and gentle character that hides a lot to himself.  Admittedly, I can't really fault Kakeru too much as a character because his actions that of the behavior of someone going through such stages.  He feels regret, guilt, and most of all, is reluctant to tell people of his problems, which is sprinkled pretty well in the series up to the last few episodes where they go whole hog as expected of the climax.  His push/pull dynamic with his character however does get irritating at times, but it doesn't really come as often as Naho does, yet it still is pretty annoying.  My biggest complaint with Kakeru however comes with the fact that the series never fully explains the events that led up to what has made him such a broken and suicidal individual.  You get a taste of what, but it just doesn't feel like enough since we never get a full-on backstory of his memories or anything of the sort.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast are admittedly...not really all that important save for Suwa.  Suwa's role in the series is to act as the 'wingman' character who secretly likes the main girl but will never confess cause he's a nice guy, hence why he's nicknamed as the series's \"Best Bro\" character.  Aside from Suwa, however, the other three members of the main cast, Azu, Hagita, and Takako really don't have much of a purpose.  They're mostly there to fill up space and make it seem like this cast is a lot bigger than it actually is since they're never focused on in the series and most of the heavy lifting or lifting at all for Kakeru is done by either Suwa or Naho which negates any and all worth that the rest of the cast has.  The only noticeable side character is this b*tch senpai who becomes irrelevant post-episode 5 who's only there to create romantic tension/drama that really wasn't even there in the first place.  (Also, how dare you make me think of her every time I go back and see anything relating to Merry Nightmare or Tomori Nao.  Never gonna unhear that now.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Kakeru being more or less true to that kind of character\\n\r\n-  Character development never feels genuine and only plot-related\\n\r\n-  Pretty much every character except Naho and Suwa are redundant\\n\\n\r\nArt: Produced by Telecom Animation Film, Orange...admittedly, given how virtually unknown the company is, is just...well to put it bluntly, it's downright ugly.  First off, the animation of the whole series has these nightmarish and unnatural character designs, especially in the faces, that make them look more like demons than people.  The eyes are unnaturally detailed and have this scary white dot in the middle of them that makes them look demented, and the lip motions, smiles, and overall look of the characters' mouths just don't look right.  The female characters are even worse offenders of this because they have much rounder eye designs, which let you see into their ghoulish eyes even more.  (Also, close-ups do NOT make this series look any better.)\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing that bothers me is how muted the colors are.  None of the colors used look remotely half-decent and everything has this gray/brown muted shade to them that makes even the happy colors of yellow and orange look dull and boring.  Even better, that's not even the worse thing about the art in this series.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst thing I have to say is the series's consistency.  The art on very common occasions look lazy with no quality check, and off to the point it feels like a character's eyes were drawn by two separate people trying to draw them at the same time next to each other.  This is sprinkled in every now and then especially during zoom outs of the whole cast where eyes are basically uneven lines at that point, but the place that this happens is during the athletic meet episode where the quality tanked so hard that almost every frame of the episode had issues.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n-  Unnatural-looking art\\n\r\n-  Quality control failures\\n\r\n-  Terrible color palette\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound for Orange is...average, I'd say.  The OP \"Hikari no Hahen\" is pretty nice and has heavy use of the guitar to that both sounds cheerful and melancholic which is a good listen even if the actual song itself isn't really all that memorable.  The ED on the other hand is a song that's in a similar style, but it kinda...drolls on to the point that it doesn't even seem worth to listen to.  Bad songs?  No.  Memorable songs?  Not really.\\n\\n\r\nOn the note of sound though, the voice acting I have to say is...subpar.  There's nothing of significance that can be said about the voice acting so...yeah, moving on.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent tracks?\\n\r\n-  Nothing memorable\\n\r\n-  Voice acting is average\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:  Ok, I had high hopes for this series.  Admittedly, I was on board with the Orange hype train thinking that this show was going to give us a great story and be a decent watch that I would recommend to people.  But boy was I wrong.  Ironically, it was the letters, the whole instigator for this series, that was the main culprit to why I think it failed.  Because of the letters, none of the characters got any growth to themselves because they always went \"Oh, we can refer back to the letters no problem and the letters have all of the answers we need\" rather than try and actively change the future without using some writing on paper-ex-machina to drive the story for them.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this series?\\n\\n\r\nNot...not really.  The problems that arose from this series really put a hamper on my enjoyment, and because the characters constantly kept talking about the letters rather than solve the damn situation by themselves, none of their actions seemed like they would progress them as a character and ultimately detached me as a viewer since nothing they did gave me that feeling to care for them.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this series?\\n\\n\r\nThe simple answer would be...probably everything.  Yeah, I'll go with that.\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this series?\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, no.  Orange's plotline had merit to it but ultimately decided to turn the other way and do other things that hurt the series as a whole.  It didn't seem like anyone actually gave a damn about Kakeru's story because everyone was basically just following a set of instructions to save this one man and I couldn't bring myself to like such shoddy characters with even shoddier character motivations.  In my opinion, Orange has far too many problems that led to little care for its characters and plotline, focusing solely on Deus-ex-machinas in the form of future letters with a paper thin explanation, ultimately leading to a series that squandered its possible potential.",

            "content": "In a world where tragedy happens, do you think you could change it?\r\nThe final episode was just released so I wanted to write a review while it was still fresh in my mind. I should also note that this is my first review.\r\nLets get right into the story. Orange, in my opinion, is much more than a typical romance, high school drama. It tackles the touchy subject of death, and how it can effect even the smallest thing. From the beginning you learn that something tragic happens in the future, so with this in mind you are rooting for the MC (Naho) the entire time,wanting her to succeed in fulfilling her future self's wishes via a letter. Now, I know that can sound confusing but this is all mentioned in the first episode, and this anime is not hard to fallow. In all i give the story an (8).\\n\\n\r\nGetting into the characters.  I give this a ranking of an (8) because some characters where more developed than others. For example you truly only care about 3 of the 6 MC's because the other 3 seem to just be there for support. honestly I don't even remember the black haired girls name -_-. But, I did enjoy an anime for once where the characters didn't over react over every little thing, they just seemed like normal teenagers. (Also, I thought hagita's personality was hilarious.)\\n\\n\r\nI thought the art was pretty, nice and bright colors that fit the mood. Also, something good this anime had going for it was the characters faces. They defined their lips, which is rare in most anime, which helped in the characters expressions. It kinda reminded me of the art in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso. (9)\\n\\n\r\nSound was good, nothing more to say (9)\\n\\n\r\nSo, in conclusion I gave this anime an (8) simply because I enjoyed it. I recommend that you watch this if you like crying, laughing, or even getting a little mad all in one episode. And I will say that I was satisfied with the ending, and was left smiling.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"It felt as if watching Usain Bolt running a marathon\"\r\nThe anime which had the potential to be a masterpiece of a shoujo anime in a short run, but instead tried to become too dragged out and everything just fell apart. Much like how Usain Bolt would start to slow down and stumble during such a long run.\r\n|contains minor spoilers which are indicated beforehand|\r\n|Story|\r\nOrange could have been such a great story. It uses great story-telling mechanics to build up the story and give the characters the opportunity to evolve and grow. But instead of building off of the foundation it set for itself, it just walksaway from it. \\n\\n\r\nRight from the beginning, we see how cleverly the creators of Orange slowly unveil the mysteries regarding the \"future\" and the letter. Initially, they have a great pace, and everything looks perfect for a good anime. We have a great mystery, with decent starting characters and a clear end-goal. \\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, after the initial setup, the anime just slows down ridiculously and tries to drag out everything and this just totally wrecks almost every aspect of this anime as they try to waste time. Let's look at those in a little bit more in detail. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance line just gets shattered, as they try to find at first irrational reasons and later on just straight up illogical reasons to drag out the way to the romance of Kakeru and Naho. The whole plot/story would only need one event to really happen to finally progress/finish, but they just keep on delaying it. In order to do so, they use multiple cliches, unneeded drama and conflicts which just become too plain and cringe after awhile. (SPOILER: Naho being unable to do literally anything on multiple occasions and being just so incredibly slow to help the plot develop)\\n\\n\r\nTo say something really positive, the anime uses very clever techniques to create opportunists. For example, the use of letter is brilliant. The way they use it really gives a chance to evolve the characters.(SPOILER: in the beginning it gives specific orders, after awhile it only says the goal and leaves the execution to Naho). It has great plot twists and has multiple huge reveals that can be shocking to the viewer as well as giving a chance to the side characters to shine (SPOILER: for example the reveal of multiple letters, and the very end twist). Not to mention a great use of time perspective shifting which really could have helped the anime in terms of expanding the depth of characters (which Orange didn't really utilize in the end...)\\n\\n\r\nIf only the story could have been condensed more, avoiding the unnecessary time wasting, then the story could have been intriguing, with a great story telling and amazing twists.\\n\r\nStory - 5 \\n\\n\r\n|Characters|\\n\r\nMost characters are quite one layered and basic stereotypes at the beginning, but that's absolutely fine for starters. The problem is, that most of them never really evolve into something more deep. The only good character was Suwa. Throughout his relationship with Naho, he really becomes someone else than what he started with, sharing great thoughts throughout the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, main characters like Naho, were just handled terribly. This mostly comes down to the issue that the creators wanted to waste time. This totally wrecked Naho's character. To begin with, she was already one of the densest of the densest, not to mention that it would be an understatement that she is shy. The Plot techniques used set her up to really get a character development (SPOLER in the beginning she relies on the letter, but later on she tries to become herself and pave her own path instead of being a \"puppet\"), but because that would solve the main plot problem, they just find excuses and leave her (SPOLER: she then fails and goes back to the letter and remains a \"puppet\"). Not to mention that she literally cannot do anything on her own and always relied on her friends and that didn't change at all, not even once. The last straw was when she actually became worse than the initial character (SPOILER: When she tells Kakeru to stay with her and abandon his granny, which was literally her telling him that she doesn't care about his feelings. Way worse than what she said in the other world).\\n\r\nCharacter Score - 6\\n\\n\r\n|Art|\\n\r\nThe art style is quite different than most other animes. It's a lot more clearer and the lineart is more visible and sharp. It all comes down to preferences, but it was actually quite refreshing to see this type of art. The animation overall for fairly smooth and consistent.\\n\r\nArt Score - 8\\n\\n\r\n|Sound|\\n\r\nThe voice acting was very good. It felt realistic, and i could feel the characters behind them. Each individual had their own speaking style which was a nice touch.\\n\r\nSound Score - 7\\n\\n\r\n|Overall Package|\\n\r\nAll in all, this anime really could have been great if it didn't sacrifice characters, cliches and good moments only to get to that 13 episode number. Although in it's current form it's not easy to recommend it, but if we discard those useless parts earlier described, then we get one of the best shoujo anime. If you like some good and tense drama that really gets you on the edge of your seat, then this is for you.\\n\r\nOverall Score - 6 (but could very easily be 9 if you put up with the frustrating parts)\\n\\n\r\n|Subjective review (rant)| (SPOILERS)\\n\r\nI was so frustrated with how they handled the romance, dramas and the main couple. Because i saw so many textbook usages of conflicts (in the beginning) and symbols (the letters or the hairpin). You will be able to read up in more details about the story-telling techniques in Orange. \\n\r\nSubjective Score - Want to give it a 9 but have to settle with a 5",

            "content": "Everyone has the desire to turn back time to do things that they should have done instead. The future self filled with regret vs. the present self filled with ignorance. What happens when the two collide? Enter the story of Orange, presented as a romance drama with a time-travel twist yet it finds a good balance between them.\r\nThe story starts out with Naho receiving a letter from herself 10 years in the future. It details about the incoming arrival of Kakeru in her life and how she must save him because he\u2019ll die in the future. What I like about this predicament is that Nahodoesn\u2019t always follow what the letter asks her to do all the time. It might be from suspension of disbelief or just awkwardness but it shows that she isn\u2019t just a plot device following orders. She shows doubt despite the fact that what is stated in the letter comes into reality which is a nice way of showing an internal struggle. There is the problem of the ever changing future and it\u2019s good that she doesn\u2019t entirely depend on the letters for her to save Kakeru. Overall there is a constant struggle between the present self who wants to do it on her own terms and the future self who wants to do it strictly in a sequence of events ensuring that there will be a change of outcome. Other characters in the story include Suwa, Hagita, Takako, and Azu. While some of them could really use some character development and more significance story-wise, they have stand out personalities that adds life to the show. They even somewhat contribute to the story later on as the story also deals with friendship and their unified feelings toward Kakeru. \\n\\n\r\nNow, Kakeru seems to be too reserved for a character to have a story revolve around him. He acts like everything\u2019s okay but he hides a lot of suppressed thoughts. I do like the idea since it\u2019s a good way for the characters to unveil him but every time someone like Naho attempts it, he just pushes the person back. He eventually opens up later on but the process can be frustrating. He\u2019s like a walking fragile plot device that one mistake done on him can ultimately lead to his inevitable death. Monologues are dedicated to him but they always seem to be not too revealing despite being full of resentment. With every revelation, it\u2019s like there is more to it and the bigger picture is really sought after. I know the story doesn\u2019t want to give it all away immediately but it\u2019s like a dripping faucet gradually being opened.\\n\\n\r\nAnd we get to the time-travel aspect of the show. I know that some are turned off with the explanation how they managed to send letters to the past but I personally don\u2019t give it too much attention. Sure it can make or break shows that explore time-manipulation but for a show that deals with second chances while still being conscious of the consequence of changing the future, I can look over it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Orange is a show recommended to viewers who can deeply connect with its theme of regret. The romance and drama revolving around it can be inconsistent at times due to its sporadic change of events but it all leads to a fulfilling conclusion. Hidden amidst a world of bright colors are bleak thoughts that await catharsis, it\u2019s a story about love and friendship.\\n",

            "content": "So for the past three months or so, I have been watching Orange every Sunday. At first, it was an enjoyable experience- bittersweet- like the plot intends for it to be. After Episode 5 or 6, however, things begin to take a weird turn. You see, I read the manga a few months before the anime started airing because I wanted to see the story unfold in its original creative form and enjoy the characters, plot, etc, just in case the anime adaptation ruined it. \r\nDid it? \r\nIn a way, yes.\r\n~~ Story (8/10): ~~\r\nAs far as the story goes, it stays the same as themanga. Five high schoolers: Naho Takamiya, Hiroto Suwa, Azusa Murasaka, Takako Chino and Saku Hagita receive letters from addressed to them and it turns out that they come from themselves ten years in the future. They are told to save their new friend Kakeru Naruse who is, in fact, no longer with them in ten years time. \\n\r\nThe anime followed the manga very closely and I saw hardly any original content which I can really appreciate when adaptations are made. If you like romance that's kind of similar to Ao Haru Ride then look no further, this one is for you. Orange also has supernatural elements to it, dealing with parallel universes and such. This kind of genre has been done to death so far in 2016, but it's a bit of a fresh perspective. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Art (7/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nThe quality of art and animation throughout all 13 episodes is quite consistent. In a few episodes, the detail can be quite poor due to the show's budget and whatnot, but apart from that, there's nothing too noticeable. The art is very nice to look at. \\n\r\nBUT. \\n\r\nHalf-way through the series, there are one or two episodes that serve as comedy relief in a way. In these two episodes, there are facial expressions drawn onto the characters that you DO NOT see in the manga. These faces are the kind of over-exaggerated faces you'd see in a comedy anime or something. Orange is not a comedy, although there are comedic moments here and there (mostly involving Suwa and Hagita), the facial expressions made in these episodes can be very offputting. That is the only warning I can possibly give you. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Sound (9/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting is brilliant and there are some top-quality seiyuu's involved in this show. Kana Hanazawa voices Naho and does a brilliant job, Makoto Furukawa voices Suwa and consistently pulls off his masculine, upbeat voice and as for Kakeru, well, he sounded like your average male MC so I can't comment much. I'll cut his seiyuu some slack though as he hasn't been in the industry for very long. The soundtrack, composed by Hiroaki Tsutsumi, is beautiful. The sad tracks are a delight to listen to and all the other tracks are excellent too. He also worked on Ao Haru Ride, which is probably why I relate the two shows so much.\\n\\n\r\n~~ Characters (6/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nIf there's one thing the anime adaptation does wrong, it's the character development. In one group, all six characters shine in one way or another. However, if you separate them and make them individuals then they have no interesting qualities whatsoever. Kakeru is the bland male MC who has depression, Naho is dense, even more, bland female MC who has a crush on Kakeru but won't ever say anything about it, Azusa is a happy-go-lucky gal who goes as a double act with Takako. Takako? She gets no attention whatsoever. Hagita is the low-key otaku nerd of the group who is often teased about something. The only character I can give praise for is Suwa because of his undying dedication to the instructions in the letters, his genuine friendship towards the others and his general, all-around likeableness. \\n\r\nBut yeah, this adaptation does a good job of making Naho even more romantically retarded than she is in the manga, and they take Kakeru's jerkiness a step too far. \\n\\n\r\n~~ Enjoyment (7/10): ~~\\n\\n\r\nI had fun watching this show. At times, the build-up of tension and feels works to more effect than the manga did, but most of the time it didn't. If you really want to enjoy the story for what it is then I highly recommend you go and read the manga, penned by Takano Ichigo. I didn't love it, I didn't hate it, and I'll probably forget most of it in a year's time. \\n\r\nI'll never forget Suwa though. \\n\r\n#suwabestgrill #neverforgetti \\n\\n\r\n~~ OVERALL (7/10) ~~",

It's not about Naho and Kakeru; it's about helping a friend with depression. And we all know how severe depression can be. Yes, Naho sometimes acts dense, insensitive, and stupid, but remember, she's just a highschool student, and you can't expect a highschooler to be the most rational person all the time. I think it's great that this anime showsus how one mistake and how our words can affect a person's whole life. Character development may not be outstanding, but then again, they're young people desperately saving a precious friend. It's good to see friends working together and not giving up to make someone happy. Don't you all feel touched after all that they did for Kakeru?",

            "content": "Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! Orange (the dub) for me was a powerhouse of emotions and led me to some very touching moments. I know I'm a sucker for the 'feels' as it is, and I know this review will not be as eloquent or as moving as say Zeph's there, but I do want to share my experiences with this anime and my time with it. The quick of it is, it doesn't really break any new ground, though it's a bit more original than some, it is still both forlorn and refreshing at the same time. I recommend for sure if youare like me and enjoy emotional-based anime. Will time travel bring the gang to the RTLR wall, or will the future remain set in stone? Let's weave this tale of time and see what we get!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 9\\n\r\nYes there are some cliche characters, and the overall feel is not unfamiliar to anyone with any experience with the slice of life genre, but yet we get a twist: the things the group of friends do have a HUGE impact on one particular member of the group. This impact is revealed and driven by a plot device that must be mentioned. The female lead of the show receives a letter from 10 years in her future telling her that the newest friend in the group has died, and the circumstances of his death. It begs her to change the things that the future self believes caused this tragedy to occur. Through the letter the girl makes changes, sometimes doesn't make changes, and tries as much as she can to prevent the tragedy in which she is warned about. \\n\\n\r\nMuch of the story is wrapped in this angle, presenting slice of life familiarity only with the twist of her seeking a certain resolution to each event. The story flashes back and forth between the 'present' her and her attempts to save the main guy, and the group together ten years after his passing. These jumps can be confusing sometimes, but for the most part are well handled. There are also jumps to alternate timelines, but only a few, possibly only one if I remember right, where we see what happens to our main man if not for the friends that reach out to him. \\n\\n\r\nThe theme of the time travelling letters is never truly explained, and I don't feel like the story suffers much for it. For whatever reason they were able to communicate with their past selves and tried their best to remove the regrets they feel in regards to their actions, and lack thereof. The only issue becomes something of a science-y situation: you cannot change the past. They present the multiverse angle, where when the letters go back in time, they create an entire different parallel universe where the changes they enact have an effect. But the starting timeline, the one where the friends lose the main guy, and suffer from their regrets, is not changed. This avoids the 'grandfather paradox'. The multiverse view just means that another world gets a chance to save the boy, but their boy will never come back. In fact they will never know for sure if their letters even reach another timeline or have any effect on them. But they come to all care for the main guy to the point they are willing to try. \\n\\n\r\nThey gloss over the mechanics, mentioning black holes and the Bermuda Triangle, but there are some things that need not be explained. They get letters to their past selves, technically in a different timeline, in which their younger selves can act on. \\n\\n\r\nIts these changes, some small, and some not so small that lead to the bulk of the story. The gang tries so hard to change the main guy's life for the better, and for the most part they do it, he falls in love with the right girl, he wins the tournament like he wants to, yet at the very end, with the finishing line in sight, there's a HUGE stumble and nearly all their work is undone, leading me to a gasping horror moment as I watched, reducing me to tears. This kinds of movement in the story tug at my heartstrings and lead me to enjoy the series so much more than I might have if it was just a pure slice of life. The feelings, the emotions are there, and even when hope is on the horizon, darkness still lingers. An agonizing feeling, but a wonderful viewing experience nonetheless. I will try my best not to reveal if the darkness wins, but let's say this: the set that sent the letters back never get their regrets undone, and never get their guy back. \\n\\n\r\nIt is this emotional movement, and the fact that the group is somewhat aware of how they all turn out in the timeline where the main guy dies, drives the action. For example, in the 'dead' timeline two of the group marry and have kids. Yet in the potential timeline, the one they are trying to fix, she falls in love with the main guy. How is the guy knowing he was to be her husband someday take this? How hard must that be? It's this rollercoaster that really caught my heart and sent me soaring through the otherwise standard storyline. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nThe characters all look well enough, and the animation is fine, but there's a bit of 'sameness' to the appearance that I found distracting. They look like any number of other characters. The guys are especially bad about this. The main girl is either dead faced or blushing with little other expressions to be had. The dark headed girl looks almost evil and the last girl actually is pretty well drawn and interesting. But of six characters with only one standing out, it's a bit of a letdown. It's not bad, it's just 'been there, done that'. I didn't notice any animation problems, though I tend to be too wrapped in the story for such things, but everything looked acceptable to me. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nI grew to love the intro theme, and the closer wasn't bad either, but neither were really tight enough to have me add to my collection of anime based music playlists. The background music was acceptable, as that's one thing that can be hard to mess up. Airy sounds for normal stuff, quiet tension in dramatic moments, ect. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice actors were a mixed bag. The VA playing the primary girl is about as interesting as watching paint dry. She's just not convincing to me in her delivery. Even though I can see past that with the emotional story, I was annoyed by her stammering and less than enthusiastic delivery a lot of times. The VA playing the unique looking girl was pretty good, the guys were all acceptable, especially the 'nerdy' one. So knock one on the sound for Naho being irritating. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7\\n\r\nThe main male, the one every one is trying to save, seems at times to understand what they are doing, and seems clueless at other times. His entire story comes down to one pivotal moment, and it's a biggie. I cannot imagine the pain they lay on his character, and the trials he faces. The themes of darkness and suicide play through him and really caused a resonance with me. Perhaps that's because I am bipolar and have been suicidal before myself (though I've never attempted the act). Its so easy to forget how much such a thing would affect all of those around you, how many lives would be destroyed, and the poor kid has to suffer through his loss. His final motivations are completely understandable and to me relate greatly to how a real life person would react. \\n\\n\r\nThe main girl, besides sounding terrible and looking a little rough, tries to save the main guy so hard, but sometimes ends up making everything worse. She's a sympathetic character in a manner. She doesn't understand the pain the main guy is going through, not truly, but still does what she can to help him make it through. She stumbles through emotions she doesn't understand, but with the intention of helping all she can so that in her timeline the main guy can be saved. Whether or not her flailing is successful is up to you to see for yourself. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast basically exist to brainstorm ideas on how to save the main guy and how to set up situations that prevent the problems presented in the future letters. The guy that would become the main girl's husband does offer a little resentment, but quickly gets over it. Probably a lot more quickly than I would have. Not that I would wish a friend to death, but I might fight harder to find a way to save him yet get the girl I loved too. \\n\\n\r\nOf course in the original timeline, he does get the girl and has a kid with her, because as I said, they cannot change their own timeline because of the paradox situation. The only way time travel is achieved is to send the letters to an alternate universe, so in a way, both guys win. The hubby gets her heart in the original time, and the main guy they are saving wins her heart as they attempt to keep him from his fate. Otherwise our cast is somewhat thin, but acceptably so. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nThis show has so many moments that made me tear up and really feel moved that you guys knew I would rate this part highly. I am a feelings person, one of the perks (downfalls?) of suffering from an emotional disorder like bipolar. The entire suicide angle relating to one of the cast members had me bawling my eyes out, and understanding yet feeling so angry at the same time. It was a wonderfully moving experience for me, and so much more than the sum of its parts. A good story, where they focus on the little things, and leave the major questions such as how they sent the letters, etc, for the viewers imagination worked out very well. By focusing on the little things they need to do to try to save the main guy, and if their bid is successful or not, is all the story elements I needed. They do mess up, they do fail at moments, and they might not even save the guy in the end, but the point is they care enough to try. If someone found out I was going to die in a way that could be prevented beforehand, would they care enough to try to save me? Do I have friends like that? What a question to ask!\\n\\n\r\nBest Girl: Azusa and her cool earrings. She's the girl with the spunk and the fun, even though she seems almost destined to marry the nerdy guy. She's a great character!\\n\\n\r\nIf you like emotional dramas, things that might put a sniffle or two out there, I highly recommend Orange. Let the big questions handle themselves, and watch out for the last few episodes, as it might not down in the manner it seems to. Remember too, in the original timeline, he's dead, he stays dead, and they will never be beyond their regrets. Will history repeat itself? It has a tendency to do that. Or will love conquer all and save the poor kid from his own fate? I recommend you watch and find out. Only one new RTLR pic, that's of Azusa smiling. The other girls just didn't do it for me, not even the main girl. I guess now I'm going to have to start posting anime pics on the ceiling as wall space is quickly running out. All thumbs up!",

Time travel shouldn\u2019t been used unless you really going to do something great. Really...\r\nLet\u2019s start with the obvious, the anime revolves around kakeru, about saving Kakeru and we barely know a thing about him right until the end. The only thing that made this watchable was the relationship the 5 friends have and the way they interact with each other and yet again, we know absolutely nothing about any ofthem.\\n\\n\r\nHalf the show is about Naho been shy and Naho fighting with herself and NAho reading the same thing on the letter, I\u2019m truly bored of this kind of Characters completely done with them, the only Character like this I was able to stand was Sawako on Kimi ni todoke, she was funny, her reactions were amazing, anyways\u2026the rest is just more of the same.\\n\\n\r\nAnd to make it worst, the theory to make the letter time travel! Never have seen such a lame way to explain it, never! The ending was even emptier than the time travel theory if you can top that.\\n",

            "content": "Apparently, writing a shoujo story is difficult. Why? Because 90% of them is basically the same story. Sure, there are some shows out there, like 'Nana' or 'Ouran High School Host Club', that are one of a kind. But for some reason, there aren't many of them and unfortunately, 'Orange' does not belong to this category of original stories. \r\n'Orange' attempts to be original by adding a 'time travel element'. Our main character, Naho gets a letter from her future self. The letter instructs Naho to keep an eye on a new transfer student in order to 'save him and erase her regrets'. \r\nThis could'vebeen interesting and give 'Orange' originality. However, this 'time travel element' was so small, that it was too weak to save the show from being generic.\\n\r\nIt's not that they let the audience forget that there is a letter from the future. Oh no, we are reminded of it quite often. It's just that Naho takes the letter for granted; she never even tries to figure out how her future self managed to sent a letter to the past. If I got such a letter I would want to know that in the first place! (at least after it proved to be the real thing) I was certain that the show wouldn't even bother to reveal this to us. I was wrong though: we've got an explanation, but only in episode 12 and it was 'explained' like in 2 minutes (far from Steins;Gate level here). \\n\\n\r\nA thing that doesn't add to originality at all is the high school setting. Seriously, why does it always has to be high school? 'Nana' and 'Paradise Kiss' proved that a good shoujo story doesn't have to take place in high school. If Orange would've had a different setting, it might've been more interesting and a bit more unique.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some shoujo shows out there that aren't too original, but still enjoyable to watch. 'My little Monster' for example; the story and the cast aren't too unique, but the comedy really adds to it. So even though you won't get a feeling that you've seen something completely new from such a show, you'll most likely be entertained by it and won't feel like you've waisted your time on it. \\n\r\nUnfortunately, 'Orange' is different. 'Orange' is a serious drama series. But in order to be a good serious drama, an anime has to be able to trigger the viewer's feels. It has to leave the viewer emotionally touched. And this is where 'Orange' fails miserably. The only thing Orange has left me is annoyance towards the characters. \\n\\n\r\nAaaah, the characters\u2026.\\n\\n\r\nLet's start with Naho, our main character, probably the most annoying one in the show. Naho is a sweet, shy girl. But when I say shy, I mean EXTREMELY SHY. She's convinced that she is a bother to EVERYONE by just breathing. She's even afraid to say 'good morning' to Kakeru (the transfer student) and that after they've already become friends. She is kinda determined that to change the future and erase her regrets, however her shyness kicks even here. Naho really does want to save Kakeru, but because she's too shy to do the things that might save him (like talk to him and make him feel comfortable at the new school) she gets angry at her future self for giving her such a task. This is kinda frustrating and it makes Naho whiney. Not to the outside world, oh no. She'll rather die than complain about anything to her friends. She's whiney in her head and we, the audience have to put up with that. \\n\r\nGirl, man up a bit!!!!\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Kakeru, the new transfer student and Naho's romantic interest. The show maintains the believe that he has a certain darkness in him. However, we never actually get to see it. Well\u2026we do at some point get to see him gloomy. But it was portrayed rather weak. \\n\\n\r\nAnother character that we get to see quite often is Suwa. He is in love with Naho, but because he too wants to help Kakeru he pushes his feelings for her away. He's convinced that if Naho and Kakeru don't end up together they will not manage to save Kakeru. That self - sacrifice is annoying. I don't get what made Suwa think that was the only way to save Kakeru. Why does he has to give up his own happiness? The idea that due his self-sacrificing way of saving Kakeru, Suwa will be the one who'll need saving in the next letter from the future apparently never crossed his mind. Pretty sure that if Suwa's hurting Naho will be sad and will try to help him too\\n\\n\r\nThere's not that much to say about the rest of the cast, except that they are average. There are 3 more characters labelled as 'main character', but honestly, after 13 episodes I still had no idea who they were. They don't get any backstory or character development AT ALL. There is Azusa and there is Takako. Both are smiling for 96% of the time, which gave me the feeling that the creators of the show were too lazy to give them any other facial expressions. Same goes for Hagita. The only difference is that he never bothers to smile and tries to be mr Cool, which might've worked out in another show. \\n\\n\r\nThe above written is quite negative. So I'm going to mention something I DID like about this show: it looked kinda good. That's it, the only good thing worth mentioning about 'Orange' (I honestly can't think of anything else)\\n\\n\r\nOrange is a sweet, naive, generic, high - school shoujo drama series about friendship. If you like that sort of thing, then go watch it. But I honestly don't think it's worth your time. There are much better shoujo shows out there, which are more original than this one.  \\n",

            "content": "Nktheepic's Not-so-epic Reviews \r\nReview 1: Orange\r\nThis review will most likely not contain spoilers, but I cannot guarantee that. Proceed with caution. \r\n------\r\nPeople have always debated over whether human lives are controlled by fate or by free will. There are some that believe that everything is set in stone, while some also believe that humans control every aspect of their present lives as well as their futures. That being said, Orange is an anime that essentially sums up the doctrine of free will, as the characters of the show have to prevent the death of one of their close friends. \r\nStory\r\nThe story follows a girl namedNaho Takamiya who uses letters delivered to her by her 26-year-old self in order to save her close friend from death. While time travel has often been used in several different series, the creators took a unique approach to the use of time travel - which emphasized the present over the past or the future. Thus, the story was quite unique.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, the story could have been improved. While the point of the story was to pull at one's heartstrings, I was unable to feel any sort of sadness or hopelessness while watching. This was mainly because the audience members could easily predict the ending from the beginning of the show. This is easily a shoujo type of story, where the main character ends up with her fated other, and where there are no tears shed or any sad endings. \\n\\n\r\nNow, even as it easily followed the general archetype of shoujo anime, it was still unique. Thus, I rated the story as a 7/10 - because it was an interesting story in spite of it being rife with cliches. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were almost exactly as I expected them to be, and thus I did not enjoy them at all. The main female protagonist, Naho Takamiya, was the housemaker type who did not have any redeeming qualities besides the ability to blush easily when in love (does that even count as a redeeming quality or is it just a flaw). She did not have any complexities and was basically a cookie-cutter shoujo heroine. \\n\\n\r\nNext, the main male protagonist, Kakeru Naruse, did not have many qualities at all, except for low confidence and what looks to be depression. Even then, he consistently takes it out on others, like towards Naho, and it largely seems as if he is just hung up on one incident, his mother's death, believing that it is his fault. This seems less like depression and more like a normal reaction towards emotional stress, so he is being quite weak and melodramatic, just to keep the darn story going. \\n\\n\r\nFinally, the side characters, who are Naho and Kakeru's friends, pretty much exist for the two to ultimately get together. These characters are not interesting in any way, shape, or form. Their whole purpose is to make Naho and Kakeru a thing, so even if they are removed, the story would ultimately have the same result. The only redeeming character of the side characters is Suwa, who is shown to be caring and puts Naho's happiness over his own. Suwa has proved himself to be a nice guy, but, just as in real life, the nice guy ultimately gets friend zoned. \\n\\n\r\nOof, now I feel bad for nice guys.\\n\\n\r\nDue to the issues that I found with the characters, I rated them a 3/10.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite average. I found the background art to be interesting and quite beautiful, but at the end, the characters were designed in a basic way. I rated the art a 5/10.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\\n\r\nI do not normally consider sound as a big factor in anime, mainly because I skip the openings and endings whenever I binge watch a show. However, I decided to re-look at the opening and closing and found them to be quite delightful, albeit skip-worthy. So, I rated the sound as a 7/10.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\\n\r\nEven though there were several flaws in Orange, I still enjoyed it to a reasonable extent. Orange is the kind of show one should watch if they need a break from dark psychological thrillers or action masterpieces. It is certainly worth watching, even as there were several things that could have been improved. I hope you watch this and enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nI hope you liked this review. Please give me some feedback on it by commenting on my profile. Thank you very much for letting me display my opinions over this show. Have a nice day!\\n\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nConclusion of Review 1: Orange\\n\r\nNktheepic's Not-so-epic Reviews\\n",

It wasn't amazing but wasn't terrible either although the quality did seem to reduce a bit towards the end. \r\n-Sound was alright too. \r\n-Includes some more serious themes (depression, suicide) and also a little sci-fi elements (parallel worlds).\r\nWhat I didn't liked:\r\n-The female main character, Naho, was incredibly annoying and got increasingly annoying as the episodes went on. She is the generic shoujo female main with an extremely shy personality but a nice and caring person to her friends. \r\n-The male main character, Kakeru, wasn't much better but a slightly easier to understand when you look at his circumstances. Nevertheless,he was still frustrating. \\n\r\n-The story felt draggy to me. It seemed to be a cycle of the main male being sensitive and irritated and then resolving the issues and repeat. \\n\r\n-I appreciate the exploration of serious themes however I don't think it did it very well. Most characters also lacked development; to me it felt like more of the focus was on romance. It also had the 'I have to save my friends and everybody' idea, which I don't particularly like. \\n\r\n-The parallel world concept was just there. I don't have too much to say about it; it wasn't explained well but whatever. \\n\\n\r\n+I've read some (alot actually) of comments of people crying over the show, being emotional but I personally didn't feel any of that. It was more frustrating than sad. Maybe I'm just not the target audience for this show. \\n\\n\r\nI believe Orange could potentially be good but was executed poorly.",

            "content": "Note: This review was written a while ago when the show was over. Thus, it does not necessarily represent my current opinions, writing, scores or anything really. Still, I somewhat stand with the core ideas of the review.\r\nMinor spoilers for the first episode can be found to better explain what the story is about.\r\nOrange is a good drama/romance story that had a world of potential, but failed at being something truly special.\r\n--Introduction--\r\nDo you have regrets? Of course you do. We all have regrets. We all have been in the situation where we wonder if things would have turned out differently. We wonder whether the decisionswe took were the wrong ones and we would be happier if it wasn't for the mistakes we did, even if at the time everything seemed alright. This anime is all about fixing your mistakes and the sacrifice that comes from making others happy.\\n\\n\r\n--Plot--\\n\r\nOur main character in this story, Naho Takamiya, is a normal high school girl that one day receives a letter by herself, ten years in the future. As she starts reading, the letter accurately predicts many instances during the day. Most importantly, the letter orders Naho to pay close attention to a new student named Kakeru Naruse. At the end of the first episode, it is revealed that Kakeru is dead in the future.\\n\\n\r\nSo the story is very clear since the beginning. Future Naho wants highschool Naho to not hold all the regrets that she has ten years in the future. In each episode, highschool Naho tries to follow what the letter says the best she can so that she doesn't have the same regrets future Naho has, and to accomplish the main goal that is saving Kakeru from dying.\\n\\n\r\nAt first, we don't really know what is going on. Like, we know that something bad happened to Kakeru since... well he's dead in the future, but we don't know the cause of it. I really like how the series keeps you \"distracted\" and doesn't really reveal what exactly happened to Kakeru. Instead of trying to revolve the plot around this idea of saving him from a tragic outcome, the series instead makes you slowly grow attached to the characters. The best way I could describe is that the show takes a \"slice-of-life route\" so that you can know the two main characters and make you care about them. Episodes 1-6 focuses on everyday life situations with a bit of romance elements thrown here and there so that it doesn't feel rushed, giving us clever clues of future events through clever editing. When the big reveals start coming out, you can look back at scenes and frames that felt totally irrelevant in the first veiwing and notice that the show was foreshadowing what's yet to come.\\n\\n\r\nThere are some things that I know would turn off people from this anime. First thing is how friendly the main cast is towards each other. In this show, the main characters are WAY too friendly. I promise you that you will never see such a friendship in real life. When you watch it you'll see what I'm rambling about and I think you will agree with me. Second is the character's decisions. There are moments when you're going to feel like you want to reach out through your screen, grab the character, give them a slap in the face and tell them what to do. For some reason, every character does an awful job at making decisions. Third is the lack of originality in the romance. We have the typical love triangle where the main girl is totally cluesless that both guys like her (kinda reminds me of a reverse Nisekoi lmao). This isn't necessarily bad, but we anime fans have seen this types of romances so much that are just tired of them and desperately want something new. It didn't bother me personally, but I know it will to others.\\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the whole thing, I found myself really confused with the time travel element regarding the time-traveling letters. The last two episodes tried to explain it, but in my honest opinion it was better if they didn't tried to. I won't spoil anything, but the explanation they gave did not make any sense neither by logic or science and it came of as cheesy. I know this is anime we are talking about and time travel itself is not realistic, but the creator(s) could have at least tried to make it do some kind of sense. I would have much rather prefered it to be stayed unexplained and left to the viewers interpretation (even though it still would have angered fans anyways).\\n\\n\r\n--Pacing--\\n\r\nOne of the things I like about this series is the pacing. Four episodes in and nothing feels rushed or slow paced. I find it impressive that episodes 1-4 only adapted one chapter each (I'm pretty sure that's the case but I'm an anime only so don't quote me on that). Usually anime adaptations are in a disadvantage when it comes to pacing since they have a specific number of episodes and budget to work with so they tend to rush things a bit, but not Orange. This opinion about pacing is very subjective though. Some may find the anime a bit to slow paced for their liking, but that is understandable.\\n\\n\r\n--Art & Sound--\\n\r\nThe art and sound of this series is quite impressive, when it wants to be. Unlike other anime, Orange prefers more realistic sceneries and character designs (much how a Shoujo would look, but better). Everything moves smoothly and it's simply gorgeous... again, when it wants to be. I have to admit there are some very noticible quality drops on the visuals, especially in the character designs. During the middle of the series, there are times when it looks pretty trashy, then we get the quality from the first episodes, then it turns bad again. This back and forth in quality bothered me a bit and that is one of my few complaints. \\n\\n\r\nAfter watching the finale, I found myself wishing this had consistent animation. A complaint from many was that the animation looked bad in the second half, but Episode 13 visualy looked pretty amazing to be honest. The character designs were on point and to my liking, the background and the choice of colors were very appealing to the eye and everything moved very smoothly, the best it had been throughout the whole series. Even though my eyes were being aroused with the visuals of the last episode, I sadly can't forget the major quality drops it suffered. Despite this, Episode 13 sort of redeemed Orange from its visual mistakes.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening and ending songs fits the style perfectly and made me want to listen to them on my free time. The soundtrack played during the episodes is just so relaxing and very fitting to the art and tone. I do have to admit I got a bit of chills the first times I heard it but the effect slowly vanishes when played every episode, which is expected.\\n\\n\r\nSince we're talking about sound, I wanted to quickly give a bit of praise to voice actress Kana Hanazawa because she freaking nails the role of Naho in this series. I don't really feel like I need to tell anyone who she is because she's in SO many anime, but for those who don't know, her voice is godly. I'm down to watch anything with Hanazawa voice acting (fanboy much am I right?) because even if I don't like the anime, I know I'm going to enjoy listening to her character. I love all of her roles and I think she puts it out of the park with her performance in Orange, but that's not really a shocker.\\n\\n\r\n--Realism--\\n\r\nAnime is known to exaggerate everything, from how loud every character speaks and acts to how most characters having unrealistic bodies. Not Orange. The character designs are much more realistic like a typical Shojou look. \\n\\n\r\nWhen you're watching this series, pay close attention to the dialogue between characters. There are moments where one characters interrupts the other because he/she wasn't expecting another person to talk. I was so impressed by this because THAT HAPPENS IN REAL LIFE. We sometimes interrupt our friends because we weren't expecting them to say something. I know this is such a small detail that is probably meaningless but it just adds to me. The point I wanted to get across is that even though it lacks a bit of originality, Orange does small things here and there that adds up to my personal enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\n--Final thoughts--\\n\r\nMy opinion of this series has changed since the first episode. Orange was my number one anticipated anime of Summer 2016. My favorite anime are the ones that hit you in the feels. If you look at my favorites list, you'll probably see a lot of the drama genre because I love my tearjerkers and the dramatic sh*t. A big reason as of why it was my most anticipated anime of this season is BECAUSE I'm a huge fan of the dramatic sh*t. Manga readers were comparing it to Anohana, Clannad, Your Lie in April and others, so WHO WOULDN'T GET EXCITED? As the episodes went by, I started to realize this wasn't what I expected. I can't explain why, but I think I was expecting way too much and got caught up in the hype. \\n\\n\r\nIs it bad? No, not at all. In fact I think Orange is good. The best recommendation I could give before watching this is to not have any expectations. A good example of \"coming in without any expectations\" and it actually paying off is my experience with ReLIFE. I was expecting the most generic, probably boring show of the summer. To my surprise, I had a blast and even inspired me to write a whole review about it.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to have in mind is that this isn't a series for everyone. If you can't stand series like Anohana, Kokoro Connect, Kiznaiver or other teen dramas, don't even bother giving this one a shot. I've seen some people saying Orange is \"the most annoying anime of Summer 2016\", and I can't blame them for thinking this way because it isn't for everyone. As I said before, this type of series IS for me and that is why I found some genuine enjoyment within this story.\\n\\n\r\nCompare Orange with other romance Shoujos, it will stand strong with interesting plot. Compare it with other highly acclaimed Drama/Romances like others have done, it falls flat and you will be a bit dissapointed like I was. It is still a decent watch if fan of the Drama/Romance combination.\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+The pacing is well done (for me at least)\\n\r\n+The concept of getting a letter from your future self is very interesting\\n\r\n+Easily relatable characters (you want them to succeed)\\n\r\n+Pretty amazing music, OP and ED\\n\r\n+First half and last episode looked pretty amazing\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Slow paced for some people's likings\\n\r\n-Very inconsistent visuals during second half (character designs mostly)\\n\r\n-Characters are not handled well.

            "content": "I rarely ever write reviews for anime I've completed...in fact, this is the first review I'm writing since becoming active on MAL about 2 years ago. I also almost never watch shoujo or anime that fall into the romance genre in general. I'm not a fan of romance stories period. So to be honest, I can't speak about the romance part of the story since I don't have a large amount of \"experience\" watching the genre. Orange is definitely not going to be understood or enjoyed by everyone, but for those who have experienced depression and self-hate, part of the story-line will definitely hit homehard. The biggest reason I wanted to write a review because as expected, some of the top reviews are giving this show terrible ratings which obviously is just someone's opinion, but I want to give a different point of view for those interested in watching.\\n\\n\r\nThe show does a lot of thing well in relation to illustrating the pain of going through depression and also the difficulties in having a friend going through depression. I really liked how there was almost always a positive message and symbolism through the story to almost teach the viewer about what depression is like how to help someone who is going through it. The story very accurately depicts how unpredictable depression can be....one moment can go so well, but that doesn't mean you're suddenly free of your inner demons that are causing you so much pain and suffering.\\n\\n\r\nDeath is also a huge theme in this story which almost seems counterintuitive to a shoujo, romance, feel-good anime. The story explores how someone deals with death in their life and how someone deals with possible impending death (aka suicidal thoughts). \\n\\n\r\nThere are so many feel good moments and an equal amount of heart-wrenching moments that this show really took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions. I have never cried so much while watching an anime. Literally, after a certain point, I cried or at least teared almost every episode. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking on the romance aspect of the show, it wasn't strong at all; it absolutely focused on friendship more than anything, so if you're expecting a decent romance story, I won't say you should look for that in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, I enjoyed it. It's pretty simplistic in my opinion, nothing amazing. Opening song is decent. Characters are lovable and admirable, and the storyline is definitely engaging. I wouldn't recommend to everyone, but if after reading my review you're still interested, then definitely watch !\\n\\n",

            "content": "I honestly loved this anime. I loved it in the way that I dreaded watching it every week because I knew I would sob my eyes out (and I did). 'Orange', (a manga adaptation), is about a group of high school friends that lose one of their own to suicide. Desperate to erase their regrets, they hope to change the past and save their friend's life. Naho, the protagonist, receives a letter from the future that gives these friends hope for a better tomorrow. This is a shoujo anime and a slow and sweet love story. \r\nThe story progression was slow, but these characters hadto follow a timeline and couldn't afford to rush through it. I liked how they took their time actually, Naho and crew were dealing with an emotionally fragile teenage boy and were desperate to save his life, so why would they rock the boat by trying to beat the clock?\\n\\n\r\nI'm reading through people's frustration about Naho's character and it strikes me funny. She's a high schooler who just got a letter from the future BEGGING her to save a classmate's life. Naho is very meek and has trouble expressing her feelings and all of a sudden she's meant to fall in love with Kakeru because a letter tells her to. I can't even IMAGINE the pressure she was under. I think she handled it as well as a young girl who's that timid could possibly handle it! Suwa was my favorite character though, his projected future with Naho was wonderful and he was such a terrific friend to both Naho AND Kakeru (his romantic rival). To bow out of a romantic conquest (especially when you know what a nice future you have waiting for you) to save a friend's life is admirable. \\n\\n\r\nI loved every character and I loved how they treated the subject matter with gravity and didn't glaze over suicide and allowed Kakeru to truly suffer through it to find he had an incredibly support system.\\n\\n\r\nMy only criticism was the quality of the animation VASTLY decreased episode by episode. Yes, sometimes their eyes were very wonky, but fortunately the story was strong enough to carry me through it. The music/sound was really great though!\\n\\n\r\nI recommend watching this if you enjoy shoujo, are patient, and are prepared to cry. BECAUSE YOU WILL! <3",

            "content": "\"It had so much potential.\"\r\nThat's how I would summarize Orange in a single sentence.\r\nStory - 4/10\r\n----------------\r\nFirst of all, let's talk about the core plot device of this anime ~ Time Travel. Here's the thing about time travel,\r\n1) You explain completely how it happens (or) \r\n2) You don't explain it at all because the focus of your anime is something else. So you leave the viewers to come up with some sort of romantic connotation for it.\r\nOrange did neither. It just half-assed the whole thing.\r\n[Spoilers below]\r\nThe second thing that bugged me about this story was the entire motivation behind the intense desire to save Kakeru. Let'sget the facts straight. In the original timeline, Kakeru was always depressed, wasn't part of any club, didn't have most of the sweet moments with the group, and so on. How did he become such an important person to them that they regretted it so much 10 years into the future that Suwa and Naho were willing to sacrifice their own lives together to save him?\\n\\n\r\nBut the most important thing that absolutely made no sense to me were the actions future Naho took. So basically she was open to sacrifice her life with Suwa and was ready to forsake their FUCKING KID to save this one dude whom she had a crush on for half a year of high school. Just try to wrap your head around that for a minute. Just made me personally feel bad for Suwa who is one the nicest characters written in anime. Of course, she could've structured her letter better to make sure that they all save Kakeru while still not sacrificing the relationship with Suwa. But yeah, no, that didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nPlaying the devil's advocate to myself here, maybe Naho and Suwa wouldn't have gotten together in the first place if it weren't for the death of Kakeru. So maybe she is not as senseless as I think she is. But still, just a pet peeve.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 5/10\\n\r\n--------------------\\n\r\nSuwa, the bro-est of all bros. He made the anime worth the watch along with Hagita, Asuza and that one tall girl. And this anime would've been a 10/10 if Hagita and Asuza were the two main MCs.\\n\\n\r\nAir-heads and bird-brained girls are a common anime troupe. Normally you'd expect these kind of characters to provide some comical relief along with another character in a relevant anime. But Naho here is so annoyingly dumb it was infuriating to watch.  Made me want to drop the anime around the middle. Can't really comment on the character of Kakeru because yeah, can't really relate or make an insensitive comment about a guy with suicidal tendencies. But then again, if I'm ever so inclined, I can definitely empathize with him, but he could've directed those frustrations a little better.\\n\\n\r\nBut again, Suwa, what a freaking strong and open-hearted character.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 8/10\\n\r\n-----------------\\n\r\nPretty good. Both the OP and ED fit in so well.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation - 8/10\\n\r\n-------------------\\n\r\nKinda went to shit in the middle but other than that, the style fit the theme of the show really well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Orange had the potential to be a true 10/10 anime that could've been hailed as a classic. But it got so many things wrong. However, it also got a couple of things right, mostly the friendship between the group. Maybe if they had removed the romance from the show and made it completely about friendship... it could've been something.\\n\\n\r\nOrange. Watch it for Suwa and the rest. \\n\\n\r\n...and why is it called Orange again?\\n\\n",

            "content": "Orange is a character-driven anime with weak characters. Yes, exactly.\r\nStory 5/10\r\nI have no issues with a far-fetched plot like that of Orange. The problem is when the creators try to rationally explain it. A melodramatic show like this already relies on emotion over logic, so why try to upset that balance? An even bigger issue would be the disappointing cast. As a character-driven anime, it is expected to have intriguing characters who can carry the show and enhance the plot. However, this was not the case for Orange, as the characters were terrible (They will be appropriately ripped apart in the \"Character\" section). \r\nArt 6/10\r\nIactually fairly enjoyed the early 2000s art style, which was interesting to see in 2016. Some of the still shots were very artistic, and the animation wasn't terrible, although static at times. Howbeit, the art quality steadily drops throughout the course of the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThe one piece that stood out for me was the ED, which was pleasant.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 1/10\\n\r\nThe characters could either have been the anime's saving grace or their Achilles' heel. The latter was certainly the case.\\n\\n\r\nNaho:\\n\r\nWhile watching her go about her everyday life, the question of whether it is humanly possible to have a negative IQ score has crossed my mind a few times. She seems to have only 2 purposes in life- to screw things up and to attend to Kakeru's every whim and fancy.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru:\\n\r\nThere was an attempt to explain Kakeru's selfish and self-loathing personality. However, it felt extremely contrived. This led to me not being able to view Kakeru as anything other than a total jerk.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa:\\n\r\nThe ultimate nice guy, Suwa is the MVP of this anime. We see him pull a Hachiman many times, always ending up with him holding the short end of the stick. He is the most developed character in Orange, but much more could be done.\\n\\n\r\nTakako, Hagita and Azusa:\\n\r\n You could call them Extras 1, 2 and 3, because I honestly wouldn't have noticed. They only serve to fill the spots and to even out the guy/girl ratio.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 2/10\\n\r\nI understand that I probably would have enjoyed Orange more if I was the target demographic. However, the mix of melodrama and crappy cast still feels like a tough pill to swallow.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10\\n\r\nAll in all, Orange was very disappointing.",

He is such a selfish... I don'teven wanna say. He only thinks about himself like he is the most pitiful person in the world. He doesn't consider other people feelings. All of them are putting so much effort and he just doesn't see it! Selfish! Even after everything, he still wants to commit suicide. Even after what everyone did and how much effort they exert just for him. Selfish! I should stop now, before i typed something really bad.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa Hiroto - He is listed as one of the best MC in anime history. He sacrificed a lot through the whole series. Even though his future (who he always wanted) might change, he still risks that chance just to erase Naho's regret. He's so understanding and so heart warming. He is always there for Naho and Kakeru. I appreciate all he'd done only for Naho and Kakeru's sake. I ship NahoxSuwa so much!\\n\\n\r\nTakamiya Naho - I personally don't like her to be with Kakeru.She conquers even her deepest fears just for Kakeru's sake. She's the kind of character who does everything and doesn't want anything in return. She's so understanding in Kakeru's tantrums. She value everyone's time and she doesn't wanna bother her friends so much. In this series, i put my hands up for Naho's determination.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\n10/10\\n\r\nWell, what more can I say.

            "content": "Ok guys I will keep this short and hope I can influence your decision of whether to watch or not watch this series.\r\nSo, Orange is a story about a really sad guy whose wife is in love with a dead person and tries to change the past to get the dead guy back while still being married and acting as if she loves him. Sad guy truly. But the writers kind of ignores the guy and shows him as somewhat of a side character. So I guess not about the sad nice guy apparently.\r\nAnyway so the story has a time travel kind of feel toit as can be understood through the synopsis. The artwork is light and hence, has a sad and happy feel to it. It's easy on the eyes. The voice actors suit the character designs perfectly. It's like when you see a person and think he/she should sound like this, here, they do. Right now I am at the latest episode and the story line seems to progress pretty well. Though the story is a bit generic shoujo, the differentiating component being the time letter.\\n\r\nThe story is about the struggles of Naho (Main Character Female) to make sense of the letter that she has received from her future self and somehow save Kakeru. I will not disclose what he has to be saved from as it might act as a spoiler. She is able to follow some of the instructions, others she is not and some barely. It is a journey to save the guy she is truly in love with.\\n\r\nMain thing I liked about the series is that they have managed to cover the loop holes and inconsistencies that are talked about when we talk about a series concerning time travel. I will not go into details of this so as not to give you guys spoilers. You probably might start wondering why the contents of the letter don't change as the MC girl (Naho) changes the past thus altering the future. This is explained in the series which made me like the series more.\\n\r\nDefinitely a give it a try series. A very well thought out series I would say.\\n\r\nPS. The sad guy is a very likeable character. This might sound gay but I am falling in love with the character of Suwa.",

            "content": "{SPOILER FREE REVIEW}\r\nBit of background before I begin, not entirely related to the anime. Feel free to skip this paragraph and head to the review. I was looking forward to this anime for a while because of this recent shojo addiction. I was going to New York City in June and I watched about an hour and twenty minutes of the live action movie on the flight. It was actually very good and I recommend that you watch that movie instead of the anime. Not that this anime is bad.\r\nSo. Orange. What we have here is what seems to be a shojo with a timetravelling twist. What it actually is, is a very generic shojo with a time travelling twist that seems to disguise the usual shojo story. When I say \"generic\" shojo I'm talking about almost every single shojo trope being checked off. \\n\\n\r\n* Pretty lead who can't do wrong, check.\\n\r\n* Athletic love interest, check.\\n\r\n* Cute friends, check.\\n\r\n* Mean girl enemy, check.\\n\r\n* Catches the eye of the hottest guy in school, check.\\n\\n\r\nThe list goes on. The strange thing about this is that it isn't really a bad anime, especially if you like shojo. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY - 5\\n\\n\r\nI give this story a 5 because I think it tries. It tries to go beyond (plus ultra!) the usual shojo story. Our lead, Naho, receives a letter from a version of herself in the future that states her deepest regret; being unable to save the life of a friend. It contains instructions on how to prevent this from happening. During the course of the show, she tries to save him and falls in love with him. I mean it's shojo so of course love is going to play a part. A huge issue I have with this is that it never, in thirteen episodes, shows any indication that Kakeru (the friend who has died in the future) is special. It portrays him as a pretty normal and average person who is depressed. I didn't dislike him, but there was no real reason that Naho would like him either. He has nothing to offer and her interactions with him seem forced and awkward. I enjoyed that they took time out to discuss parallel worlds, and that does excuse time travel issues. It is an easy and foolish mistake to leave this out so props on Telecom for keeping this in because time travel shows fall apart without the time travel being understood by the audience. There are a few other issues I had with the plot, hence the rating, but they would be spoiler territory so not for this review.\\n\\n\r\nART - 7\\n\\n\r\nI have to confess bias; I love anime art. The bright colours, the funky hair, the details that are put into still frames (and it's anime so there are tons). Nothing special about this art. Nothing bad about it either. The colour of the high school blazers was a forest green and that was the colour of one of my rival schools when I was in high school, eh. Take this part of the rating with a grain of salt due to my love for anime art.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 8\\n\\n\r\nI loved the opening and ending tracks. I don't think I skipped either more than once or twice when I was binge watching eight or nine episodes in a row. During the show itself, the sound isn't memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS - 4\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the show failed dismally. None of the characters are memorable besides Suwa. Let me list the others, bear in mind that these characters have absolutely no character development.\\n\\n\r\n* Naho - Mary Sue protagonist who is cute and awkward\\n\r\n* Kakeru - Depressed teenage boy\\n\r\n* Hagita - Nerdy friend\\n\r\n* Azusa - She's the cute friend, parents run a bakery\\n\r\n* Takako - Tomboy. That's literally her entire character.\\n\\n\r\nNot really a bad group, but not interesting either. They exist to basically push Naho and Kakeru together. But it's ultimately Suwa who does everything until literally the last scene in the last episode. He's the soccer star with a heart of gold. He cares about everyone and it's obvious that he's into Naho, but when he sees she likes someone else he steps aside to support her happiness. He's kind and compassionate and invites a lonely new kid to hang out with them. It blows my mind that Naho didn't like Suwa before this, although it's hinted that she does due to the scenes set in the future world. But that just makes it stranger that she somehow became enamoured with Kakeru even though there was a latent attraction to Suwa. Nine times out of ten, Suwa is the hero in a shojo love story. This was one of the nine times, he was the hero. Just not the love interest. But this is a story about dealing with mistakes from your past, not about romance.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 8\\n\\n\r\nThis had some very sad moments, and if you've ever been depressed it's going to hit you hard in the tear ducts. I like that sort of thing, and this section of the reviews are always the most subjective. \"Enjoyment\". Sometimes anime that is very boring to some will be very appealing to others. This is not a clone of anything the way God Eater was with Shingeki no Kyojin, definitely not. But with the success of Boku Dake ga Inai Machi, I knew we'd get some time travelling anime in the next few seasons and this is one of them.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL - 7\\n\\n\r\nIt was 8 but I changed it to 7. I recommend this because I enjoyed it, but I recommend the live action movie first.",

            "content": "Late to review but whatever...\r\nMy grips with with the melodramatic show lead me to drop it harder than Maho's  (I think that's her name) thick as hell skull and her problematic shyness. I say problematic because she puts \"I can't do it\" over Kurururkeos life multiple times! The show parades this character as the moral high ground, so cute she must be cuddled and given affection at all times could her widdle hearts breaks to easily, she's like a lost and crying child half the time. Listen, as a person who has a hard time taking to even a MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE, if it meantthat a friend was going to die if I didn't, I'd hike up my skirt AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!\\n\\n\r\nA scene that pissed me off so much was when kueerkeuos first girlfriend passed Moho, her bag hit her, and she fell like a stuffed animal. Everyone is supposed to feel sorry for her and hate hottie because she's \"the other girl\" while Moahoa is perfect and modest... fuck off. \"The other girl\" was nice to her this whole time before Kuororor broke up with her (and even during that time people were judging her because her life affects them sooo much) and now we gotta have a villain - lets make the hot \"other girl\" such an awful person now because as I said \"she's the other girl who's hot and popular\" and make her attack Maoho specifically to victimize her further. Stop that, just because she has a more forward personality with a more cared for look shouldn't make her a villain to which the show did anyways.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters have a personality of a brick; bread girl is spunky, black haired girl is spooky, blond haired boy is blond hair boy because nothing about him is memorable, and the not annoying, best boy, red haired character, is cucked. \\n\\n\r\nAs the target demographic for this show, I couldn't keep watching. I feel as though its biggest draw back is it's main focus on one character, and the most poorly written character. Maybe if they looked into other character's perspective it could have been more interesting to watch, but its bad narrative is a no for me.",

            "content": "Orange has been one of the most hyped and anticipated show of the summer.I first heard of the show back in january.Apparently the manga has a very big decorated and devoted fanbase.But I am not here to talk about the Manga,The question is how good is the anime.\r\nWithout spoiling to much,Orange is about a group of friends who sends letters to their younger selves to prevent a certain accident from happening which they had to burden for the rest of their lives.\r\nOrange is undoubtedly one of the best slice of life anime of recent memory.From the first episode,everything works.From The beautifully rendered setup to it'sclever script,everything adds up to a very nice experience.It's one of those show that asks it's viewers to put faith in them and if you do agree to put your faith in their story you'll be rewarded with a fantastic experience.In recent memory two other shows tried to do something similar.Those two shows are Erased and Relife.Orange accomplishes what both those shows failed to do.It establishes geniune character motivation and indepth character development.This show magnificently portraits,just because you know what's gonna happen in the future doesn't change the fact that you have to face the present.\\n\r\nIn terms of flaws,I guess the animation quality was really inconsistent and for a story that is so close to heart,it should've had far better music composing but my biggest issue with the series is it's time traveling mechanism.I think it would've been better not to explore it.Just imagine if movies like It's a wonderful life or Ruby Sparks tried to explain their weird other worldly things,would it work?no.They shouldn't have tried to explain it.\\n\r\nAs for the show itself, while there were many dips in animation quality, poorly explained time-travel mechanic that should've been left a mystery, and really irritating characters at times, I'm happy that the show ended the way it did. The ending reminds us of the real purpose of the story: Even if you know the future, changing your innate personality and making the right choices is hard. However, if you don't give your best effort, then in the end you will be left with regret over what \"could have been\". The ending saved the show for me by reminding me what it's really about, while also hitting very close to home.It's a very solid show with great starting a very well thought out middle act and a strong ending.",

I was left verysatisfied with the ending, and I enjoyed myself the entire time I was watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 9/10: The art in this anime was beautiful. There was some amazing scenery, and I loved how colorful certain parts of this show were. They did a great job portraying emotions through facial expressions, and the art, along with the story, which almost moved me to tears toward the end. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10/10: As previously mentioned, the characters in this anime grow to care for each other, and their relationships grow and change throughout the story. I was able to relate to the majority of what the main characters went through in this anime, and I think that the characters were implemented beautifully.",

            "content": "Orange is an adaptation of a manga of the same name. A manga that was hyped to high heavens but seemed to have been quickly forgotten not too long afterwards... The anime had a similar fate and I think I know why.\r\nThis review will contain spoilers throughout.\r\nThis story is about a married 26 year old mother who found a way to send a letter to her past self from 10 years earlier, in an attempt to fix her regret and save a male friend of hers (who also happened to be a potential love interest) from committing suicide around that time. Of course, anybody withhalf a brain cell would think this is a bad idea since that may result in her aborting her own baby, not having her current husband and potentially leaving her with a boyfriend who commits suicide - not to mention countless other bad things that may happen as a result of her messing around with time..\\n\\n\r\nBut she doesn't need to worry about any of that, Why? because changing the past is only going to create a parallel universe with a different set of events.. I mean who cares about those people, am I right? They're not us. And how is she so sure that that's how time travel works you ask? well, because her teacher said so, duh.\\n\\n\r\nI also love how her 16 year old self reads the letter she receives piece by piece, day after day, depending on the date of the page she's reading instead of reading the entire letter at once because she's \"too afraid to read ahead\", but not too afraid to see events written in a letter unfold before her very eyes. She definitely knows a thing or two about screen writing since that way of reading the letter makes the series last twice as long as it should and fill the episode count.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a nitpicking asshole aside, I'm only doing this because the story and characters aren't good enough to distract me from all that..\\n\\n\r\nNone of the characters are fully fleshed out, none of them have any long term goals, their personal lives are non existent and irrelevant including the lives of the main ones, who are so fixated through out the entire show on the potential suicide committer, to the point where they don't feel like independent individuals but just puppets of their future selves. Just stop and try imagining these characters without the main driving force that puts this story in to motion: which is the suicidal ticking time bomb, Kakeru. You can't, they'd just be empty husks.\\n\r\nThe interactions between them are made up of banal dialogue, lots of smiles and laughing at things that aren't funny to the point it becomes embarrassing to watch and makes their chemistry feel fake and artificial rather than being heartwarming as it's intended.\\n\\n\r\nHell, even the traits they do have aren't really shown to us through their actions and are largely communicated by telling us about these traits. We're told that the MC, Naho is good at housework but we never really see her doing that aside from that one time she made lunch or another time she made chocolate. She spends the rest of her screentime obsessing over Kakeru and that's pretty much it, she has no character arc to speak of. And the same goes for the rest of the cast, they're defined by one characteristic (Saku is the nerdy one, Takako is the tomboy etc') and they spend the first half of the show just going about their lives, pretending to be ignorant about Kakeru's fate - all for the sake of a revelation midway that they also received letters from their future selves - followed by them obsessing over Kakeru for the rest of the show as well. In hindsight, I don't see why or how none of them did anything extremely different in the first half of the show once they learned about Kakeru's fate, the events all took place as the letters said they would despite everyone knowing that Kakeru's going to die?? \\n\r\nI guess the author figured this story needs to have some revelation midway even if it makes little sense. \\n\\n\r\nHeck, even Kakeru who's the emotional center of this story is lacking. While he's a more well rounded character than the rest for sure since he actually has a character arc, and his dilemma matches the core theme of the series which is regret and whether or not it's worth worrying about - since he blames himself for his mother's suicide - just like his friends who regret his suicide in the future and blame themselves for not doing enough to stop him (as if the parallel could be more obvious).  Still, The info we get about him is quite minimal too. We're supposed to be invested in his sadness and feelings of regret about his mother, but it's only near the end of the series where we actually get to see what his life was like with her, and even then it gets less than a minute of screentime and right away it is revealed that his mother's suicide was not Kakeru's fault in an emotional climax... once again it's this series' tendency to tell a lot more than it shows.\\n\\n\r\nAnd so the show ends with Kakeru almost committing suicide but regretting it in the last second because he remembered the happy times he spent with his friends (thanks to the letters from the future) which is the only moment of pathos in this entire series and made it worth sitting through.\\n\r\nWith that being said, I'd also like to point out that I'm not sure what this series is trying to say about regret.. Is it worth worrying about it or not? I'm not sure because they've succeeded in their mission of stopping Kakeru's suicide thanks to the power of time travel, while at the same time, the series is also saying that Kakeru should stop being sad about his own regret with a bait and switch, by making his mom turn out to be a saint despite being demonized for the entire show.. Kind of a mixed message, but whatever. \\n\\n\r\nSo then Naho hooks up with Kakeru and her future husband, Hiroto is unrealistically ok with that because he's too bland to care. Besides, it's the last episode, there's no time for another conflict. To be fair we did see him conflicted about this issue on a few occasions, but as you can see it went nowhere and didn't matter in the long run.\\n\r\nAnd it also seems that they've really created a parallel universe since their future selves stayed in the same situation, no babies were aborted and they all lived happily ever after... \\n\r\nTHE END.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah the story and characters are quite bad.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, both the visuals and sound in the show are quite nice. Visually you have these nice semi realistic looking backgrounds, lots of extreme wide shots to compliment them, good color contrast and careful attention to where characters are located on screen in every given shot in order to communicate the most emotion out of every one of them.\\n\r\nIn terms of animation however it isn't that great, lot's of motions look clunky and not all that smooth. And while the characters have fairly good shoujo designs, their expressions can get a little creepy looking, especially when they smile it looks more like they're being blinded by the sun.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of music and voice acting, everything seems on point, but not especially memorable either, aside from one track or two or one scene or two of great 'character acting'.\\n\\n\r\nSo there you have it, a show with bland characters, a stupid premise, a lot more telling than showing and a boring as hell story about trying to cheer up a depressed kid for the entire run-time. \\n\r\nWith all that said, I'd be lying if I claimed that I don't see why this anime and manga were so successful - it's a genius formula of a shoujo romance mixed seamlessly with a layer of tension and time travel. What more could you ask for?\\n\\n\r\nThe most disappointing thing about this adaptation is that they hired an actual great director - Hamasaki Hiroshi, a director known for cool cinematography and creating works that successfully do 'show don't tell' (Texhnolyze, Shigurui, Steins Gate, Terraformars), unlike this show that does mostly the opposite and asks you to have the feels.",

The characters are so well-written and cute, you'll love almost all of them. The chemistry between characters as students is perfect, but between lovers, not as good. The only reason I didn't give Character column a 10/10 is because of how unlovableKakeru (the 2nd main character) is.\\n\r\nThe whole story goes around him, but as a character, it just feels wrong.\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment 9/10]\\n\r\nIt's an enjoyable anime.

But I liked this, shockingly.\r\nPerhaps because one thing it was missing was the cringy \"comedy\" that most animes have. It might look good in some genres, but it does not befit sad stories like this and YLIA. This anime had this feel-good thing going onalmost in every episode, and I did not find ti out of place at all.\\n\r\nThe pain Kakeru carries with him everyday hits way too close to home. The anime does not show that his depression has been cured, but only that he has taken a step towards seeing a future for himself. Hence, I think a lot of the complaints are unjustified. But to each, their own.\\n\r\nOverall, I can see the many flaws this anime has, and yet, I give it a 9/10 for the tears it made me shed.",

            "content": "Short and sweet review. Do you know what to expect from romance anime and are tired of people pointing out the \"genre stereotypes\" and then judging the anime only around that? Just want to know the important stuff and if you should watch it ? I've got you covered.\r\nOrange is one of those romances that I put off for a while because it has that always random \"supernatural\" tag on it. Supernatural mixed in with romance is always very hit or miss with me personally, falling more on the miss side. However, Orange had an intriguing premise so I put it on my watch listanyway.\\n\\n\r\nBasically the entire premise of the show is that a girl in the future somehow manages to send letters to her past self giving details about a friend dying. The letters detail all the important days they think contributed to their friend's death, complete with notes on what she would like her past self to change in order to try to prevent the death of the friend. That intrigued me because it wasn't a story- line I had heard of before, especially in a romance/school show.\\n\\n\r\nThe show itself, if it wasn't for the letters and the supernatural aspect, would be a pretty standard school romance show. But with the addition of the main female character's knowledge of future events and her attempts to change the past with that information, it becomes an interesting show. The characters are all very good, and are easily the best part. The story is original thanks to the addition of the supernatural element, and thanks to the dynamic between the supernatural elements and the characters, the show can really tug at your heart.\\n\\n\r\nMy issue with it isn't really a specific thing. Mostly my overall enjoyment of the show, despite a mostly happy ending and progress that is made both in the romances and the character's development, was lower than I expected. I think this was due to the fact that, even though you are watching these characters try to change their past, there is a story detail I will leave out that just makes everything they accomplish not really mean as much overall. And while there is a good deal of progress in the romance side of things, more and better outcomes come to side characters than the main ones. Really I found myself a bit depressed and overall kinda wishing I hadn't even bothered once it was over, just because it was such a debby downer kinda show. They also deal with some really heavy topics. That wasn't a bad thing, I love deep shows, but that combined with the overall downer nature of the story/ending really makes it a depressing show in the end. This was a weird one for me.\\n\\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS: Great characters, actual romance developments (especially by side characters), interesting supernatural plot point,  nice art, interesting story\\n\\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENTS: Debby downer anime, depressing/deep topics can lead to overall less enjoyment, ending wasn't very satisfying despite it being a \"positive\" ending.",

This is where the anime shines. It shows us developed characters and the outcomes and then tries to change the present while not actually going out of it's way and maintaining the core personalities so even if a lettertells them to do something, if it's too outrageous, it's not going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nOverally I liked the visuals and the sounds, mostly just the story made it for me since it seemed really unique and I haven't seen anything like that before. I'm also not that big of a fan of slice of life so this really was a big surprise for me in a good way.\\n\\n\r\nBut you can watch my more indepth review on it on YouTube. My channel is MudanTV and I spent like over 15 hours making the Orange review on there so I'd be happy if you'd check it out.",

            "content": "Orange is one of those shows with the potential to become an instant classic, but it ultimately falls short and succumbs to every shoujo cliche imaginable while basking in melodrama.\r\nNaho, the protagonist, is exceptionally bland and probably the least interesting character in the show. She's shy, clumsy, and very sweet, but has no personality whatsoever. Throughout the 13 episodes, we never really learn about her goals, what she likes, or what she wants for herself. Instead, Naho spends literally every minute of her time trying to save a boy she loves from committing suicide. This show kind of sends a toxic message that I seein way too many series for young women--that it's normal to sacrifice your own well-being for the sake of someone else who needs professional help.\\n\\n\r\nI stuck with the series because I loved Suwa and the other friends in the group. Orange does have some funny and genuinely heart-warming moments, but they're overshadowed by Naho and Kakeru's incredibly slow-burning relationship. It can get frustrating when there is such an emphasis on the awkward and overdramatic moments between these two when that time could've been spent developing the characters or creating more subplots. At one point, someone mentions how messing with the past could affect other people or events in the future, but the conversation stops there. It would've been interesting if the show had explored that more.\\n\\n\r\nI'll try to keep this short, so, is this series worth watching? I would say sure, but you're not really missing anything if you don't see it. I put this on before bed and it was a nice, calming thing to watch, but I couldn't help but think about how great it could've been with a little more effort. Orange is just another show that could've been amazing, but it checked off its boxes and didn't strive to be a truly memorable series.",

            "content": "Many people think about orange as being not unique, To cliche or overly dramatized and it looks like they sometimes forget to look at if the anime really was fun to watch instead of hating it from the first episode on because its not unique enough or whatever. Is orange overly dramatized? Maybe, Yes, But thats what made orange so good for me. I used to really love clannad but i think by now orange has made its way higher then clannad because its simply such a beautifull & sad story. when things make me sad/cry a lot, i think that show deserves my ratingfor acomplishing to influence me and let me feel different. From the hilarious higata to the cute naho and the sad kakeru to the sweetest guy you'll ever see, suwa. Simply every character has his own perfect side and the picture of the group together just fits so well to the story. Orange is packed with the best drama ive ever seen, includes great characters, comedy, Love and a short but really well enjoyed story. The balance between the loved ones is so well done, it just keeps making you happy and sad every episode. I love it when shows influence my emotions by making such a great anime and thats really for me one of the biggest reasons i rate a 10, the drama. I still have to watch 2 episodes but it already deserved my 10 rating at episode 3. Thanks for reading my short review, hope some of you can use this as motivation to watch orange!",

            "content": "Orange. This show seems to be a hit or miss, and I guess it missed me. Orange tackles some very interesting topics (Suicide and depression) but it loses steam quickly. My issue with it is that KAKERU is the one experiencing depression. KAKERU is the one who wants to kill himself and end the pain. Instead we get to watch Naho's insecurity and hesitation, even though she knows the freaking future. Naho becomes more and more unbearable with every episode, reaching a peak at around episode 10. At that point I honestly wished she herself would commit suicide and the show would match Kakeru withSuwa.\\n\\n\r\nInstead of going through the categories I'm going to quickly explain why I rated this show a 6. Based on my previous paragraph this show earns maybe a 3. The reason it's a 6 is because, despite Naho, this show was interesting. The side characters were fun and developed \"well\" or at least much much better than Naho. Kakeru was relatable and interesting to watch. Although the mechanics of the time travelling letter wasn't explained well (It shouldnt even have been mentioned at all but whatever) it was fun to see which events changed the future and how it impacted it from a technical standpoint. Naho is the only truly \"bad\" thing in this show, but unfortunately she is an important chunk of the show.",

            "content": "We see many shoujo romance anime and manga that don\u2019t attempt to do anything different with its premise. Very few of them end up doing something different. Orange attempts to do something different with the shoujo romance genre as it takes a more science-fictional and dramatic take. Adding a time-travel and suicide-victim factor to the story and focusing on themes like depression and regret, makes this one of the most original shoujo series out there, even if the execution itself can be a little wonky. Though it may not be as good as its manga counterpart, the anime manages to be one of the betteranime of the season.\\n\\n\r\n~{Story}~\\n\r\nThe premise is basically about a girl who gets a letter from her future self that says that she needs to save a new transfer student from an accident by changing up the past. The story revolves around how the girl and her friends befriend the transfer student and make him not have any regrets. Like most shoujo anime, this series has a very heavy emphasis on romance. The main focus of the series is on the romantic relationship between the protagonist, Naho, and the transfer student, Kakeru. However, the story also focuses on Kakeru\u2019s friendship with the rest of the main cast. Overall, the story is handled pretty well throughout. The first half of the series doesn\u2019t do much to advance the plot, but rather it focuses on the characters. The second half adds more to the story as many plot points get revealed. If there was one thing I was disappointed in, that would be the explanation they gave for how the letter was sent to the past. It\u2019s ridiculous and unbelievable, even when considering the story as pure fiction. But that wasn\u2019t the main focus of the series to begin with, so it doesn\u2019t affect the series as a whole that much.\\n\r\nStory: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Presentation}~\\n\r\nThe thing about Orange is that it\u2019s pretty well-directed, yet it never feels as impactful as the manga. Things like the cinematography and the lighting is done really well and adds more to the mood of the series. And unlike most shoujo series, it manages to blend its lighthearted jokes into its drama (although Orange doesn\u2019t have much humor to begin with). However, despite all that, the series never really feels effective in conveying its emotions. Many of the emotional moments might just fly past you because its themes aren\u2019t organized to well. More could\u2019ve been done with its theme of regret and it feels like a lot of the opportunities were lost. And the pacing is rather inconsistent too. The first third and last third\u2019s pacing could\u2019ve been a little faster so that the second third wouldn\u2019t feel too rushed. But the biggest inconsistency out of all of them is definitely the production values. But that will be covered later on in the review. But at least almost everything was adapted from the manga, so it was loyal to a degree. But its emotional impact remains lackluster when compared to the manga.\\n\r\nPresentation: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Character}~\\n\r\nOrange features a somewhat large cast of main characters. The protagonist, Takamiya Naho, is a somewhat decent main character, but she can be a little annoying at times. Not always does she follow her letters has she finds some things too hard to do. Though some of her behavior is reasonable, but she does it so often that it feels too irritating. Due to this, her character lacks a proper growth and it never feels like she\u2019s changed much as a character. The transfer student, Naruse Kakeru, is a pretty well written and believable character. Though some of his actions may seem a bit rude and selfish, when his inner thoughts are properly explored, and when his way of thinking is apperent, his actions feel more justified. The choices he makes are wrong, but he\u2019s not wrong himself. Naho and Kakeru\u2019s friend, Suwa Hiroto, is a great character. Not only is he such a great guy, but he\u2019s also selfless and doesn\u2019t care whether he doesn\u2019t gain anything as long as others do. He is easily the most likable character of the series. Another likable character who is part of the group, Hagita Saku, is actually pretty funny and is used as a comic relief pretty well. The other two main characters, Azusa and Takako are alight, but they don\u2019t play a huge role in the story. \\n\r\nCharacter: 5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Art}~\\n\r\nWhen Orange is at its best, it\u2019s really, really beautiful. The backgrounds are simply stunning and gorgeous. They are easily the best backgrounds I\u2019ve seen this year. The bright colors really work well with this series. And the character designs are really good and are very well detailed. As mentioned before, the lighting is put into good use and is very effective. This would have easily been one of the best looking anime of the year, until the second half happened. The drop in the art quality was slowly becoming apparent in the second half. The ninth episode was one of the most ugliest episodes I\u2019ve seen this season, and that\u2019s saying a lot when Berserk was airing in the same season. The backgrounds still looked good though, but the character models looked atrocious in some places. The art improved near the end, but it looked nowhere near as good as the first half of the series. \\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Animation}~\\n\r\nUnlike the art of Orange, where it started off great and then quality drops happened, the animations of Orange weren\u2019t as fluid since the first episode. The backgrounds however are animated nicely and look good. But some of the character movements lacked a bit of smoothness at times. Though this was apparent later on in the series. There\u2019s one moment somewhere in the last couple of episodes where some characters are walking along a path and we see them from far away behind them. Their moments looked like as if they were sliding along the path, and it felt very distracting. But for the most part, the animations are functional and are alright. \\n\r\nAnimation: 5.5/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Voice Acting}~\\n\r\nThe seiyuu cast did a fairly well job in Orange. The cast itself is mixed with well-known and not so well-known seiyuu. The extremely popular and really talented seiyuu, Hanazawa Kana, does a really good job with Naho. She does what the script asks her to do. She doesn\u2019t do too much with her character, but she does just enough for her character to work. Kakeru\u2019s seiyuu, Yamashita Seiichirou, hasn\u2019t done much in his career yet, but he did an excellent job with his character. He conveys his character\u2019s feelings and emotions properly. Furukawa Makoto, who\u2019s now really well-known for doing Saitama from One Punch Man, did a very good job as Suwa and makes his feel like a true bro. Okitsu Kazuyuki did a good job as his megane character, Hagita, and he gets his comic timing right. Takamori Natsumi and Kinugawa Rika does a fairly good job as their characters too. \\n\r\nVoice Acting: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Music}~\\n\r\nThe music in Orange is really good and is one of the series highlights. The OP, \u201cHikari no Hahen\u201d, is fairly good. The vocals and music is nice and the song matches the series. But the ED, \u201cMirai\u201d, is fantastic. Not only is the vocals and music amazing, but the lyrics are good too. It really has an emotional feel to it and it\u2019s the perfect ED for this series. The ED made me feel more emotional that the actual series did. The background music in the series is also very good. The music used more the emotional scenes are good, but they don\u2019t add too much to the scene. And the music used for its normal moments are pretty good too and work well. \\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\\n\r\n~{Enjoyment}~\\n\r\nThough I was hoping more from this series, especially since I really liked the manga, but it was still a good anime that\u2019s one of the best of the season. The characters, for the most part are handled well. Suwa and Hagita were definitely fun to see. The art, when it was at its best, looked gorgeous and the anime is worth watching just for that. The backgrounds especially were amazing. I really liked how Kakeru was handled and near the end of the series, I really understood how he felt and made most of his actions justifiable. I would\u2019ve enjoyed the series more if the production value drops weren\u2019t so drastic. \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Orange is worth checking out for those who want to see something new in the shoujo romance genre. Though, if you have already read the manga, you\u2019re better off not watching this adaptation. Even if you haven\u2019t read the manga, if you can, try reading the manga instead of watching the adaptation. Though the adaptation is loyal, the emotional aspect of the manga isn\u2019t properly conveyed in the anime and feels lacking. And the sudden production value drop is jarring and distracting. But this is a really good story about regret and depression and it handles most of its characters pretty well. Even with the adaptation being not as good as we were hoping it to be, Orange is still one of the better anime of the season.\\n\\n\r\n+ A nice story focusing on a group of people who wants their friend to have no regrets. \\n\r\n+ Nice and unique take on the shoujo romance genre.\\n\r\n+ Kakeru\u2019s perspective is handled well and Suwa and Hagita are really likable characters. \\n\r\n+ Background music is very good and the ED is fantastic.\\n\r\n- Very inconsistent production values as the art quality dips mid-way in the series. \\n\r\n- Emotional moments aren\u2019t as effective as they should be and feels lacking when compared to the manga.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.3/10",

The other characters are mainly supportive and characters you'll like more than the main two lol.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I liked the beginning of the anime, but then it really went bad. It did not do the manga justice. The manga definitely made the characters unique without over-exaggerating them. In conclusion, read the manga instead.",

            "content": "I'm just reading the other reviews about Orange, and around 70% are giving it a 5 or lower. Now I'm sitting here wondering what could possibly be going on in those people's lives that makes them rate such a good show such a low score?\r\nLet's start with the plot. I really liked the story (9/10) because of two things. One, time travel is a theme that is hard to nail. There are films that do horribly because they do nothing to explain it. There are films that receive mixed reviews because they over-explain it (Interstellar). And then there are films that don't overload you withthe science while including a basic explanation to allow the story to flow. Do I 100% understand how the letters were sent back? Of course not, because no one does. However, I think Orange explained their version of time travel well enough to not have viewers nitpick at it. They elaborated enough so that it doesn't have to be the main emphasis of the anime. Actually this transitions really well into my second point. The main emphasis of Orange is actually not on the concept of time travel (*what really? I didn't know that...*) but rather on the selflessness of friends and what friends will do to continue being friends. MC Naho receives a letter from the future and tries to save her friend and crush's life. How selfless can you get? I understand that some of her actions were pretty stupid, but then again, this is a school slice of life anime. Everybody makes mistakes, everybody has those days. But how Orange wove in the events in the letters and how they changed in the present was so masterfully done that I had to rate the story a 9.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of Orange was pretty good (8/10). Made from the same studio as Ao Haru Ride, it's not exactly the type of conventional art style we think of when we hear the word \"anime\", but I think it would've been a hindrance if it were to be animated in how most of us are used to seeing anime. Orange is a softer anime and the art definitely contributed to that effect.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack, by itself, is very good (8/10). I'm now listening to Kobukuro thanks to Orange's ending. Mirai (the ending song) has a really soft timbre and provides the feels train with electricity. Whenever I hear those first ascending notes in the ending, I get goosebumps. Hikari no Hahen, the opening song, is pretty much the average for any serious high school show. Guitars, lighthearted vocals, and standard drumming, it just screams \"mainstream slice of life right here!\" Apart from the opening and ending, the sounds in the actual anime aren't bad - they contribute to the scene sometimes, but other times they are just annoying.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is where Orange really takes the W (10/10). First of all, Naho is a social dandere and makes for an annoying MC sometimes, due to her inability to make the right decisions, but it's cute when she gets it right. I mean, you have a letter from the future to tell you what to do right, but she ignores some of it, or even follows it to the letter (heh) and that just ticks me off sometimes. Kakeru is a solid character - he blames himself for his mother's death and near the end, shuts himself out from his friends thinking that he's hurting them. How sweet can you get... I mean, he's the one hurting the most, but he doesn't want to burden others, what a sympathetic character. I can't really say I feel for him since my parents are alive and well, but it's understandable why he acts the way he does. Suwa is a really strong character, both in the physical sense and the emotional sense. He is supportive, and is ready to take on any challenge. He doesn't really change throughout the show, but he's reliable and probably the smartest out of the whole bunch, which is funny considering he's also the jock in the group. He sacrifices his own love life for Naho and Kakeru's. That's called selflessness and taking one for the team. Takako is just Takako, not really an interesting character, she's just there. Now we get interesting. Azusa is the outgoing girl of the group, and she's the one who usually plays matchmaker. Everyone likes her, and if she wasn't in the show, Orange would get bland very quickly. My favourite character, Hagita, is the nerdy and seemingly pessimistic of the bunch. He's quite the tsundere and is portrayed to have a crush on Azusa. Actually, he's married to her in the future. He acts as the comedic relief, often ignored and made fun of, but he has as much of an importance on the story as everyone else. After all, he's the one who broke Kakeru's bike to protect him. He's the best.\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment factor of Orange was off the charts (10/10). Often, I would go through the weekdays wishing for Sunday to come to watch Orange on Kissanime. If it detracts my attention from my work and captivates me when I'm watching, I can't see how it deserves anything less than a 10 for enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Orange received a 9 from me, because of its successful characters and plot. For all you reviewers who gave Orange a five or lower, I would *strongly* insist that you reconsider.",

            "content": "Quite like orange juice, I couldn't make it through this show without gin. The basic premise of Orange is that a 26 year woman named Naho Takamiya sends a letter to herself ten years in the past, in order to prevent the several mistakes she made including some that she believes caused the suicide of her love interest name Kakeru. It's pretty predictable from this premise alone that the show had the potential to turn out to be simple wish fulfillment garbage, and unfortunately that seems to be the case. That isn't that say I didn't go into it with an open mind that is,as I knew nothing of the show going in to it, so don't give me any of that crap.\\n\\n\r\nThe real problem with Orange is that it expects you to care about it's characters, but never really makes any effort to make them likeable or well developed. All of them can essentially be broken down to their single defining characteristics, there is even one amusingly unaware scene towards the end of episode three, in which one of the characters starts describing all the others essentially using these singular traits. Naho is kind and helpful, though a much simpler summary of her character can be put into one word 'doormat'. Kakeru is your typical love interest, dark and brooding, his total lack of personality makes it impossible to see what Naho sees in him beyond his appearance, and the same can be said of his attraction to Naho. All the other characters have almost no bearing on the plot making them completely forgettable and not even worth noting. Times in which one would think the show would try and develop its character is instead spent upon lazy montages or creating repetitive drama merely for the sake of it. Because of this the show fails to engage its audience in its plot as it is almost entirely character driven. Why should one care that Kakeru commits suicide or has mommy issues, if the show tells us almost nothing about him as a character, he also goes from unlikable to downright hateable as the show goes own, which I wont go into for the sake of spoilers, though I'll standby that he acts irredeemably selfish.\\n\\n\r\nAnother glaring issue is the casts and especially Naho's utter and constant stupidity which is the cause of the vast majority of the drama throughout the show, making it unbearably frustrating to sit through. Naho rarely tries to solve her issues in the most straight forward and logical manner, it feels as if she isn't making her choices based on her past experiences or her personality, but more that she is acting in such a way because the show needs the plot to move from point A to point B. Despite the characters actions causing an unnecessary amount of melodrama, for the most part it usually resolved within a few episodes, as if the show is dancing around what little plot it actually has, so it ends up feeling like a complete waste of time. \\n\\n\r\nOther than that the show is unimpressive in both its animation and audio quality which also gradually decline in quality as the show progresses, so it really has nothing going for it. There are also many smaller issues such as Naho never reading ahead in the letter and the shows baffling attempt to explain away the time travel, I'd go on, how ether I don't have the time nor the patience to go through them all. Overall the show is at its best boring, and at worst teeth grindingly frustrating, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. \\n",

This is a story of hope and healing more than anything else. As someone who has lost another, this anime hits deep. I have never cried so much to an anime, or any show or movie on that note. But please do not let that stop you from watching this. Sure it has the basis of a cute shoujo - Boy and Girl meet then fall in love. But it is VERY DIFFERENT. I wouldn't exactly list this assci-fi, more a fantasy, but this is the most unique plot of a drama anime I've ever seen. \\n\\n\r\n(this paragraph contains spoilers)\\n\r\nRevolving around a boy struggling through both a recent family loss and resulting depression, his new friend group come together to help him appreciate being alive. His friends however are receiving help from a group of people who have lost an important friend - their future/parallel timeline selves. Though there are two futures in this anime, but I truly enjoyed both. Kakeru and Nahu, and Hiroto and Nahu. Both are great matches yet I believe everyone is happiest in the Kakeru and Nahu pairing as not only is their close friend still alive, Hirotos two best friends are happiest. I think Kakeru is a good depiction of someone suffering from loss and depression. Not always happy, yet not always sad. His friends force him to open up and share his burdens and slowly he comes to enjoy life, perhaps even forgive himself. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime shows the weight of regret yet it is a truly a unique story with a positive ending. Very refreshing.",

It's about how our actions reflect on consequences that impact our lives, and about the feeling of guilt and the release of that. It's simple and inspirational, it successfully conveys the message that is trying to pass. \r\nI recommend this very much, with none doubts. It's sad that this anime/manga are not very famous, I hope that comes out more anime or manga in this same theme and style. The writer is very dedicated with her fans, which Ifind very nice too.",

            "content": "Waffle - OK, so let's keep this short and simple. A friend of mine, when asked for an animator review, recommended this anime \"Orange\". This was roughly Christmas time so I personally thought the timing was slightly off, but a promise is a promise so I am making it for Valentine's say. Why? Because it is a romantic drama with a sci-fi twist.\r\nSpoilers a Head....................................................................................................\r\nStory - Have you ever watched an anime involving high school students? I am sure that has never even crossed your mind before, revolutionary I know but surprisingly uncommon with this genre of the medium. And, stop me if you haveheard this before, have you ever seen an anime where the sub-main character is a transfer student who is the main character's love interest. That last one is kind of fresh, however, we are going to ignore it for the sake of the joke because I'm not funny. My point is that the story is fairly stereotypical as well as safe to do. Boy transfers in, girl likes said boy, the full story is about the girl not admitting this fact, friends help her to get close to the boy, both fall in love. It is a fairly easy structure, however, they added a small change; time travel. It's an interesting spin on the genre, with the concept being fairly impressive, the only gripe I have with it is they didn't utilise the time travel enough. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, let's take the letter that changes the story. Put simply, the main girl gets a letter from her future self, telling her past self about future events, to which she was sceptical at first. After witnessing them coming true she changes her mind and so the story continues with her changing the past. The problem lies in how? I mean how does any of this work? This is a very open question and there doesn't seem like there was an answer to it or at least one that is satisfying.  This really didn't feel like a sci-fi anime, it felt like a romantic comedy\\n\r\n.\\n\r\nAnimation - This one is at least satisfying. The best way I would say it is that it felt a little rough around the edges. Sure, nothing to the extent of Aon Hana, but there were certain issues in both animation and art style. T he art style took on more of a realistic approach, a relatively noble thing to do, however, this does make it much harder to animate. Moe is a unique thing, it is surprisingly easy to animate and easy to get the attention of people. The issues with realistic animation is the Uncanny Valley, a spectrum where if something looks too human people become scared of it. A much more realistic proportion and when there are mistakes they are much easier to see. Sure, it can be done in several cases such as Ghost in the Shell, but that had a massive budget for a start and had a much wider cast and crew, meaning more people to check things. Whilst I consider it noble to take on such a style it wasn't my cup of tea. The same thing can be said about the colours, ironically enough there was plenty of oranges, but for me personally, I found it to be oddly hard on the eyes. It could have just been the animation issues but something felt weird about the colours. Everything felt a little saturated and not appealing on the eyes, which is relatively odd as I recall that this is one of the anime's I couldn't binge watch, and I didn't realise at the time that this might have been the case. However, I am not confirming or denying.\\n\\n\r\nSound Design - The opening was country music - nope, just nope. And whilst I can't play it I encourage you to go and listen to it. And, whilst it wouldn't be my taste, I honestly can't think of anyone else who would enjoy it. However, even if it doesn't match up to my personal tastes, the OP wasn't catchy enough to hold my attention for long. As for the sound design no track was really too memorable, there were some that were slightly catchy, yes, but nothing that I can really get down and boogie with. As for voice acting, I stuck with the dub mainly because I thought that time travel would be something I needed to remember, for example, time, date, location, however this really wasn't the case, and whilst the dub is serviceable, as it is Funimations,  it's not necessary that you would need to remember a lot of details, so if you prefer subs go with subs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - These have to be some of the weakest characters I have seen. It is so bad in fact that you only need to know three characters, main girl, main boy and love rival, also known as Naho, Kakeru and Hiroto. Those are the only characters that you really need to remember until the second half where everyone gets pushed. This here was an annoyance, you spent an entire season dedicating yourself to three characters and then you make everyone else relevant just because. And Naho has to be the worst one of them all. First off, her future self-time travels to get a guy she liked, killing off her baby, and yeah that was her future self but it still shows a bit of selfishness on her part, at least she got someone, and even throughout the rest of the show she is fairly stereotypical. Hiroto was the tolerable one, but at least he was nice a bit cookie cutter, but you know, a tolerable character. \\n\\n\r\nThe best character by far though, Kakeru. He had the most character development, a fairly deep backstory and he remained ignorant for the entirety of the show. This character is worth the watch though. The character has some very deep moments. And, as for the rest of the cast, who even remembers them. One was so bad they were reserved for getting bread; she was the bread girl. Nothing really happened much with the other characters and, for anyone that watched it, I think most will agree, they only really become relevant in the second act, and that is relevant with quotation marks. Sure, they did account for some plot points, but that is kind of a moot point, they didn't do that much to advance the story and, quite frankly, was a waste on Naho's money on buying them drinks.\\n\\n\r\nSynopsis - Overall I would say that the only character that it worse the watch is Kakeru; he makes the entire show. The only other redeeming quality is the time travel gimmick, which they didn't even utilise, or at least not to its fullest extent. The soundtrack happened and the animation was noble, it doesn't mean it is worth watching for that, so yeah I would recommend watching it but it is one of these that you could pass and not miss much, however, if you are going to watch it, watch it for Kakeru. \\n\\n\r\nRecommendations - Anything else... ok ok It's not that bad... try Kimi ni Todoke it's that close in both themes and feel to each other only ones good",

            "content": "Orange. This anime has been popping in and out whenever I search some sad anime online. And since I\u2019ve already exhausted my sports anime to-watch list (well, almost *wink), I decided to try something dramatic this time. I originally tried some other anime suggestions first but it\u2019s only with this anime that I was able to settle in as early as the first episode.\r\nMy whole viewing experience was really eventful, which definitely explains why I wrote this article, *wink. After watching all 13 episodes, I\u2019m still not sure whether I love this anime or not. Ofcourse I have some few points that I love andsome that really frustrates me, but thinking back, I think this anime is a really good interpretation about having regrets, feeling guilty, and depression which we can really relate and learn from.\\n\\n\r\n(WARNING: I might include some major spoilers ahead, so if you don\u2019t want to get spoiled, stop reading right now and watch the anime instead, *wink. But if you\u2019re really that curious, feel free to continue reading.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nOpening and closing themes (plus the songs and art)\\n\r\nThe first thing that comes to my mind when I saw the opening theme is spring. It has this calming effect to it and the art works\u2019 really good, as well as the song. In comparison to its opening song, the ending song makes me want to curl up in bed and cry my heart out. Not my usual catchy anime song but it went straight to my heart that all I wanna do is emote (lol)!\\n\\n\r\nI actually have no violent reactions about the arts, characters design, effects, animation etc. because they all look fantastic to me.\\n\\n\\n\r\nPlot\\n\r\nTime-related plots (like time travel, etc.) were pretty common these days and I think it could be considered clich\u00e9 to some. We all hate clich\u00e9s, right? (well, I think not all) But time traveling or stories where the characters got the chance to change the past or something like that isn\u2019t part of my most hated clich\u00e9 in the history of clich\u00e9 list. Unless ofcourse it\u2019s done so horribly.\\n\\n\r\nFor this anime, Orange was able to capture my attention the moment it mentioned the strange letter Naho received from herself \u2013 10 years in the future! A letter from herself 10 years in the future? What\u2019s the big deal?! But that isn\u2019t just a simple letter, it\u2019s a letter from her future self that tells Naho\u2019s future life is filled with regrets, and she hopes that her younger self can correct the mistakes that were made in the past and most importantly, save the person she loves. And right there, I wanna burst to tears.\\n\\n\r\nThe addition of suicide, regrets, guilt and depression makes this anime more than your usual time (travel) stories. All of those things we\u2019re pretty dark but I think Orange was able to portray those issues so well. It can be a bit frustrating especially on how Kakeru handled them but thinking back, it made me realize how powerful guilt and depression can be and that it could easily snatch a precious life away from someone.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I like about this anime is what amazing things these 5 set of friends did to save Kakeru. FRIENDSHIP is another big word in this anime and you know me, next to family, I love reading stories where it highlights great friendship.\\n\\n\\n\r\nNarration\\n\r\nYou can really feel the emotion with every narration but for someone who loves fast-forward (very guilty, haha), you may find Orange quite slow. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I didn\u2019t feel bored watching this anime but it was quite slow (especially on some sad scenes between Naho and Kakeru) that I wanna hurry up and learn what happens next.\\n\\n\\n\r\nLesson\\n\r\nNo one can change the past so you shouldn\u2019t dwell on them. But sometimes, you have to go back to the past in order to really move forward.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing which I think makes this anime really good were the set of lessons the viewers can be able to learn from it. It ranges from \u2013 guilt, regrets, sacrifice (hands down for Suwa), and that you can\u2019t carry all of these burdens alone and somewhere along the way, you\u2019ll be needing your friends and family\u2019s help to get through them.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nAnother thing why I love shoujo anime is that most of them showcases set of friends who may share different personality but were able to create an amazing friendship. For Orange, it didn\u2019t fail to show me that. Ofcourse the main focus for this story is Kakeru so there\u2019s no thorough introduction with each character but all throughout the show, we can definitely get an idea what kind of person each of them are.\\n\\n\r\nI actually like most of the characters but there\u2019s this one specific character that really stood up for me, and that\u2019s Suwa. I just love him. Even after what he found out, he still supports Kakeru and dropped everything (even the future for the one that he loves) so he can save his friend. So yep, the best friendship and the best guy ever award for this anime goes to Suwa.\\n\\n\\n\r\nRomance\\n\r\nI love YA especially if the settings\u2019 in highschool, which definitely explains why I always seem to watch shoujo anime, hihi. I think this anime focus more on the friendship rather than the romance, but ofcourse for a hopeless romantic, I can\u2019t help but giggle whenever Kakeru and Naho has their moments. But my most dreaded bitchy-ex-ruining-everything scenario happened in this anime which really made me want to throw a tantrum, but luckily it wasn\u2019t stretched that long.\\n\\n\r\nSince there\u2019s two sets of timeline in this anime, there\u2019s also two sets of pairs you are going to look out for. I was actually kind of torn which one of the pairs I love the most but because of the issues Kakeru is encountering, he can act really weird and frustrating sometimes so I can\u2019t help but also cheer for the other guy. I guess this is also the reason why I\u2019m not sure what to really think of this anime.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, both the girl and the boy confessed their love but they\u2019re not officially dating. What\u2019s with that?! But looking at the boy\u2019s point of view, I think I kind of understand. But still, it\u2019s definitely not good for my hopeless romantic backbone.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnding\\n\r\nIt was bittersweet which exactly explains why this anime is entitled Orange. The ending may not be your ideal boy-get-married-to-the-girl scenario but it\u2019s definitely giving us an idea what will happen next now that they were able to accomplish their goal.\\n\\n\r\nBut truthfully? I think your reaction of the ending depends on who are you rooting for. For me? I am rooting for Kakeru at first (that seems to happen when you know that the guy is going to die or something) but as I watched further, that changed and now I am rooting for the other guy. I think both of the guys deserves Naho and if I could be mean, I don\u2019t like Kakeru to end up with Naho, I think the other guy deserves her more. But I feel something weird, really. I know I don\u2019t like the idea of Kakeru and Naho but whenever they have their sweet moments, I am silently cheering for them lol.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nBased on the pointers above, I still can\u2019t commit to just one emotion but one thing\u2019s for sure now \u2013 it\u2019s not hate. So, I guess it\u2019s close to love? If it helps, I gave this anime an 8 out of 10 rating overall, *wink.",

            "content": "Shoujo anime follow a very basic and straightforward structure, and more often end up feeling way too dramatized and overly-melodramatic for no apparent reason. Orange is slight different in this aspect.\r\nThe story of Orange revolves around Naho, a carefree girl in her second year of highschool. She receives a letter on the school opening day. The letter was sent from Naho to Naho 10 years in the past in hopes of her younger self being able to correct the mistakes she once made in highschool. It's up to Naho to correct her past mistakes by saving the new transfer student, Kakeru Naruse, so that heexists 20 years from then.\\n\\n\r\nCompared to most Shoujo, Orange has less drama and some logic which made it a successful summer 2016 anime. Though written poorly, the show hardly gets boring at first. Naho is perfect as the protagonist as her clumsiness and inefficiency to take decisions results in events which keep the show forward. There is a negative side as how boring she is.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa is easily the most likeable and respectable character in the entire story. However, while you can tell that unlike Kakeru, he genuinely cares about his friends' wellbeing, his stance on Naho and Kakeru's relationship is far too idealistic to be real. While his goody-two-shoes persona does make him prevail over the likes of Kakeru, it also makes his character all too stale and predictable. His best moments are easily the ones in which he feels conflicted whether or not to act upon his intuition and snatch Naho for himself instead of undermining his feelings. Unfortunately, they are very few and far in between, as for the overwhelming majority of the show he simply acts as Kakeru's wingman without bothering to intervene. In my perspective, this ruined the character. There is nothing to speak about the other character. Hagita could have been better used in the story as a geek coming up with awesome ideas.\\n\\n\r\nThere ending of the story is more Shigatsu wa kimi no uso like. The presentation of \"orange\" after opening is also similar to Shigatsu wa kimi no uso.\\n\\n\r\nLogically speaking, the poor portrayal of a clinical depressed patient is another downside of this anime. A person with suicidal thoughts should be consulted with a psychiatrist and not by some high schoolers who want no regrets in future stuff. This anime gives the wrong message if children below 15 are to watch it.\\n\\n\r\nDid i enjoy it? Not really. Just a different shoujo anime experience. Shoujo is not my thing. But this a good show. Just watched by my sister's recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\r\nArt : 7/10\\n\r\nSound track : 6/10 Opening is pleasing to hear. Voice acting is ok. Nothing special.\\n\r\nCharacter: 8/10 Not because Naho is an awesome character, but her clumsiness gives something to show in the anime. In this perspective, Naho is the perfect main Character.\\n\r\nOverall rating: 6.75/10\\n\r\nWorth Watching? : Love shoujo, romance, drama? Then go for it.",

            "content": "Orange\r\nAKA \u201cWhoever saves one life\u2026\u201d\r\n[Contains Spoilers]\r\nIt is difficult, I think, for a work to delve into a topic as loaded with presuppositions as suicide and find the right balance in tone. Too serious, too bent on the tragedy of it all, and it becomes melodrama; too light, too afraid to tackle such a topic head on, and it becomes easy to shrug off the pain of the person suffering and look the other way. Much like in real life. Perhaps that is why there seem to be very few anime willing to deal with such a topic at all.\r\nThe central theme of Orange is suicide.In particular, it is about a group of friends who, even 10 years after the fact, are filled with regret over the realization that they couldn\u2019t recognize that their friend was in crisis and thus failed to prevent him from taking his own life. Those two ideas\u2014suicide and regret\u2014are the cornerstones of the anime. However you may feel about the handling of its characters, or their relationships with one another, or the sci-fi-time travel conceit, what Orange had to get right was how it approached the topic of a suicidal individual, and how his friends, given new insight and a second chance, had to do everything in their power to stop him from making that choice again. And it did get it right.\\n\\n\r\nI think it\u2019s important to mention that although Naho is our main character and the one through whom we see the events of the anime unfold, the story isn\u2019t really about her. It is about Kakeru, and his personal struggle with his own regret and eventual (possible) suicide. And here is where I think an important decision was made in the writing of this story, one that might be easily overlooked. It would have been so easy to swap the roles of Naho and Kakeru; to make her the one struggling with suicidal thoughts and him the one who has to save her. Why is that important? It is very, very difficult for men to open up about their feelings, especially when those feelings have to do with weakness, inadequacy, and loss. Even today, though we like to boast about our breaking down of predetermined gender norms and our willingness to embrace emotional openness, men who show psychological fragility are often met with social stigma in return for their trouble. As a society, we still don\u2019t like to talk about mental health, and that goes double for men\u2014though we don\u2019t say it, it\u2019s almost always easier if they just keep quiet about it.\\n\\n\r\nOrange says to hell with that. One of the most powerful scenes has Suwa and Naho directly confronting Kakeru and refusing to back down until he answers their questions truthfully, with the verbatim words \u201cWhy do you want to kill yourself?\u201d coming from Suwa. This is so important, because when said by another person, it forces the idea of suicide to become real and tangible to the suicidal individual. They have to confront the notion in the broad light of day, with others watching and caring, rather than keeping it secluded in their own mind. Through this, Kakeru is finally able to open up about what he has been feeling. He finally can acknowledge it honestly and discuss the thoughts with the people who care for him. It is a chance that many suicidal people, sadly, never receive.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, it is not one single person or one single event that keeps Kakeru from killing himself. It is all of his friends, trying day after day and taking the time for all of the little things, that cause him to realize that he is dearly loved, and enable him to forgive himself and make a different choice. His friends manage to not only wipe away their own guilt and regret from having failed him, but also show Kakeru that it\u2019s possible to move on passed his own.\\n\\n\r\nStray Thoughts\\n\\n\r\n-I was struck by how reminiscent the first few episodes felt to Anohana. The same melancholy is there; the same estranged group of friends brought back together due to past regrets. The feels flowed freely from that point forward.\\n\\n\r\n-No, that\u2019s not how black holes work. Honestly, though the method that the older friends (let\u2019s call them World A) used to send their letters to the younger friends (let\u2019s call them World B) was pretty ridiculous and felt rather forced, the use of the parallel worlds idea enabled the anime to do something rather remarkable. No matter what happens in World B, the World A friends have to continue living with their regret. They can never bring Kakeru back to life in their own world. They will never even know that they saved him in another time and another place. That\u2019s a very sobering and very mature take on the whole affair. You could even make the argument that the whole thing was just dreamed up by the World A friends in order to finally make their peace with their regrets, though I think that is a much darker interpretation than what the anime was going for.\\n\\n\r\n-Naho, like so many MCs before her, can be infuriatingly dense at times. Being shy and introverted myself, I understand how difficult it can be to put yourself out there and take initiative. But when you are literally handed the guide on how to stop your friend from committing suicide and you can\u2019t bring yourself to TALK TO HIM it becomes a bit ridiculous. I give her a pass only because she shows true development and growth in this regard by the end of the series.\\n\\n\r\n-Suwa is the hero we don\u2019t deserve, the best boy, the best bro, now and forever. Seriously, the guy purposefully sabotages his future with Naho on the chance that it might help him save his friend. Can you get any more selfless?\\n\\n\r\nWho Should Watch\\n\r\nSomeone looking for an honest look at suicide, the pain the individual and their loved ones go through and how difficult it can be to show that person they are loved.\\n\\n\r\nWho Shouldn\u2019t Watch\\n\r\nSomeone looking for a lighter shoujo/romance. Honestly, I would hesitate to call this a romance at all. It\u2019s so secondary to the main theme that they might as well not have bothered.\\n",

            "content": "This anime is short, sweet, and heartbreaking. Sure, the plot has a lot of holes and things weren't really fleshed out as much as it should have been but that's not what keeps you watching. The main character is shy, awkward and at times a bit annoying. However, she's also relatable if you have similar issues with anxiety and shyness as she does. She doesn't realize how brightly she shines simply because she's always putting herself in shadows of her friends. Everyone has their own unique personality and they all fit together almost perfectly.\r\nThe story is typical, the plot is a bit one dimensional butit has heart and it's extremely sad. They try their best to save their friend and in the end it leaves us with more questions than answers. They do almost everything that they can do and have slip ups like normal people. They all care deeply about one another and that is what is moving. It's depiction on mental illness is far too real that sometimes it made me slightly uncomfortable watching it play out. It hit home in a lot of spots for me.\\n\\n\r\nYou find yourself leaning more towards the main male with his emotions but my favorite was still Suwa in the end. He gives his all and gives up his future in order to make others happy. He puts the needs of others before his own without making it seem like it was a huge burden to do so. He sacrificed greatly for the sake of others that you can't help love him even more. His natural charisma and his welcoming personality is what made me love him as well. All in all each character had their own unique traits and you will find reasons to love each one.\\n\\n\r\nIf you want an anime that might make you cry and you want your heart teared to shreds over something that could very well happen to anyone then this anime is for you. However beware of how silly it may seem at times and how reptitive it may seem in some instances. Also the switching back and forth sometimes was not obvious which confused me in parts. This anime is a nice watch regardless.",

            "content": "Although the title of the anime is very ambiguous , as though the creator ran out of ideas , i can very well assure you that is not the case . Behind such a simple name , the author has managed to incorporate the essence of the story in a nutshell. The experiences of the characters throughout their life is just like an orange - sweet (good experiences ) and sour ( bad experiences ) . Either that or the author just wanted to name it after an orange  juice box which Kakeru gives our MC , Naho. \r\nWell since i mentioned two characters, might as well give a brief description of each as it is very refreshing to say that these arent your typical overused troupes . \\n\\n\r\n1. Naho - The MC, is however a typically common character troupe - the shy \\n\r\n   easily bullied , girl with high morals but low self esteem\\n\r\n2. Kakeru -   A quiet guy with a secret backstory that runs the plot forward\\\\n\r\n3. Suwa -    The athletic guy who has a thing for Naho .\\n\r\n4.Azusa -    an overly happy yet very likeable happy go lucky girl \\n\r\n5. Chino -   the strict silent enforcer of the group\\n\r\n6. Hagita -   the nerd of the group\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story is very interesting and captures your attention from the start and continues to keep you enthralled . Basically Naho receives a very detailed and long letter from her future self ( 10 years in the future ) . It tells her of the arrival of a transfer student , Kakeru and how she wants her high school self to prevent his inevitable death. \\\\n\\n\r\nWhatever decisions she makes , there will be consequences that she must face . (Kind of like the LIFE IS STRANGE games) Naho is faced with the immense task of preventing the inevitable while at the same time doing this all alone , as she fears her friends will just laugh at her.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot thickens over 13 episodes and becomes very thrilling with each episode . The character development is just amazing . I rarely say this about an anime . Considering that they had just 13 episodes they did an amazing job. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation was amazing. The character designs were very good and more realistic than what you usually find in anime. I dont remember the sound tracks as it has been over an year since i watched it . I really wanted to write a review much earlier but i was afraid i might not do it justice ..still dont but i just need to do this one.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough the story is great, it is ofcourse not without flaws. You can see some cliches occuring here and there , but its not that much. But i just hated the fact that the creator just seemed to shy away from giving more details about how the letters were sent to the past. It is explained in just a small part of the anime. But considering that this letter is what started and is moving the plot , i really wished they'd have talked more about it. \\n\r\n(At the time of writing this , i had not watched the movie and hence donot know if they talk about this there )\\n\\n\r\nBut why this anime recieves a 9/10 is because for me it really lived up to its Slice of Life tag. I strongly urge you to watch it",

The anime I had recently finished before watching this newer series were Your Lie in April, Kaichou wa Maid-Sama, and Kimi ni Todoke, so, if you're familiar with those shoujo classics, you'll understand the high bar I was setting for Orange. \r\nThe worst thing was that time and time again the unoriginality of the characters' interactions/tropes were highlighted. I was repeatedly noting how similar the characters were to those in Kimi ni Todoke. In my opinion, the decision to tackle mental health/depression was poor in that the rest of the story was so bland.\r\nThat being said, I watched all 13episodes in one day, so there must've been some redeeming factor; probably just the adolescent giddiness to be watching another shoujo anime that recreates the feelings of a high school crush no matter how long ago your own experience with it was.",

Still, I went ahead and I don't regret it one bit!\r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThe story is quite simple and effective. It mixes the point of view of the main characters in the present and in 10 years. Therefore I thought it was rather satisfying as I often find myself wanting to know how the characters evolved in the future.I never felt I had to force myself into keeping up with the episodes. In fact, I believe the number of episodes (13) is actually perfect and it felt like going at the right pace. The plot is also interesting because it talks about the death of a parent and how you deal with depression in a rather honest and realistic manner. However I guess it was predictable and could have been a bit more complex but it didn't stop me from enjoying it and the end was still good!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10\\n\r\nThe art was pretty nice. It was clean and the quality was constant which I really enjoy in an anime. It was a bit more realistic than what shoujos got me used to which I believe suited the anime. I appreciated the fact that they never tried to make it all moe and stuff, it felt right.\\n\\n\r\nSong: 7/10\\n\r\nThe music background didn't particularly drew my attention but I did notice that it did the job by being uplifting, moving or else when it had to. All in all it was a good music background for a shoujo with drama that is not overdoing it. I liked the ending better than the opening but I won't listen to them again.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe five main characters all have distinct personalities: Naho cares more about others than herself and most of the time she is shy, yet when she sets her mind to it she has lots of courage. Kakeru is tormented and lost in his pain but you get to see is personality, kind and a bit daring at times. Suwa is super friendly and upright (my favorite). Azu (my other favorite) is sunny, energetic and straightforward. Takako is like a mother: loving but will also kick your ass if need be! Hagita acts mostly like he doesn't care but truly he loves his friends and when he shows it it's so clumsy it's hilarious! They all have a beautiful friendship and I loved that aspect of the anime. I regret that they didn't develop the Azu/Hagita duo but 13 episodes is short so\\n\\n\r\nOverall : 8/10\\n\r\nOrange was a nice surprise, there was humor and also some moments that got me breathless waiting for what would happen. It felt right and I don't regret watching it!",

            "content": "I'm writing this review because I'm concerned about the messages and themes this anime has. If interpreted incorrectly, it'd be an unhealthy way to cope with mental illnesses, and possibly harmful. I'll try to avoid spoilers and focus on concepts. \r\nI started watching this series because I saw something about a character attempting suicide. Motivated on seeing how the character, Kakeru, can survive his suicidal thoughts, I got pretty captivated and emotionally invested. I find his behaviour and thought process realistic as symptoms mental illness, which is most likely major depressive disorder (although I wonder if he has something else along WITH it). However, theanime kind of concludes with the message of, \"love can save you from depression,\" which is pretty disappointing. Because it won't. \\n\\n\r\nAnother theme they pushed really hard was having supportive friends and family. This is indispensable when it comes to treating a mental illness, and I strongly agree with it. It's sweet for a group of friends to work so hard to make their friend happy, and I probably have a soft spot for that, BUT that's not going to cure your depression. No one can save you from any kind of mental illness, except for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe type of negative thoughts Kakeru had, needed to be worked through in therapy, specifically cognitive behavioural therapy. He kept blaming himself without anyone opposing his thoughts with reason. Instead, it was just \"YOUR FRIENDS MAKE YOU HAPPY,\" kind of shit. No, he will start thinking them again until he is able to correct his negative thoughts into more reasonable ones. \\n\\n\r\nHe might even need medication, considering how his mom likely had some sort of mental illness (I got borderline PD vibes) that she passed on to him. Sometimes it's a chemical imbalance, and it just can't be helped in another way.\\n\\n\r\nIt is probably important to keep in mind that in Asian countries, mental illnesses more or less \"don't exist,\" and you just have to suck it up. Maybe support from friends and family is all they have available.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough well-intentioned, I think the core message (lol) of Orange can be harmful. I am probably being very generous with the scores because I do think they portrayed mental illness accurately. Also, personally I was just really rooting hard, and emotionally invested, for suicide prevention. \\n\\n\r\nDo I recommend Orange? I guess if you want to see how friends try (or fail, I didn't spoil the outcome okay?) to prevent a suicide. I think it could be educational and thought-provoking to understand mental health issues better. Don't care for all that? Don't watch.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I had to think about this one a lot. In this review I'll only be discussing which aspects of the story I liked and what made me drop it after 11-12 out of 13 episodes.\r\nFirst off and most importantly, Naho. She is a likeable character overall, but there's something about her that just seems odd. (Spoilers ahead) In the alternate future, she is married with Suwa and even has a baby with him, but in the timeline where she receives the letter she ends up with Kakeru who is deceased in the other future. The group of friends learns 10 years later that the latterhad comitted suicide and among others, Naho does show emotion, but I wonder why she never seemed to have cared enough to find out more about what really happened...? In the timeline where she knows about the suicide 10 years back, she reads in the letter that her future self had already had a crush on Kakeru and for some reason this time, she does enough to save him for the time being, out of love. So what I'm trying to say is that I don't really support her decision that she one time went for Suwa, who loves her in both timelines, and in the other for Kakeru because he's still alive. I find this a little bit... how to say it, unfaithful? In any case, be it because of her anxiety or whatever, but her actions and ways to show affection (or hold back) get really annoying in my opinion. Somehow, I would have wished for Kakeru to end up with someone else, but I guess it couldn't have been avoided since it's a shojo. I don't know what happens in episode 13 and I kind of don't want to watch it because I feel very sorry for Suwa and I think it's also obvious that Naho and Kakeru will just show how much they love each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot has great potential, but this final result doesn't live up to it unfortunately. I would still recommend this to people who are in a way interested in the issues that Kakeru has to maybe find a new way on how to deal with them or just to see that there can be a good future awaiting you if you don't give into depression. It would have been possible to work more on this part of the story too though.",

            "content": "S T O R Y:\r\nOK, let's just start off by saying that this is no ordinary shoujo anime. There is a more serious undertone to it for those that can understand it. What I really like about this anime is that it challenges the stigma of depression and tries to show others what it's like from the perspective of someone with depression vs. those who don't have it. In fact, I feel like this is more of a drama than just an everyday, slice-of-life show.\r\nI find that depression is not commonly portrayed in animes which is why I found this show so interesting. I havenot interacted with people who have serious depression until this year actually, so this anime really hit home with me. Watching this was actually frightening to me because it made me think of the people I know in real life who might be going through the exact same thing.\\n\\n\r\nThere are lot of generic stereotypes used in this show, like parallel worlds and cliche character types, but I still feel like the plot turned out great. Instead of being tacky and overdone, the stereotypes were subtle and contributed to the story. In fact, I feel like these stereotypes are accurate depictions of how different people act in real life. Many people with depression try to hide behind a mask and don't like to burden others with their problems. The same goes with selfless people.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I found this show so powerful. It was realistic,relatable, and tackled an issue that we may come across in real life.\\n\\n\r\nA R T:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime reminds me of the art in mangas and less like traditional shows on TV, which would make sense since the show is based on a manga. I like that they kept the characters looking identical to the manga. \\n\\n\r\nThe low budget/13-episode artwork becomes apparent in some episodes, but I find that that's what gives some scenes the relief that they need. Otherwise, I find the art to be very pretty!\\n\\n\r\nS O U N D:\\n\\n\r\nTHE ENDING SONG HAS SO MANY FEELS. That is all.\\n\\n\r\nC H A R A C T E R:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters aren't all that great when you look at them individually, but put them together and they become something special. The close-knit group of high school friends is pretty cliche, but that's what I find so charming about this anime.\\n\\n\r\nNaho is the typical shy, polite girl, which I found frustrating at times, but the series did show some good character development so that was good. Though sometimes it felt like she wasn't learning at all.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa is your ordinary popular, athletic, good guy, but his role in this show is more than that. He pretty much becomes the anchor in this friend group. I'm not sure if I found any favourite characters in this show, but if I had to pick, Suwa would have probably been the closest bet. Selfless, strong, and always able to look on the bright side; this is exactly the kind of character that inspires me.\\n\\n\r\nE N J O Y M E N T / O V E R A L L:\\n\\n\r\nWhile I do really like fantasy and action, I also do enjoy a good, realistic anime once in a while. If you're someone who particularly enjoys dramas, this is not one that you want to miss. Even if you're one to shy away from shoujos and slice-of-lifes, I feel like this is one that everyone needs to watch in order to open your eyes or remind you about depression and that it exists in the world. Besides, it's only 13 episodes. Such a good message depicted in such a short time.",

            "content": "Ever make a decision that you regret? What if you could send a letter to your past self to act otherwise? Orange is a slice of life following a teenage girl, Naho, and her group of friends that encounter this exact scenario. Orange is about as unexpected a title as you can get for a show with a coming of age twist to the whole time travel category. However, it is also one of the most predictable shows once you get past the first episode.\r\nThe show comes across as something between Anohana and Ao Haru Ride. Though I don't see it nearly as favorably asthe aforementioned shows, it's a nice departure from the wild sci-fi and fantasy shows that seem to be dominant these seasons. If you're looking for a show that explores character relationships a bit more naturally than Kiznaiver and don't mind the predictability, then this is a pretty good candidate.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation:\\n\r\nThe show is nicely drawn overall with reasonably detailed backgrounds and modern, crisp lines. The show has a slightly unsaturated color palette, which is fitting given the somewhat apprehensive mood for the majority of the show. There is some occasional 3D CGI but it isn't particularly distracting. Animation-wise, two things bothered me about the show. First, the show is about notes from the future. Expect these notes to flash quickly across the screen, so fast that unless you're extremely well versed in Japanese you'll probably need to pause to fully digest the contents of the letter. The second thing that bothered me was the drawing style. Something about the eyes just doesn't mesh well, especially on the girls. It feels like they have doll eyes at times, thus somewhat killing emotional scenes (especially Naho). Furthermore, Kakeru's smile just looks wrong; I can't quite pin down what it is but it's just off-putting. Characters do get emotional quite often in this show, even the guys; just don't expect the same detail and authenticity that you get with P.A. Works.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't an action based show, unless you count athletic meets as \"action.\" There also isn't any ecchi though you do get some light romance.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe show opens with a warm, slow guitar piece. I'm not a huge fan of the singer but the melody is decent. The ED has sad overtones and is sung by another guy. The BGM is standard-fare material, supportive but not memorable.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly speaking, other than Kanahana and Ayane Sakura, the cast is relatively junior. Kanahana shows her experience, giving Naho a very fittingly shy and reserved voice. On the other hand, I have yet to find a role voiced by Seiichirou Yamashita that I like, and this show doesn't change that. Though only voicing a minor role, Yuu Asakawa deserves super kudos for her outstanding role as the English teacher; her intonations are almost passable as a native!\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nI'll admit that the premise of this show was particularly intriguing to me - the idea that one can influence their past self rather than forcefully take their earlier version's place like in so many other time-travel shows. How differently would you behave if you knew that someone would soon become intimately close with you? Of if you knew they would soon die? Furthermore, they play with the idea of regret, and whether choosing a different path really would reduce your future regret (by making yourself happier, doesn't it rob someone else of a chance to be happy, such as during a competition?).\\n\\n\r\nThe show is at heart a modified slice of life so the majority of the scenes revolve around school life. The atmosphere here is a bit complicated as everyone is trying to strike a familiar, friendly mood while knowing that disaster is looming on the horizon. Still, they manage to have many good times with a fair amount of comical and romantic scenes. The majority of the apprehension comes from the future scenes, where more mature versions of the protagonists look back with regret on their past.\\n\\n\r\nThere is a single main plot line that, while slow, eventually builds to an incredibly predictable climax and resolution. This is honestly one of the most predictable shows I've seen in a while. The whole time traveling letters thing and the impossibly photographic memory of all the future protagonists are pretty much glossed over to my disgust. However, despite these shortcomings, it's still a reasonable storyline, especially from a thematic perspective.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\r\nWhether this show works or not for you will strongly depend on how you perceive the characters. These are not your standard, bombastic anime characters that don't actually do anything. Instead, these are more realistic teenagers that show lots of hesitation in relationships, and often are caught up in trivial misunderstandings. These characters eventually start developing innocent relationships that form the backbone for a majority of the tension in the show. From that regard, this show is pretty strong for me. You can expect all the main protagonists to be dynamic characters, albeit perhaps a bit forced given the future letters.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two major detractors from this category. First is Kakeru. He definitely is a bit of a nutcase, making me wonder why everyone is so fixated on him. Furthermore, the show purposely makes it hard to get inside his head; really, he's the only thing that is rather unpredictable in the show - you never know whether he's going to accept something or go crazy and run off. Though there's an entire episode later on dedicated to explaining his past and thoughts, it doesn't help his relatability for the many previous episodes. Perhaps I just can't like a dude that smiles in such a fake way all the time. Second, I understand that these are very young characters but their reluctance to act or their inability to see the pitfall in actions that they take is all rather irritating; this will continue to occur throughout the entire show.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a show that really explores and grows character relationships, this show is a pretty decent candidate. I won't say it's as fulfilling as Kokoro Connect or as relatable as the characters in Nagi no Asuakara, but nonetheless it's quite a few steps up from many other shows out there. Just expect there to be lots and lots of crying.\\n\\n\r\nValue:\\n\r\nI'm not a regular consumer of the shoujo genre, but compared to previous offerings I'd have to say that this one just doesn't feel as complete. I can't quite pin down whether it's the lack of relatability to the unstable Kakeru or statistical improbability of their letter plan actually working. In any case, I find myself at the weird crossroad of liking the character development and relationships yet also constantly being infuriated at the characters' actions or lack thereof. I'll still give credit to the interesting premise and amazing English teacher, but overall this is isn't a particularly strong shoujo show. That said, it still was a welcome deviation in terms of characterization and had an interesting premise.",

I promise its 100% amazing.\r\nThis is the best 13 episodes of my life. I usually binge anime's and feel like time was well spent but this felt more emotional like a life lesson. I am not going to do a normal review but one medium sized paragraph. \r\nThe concept of time travel for me is I think a hobby, I dream about it, I watch shows ... movies, read books and watch anime's. So this was right up my ally. Thiswas a truly heartfelt story between 5 friends trying to save their 6th friend from dying by understanding his pain and the loss in his life and making him feel that living should be better than dying. I don't think I can explain how much I have cried over this anime, tears of joy and happiness. The music for the opening and ending were just so beautiful that I felt matched the anime so perfectly and 100% I will buy the Original Sound Track. I love these drama, romantic, school anime's as I would always desire a life like that in school but for me school IS just a pain. The animation was perfect and I would see all the characters and their slightest emotions on the their face. Visually stunning. The whole anime revolved around the characters and the friendships and the lengths they went to save their friend for committing suicide. These stories are the ones which are unique and I feel with the right audience, popularity and fan-base can withstand the test of time. Overall this was anime that made me reflect on me and what kind of person I am, I didn't view this as media but more of just a tale of friendship which withstand time and even parallel universes for that matter too. A true classic.",

            "content": "I have to admit, the \"Romance\" genre is a bit overdone right now because there's only so much story they can tell (Girl A and Boy A meets, gains feelings for each other and some obstacles in their way before they can truly love each other) but \"Orange\" stood out to me because of it's Sci-Fi twist and the Dramatic aspect of the show, which was really well-done. \r\n(There will be some SPOILERS in my review)\r\n[Story]: (8/10)\r\nOrange was one of my most hyped anime of Summer 2016. I'm a real sucker for Romance and I'll pretty much watch any anime that has a tag Romancein it (Except harem shows that also has a tag Romance) even though I'm starting to get burnt out of the genre (That doesn't mean I'm starting to hate the genre) but the Romance nor the Drama wasn't the only reasons why I was hyped for this anime. It was the \"Sci-Fi\" element. The future self of the main character sending a letter to herself in the past, which was the present in the show's main timeline. I thought it was an interesting take on the Romance genre and I wanted to see how it plays it out. I have to say that, for the most part, I was not disappointed. \\n\\n\r\nThe story of the series is about Naho receiving a letter to herself claiming that the writer is herself but 10 years in the future. Future Naho claims that she must watch over Kakeru, as he's no longer with them, and fix all the mistakes that her future self did and to erase any regrets that her future self has. \\n\\n\r\nThe romance aspect of Orange wasn't really anything ground breaking. It's also not that complicated. It's a simple love story between Naho and Kakeru but with a few hiccups here and there. Though, I have to say, that Naho and Kakeru barely did any work for them to get together. It was mostly the side characters helping them get together. The Sci-Fi element on the other hand was decent. It wasn't bad but it wasn't impressive either. The reason why I don't really give that much shit about Orange's \"Sci-Fi\" aspect is because it's fairly obvious that the Sci-Fi aspect wasn't really the show's main focus but rather, it focuses more on the romance/drama side of the show and the characters, especially Naho's struggle to live her high school life while getting a bunch of letters from her future self and making sure that Kakeru is doing a-okay. \\n\\n\r\nThe dramatic aspect of the show was done exceptionally well and I think that's an understatement because I can't find a better word to explain how the staff did a great job with Orange's drama. In my opinion, it's right up there with Your Lie in April. Anyways...At first, I was expecting the show to make me cry (Based on the source's material high score) but I WASN'T expecting to get this emotional after watching just a couple of episodes. Seriously, after watching 2 episodes of Orange, I was already teared up twice. I honestly can't count how many times I got emotional before the final episode. One of the major themes of the show that got me really emotional was Depression and Regrets. \\n\\n\r\nAs someone who actually noticed (up close and personal) one of my family members (My Aunt, to be more specific) suffering through depression, I have to say that Orange's portrayal of Kakeru's depression was absolutely spot on.   When my aunt was suffering through depression, I'd always question her behaviour (She was getting mad at me randomly) and since I was just 12 at that time, I didn't know what she was going through. Most of the time, I was being insensitive and looking back at the events, it's fairly obvious that she was putting a fake smile when she's playing with me. Seeing Kakeru suffering through depression reminded me of those days and I was able to connect with this show, emotionally. When people say that \"Kakeru is just a pussy who's always on the verge of suicide\", I just view them as a bunch of ignorant dumbfucks who hasn't experienced depression personally or someone in their family members hasn't experienced it and they just don't understand how it feels. Since this is a review and not my personal life story, I won't write everything that happened to her or why she was even depressed to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the show's portrayal of regrets. That was also well done. That was the main reason why the letters exist. Their future selves regrets not being able to save Kakeru. You're also going to see a whole lot more regrets from Kakeru as the show goes on. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]: (8/10)\\n\r\n\"Episode 1-8's Animation Quality: 9/10\"\\n\r\n\"Episode 9-13's Animation Quality: 6.5 - 8/10\"\\n\\n\r\nThat's how I'll sum up my thoughts on the show's Animation Quality. Now the long version. The first 8 episode's of Orange has one of the best Visuals/Art/Animation Quality I have ever seen. It reminded me of Your Lie in April. The character designs felt a bit weird at first, especially with how their faces look like compared to your average anime character designs, but I got used to it. As for the Animation Quality in Ep. 9 and so on, the quality dipped for whatever reason. Time Constraint? Budget Issues? I really have no idea but it looked bad. The art looked somewhat worse and the character designs looked derpy as fuck. The quality did improve on the 12th and 13th episode but it wasn't the same as it did in the first 8 episodes. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Sound]: (7/10)\\n\r\nThe show's soundtrack were ok. None of them were bad but none of them were great either. They were completely average, at best. Now the OP and ED theme song(s)\\n\\n\r\nThe OP theme song is \"Hikari no Hahen\" by Yu Takahashi and the ED theme song is \"Mirai\" by Kobukuro. Whoever's the fan of these songs, I'm sorry to say this but I completely hated both the OP and ED theme songs. I did not like the singers and their voices. I have nothing more to say. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Characters]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nThe main character, Naho Takamiya, is the reason why I held off my rating to 8. Well, that and the bullsh*t reason they gave us as to how the letters were getting sent back to the past. It honestly felt like a kid came up with the idea. At least they explained how the time mechanics here work, something that a lot of anime these days tend to ignore for whatever reason. Anyways, back to the MC. At the earlier parts of the show, Naho was an acceptable character. She wasn't too great but she wasn't a bad character either. She's the kind of person that you'd want to cheer for just to save Kakeru. \\n\\n\r\nThat's how I felt for the first 8 episodes. After episode 9 and so on, my opinions on Naho was gradually changing each and every episode. I couldn't believe how dense this character was. On episode 8, I thought she already confessed her feelings to Kakeru but on episode 9 and the future episodes, she was still acting like some pure, innocent and shy girl who just recently met him. She can't even hold his hands without acting like some idiot. Appearantly, in the manga, there was a monologue from Naho explaining why she was acting that way but they didn't adapt her crucial monologue from the manga which would have explained why she was acting like that and instead, she came off as some dense character. She's in high school, for god's sakes. There's no way she's THAT dense. I read the manga after watching the anime and I have a different opinion of her compared to the anime version but I'm not going to write it in this review. \\n\\n\r\nNext up is Kakeru Naruse. Two realistic characters in one season? (You can guess who's the other realistic character that I'm talking about). Geez, am I still watching anime? Anyways, Kakeru is one of the most character character I have ever seen, in terms of the way he acted. Kakeru suffers from depression and he likes to deal with his problems alone rather than telling his friends because if he gets his friends involved (like he did in the past), he believes that they're going to think he's lying or they're just going to blow him off. That's completely understandable because only a few people would get involved with someone's personal problems like Kakeru. His portrayal of depression is spot on and the moment that led to his suicide was absolutely believable. I would've probably done the same thing because I wouldn't be able to bear with that much regret. \\n\\n\r\nNow the side characters of the series, Chino Takako, Hagita Saku, Azusa Murasaka and Hiroto Suwa. Here's my opinion about them. They are one of -- if not -- the best group of friends I have ever seen in my entire life. I've had a different variety of friends from Elementary to High School and they don't even come close to these great side characters. Not even my best friends. If I were in Kakeru's shoes, I highly DOUBT my friends would go through this much trouble just to help me get better. They're going to believe that my parents are going to be there for me or I'm going to be able to solve it on my own. Even though they're just side characters and got little to no character development, they're still an enjoyable cast. They made such an impact to the story that it makes it hard for me to believe that they're just side characters. Suwa is best guy for me because of all the things that he did in the show that thoroughly impressed me and Hagita and Azusa are one of my favourite characters because they are hilarious. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[Enjoyment]: (8.5/10)\\n\r\nI really enjoyed Orange despite a few bumps on the latter parts of the series. It was like an emotional rollercoaster ride for me. It made me laugh, it made me cry and I even connected with this series, on an emotional and personal level. \\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\\n\r\n[VERDICT]\\n\r\n\"Orange\" was one of my most hyped anime in Summer of 2016 because it's a romance show and the \"Sci-Fi\" aspect piqued my interested. While the show wasn't as great as I wanted it to be, due to the latters parts of the series hitting a few bumps and was quite shaky, it still turned out to be a really good romance show. The realistic portrayal of Kakeru's Depression and his regrets and the side characters was, honestly, the saving grace of the show. Naho almost killed the show for me but she redeemed herself at the end. Mostly...\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]: (8.3/10)\\n\\n\\n\r\nPros:\\n\r\n+Realistic Depiction of Kakeru's Depression and his regrets\\n\r\n+Still a good romance show despite a few bumps in the latter parts of the series\\n\r\n+Great Art/Animation Quality in the first 8 episodes\\n\r\n+Great casts of characters, especially the side characters\\n\\n\r\nCons:\\n\r\n-Naho can be irritating to watch after episode 8\\n\r\n-Dip in Art/Animation Quality after episode 8\\n\r\n-Unlikable OP and ED theme song\\n\\n",

I have watched this genre for a while, and I could not stop watching this anime, but at so many times it was hard to watch. You just wanna throw some of the characters into a lake for being stupid so many times in this anime, but that also may be its beauty. All that being said i watched this whole seriesbasically in one night.... A love hate relationship isn't always good, but i think this anime achieved that well. Take it with a grain of salt according to the genre. It's important to note though that within this genre this anime did something that made me want to keep watching it. A critical review can say a lot in a lot of words, but my say about this anime is that it made me want to keep watching, why else spend your time doing something?",

            "content": "I feel as though this is one of those anime that you either love or hate. I'll be keeping this fairly vague so as not to spoil anything. As a side note, this is also my first review.\r\nOrange struck some very personal chords with me and perhaps that's why at the end of it I looked like a right ugly mess from crying so much. But I can also understand that not everyone connects to a single anime the same way which is why some the flaws in Orange stuck out like a sore thumb to others.\r\nStory 9/10\r\nOverall, I did enjoy the story; it wascliche the way everything was arranged but I can only describe it as a good kind of cliche. Yes, the time-travelling, parallel worlds thing does get a bit wonky when it comes down to giving the viewer a straight forward explanation as to how Naho and her friend group are able to send those letters in the first place. But I was forgiving on that end because I felt like the characters are the story and it's their experiences and feelings that you end up watching for instead and they do a very good job of telling their story (but more on that later).\\n\\n\r\nArt 10/10\\n\r\nI'll be honest, I probably judge the art in anime too extremely. I either hate it or love it; there is no in between. I really did love the art in Orange - it was cute when it had to be but also thoughtful and sincere at other times. It was wonderful to look at but not I guess... overbearing. It enhanced the experience without outshining it. \\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal. Nothing else could adequately describe the poignant beauty of this anime. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry. It makes you tense, angry, inspired. Probably one of my favourite anime soundtracks so far. If I had to blame anything for the emotional rollercoaster I had as a viewer, it would be this.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nAs I've said before, I felt as though the characters were the story. In the first few minutes, you meet the 5 (not including Kakeru) high school students whose actions and guilt are still long in their mind 10 years later. And Kakeru. \\n\r\nOh, Kakeru.\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, his characterisation could have been fleshed out better seeing as the whole series revolves around him and his relationships with these other 5 people. His actions do tend to get repetitive but not overly so that you begin to feel frustrated. \\n\\n\r\nNaho is a bit of a different story. I don't know how I feel about her. \\n\r\nShe isn't annoying. But she could have been much stronger. And her character writing needed to be a little more consistent. There will be times when this girl is the shyest human being on the planet; to a point where she doesn't interact with Kakeru DESPITE KNOWING that the whole point of the letters was for her to change these things. But does that make her a more relatable, more human character (albeit with weak resolve.)? I get that she's usually the quietest girl in the group, that she's sensitive and whatever. \\n\\n\r\nBut then we put her in the same room as Kakeru, and she always changes. It's like her sensitivity to people just vanishes in order to make Kakeru look like the ultimate people reader. She becomes awkward and oblivious to any more sensitive issues that arise (and they do because she is the potential love interest of a boy struggling with depression). Then Kakeru walks out the room and hey presto! she's back to noticing every tiny detail about everyone and worrying herself silly about the one guy who she always successfully brushes off in some way after each encounter.\\n\\n\r\nSo maybe this is why I only gave Characters an 8/10. It certainly had the potential to be a 10 as the rest of the characters are just marvellous (especially Suwa and his arc) but it fell a little short with one of the most important characters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI can't say I didn't enjoy this anime. Not at all. It's way up there with my favourites. When it tried to squeeze some emotion out of me, I ended up a wreck - crying with laughter; actual crying; absolutely fuming. There were times when I felt so incredibly helpless. Times where I felt like I was a part of this story and friend group myself. Times I wished I could reach through the screen and tell Kakeru that he was loved more than he knew. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10\\n\r\nI would easily watch this again - and soon. It's certainly an experience, and if you're a crier like me then get some painkillers nearby because, by the time I finished this at 3am in the morning, I had a splitting headache. It gives you a lot to think about, potentially stuff that you continue to think about days after watching. \\n\r\nBut like I said before, it's more of a 'you love it or you hate it' anime.\\n\\n\r\nBut please, give it a chance because it really does tell a wonderful story and I'll be looking to buy it on DVD very soon.\\n",

            "content": "First of all, why is it called \"Orange\"? Is it because the hair of the main heroine is orange? Does it even refer to the color or the fruit?\r\nTruth is somewhere there. Apart from being able to tell immediately who is the main heroine of our story, the title also refers to... a drink. The taste of the orange juice, sweet, savoury, but bitter as well. The taste of melancholy. The taste of memories. The taste of unrequited love.\r\nIt's not like Orange isn't just another shoujo about romantic school drama, another title indistinguishable from many others you've watched so far. But what's good about itis that it has a quality the majority of titles lack. And that's its ability to make the viewer feel empathy towards the heroine, to root for her when she's in struggle (not just the obligatory shipping empathy).\\n\\n\r\nThat, however doesn't make the show immune to some plot holes, such as:\\n\\n\r\n- Naho receives a letter from herself and, instead of reading the whole letter, like a normal person would do (well, omitting the part where it's normal to receive a letter from your future self), she reads it bits by bits, parallel as the story progresses. It's understandable, since that would prevent unwanted spoilers and keep up the suspense, yet it diminishes the importance of the letter itself and uses it as nothing more than a medium for telling the story.\\n\\n\r\n- The show is full of some very irrelevant conversations that are supposed to bring the slice-of-life vibe, yet they just make them look forced and awkward and like everyone is acting out of character.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side of things, the story is good and it's progressing good. Or maybe I'm just saying that because I'm a sucker for time-twisting stories (=.=`)\\n\\n\r\nIt gives the viewer hope that things can be changed for good, yet at the same time some things remain unchanged - be it because they must happen, or because Naho didn't do the right thing at the right moment. At the same time we're seeing character development: from the timid, indecisive Naho of the past, the heroine gradually builds up courage, although faltering here or there, half-driven by the weight of the letter, half-driven by the desires of her 16-year old self.\\n\\n\r\nOne downside of this show is the soundtrack. The music is somewhat off with the scenes and overall unmemorable. OP and ED are generic at best albeit they might prove entertainment for some watchers but personally not something I'd listen to twice.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are one to appreciate a romantic drama with a spice of time-travel and would be able to ignore flaws such as the above-mentioned, I recommend to give Orange a chance.",

            "content": "Plot\r\nIf you haven\u2019t watched the show yet and want a summary, \u2018Orange\u2019 is a 13 episodes long show that revolves around a group of school friends made out of 3 girls, 2 guys and a boy named Kakeru who has just trasfered into their school. All pretty clich\u00e8d, so far. The novelty in this scenario is the fact that one of the girls (Naho, the protagonist) receives letters from her 10-years-in-the-future self. Future Naho reveals she has a lot of regrets she wished she could go back in time to erase. One of them, is not being able to save Kakeru.\r\nFrom here the plot unwindsthrough Naho\u2019s struggles with following the detailed indications contained in the letters and attempts to fulfill them successfully.\\n\\n\r\nThe rhythm of the narration is really slow, probably slower than what might be necessary, sprinkled with flashbacks and reminders/explaination concerning the plot. The slow flow is not totally unpleasant, it gives a nice feeling of the rich, slow flow that good slice of life works give, but at times it can be fairly boring. But it\u2019s a fair price to pay for the absence of filler episodes.\\n\\n\r\nA great part of the animation rings around the emotivity and the emotional sphere of the characters, although, as much as their feelins are clearly depicted, no time is dedicated to the actual analisis of these feelings, resulting in a very diluited character development. The protagonists often have the time to face their emotions, but never seem to properly learn how to.\\n\\n\r\nDespite these little flaws, I really liked the way flash forwards and flash backs were sprinkled through the plot, offering the chance for the audience to stop and reflect more on the implications of what\u2019s going on in the main time line. I also appreciated how the characters themselves had questions on whether or not changing the past or travelling through time is possible or not, I wasn\u2019t expecting actual scientific theories to be brought up, albeit the fairly unrealistic discussions the characters have about them.\\n\\n\r\nThe best aspect of \u2018Orange\u2019 is undoubtedly the way it dealt with heavy topics, such as death, suicide and depression. There\u2019s a deep, reverential -almost elegant- delicacy with which these themes are brought into an almost overly sunny, light-hearted school life, without creating a disturbing contrast nor taking serious matters too lightly. There\u2019s a somewhat poetic realism in the way the suffering of one\u2019s soul is described.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 8/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nThe design of the characters is rather plain, but not at all distasteful. For once I\u2019ve appreciated the absence of crazy-coloured hair protagonists, overly prosperous female characters and/or other overly clich\u00e8d features that occur way too often in anime. \u2018Orange\u2019 has more realistic characters, more easilly comparable to actual highschool students.\\n\\n\r\n Personality wise, they all have fairly distinct ones from one another, all oriented towards a more realistic characterization, although at times more stereotypical features shine through. The only not stereotypical yet irrealistic aspect I detected in them, is how good and selfless they all are. I was happy not to see the usual moody teen-age highschool characters of the usual school dramas for once, but I started getting the feeling that it\u2019s more than just a bit unrealistic not to expect at least some emotional breakdowns from them, as it is natural to happen in that stage of life. Save the really dramatic moments, the general atmosphere of \u2018Orange\u2019 is good vibes and light-hearted school life.\\n\\n\r\nWhile they are all individually fairly well written, their group dynamic doesn\u2019t quite escape the clich\u00e8d anime group dynamic, which is not as great as a defect as much as the unbalaced weight given to every single character in the plot. The main characters are undoubtedly Naho, Kakeru and Suwa, while Takako, Azusa and Saku are clearly put more in the background. With many characters it is understandably difficult to let everyone have the same importance or relevance to the plot as the others, yet in this case the discrepancy between each character\u2019s presence in the narrative is large. While Naho and Kakeru stand out clearly in their role of protagonists -and, a little later on, Suwa in his role of primary character-, Takako, Azusa and Saku are almost useless to the development of the plot, not quite playing the part of helpers or obstacles. As the shows goes on, their role acquires relevance but their presence continues to be marginal. Furthermore, the two girls -Takako and Azusa- don\u2019t even seem to have an indipendent presence of their own, as they always appear on screen together and never on their own -except one exception in which Azusa shares her screentime with Suzu-. The latter shares his screen time with several other characters but he is definitely the one who appears less on screen. Their overall irrelevance left me wondering whether or not these three characters were really necessary or not.\\n\\n\r\nThe worst flaw I\u2019ve detected is Naho\u2019s plain, barely exsistent -if not at all- personality. She has to be the most unappealing protagonist I have ever seen in a long while. As the story goes on, it is possible to notice a slight hint of character development, which is very armonious and very welcome, but still not enough to completely redeem the girl from her sheer, annoying tastelessness. Seeing her just standing around, wide eyed and incapable to fend for herself nor take initiative is just really distressing to watch.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 6/10\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is smooth and natural, with no space for comic reliefs chibi moments nor any alteration to the art style used as a narrative device. Nothing weird, but nothing exceptional either. The shading is almost always present although quite simple. The colours are very natural and very well used to transmit the idea of atmospherical conditions -from a sunny spring day, to a gloomy autumn morning to a late evening moment indoors. The animation quality is lower at times but nothing too visually disturbing.\\n\\n\r\nMark: 7\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall mark: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nDespite its little imperfections, I enjoyed the vibes of Orange. It\u2019s a good watch when in need for something chill but still touching emotionally involving. For me, watching it was a good cocktail of frustration and tenderness, and the ending surprises withouth dissapointing.\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re willing to watch a show that takes it slow and brings you in a tranquil, plausible high school envirorment, if you\u2019re ready to get sad, happy, slightly annoyed and worried, if you\u2019re willing to let 6 incredibly good-hearted characters make you feel like getting better it\u2019s possible, then definitely give this show a shot. You\u2019ll find out that Orange is a fitting title for this bittersweet anime.",

            "content": "Mystery, romance, and companionship kept me enthralled in this anime. The story is about a group of high school friends that met one cool fellow on the first day of class.  This new fellow makes a great impact on the kinship of the group of friends and they learn that they can't live without him.\r\nBut then tragedy strikes. No one saw it coming, but it begins to slowly tear the new guy from the group, while in the meantime the group is trying to keep him in. The catch here is that the group of friends already know that this cool fellow is goingto commit a tragedy far worse than they can imagine.  They can only try hard everyday to stop him from getting closer to committing it. \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not trying to hype up this story line just to burst your bubble near the end. This is still a slice of life genre, so nothing is ever too breath taking.\\n\\n\r\nSit back, relax, and enjoy the sweet, anxious feelings that may seep into your veins while watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nStory - 10 - I'm going to give this anime a solid ten, because not once did this anime deviate from progressing the plot, if not solidifying it.\\n\r\nGraphics - 7 - No complaints here. Well drawn characters and movements. Great emphasis on character emotions and possibly too forced at times.\\n\r\nMusic - 6 - Similar tone used through out the majority of the anime.\\n\r\nCharacters - 6 - The characters displayed distinct personas, which is great, but there wasn't enough background to each individual character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 7 - This anime won't hurt to watch and is actually quite heart throbbing at points where the characters spill their hearts out. Kinda makes me miss the real dramatic love story between a girl and guy.\\n\r\nRecommended - Yeah. Go for it.",

            "content": "Life is bittersweet somewhat like an orange. Think of the orange as your life and yourself as the centre; peeling away the hard skin can be seen as carving away your problems. Sometimes taking the skin off is a daunting and challenging task without getting your fingers messy and sometimes its undeniably easy. Now you are left with sections, each with a different taste. You take a bite of your orange slice expecting a sweet and tangy flavour yet you are left with a bitter unpleasant aftertaste wrapped around your tongue.\r\nThere are different ways to see this anime depending on which character's point of viewyou want to see the anime from. Naho's perspective is best suited since you never know what to expect. It makes you want to learn more about Kakeru and his problems in order to empathise with him. \\n\\n\r\n3 episodes in and I was hooked, I needed more however that meant having to wait another week for the next episode to come out.\\n\r\nSo I gave in to my temptations and I do not regret finishing the manga one bit. Now I am just as excited about finishing this anime, it goes along very well with the manga in case anyone is willing to find out what happens at the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is relatable to me since I myself have been in Kakeru's position; it enforces the fact that you are not alone. Re-evaluate your thoughts and do not become a victim of depression. If you are having a hard time, give this anime a go. It will remind you that you are just like Kakeru with people to love and cherish.",

            "content": "Orange is the taste of sweet, sour, and sorrowful. Orange is the colour of sunset and of sunrise, of endings and new beginnings.\r\nThere was a time when I almost hated this anime because Naho was such a limp, wilted flower with a density rivaling Osmium.  Then I decided to forgive her for being a shy, introverted, 16-year old girl who grew up in Japan, walked always a step behind people, being happy when they were happy, and who never wanted to be a bother to anyone.  A girl who's getting instructions from herself at 26, but while it's easy to decide in retrospectwhat you should have done, it's not easy to act on that knowledge if you're not actually 26.  I would have never acted like Naho did, but then I am not her.  And who knows what differences, what repercussions a Naho who's not 16-year-old Naho would have brought.\\n\\n\r\nStory (9/10): This was the most original shoujo story I watched in ages. This is not actually a science fiction story.  It has an sfnal element -- the letters the 26 year old friends send to their 16 years old selves -- don't get all excited; there's an \"explanation\" but it's technobabble.  Don't get hung up on how the letters arrived.  That's not what the story is about.  It's also not really a romance, though there is a very strong romantic element present, and plenty of people will argue the benefits of one ship over another -- and completely miss the actual story.  It's really a story about the power of love -- not just or even primarily romantic love, but the love that drives the entire story, that causes Kakeru's friends to not forget him, and to not forgive themselves for failing to save him.  Love can be transformative.  Love can be selfish. In Buddhism we are supposed to grow beyond our selfish attachments to the material world, and embrace something purer. Erasing regrets is a selfish desire because it's mostly about personal feelings of guilt, but what these friends ultimately do is selfless -- they will never know whether it worked, sending the letters back to save Kakeru.  They will never be able to speak to him again, never be able to apologize, never be able to tell him that he is not alone, that he is loved.  If it works at all, it will happen in a parallel world, and they will gain nothing from it.   It's a powerful message of hope winning over fear and resignation, and I am probably showing my age by finding it a lot more powerful than the usual teen romance.\\n\\n\r\nThe message is underlined brilliantly in the last episode.  Kakeru needs to take that step himself, hope over fear and resignation.  Love can be transformative.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond that it's an interesting thought experiment -- is it enough if you just change the action about which you harbour a regret?  Once you change anything, what side effects might that have?  Once the timeline diverges from your foreknowledge, what guides you towards other changes?  Is it right to change something if it might rob other people of an important moment, or worse, their happy future?\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, it's actually quite good in showing depression, how it can distort the lens through which you view the world and others, and how excruciatingly painful it can become, so painful that the act of living itself becomes an unbearable burden.  Considering Japan is on the ass-end of acknowledging depression and doing anything about it, that's pretty darn good.\\n\\n\r\nArt (7/10): The art and animation was very good at the start, but later on some episodes really suffered from either time or budget crunch.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10): I liked both OP and ED, and the BGM felt very fitting.  I've heard better voice acting in my life, but it didn't detract from the story.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (7/10): Oh Naho, Naho, Naho.  I did want to strangle her many times.  I'd like to think that if I knew somebody's life was on the line, I could be more proactive instead of running from my own feelings, but as I said above, I am very much not somebody like Naho, and I already wasn't like her at 16, despite shyness and introversion and abject embarrassment at talking to people in whom I had an interest (not even romantic).  She does come through when encouraged by others, and she grows into somebody who can tell her husband the truth, without even as much as blushing, so I forgive her.\\n\\n\r\nI bled with Kakeru.  I know we don't get a lot of character here beyond his depression, but that's enough for me to empathize with him.  Yeah, I know what that feels likes.  Yeah, other people hardly even register when the pain takes over.  Yeah, every step is painful sometimes.\\n\\n\r\nAnd wow, Suwa.  Here's the embodiment of selfless love among the characters.  What a great guy.  I don't usually even like the extraverted, popular soccer captain sort of guys much, but there isn't anything about this guy that's not likable.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact they're all likable (except for Ueda the bullying bitch). We don't learn enough for my taste about Takako, Asuza, and Hagita (the latter has some prime wisdom to dispense), but there is only so much time in 13 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10).  I can't even remember the last shoujo anime that has found me this engrossed, and thinking about the issues.  Orange has flaws, definitely, but I don't even care to talk about them right now.",

            "content": "Since autumn 2014 after Ao Haru Ride series have already finished so many people have requested for the second season, including me too. Besides, there\u2019s several ANIME fan doesn\u2019t satisfied with the series because Production I.G can only make 12 episode for Ao Haru Ride series. It\u2019s really make a sense and it\u2019s no wonder the series so easy can get highest demand from ANIME fan. However, in the year 2016, ORANGE is the one Anime, we could called it \u201cSibling Rivalry\u201d with Ao Haru Ride. Ladies & gentleman, I\u2019m Dhiyauddinzidane will deduce for the whole story of Ao Haru Ride with ORANGE or AoHaru Orange. Shall we start now???\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s two wish that human always want it : whether RICH or ERASE something regret. Firstly, why they choose \u201crich\u201d because they want a lot of money, so they can buy anything in this world. Secondly, is \u201cerase\u201d any regrets they did. It\u2019s really impossible to erase anything regrets, what they did. Now let\u2019s focus about topic \u201cerase\u201d. We realized that any kind of erase something regrets, for sure, they want to create something Paradox, of course, they will build time machine or use some magical power, in order to fix anything in the past. All this things always appear in Anime, Western Cartoon and Hollywood film. For example, Men In Black 3, Primer film, X-MEN : Day Of Future Past, The Adventure of Jimmy Neutron, Phineas & Ferb, Edge Of Tomorrow, The Fairly Odd Parents, Family Guy, STEINS;GATE and ETC. In nutshell, every people in this world were totally can\u2019t predicted their own future and we never know what the future will bring to us, is it good things will happen to us or bad things will happen to us and that\u2019s why \u201cDESTINY\u201d is really mystery and also people often said that \u201cYesterday is History, Today is Present and Tomorrow is Mystery\u201d.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cThe Days You Were There and My Future\u201d & \u201cThe Future Is In Your Hand\u201d that\u2019s what Takano Ichigo Sensei wrote about the literally of ORANGE. Those words are the introduction of the ORANGE manga, I read before. Personally, it would suitable if Takano Ichigo Sensei wrote this phrase \u201cWhat We Chased After Wasn\u2019t The Future, But The Past So Full Of Remorse & Always Remember, Make it Right Decision Before You Do Something\u201d\\n\\n\r\nBesides, ORANGE is an anime adaptation of the popular manga written by Takano Ichigo. Personally, common stereotype with the category \u201cShoujo theme\u201d, for example, include \u2018Love\u2019, \u2018Tsundere\u2019, \u2018Clich\u00e9\u2019, \u2018Comedy\u2019, \u2018Encounter Each Other\u2019 and \u2018Misunderstanding Always Happen\u2019. However, Orange is very different Shoujo story and that\u2019s because, Takano Ichigo\u2019s include element of Sci-fi (Time-Travel) in the Shoujo manga (WHAT!!! AGAIN!!!) Truthfully, I was fascinated about the realistic location event, decent characters, breathtaking events and a beautiful concept of friendship in the ORANGE series. Besides, ORANGE is always bring memorable to me with ANIME I watched previously, such as Ano Hana = One of their friends died ; Ao Haru Ride = a similar concept of drama ; Mirai Nikki = several of the characters gains the ability to read the future through his personal diary ; RAINBOW ~Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin~ = a strong spirit of friendship ; STEINS GATE = Parallel world.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that most surprised me about this series is how closely it tries to follow the each of the chapter Manga and the concept of friendship in the series is really beautiful. The most things I respect about the series is, they know that, a bad things will occur to Kakeru. As companions they always support Kakeru and not betray each other. That's the value of true friendship is shown in ORANGE. (Let\u2019s Burst Our Tears, because TEARJECKER IS BACK)\\n\\n\r\nORANGE : please don\u2019t misunderstood with the title. This is just metaphor. Basically, we can find the Orange meaning in the third episode : \u201cThe Orange juice was tasted sweet, sour and full of sorrow\u201d, said Takamiya Naho. So the title of \u201cORANGE\u201d want tell us about Sad, Pain, Happy, Confusion all this thing always human through in daily life. (OK I got it)\\n\\n\r\nI'll start off my review about the situation of ORANGE series.\\n\\n\r\nNow just imagine, if you have a letter from someone else and then you read a letter about what will happen to you in the future. At the same time, your name down on the letter which means the only person who write the letter, it\u2019s you from the future. Fundamentally, Orange series told us about the Takamiya Naho gains the ability to read the future through her personal letter. Mainly point of this story is Takamiya Naho from the (future), give a letter to Naho (present). She\u2019s want to tell her about try to save someone from the accident and the name of person, she will save is Kakeru. Can we called it \u201cOpportunity\u201d or \u201cBig Responsibility\u201d. Absolutely, this is the big responsibility because this is about human life. Everyone must think that, it's up to Naho (present) to fix everything (Oh no, that\u2019s Awful Dilemma). At the beginning, the plot is mainly focus on Naho's thoughts and actions. It\u2019s absolutely show strong bias and is really difficult to someone who gains this ability can made the right decision. In fact, Naho is not DEUS EX MACHINA. \\n\\n\r\nThanks to Takano Ichigo Sensei because she\u2019s has good idea to made some a good development of the story. Hey!!!! Do you guys always heard this phrase \u201cTwo Is Better Than One\u201d : For sure, this metaphorical phrase everyone know about it. Human are not perfect creature because no matter who we are ; President, Aristocratic Family, Billionaire or Genius Person. We\u2019re still need help from someone else to achieve great success. Now, I altered this phrase \u201cFive Is Better Than One\u201d. Consequently, the plotline show the great climax, especially when Naho cooperate with their friend to save Kakeru from disaster. So yeah, Naho and also her friends is like a POWER RANGERS and Kakeru is just ordinary human being who\u2019s in trouble, so Naho & her friends received a mission to save Kakeru from any disaster. That\u2019s some ridiculous imagination I made. At least it doesn\u2019t show that Naho is like a BADASS character who only can save Kakeru and the best thing is all their friends actually got the \u201cFuture Letter\u201d. So the conclusion is for the beginning of the series, every character in the ORANGE series, they have thought up some scheme for making Kakeru to become their friend and they also know Kakeru will transfer at their school. All the things happen in the first episode is not coincidence but this is master plan did by Naho and their friends. One more thing is Takano Ichigo Sensei decide do not let 100% responsibility to Naho to fix everything in the story. If Naho carry all this things, is absolutely will become chaos. Thankfully, ORANGE series is not rush story. The medium of the story is quite decent and their characters always calm down to figure out something. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the concept of parallel world always appear in the Time Travel story and I think isn\u2019t something new. Popularized by the overwhelming STEINS;GATE, The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya, Doraemon & Primer film\u2026\u2026 I think is nothing to me to surprise about the medium ORANGE series but what\u2019s make this series called Sci-fi (Time Travel) because most people always think where\u2019s the letter came from??? And what\u2019s the type of machine they used??? Is it like a Machine in Steins:Gate or Supernatural like a ERASED. That\u2019s questionable of the story. The answer is they use black hole to send the letter into the past few years ago BUT HOW COULD BE???? forget about it. Nevertheless, one of the problems within the narrative is the script is the weak point of the series. Basically, every single script in the series too much of a spoiler to reveal. To put simply, the dialogue has been a bit of an emotional rollercoaster.\\n\\n\r\nFree spoiler for the next paragraph, yay!!\\n\r\nBefore I continue to write about their characters, let me help you to get the picture for each characterization act by the cast :\\n\r\nTakamiya Naho \u2013 Kind, Decent, Innocent & Na\u00efve\\n\r\nKakeru \u2013 Mystery guy, Pessimistic person & Madness\\n\r\nSuwa Hiroto \u2013 Cool guy & Passion\\n\r\nHagita \u2013 Weird, Funny & Cold guy\\n\r\nAzusa \u2013 Always cheer for people\\n\r\nTakako \u2013 Blunt manner\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s seem that Orange series include Love triangle. First, Kakeru fall in love with Naho. Another person who fall in love with Naho is Suwa Hiroto. Suwa\u2019s really love Naho and he\u2019s always care about Naho and always try comfort her if anything matters she couldn\u2019t endure it. He\u2019s really kind person and Suwa is not selfish guy. In fact, Suwa, Hagita, Azusa and Takako always support relationship between Kakeru and Naho. That\u2019s the good things he did to their friend. But another parallel world for the future, Naho and Suwa are married and also not forget they got baby, such a lovely couple.\\n\\n\r\nThe narrative part of the romance is backfired in several times. Let\u2019s refresh all the element of the relationship between Kakeru & Naho. Basically, ORANGE want to show us the romantic scene of Kakeru and Naho, but Takano Ichigo created Kakeru in such a manner as to reflect his struggle against depressed. Unfortunately the romantic scene failed in this series because of Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, the main issue with the show isn't the story. However, it's the characters, especially Kakeru. Besides, Kakeru is typical despair protagonist in the story. In fact, he isn't courageous to change his mindset, or calm, especially when he\u2019s get such a miserable fortune. Truthfully, Kakeru considers himself to be worthless. Unfortunately, Kakeru is the only characters who doesn\u2019t have a good development. He\u2019s fragile person and inconsolable. What Kakeru always want Naho to pity him and while this is not necessarily a bad thing. \u201cArrogant\u201d another key factor of the relationship between Kakeru & Naho become mess up. Sometimes I can\u2019t predicted what actually Kakeru want it. In fact, sometimes Naho did some mistake and try to apologize to him. However, Kakeru just act so cold or ignore to her. Seriously, I pitied Naho and I wanted to hit Kakeru afterwards. That\u2019s why I said their relationship it was backfired. It would be good enough if this story present us the romantic couple between Suwa and Naho. In addition to that, sometimes Kakeru just give up and he let Suwa to take care Naho. Besides, Kakeru just pretending he\u2019s like a tough guy. In fact, he\u2019s not think outside the box, if he lets Suwa take care Naho, is like a chance for Suwa to make Naho as a girlfriend. You can see that Kakeru is really indecisive & pessimistic & ignorant.\\n\\n\r\nORANGE it\u2019s not merely an adventure of love someone, it present us about the reality of post-traumatic stress disorder, especially Kakeru. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s vote the famous protagonist who have the great grief-stricken : \\n\r\n1.\tMabuchi Kou (Ao Haru Ride)\\n\r\n2.\tIzumi Shinichi (Parasyte) \\n\r\n3.\tLelouch (Code Geass) \\n\r\n4.\tEren Jeager (AOT) \\n\r\n5.\tEdward Elric (FMA)\\n\r\n6.\tArima Kousei (You Lie In April)\\n\r\n7.\tShinji Ikari (NGE)\\n\\n\r\nAll this characters is really famous and absolutely their attitude change immediately, from Zero to Hero. How could this happen?? This is because they loss a beloved person, especially their mother. Mabouchi Kou is the one who have same experienced with Kakeru.\\n\r\nSome parents are so worried that they remain in unhappy marriages, believing it will protect their offspring from the trauma of divorce. Next to avoid any horrible things. Since Kakeru was young, his mother divorced with his father, in order to protect Kakeru from abused by his father. There\u2019s love from his mother to Kakeru. Whatever mistake we had done, it doesn\u2019t good to drag those thing into our life. What actually we can do is, we must provide a new improvement, in order to heal our remorse. It\u2019s really sad when we know that someone we love, especially our beloved mother committed suicide on the day of the opening ceremony. That\u2019s what happen to Kakeru. I know, he feel regret after he ignored his mother last request. In Kakeru case, he\u2019s totally can\u2019t dealing with the death of his mother. Grief-stricken and confusion always become nightmare for him. One thing I couldn\u2019t understand about him why he\u2019s very passion to commit suicide????? The answer is he want to apologize to his mother in HEAVEN. He couldn\u2019t control his emotion and he become madness and rage. Kakeru wanted to kill himself because he thought he was worthless and he always said \u201cI want to commit suicide\u201d every single in the episode. In truth, the same boat to Kakeru would probably be Mabuchi Kou. Inevitable conflict make him become worst person. At least Mabuchi Kou is not crazy person who want commit suicide like Kakeru. In my opinion, in order to resolve the matter is Kakeru should calm and always pray the good things to his mother and also try to comfort himself, not babbling. Unfortunately the exact details of Kakeru's death and his mother\u2019s death were never explained, but it was needed. Which is to comprehend for the whole story.\\n\\n\r\nSo far, Naho is the most characters have a good development. At the beginning, we realized that Naho is just girl who has na\u00efve personality and decent in the series. However, she can alter all her behaviour because of Suwa always support her and the \u201cFuture Letter\u201d. Thankfully, in terms of her efforts is something I should proud. As we can see she\u2019s never give up to confess that she\u2019s really love Kakeru. For the great climax, Naho managed to persuade Kakure and they become a couple again. In fact, all of them have a great passion to save Kakeru and they did it. Finally, Kakeru become a normal person and he\u2019s cancel all his passion to commit suicide because he want have a good time with his friends.########MADNESS GUY\\n\\n\r\nNow it\u2019s time for Art & Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe animation for Orange is absolutely stunning, especially their eyes. Crucially, in terms of their \u201ceyes\u201d is really shaft and is absolutely fascinated when you look at it. The OST for the series is pretty decent, one of the best I've heard is the OP song. TMS Entertainment carry out the soundtrack is very meticulous for each scene in the series and the harmony musical instrument they put is quite comfortable. If you listen carefully. You could hear the soundtrack is really harmony.\\n\\n\r\nFinally,\\n\\n\r\nElement of enjoyment is difficult to me to describe it. Nevertheless, at least I know where the best part of romance in the series. However, the element of romance is quite melodrama and I think the concept of melodrama is good, it\u2019s kinda similar with Ano Hana and Ao Haru Ride, so Orange is something mix of story. If you think Orange is try to emulate Ao Haru Ride. Totally, you\u2019re wrong. Consequently, Orange story is attempt to add the new element and Takano Ichigo want to use it for attracted us (as spectators). In addition to that, Takano Ichigo might be someone who care about the \u201cthriller\u201d and she\u2019s realized that so many people seek that element. That\u2019s why she decided to put that element in the Shoujo manga. In order to fulfill people desire. Truthfully, I hate to admit it but my tears were running down on my cheeks because of Kakeru. I always remember what Sheldon Cooper (The Big Bang Theory series) said \u201cOne Cries Because One Is Sad. For Example, I Cry Because Others Are Stupid And That Makes Me Sad\u201d\u2026\u2026.That\u2019s what I feel when I watched the series and is really broke my heart. Precisely, ORANGE is resembles Ao Haru Ride and maybe Takano Ichigo & Io Sakisaka are best friends. (I know there are numerous people who disagree with this point of view)\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, 'ORANGE' Receives Anime Sequel Film on 18 November 2016\\n",

            "content": "Overall: 7/10\r\nMAL Rating: 7.97/10\r\nArt: 8/10\r\nIn regards to the art, it was done well.  At first, I had only seen a few series that used this art style so it took a bit to get used to.  Aside from that, the art was done well, but not in a way that distracted from the story. \r\nOrange seemed to rely on the story itself, while the art aided the setting in subtle ways.  For example, warmer colors are used during summer time, and in the wintertime, the colors are much more subdued. Things appear more grey.\r\nIt did well, highlighting the characters emotions, though theuse of closeups.  The facial expressions captured were believable, through the differences in the eyes and the mouth. (I have seen some shows where facial expressions more or less consisted of mouth open or closed.) \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI didn't seem to pay too much attention to the sound at first. Or rather, I did not notice anything missing.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack was decent.  I find myself often skipping the OP and ED of a lot of anime.  Orange was one of the shows where I did occasionally watch them all the way through.  The OP and ED did give this series a drama feel, which is appropriate.  Though I might not add either track to my personal collection, they were correct for the show.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nOrange really focused on anywhere from 1 to 3 characters: Naho, Kakeru and Suwa, in that order.  There seemed to be a lot of development of Naho, quite a bit of insight into Kakeru and then Suwa.\\n\\n\r\nThe other friends in the group supplement the relationship between the main characters.  The interaction between Azu and Hagita is comedic at times, and some viewers may find themselves curious about what their future might look like.  Takako seems like a girl who carries herself more seriously, and apart from being very supportive towards Naho, does not receive a whole lot of attention nor development.  If this series could have been longer, I would have liked to see more development out of these three characters.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru, though much of the story focuses on him, seems often to be more of an objective rather than a person, as the entire story and the rest of the main/supporting characters revolve around saving him.  Kakeru is a likeable character, but is written in a way that mostly reacts to actions around him rather than having his own will.  Then again, that is consistent with his character and background.\\n\\n\r\nThe two characters that seem the most alive, or realistic are Naho and Suwa.  Naho, of course, starts out as a reserved, shy girl that pushes herself to take drastic actions to save Kakeru.  The entire progression of the story relies on the pace and boldness (mostly lack thereof) of her actions.  I'll get to this later, covering the story, but the middle/later episodes move rather slowly because of this very issue: Naho's hesitation or lack of bold action.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa initially comes off as an Alpha Male, confident, tall, athletic.  While many people knock this sort of \"cookie-cutter\" character, but they do exist in the real world.  What I also do like a lot as the story progresses is that it becomes revealed that he is a very supporting character and makes decisions for the greater common goal while sacrificing his own desires.  Call it predictable, but it does add a lot of depth to Suwa's character.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nI might have rated this a bit low, Orange very well might deserve a higher rating.\\n\\n\r\nHaving never read the manga, I started watching Orange a bit after it premiered, so I was able to watch a few of the first episodes in one session.  The first few episodes I found very enticing.  There's the rule that if you should give each anime 3 episodes to prove they're worth your time.  While I've seen some that couldn't do this in 10 episodes, Orange got me from episode 1.  At times in the first few episodes, I actually spoke out loud towards the screen, saying things like \"Just do it already!\"  I immediately found characters that I liked and wanted to see them succeed.\\n\\n\r\nWhile Orange was airing, I also watched Boku dake ga Inai Machi (ERASED), based on a similar theme.  Perhaps this influenced my view of the later episodes of Orange, as I was able to get more instant gratification from Erased, while I had to wait week by week for Orange, and see minor steps forward.  A lot of the achievements or challenges that came up in Orange did not seemed to be given very much weight or importance.  (Maybe this is because I am mostly dead inside anyway.)\\n\\n\r\nThe main issue with the story reveals itself past the first few episodes.  They draw in the audience and place them in sort of a plateau of very slow plot progression.  When viewers commit to following any series on a weekly basis, they deserve a bit of a reward from the each episode. But again, the plot does follow Naho's own personality, and after the initial establishment of the story and setting, takes little steps, as Naho makes little breakthroughs.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's the letters.  This was not necessarily a bad idea, but at many times, it seemed like the viewer was made too aware of the progression of the plot, either through the letters, or how the story was written.  This applies to the characters as well.  If you're just starting, you'll know what I mean as you go through a few of the episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the story did highlight desires and conflicts of some of the characters, but it also lacked passion.  Some of the scenes were very appropriate and moving, but there were some that were lacking.  This is not to say that the characters try to save Kakeru out of obligation, but I would have liked to see a bit more emotion in certain situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the factors contributing, the characters personalities, the supporting sound and art, I did find this series pretty enjoyable.  \\n\r\nYou start with a very nervous, shy girl who feels like she is desperate, completely alone. You see her close friends pick up on the situation and unconditionally offer their support, even if it means making sacrifices.  They put their all in correcting past mistakes, creating a future with no regrets.  Though this cannot happen completely in real life, it is good to see people get a second chance, even if they are fictional.  This is no doubt, a \"feel good\" series, which is a refreshing break from the dark, heavy anime that I typically gravitate towards.  I liked this series a lot, compared to a handful that I have watched recently that have brought barely any reaction out of me at all. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I give Orange a 7, and do recommend it. I could give it an 8, but since I have to pick one, it gets a 7.  I look forward to watching \"Orange: Mirai\" when it airs.",

            "content": "I am not into shoujo or romance animes because they usually have no progression whatsoever--just two people who suddenly fell in love with each other then boom, they are now flirting with each other. \r\nI wasn't planning to watch this anime anytime soon, but I did because a lot of people were telling me that it would be good. I told them I was not into a 'typical' romance, but fine, I'll give it a chance.\r\nAnd I sure am glad that I have watched it.\r\nAs for me, I didn't see this anime as a romance or shoujo anime which aimed to make me feel giddyinside or make me want to fall in love. No. This anime is so much more. It wasn't about love for me. It was about saving a friend who has fallen into deep.\\n\\n\r\nDepression, something that people dismiss nowadays as just acting or just someone being so 'emo' or a 'jerk' or 'showoff' whatsoever. Depression is something people vaguely know, and I'm glad that it is now being represented and being made known through this anime. And they portrayed it quite nicely as Nanase Kakeru. A lot of people don't like him because they only see the shallow side of the story and fail to dig deeper into what the story is trying to make us see. Depression, suicide, they are happening, and as much as people hate it, unlike the anime, there will be no second chances. I saw Orange as something that would tackle this issue. It's something that is happening in reality. \\n\\n\r\nNanase Kakeru laughed with his friends, and so, they thought everything was fine. They thought that nothing's going on because he still was able to be happy and laugh with them--I have also heard a lot of real life stories telling the same thing when it comes to people who have committed suicide, and this is what happens in the story. But unlike in real life, the anime gave the characters a second chance to try and save their friend this time around.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that they needed this 'second chance' to change the future just shows that they were really clueless, that is why I didn't hold it against them for being so dense. They didn't know what to do, which is exactly what happens. You wouldn't know what to say, you wouldn't know the right thing. Know-it-alls would say, 'why didn't she do it' or something like that, but would you even know what to say or do if you were in that exact same situation? easy for you to say because you're a know-it-all. Anyway, I love how realistic it could be (except for the second chance they had ofc). Not everyone's gonna know what's the right thing to do or say, and that's just how it's gonna be.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed watching this anime. I, too, get frustrated at times, but then I remember that if I were in their position, I wouldn't know what to do, as well. Try to look at this anime in a deeper perspective, and you'll see that this is not about romance. This is about saving a friend so that ten years down the road, you won't have any regrets. And if you still do, then at least the regret will be lighter.",

The plot was pretty good and the artwork / music was alright, but what really won anime of the season was the friendship and character development these characters had.\r\nAt the beginning of the anime I expected most of the characters to be thrown aside except for Naho and Kakeru. Usually in these type of school-romances they tend to just throw the side characters away and let the couplegrow a closer bond. However most of the characters got plenty of screen time and got to grow a close bond to the couple as well. Honestly, i'd consider Hiroto Sawa just as important as Kakeru was considering how much time they put into the character. The anime didn't just feel like it revolved solely around Naho and Kakeru and it actually felt like this group was close and had a genuine relationship with one another.\\n\\n\r\nThe only real problem I had with Orange was how the plot just kind of hit a brick wall. For a while it was building up a steady pace but due to it only getting 13 episodes it got to a point where the plot had to really pick up the pace and just crashed straight into a brick wall. Honestly if Orange got 2 season's instead of ending it in one, I think this anime could have gotten anime of the year from me. The artwork and music were both pretty good and very fitting for the anime, but nothing too special.\\n\\n\r\nI definitely this anime is worth a shot if you're into the whole drama/romance genre. It kind of feels like a more adult version of Your Lie in April as it uses a more mature vocabulary and can sometimes be a little hard to follow.",

            "content": "Regrets. Many, if not all, of us have them, and this anime uses this concept to appeal to everyone. The plot of Orange is straight forward, however the realism in the characters attitudes especially Naho and Kakeru almost accurately portrays someone who has social anxiety with the character Naho and someone who is going through depression with the character Kakeru. If one is not familiar with social anxiety or depression this anime may seem overly exaggerated, but this is not the case. The backs and forths of the two characters going from good to bad to good again is exactly how individuals with social anxietyor depression would act like. There is no doubt that Ichigo Takano the writer and illustrator of Orange researched the behaviours of these types of people and tried to capture the essence of them in his characters. Suwa, Hagita, Takako, Azusa each have their own personalities that help support Naho and Kakeru. It is a well done anime that reminds us the important of friendship and to live life with no regrets. I recommend this to people who who may be going through a rough time or has social anxiety, because with this anime you get the chance to see how others see you and why they may not understand you or help you. As a person who had social anxiety myself, and still do to a certain degree, this anime was one of the things that helped me overcome and understand certain aspect which causes my anxiety and how to fight it.",

            "content": "That's right, I daringly gave this anime a 10 and I will tell you why. \r\nI'm honestly quite sad to see that most of the top reviews for this show aren't good ones because I completely differ. I realized many people who gave this show a low rating seemed as though they really didn't understand the show much. I shall begin with why I gave this show a bold 10, trust me, I will explain myself. \r\nStory: \r\nOrange deals with very taboo topics that are easily a hit or miss in this society. Topics such as depression and suicide can either be done very welland effectively or totally turn people away. In my opinion, Orange hits a complete bullseye. The way in which these topics are explored isn't too overwhelming but not too little, it was just right. We were shown enough to understand Kakeru's pain and suffering, but also enough to see how his group of friends saved him from that suffering. I found the theme of regret and wanting to save someone from their pain very powerful and enough to hit me emotionally. The idea of sending letters to your past self does seem far-fetched, but that's not really what the show was focusing on. The show's purpose was to depict the way in which many people hide their pain from others, other people never really take notice or don't do much about it, then hate themselves and regret so many things once that person is gone. Seeing this play out in an emotional roller coaster ride of a cute and cry-fest show made me click the 10 so quickly. \\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI actually enjoyed the art for Orange. It wasn't particularly beautiful or anything, but it had its own style that I liked. \\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nWOW the OST for Orange is so underrated. The opening is so good and the OST is so calming, I honestly suggest having a listen. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nWOAH this is where I will go off. I've seen many reviews trashing the characters because they didn't act \"realistic enough\". I think this was literally one of the most realistic portrayals of characters I've seen. Beginning with Kakeru, his depression and suicidal thoughts and actions were done very realistically. As a high school student myself with a similar friend group, I very much understand why Kakeru hid so much from his friends. When you're with your friends, you don't want to be in pain. Your friends are a place to forget your troubles and laugh it all away. This was the case with Kakeru, however, you can only hide so much until you eventually can't take it anymore. This explains Kakeru's sudden outbursts and why he always ran away or pushed his friends away. Kakeru was trying to deal with all of his emotions on his own which resulted in him letting out his pent up anger at himself on others, choosing to run away from his problems instead of facing them and not wanting to hurt or burden his friends with his own issues, thus pushing them away. In my opinion, Kakeru was a very realistic character who acted realistically. He was so troubled on the inside, dealing with so much regret and pain and guilt and blaming himself for everything that we as watchers can't help but honest to God cry. The simple ways in which you see his pain, from certain lines to clutching his mouth as he tries to cry silently by himself is enough for the story to deserve a high rating. The story handled its topics very well and very effectively, leaving the audience feeling the same pain the main character does. \\n\\n\r\nOther characters like Naho, sometimes she didn't make the right decisions, like never really speaking up or lacking confidence at certain moments when she seriously needed to be confident. However, it was all a part of her shy and modest personality. This again, is realistic. Naho says herself in the show that it's easy for someone from the future to tell someone in the present to act a way that's different from your usual self to prevent something from happening, but that it's actually really hard to change a personality. You're already doing the best that you can in the present. However, we see Naho gradually forget about what Kakeru thinks about her and rather do things for his own sake, even if it meant hurting him or having him hate her. The others were also very supportive which may have been a little too perfect, although, considering they had their fair share of regrets, wanted to make sure their friend who they miss dearly can hopefully choose to live and literally had letters instructing them on what and what not to do clearly explains why they were all so kind and supportive towards Kakeru, making sure he lives. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nOrange made me laugh, smile, get angry, scream, cry and everything else in between. Seeing Kakeru go through what he's going through and seeing him choose life, despite living being so painful for him, is not only satisfying but inspirational. This anime was an eye-opener for me, as in you never really know what somebody's going through, and how sometimes the little things you do or say can change somebody's life. It was also a thorough lesson about regrets, how we should also try to live life in a way wherein the future, we don't stand there and say \"I wish...\". It teaches us that it's important to look out for the people you care about, as you can lose them to something you didn't even notice before. Hope, happiness, belief, the many positive things you get from this anime left me in tears. It was beautiful to see this ragtag group of 5 come together to save their beloved friend who believed death was the only way to be alleviated of his pain, regret and sorrow. To see the manner in which they alleviate this pain for Kakeru is something that gives me hope for people who suffer just like him. \\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nOrange is great, just goddamn great. Looking for something short, sweet with a side of emotion and crying? Orange is perfect for you. Watch it.",

            "content": "Orange is a competent, oft moving high school drama that tackles the important issue of mental illness, something that affects many young people today, head-on, whilst also dabbling in the mysterious phenomenon that is time-travel. Below is an in-depth review as to how I fared with it.\r\nStory\r\nOrange\u2019s story had a number of strengths. For example, I found its premise and execution to be extremely gripping. Because, following the characters choosing to take a different course of action, the changes in their present day lives were so subtle, I was left wondering \u201cWill this group of friends be able to save Kakeru?\u201d and \u201cWhat effect wouldthat have on their futures?\u201d right until the end. Orange\u2019s portrayal of suicidality, depression, and how best to support somebody suffering with these things was also sensitive and accurate. It was difficult to watch Kakeru shoulder his troubles alone or be brushed off or offered unhelpful platitudes when he did try to reach out (a common issue for the mentally ill). But it was also moving to watch his friends do whatever they could to remind him just how loved he was and how much he would be missed were he to disappear from their lives. And whilst it\u2019s a dangerous mistake to think you can either save somebody or, through your \u2018careless mistakes\u2019, push them to suicide (ultimately it\u2019s the individual\u2019s own decision and responsibility) this can be forgiven as being a commonly held belief. Nevertheless, it was odd that a high school drama grappling with the issue of mental illness have an element of science fiction to it. But, thankfully, Orange didn\u2019t spend too much time focusing in on the exact science behind its premise.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nOverall, Orange had a strong cast of characters. As with its portrayal of mental illness, they were believable and realistic. Kakeru\u2019s friends\u2019 insistence on being able to \u2018save\u2019 somebody from the depths of depression was characteristic of the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of youth. And Kakeru\u2019s tendency to push his friends away shortly before clinging onto them again was also faithful to somebody wrestling with depression (take it from somebody who works in mental health). I especially fell for two characters in particular: Suwa, who was a hero, sacrificing his own happiness for that of his friend\u2019s, and Hagita, who had me in stitches on a number of occasions. My only problem was with Kakeru and Naho\u2019s relationship. Wow. My three-legged cat hobbles along faster than the relationship between these two characters did! If their relationship was typical of all Japanese relationships, it\u2019s no wonder they have a declining birth-rate! Their progression from friends to more-than-friends was so painfully slow and so devoid of chemistry it caused me actual bodily harm!\\n\\n\r\nArt and music\\n\r\nAt times Orange\u2019s art was amazing \u2013 all big, sparkly eyes, iridescent bloom effects, and soft, pastel colours \u2013 and at other times it was abysmal. At times the extras were extremely off-model, to the point where it bordered on the nightmarish (think the titans from Attack on Titan). Even the main characters occasionally resembled childish imitations of their usually beautifully drawn selves. I would have liked more consistency. As for Orange\u2019s music, it was charming and folksy, but, on the whole, forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall enjoyment\\n\r\nUnfortunately, my enjoyment of Orange waxed and waned. I loved its moving portrayal of mental illness, but hated the relationship between its two core characters and its occasional drop-off in terms of the quality of its art. Thankfully, its strengths vastly outweigh its weaknesses and I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking for a high school drama that deals with real and relevant issues.",

Maybe the best.\r\nThe series is directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki (Steins;Gate), and it has many parallels to his past work on Steins;Gate.  Both in terms of the deep plot, exploring the interplay between the past and future, tortured characters, and how much it demands of its audience.  \r\nThis series took me through a rollercoaster of emotions and pulled at my heartstrings, without ever feeling manipulative. It covered some VERY difficult subjects -- suicide, depression, guilt, love, loss, and friendship -- with much more subtlety than I think I've ever seen ina high school romance anime -- or nearly ANY anime for that matter.  It also made me really question the impact that one life has -- and all the ways the world can change (for good and bad) if you could save the life of a friend.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR:  Give it a chance.",

If you're looking for an anime that has the right amount of drama, romance, and life in it; this is the anime for you. \r\nIf I had to compare this show to another, Clannad: After Story would be just that.

This show wraps you around its finger and never lets go until you finish. \\n\\n\r\n--SPOILER AHEAD--\\n\\n\r\nThere are ideas that might seem silly like the ability to send letters back in time, but it's an anime; it's not a show based on reality. That being said, it's still a show a lot of people can relate to. The last two episodes contain so much emotion it's unbearable at times. Taboo topics like suicide are so easily brought up in this anime and they honestly do such a great job of giving us insight into the mind of someone struggling with pain, suffering, and regret. \\n\\n\r\nI'm really glad that I chose to watch this anime because I certainly do not regret it. It's amazing being able to learn something from a show, and I did exactly that. If you're thinking about watching this show, please do. I'm sure you'll be mildly surprised how much you enjoyed it and the time you invested. Ignore the ratings, watch it. Seriously. Don't regret passing up a gem like this. Thanks and enjoy!!",

Sometimes he acts absurdly. I think the whole drama in the last episode was just made off.

Because during the anime episodes, we follow the present and the future.\r\nWe follow the attitudes that each character has.

            "content": "Orange, within the first few episodes, was almost unbearable to watch for me. Between the dreadful cliches, to the confusing cut scenes between the future and the present, I almost gave up on this anime. However, I continued in hope of better enjoyment, and I'm glad I found it.\r\n- There are spoilers in this Review. -\r\nStory: 8/10\r\nAs someone who has experience with being someone who has the weight of a suicidal person on them, the story was rather believable and it covered important topics. I sometimes wish I could send a letter to my past self, to prevent certain events from happening. This story keepsyou on edge, questioning what was going to happen next. There's a certain progression in the story, which makes it so good. It doesn't reveal massive info all at once. It brings it out slowly, and it keeps an air of mystery. The dark topics portrayed in this anime are all brought out nicely, and correctly, for that matter. Overall, I found I had a pleasant time keeping track of what was going on.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nThe art itself, at times, was quite good. However, the characters were often drawn to look much older than high school age. Some of the details were rather poor, and the facial expressions were a bit comical in some episodes for such a serious anime. This could be chalked down to the budget, but I still can't say I'm impressed in any regard.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting was great. I have no complaints on that regard. However, I have to take a lot of points off for music. It wasn't memorable or significant in any sense, and I just couldn't find a way it added to the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 5/10\\n\r\nI'll start off by saying these characters are... almost textbook definition of cliche. I enjoyed Suwa and Kakeru, as they were both rather interesting to watch. Suwa was far too selfless for a high school student, but the dramatic portions of Kakeru were spot on. I've seen many people say it's over-dramatized, and they should have cut back. However, it was entirely realistic. Suicide is a dramatic topic, but a very serious one. He reacted very similarly to what I've experienced, and it's not at all dramatic for him to be upset over the death of his mother. \\n\r\nHagita, Azusa, and Takako were all rather... unsignificant. They were very clearly a representation of cliches, with Hagita being the intelligent nerd, Azusa being the friendly and outgoing girl, and Takako being the silent but badass type. Insignificant, to say the least, but they had their moments that set them out as people. Granted, towards the end, but I digress. \\n\r\nHowever... Naho, to be blunt, is an idiot. I don't care that she was meant to represent being awkward and shy, but she made me want to bash my laptop against a wall. She couldn't see what was glaringly obvious. I know that's so it can be realistic, as teenagers aren't the most perceptive, but it was to the level of obnoxiousness. There are times when it was too subtle, and it made sense for her not to understand. However, there are times where she was told to do something plainly, given advice multiple times, saw the same action as she had been warned about play out in front of her, and she did nothing. \\n\r\nOverall, I just couldn't find myself enjoying the characters. I was dedicated as the next to Naho and Kakeru's relationship, but Naho made the anime significantly less enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nI wouldn't mark this as a bad anime. As a fan of shoujo anime, I find the boring high school days enjoyable, so that wasn't off-putting at all. However, this certainly would not be the first anime I would recommend to anyone. If you aren't a fan of shoujo anime, and you can't stand the boring repetitive days of school, this is certainly not the anime for you. Even with the serious topic of suicide added, it's still just people being annoyingly awkward to each other and classes. However, if you can stand the deep topic, an infuriating main character, and the repetitiveness of this type of anime, it's worth a watch, at least once.",

            "content": "There\u2019s a particular scene of Orange that will stay with me for years to come. In this moment, Naho, the protagonist of Orange, attempts to console Kakeru by providing him with emotional support only to realize there\u2019s nothing she could do to \u2018save\u2019 him from his own emotions. It was absolutely devastating to watch. Everything in this moment executed Kakeru\u2019s frailty with a crushing weight that persisted through the scene with increasing intensity. The sullen look on Kakeru\u2019s face as he avoids Naho\u2019s eyes and the hoarseness present in both the character\u2019s voices as they spoke punched me repeatedly in the gut. It was heavyand uncomfortable. The ambience of the cicadas gradually overpowers the scene for a moment. As the cameras pan away, her attempts at consolation sit there in total silence. As that moment lingered, I felt my heart sink into the pit of my stomach. The scene continues with Naho\u2019s moment of epiphany as the cicadas give way to a guitar somberly playing in the background. At that moment, she realizes how what she\u2019s saying doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cWhat\u2019s okay about it?\u201d she asks herself as she tells Kakeru everything will be alright. Then, Kakeru asks to be alone. Moments later, she follows that trail of thought with, \u201cWhat does it mean to save someone?\u201d Those words evoked a feeling of helplessness and anguish that felt far too palpable. It was at this moment that I realized this show was something special. I could not bear to see Naho choke on her own emotions as she fumbled over her words to find what to say. After all, what could she say? To me, this scene embodies everything Orange is about; learning to love. While the romantic love presented in Orange is an integral part to the plot, that\u2019s not entirely what I\u2019m getting at. What I mean is, learning to love at its most fundamental level; the type of love that you can only show others after you learn to love yourself. A cyclical type of love that truly allows you to forgive yourself so you can love and be loved.\\n\\n\r\nOrange begins by following a high school girl by the name of Naho who\u2019s late for school. While she gets ready to leave, she notices a letter addressed to her and tucks it away in her bag. When she arrives at school, she unpacks her bag and skims through the letter, noticing something rather peculiar. The note is addressed from the her of 10 years into the future, pleading for her to follow the steps in the letter she has laid out to her. In it, future Naho had accurately predicted that not only would she be late for school, but that they would be getting a transfer student by the name of Kakeru Naruse. The letter advises her to not commit the same mistakes she had in the past and that she must absolutely watch over Kakeru who is no longer with them in the future.\\n\\n\r\nOrange delicately explores the emotional states of most of the characters in the show to an excruciating amount of detail to drive this subject of learning to love home. I say most because there are some weakly developed characters like Ueda-Senpai, however they play very minor roles in the overall narrative. Orange explores this thematically through the debilitating guilt that plagues the cast\u2019s every decision. When we get glimpses into their future 26-year-old-selves, we see the guilt manifesting in their environment as a form of paralysis; every time they\u2019re shown it\u2019s always as if they\u2019re stuck in a loop. They\u2019re consistently looking off in the distance as they talk to each other, reminiscing of day the Kakeru had left them. This notion of looping is only enforced by their long and abrupt pauses in dialogue. In their past high school selves, it\u2019s a sense of guilt that makes the characters hesitate and second-guess themselves, knowing that the weight of their every decision could have dire consequences. I really enjoyed that the series explores that maybe fixing the mistakes of their past selves isn\u2019t as simple following instructions. Even after a life-time of making mistakes, they\u2019re still learning how to be vulnerable. In order for them to help Kakeru, they have to first help themselves get through their own insecurities. Is it annoying and draining at times? Absolutely, but this is what forms the heart of the story. It\u2019s what makes the characters feel much more grounded and humane. Saving Kakeru is not as simple as following the template the letter has given them. It\u2019s about forgiving themselves so they can help Kakeru forgive himself.\\n\\n\r\nOranges greatest strength is also one of its many weaknesses. Out of all its convenient plot devices, the only part of orange I had qualms with accepting was in the convenient usage of the letter (not that it was always bad). When it\u2019s used right, it gives insight into a character\u2019s inner dialogue and shows their conflicting opinions. It paints their fears and insecurities in a way that was relatable to me, allowing me to urge them on even after they make stupid mistakes. In fact, I love that they make mistakes not because I love to see characters suffer, but rather because it filled me with joy to see their strength of spirit. However, sometimes when they second guess themselves, they fall into the trap of adhering to instructions of the letter too tightly, making them feel like puppets on a string acting out a script that is preordained. It cheapens the drama by adding an element of predictability, but honestly, this is me just being nit-picky. It did make some parts feel exhausting to get through. It\u2019s just something I wish they would\u2019ve handled a little more carefully to give this show that push it needed to be a true gem.\\n\\n\r\nBut don\u2019t let that deter you from exploring Orange. I could not recommend Orange enough for its ability to capture overcoming grief in such a moving and captivating way. I\u2019ll warn you though. I was a complete mess after finishing this series, so if you do decide to watch it, you better be ready for an emotional roller coaster. I probably haven\u2019t felt like this much of a wreck after finishing a series since Your Lie in April.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\u2014 Palpable T_T\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor more full or seasonal anime reviews, visit my blog at http://palpableemotion.wordpress.com\\n",

            "content": "One day, Naho Takamiya receives letters that claim to be from herself ten years in the future, each letter describing a different day and what she must do to prevent her \"biggest regret\". At first, she thought it might just have been a prank but just as the letter described, Naho and her friends befriend the new transfer student named Kakeru Naruse who joins her class. As other events occur just as the letter said they would, she starts to believe the letter was real and starts to follow instructions, slowly falling for Kakeru while unaware of what the big regret will be.\r\nThe show soundslike it's sci-fi but it's mostly romance and friendship. Most of the time the show is really happy and cheery - a little over-exaggeratedly so and I think they go overboard with the friendship too. I think the idea was to portray the strong ideal friendship where everyone would do and give up everything to save a friend's life. We see how Naho's friend Suwa has feelings for her but instead of trying to win her heart, he actually tries to spur Kakeru and Naho on. Seems a bit too much even if it did give a reason for Kakeru to live on. There could have been better ways while they kept the competition fair.The whole time leap idea with letters seem shoehorned in too since it isn't given much focus on how it happens like in Steins;gate.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand, the visuals and music are really good. This show is probably one for anyone into heavy friendship themes with a little romance thrown in.",

            "content": "I can relate to this anime a lot, and especially to Kakeru. I also am living with a lot of regrets that I can't get past. I have always wished there was a time machine so I can go back and undo the things that I have regretted. The feeling of regret is probably one of the most tormenting feelings in the world. What would happen right now if I were to jump back in time and fix the past? What would become of the future me then? \r\nI could relate to the show in whole because I also knew a friend that had depression,although I didn't know it then, I had wished that I could've at least messaged them and say hi or just seeing how they were doing. When a friend dies, especially if you're close to that friend, the feeling of regret that they couldn't save them from taking their own life will forever stay there.\\n\\n\r\nI was never really into romance or shoujo genre animes, but this is the one time that I was actually even interested in watching this show.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe anime Orange is a show about a guy named Kakeru Naruse, who had transferred into Naho's school, and became one of the six in the group. However, Kakeru is a depressed boy, with feelings of immense regret, to the point that he wanted to die, because he thinks that his mother's death was all his fault. The boy portrayed his mother as an unreasonable and selfish mother, such as getting a divorce without letting him know, throwing out his soccer cleats without asking him. His mother's death was the greatest act of selfishness and torment to him. When he transferred to Naho's school, he became good friends with Naho and became one of them. He eventually falls in love with Naho, and Naho one day receives a letter, which recites the events of the day, and she came across the letter where it says that Kakeru is no longer with them in the near future, and that the reason of Kakeru's death was no accident, but it was intentional. That all leads down to the spiral of Naho and her friends trying to save Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe most important characters we have here are Suwa, Naho and Kakeru. Of course, I will lightly touch up on other characters too.\\n\\n\r\nNaho: At first, she was a shy and reserved person, who tries to do everything she can to save Kakeru. However, there were at times when I really wanted to punch the screen or yell at Naho. Like the times when she hurt Kakeru's feelings unintentionally and didn't apologize right at the spot. She frustrates me sometimes, but I feel like we can kind of relate, because I am also a shy person. But she can be dumb at times too, such as when Kakeru held his hand out to hold her hand but she didn't know, I would be yelling at the screen like, \"WTF, you're so dumb!!!! Just take his goddamn hand!!\" But overall, I think she's an okay character, and she developed throughout the series too.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa: Suwa is like an extremely kind guy, and he even sacrifices his relationship chances with Naho to save Kakeru. You can really tell that he genuinely cares for all of them, and he isn't afraid of speaking what's on his mind.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru: He is the main guy character of the story, and probably the most depressing anime guy too (next to Arima Kousei in Shigatsu). He is the most like me, in the sense of bottling up feelings and then snap when the feeligns explode. He never tells his friends what he's truly thinking, even though they genuinely want to help him. His romance with Naho was really cute, and it was funny that he dumped Ueda after like a week or so of dating. He really cares about Naho and his friends and he thought that by dying, he wouldn't be able to hurt them anymore. \\n\\n\r\nAzusa: I think Azusa is like the relief of the story, along with Hagita. Their relationship is perfect, and I don't see why Hagita won't admit it and just date already!! \\n\\n\r\nHagita: Hagita is a pretty chill guy, even though he's like the quiet type.\\n\\n\r\nChino: She's a bit boyish, and she defended Naho from Ueda. She got me chuckling when she said, \"Oh? Since I'm the nasty bitch, I'll tell everyone that you're bullying an underclassmen.\" Or something along those lines XD \\n\\n\r\nART 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is alright, when Kakeru smiles it is really cute though! I don't really have much to say on this, but the drawing is not outstanding but neither is it bad.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND 7/10\\n\\n\r\nAt first I didn't really like the opening song, but I kind of got used to it as I watched from episode to episode. I didn't really care for the ending song either, actually I skipped it.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this anime, and I would recommend others to watch this show if they like a good romance/tragic anime. It had a lot of feels, and watching this show during break is just something one should do!\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI liked and enjoyed the anime, as I said above. If one were to feel suicidal, one should think about how much it would hurt the people around them, the people that knew them, and especially the people that were close to them. If there's anything that's troubling you or if you have feelings of regrets and feel the pain of it, don't be afraid to speak up and talk to your friends about it, they will help you overcome your pain. If you committed suicide because of it, then in the future there would be no you, and you would have no future to look forward to. Live through the pain you're having now, and don't wait to speak until it's too late. Also, to the people that might have friends who might have been showing signs of depression and contemplating on committing suicide, lend a ear and stretch out your hand to them, you may have saved a life by doing so.",

            "content": "The story was awesome. I'd been putting this anime off for a long time because I've never really given that many Shoujo a chance. But when a learned it was related to time travel in a way, I thought it was pretty awesome and gave it a chance.\r\nArt starts out amazing. Looked to be one of the most detailed artworks I've seen recently... Sadly though, the art drops at around episode 7 or so, but it makes a comeback. You'll definitely notice the laziness in some parts, but it doesn't occur enough for that to be detrimental to the anime.\r\nThe sound was good as well.Not sure what to say about it. Good sound. Good music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters were all pretty awesome. It would have been cool to have a bit more focus on the other main characters of the series, but even so, it was still great. Especially liked Higata.\\n\\n\r\nI never wanted to drop this series. Had me fairly entertained both comically and emotionally throughout the whole show.\\n\\n\r\nI loved it. My reviews are probably more biased just towards how much I enjoy them, so a few setbacks here and there aren't gonna make me give a poor review. If you enjoy something, why nitpick at all the little things?\\n\\n",

I like how it turns the idea of sending letters to our future selves upside down and deals with the idea that everyone's regrets can be encompassing. In the end I am glad I saw this anime to the end. I like how the anime revisit scenes to give the audience the perspective of each character and how it limits him/her. I also like how the anime make it seems what weas the audience are witnessing is only a small part of what is going on in everyday high school life by adding off screen conversations and exclamations. However I wish some of the characters could be fleshed out a bit more by giving them their own problems and challenges to overcome. It makes you consider if there is really such thing as free-will wouldn't it be inhibited by lack of experience, education, or everyday forces. I wish the anime focused more on the future and past education on how to help a troubled person and if it did what more interesting obstacles would the group face when trying to save their friend?  In other words what does it take to make the world enlightened to help troubled people effectively for mutual benefit when they don't have the luck to create and sustain meaningful relationships?",

            "content": "Often with the \"high school romance\" type anime, they're pretty similar with one another -- the love interests, the rivals, the occasional misunderstanding and then eventually the story comes full circle and everyone gets the ending the audience anticipated from the beginning. Orange is incredibly unique in its own way, tackling the sub-genre in such a way that's imprinted on me and how I view the world.\r\nSTORY\r\nIncredible storyline. The plot is somewhat relatable to me as a high school student, and the emotions portrayed are very real. It's about stepping beyond your comfort zone and being courageous enough to take the steps you know arefor the better. This anime shows this in the main characters, particularly Naho, Kakeru and Suwa. It was a thrill to watch their development as people of a story from beginning to end.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\r\nI'm gonna be blunt -- not my favourite thing. I even took screenshots of scenes where the art of faces, background images or other things that were so hilariously drawn it looked unrealistic. While I can appreciate scenery, I really think the character expressions and even the fundamental facial structure was a bit all over the place. This definitely bugged me at times.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\r\nThe voice acting sounds so natural, not the kind that is obviously someone reading from a script. It sounded like real-life recorded dialogue in an everyday setting of high school friends, though at times the strong emotions portrayed in the voices may have been a bit overkill for some scenes. The music is beautifully ambient and creates an atmosphere that leaves you always wondering \"what's going to happen?\"\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER\\n\r\nAs far as high school romances go, you can only do so much to make each character uniquely distinct from everyone else, especially when you don't have the same freedom as a \"fantasy\" genre does. While the focus was on 3 out of the 6 main characters, there wasn't really anything that drew you in to like the person-- the challenge this anime presented me was to try and appreciate the characters in their ordinary-ness.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT.\\n\r\nWhile this was a great anime to me, I'd read the manga a number of months before the anime was released, and there are obvious bits and pieces that the manga does much better. But watching the manga coming to life in animation was a thrill in itself to watch and am glad it became an anime, where music, voices and colour can all be added to the paint tin to create an even more beautiful masterpiece.\\n\\n\r\nA story about a group of friends who send letters to themselves 10 years in the past to themselves in high school in hopes of fixing unfixiable regrets. It is because of this series that I journal often to myself, and even write a yearly letter to my future self. This show opened my eyes in so many ways and really put things into perspective for my own thought life.\\n\\n\r\nAbsolutely watch this if you're into the high school romance stuff, but also read the manga. The manga is worth your time <3",

            "content": "At first, I was a little skeptical, yet really curious as to how this show would play out with its theme. As a shoujo, many people would expect it to just be \"blah\" about it and everything turns out well: WELL LETS JUST SAY this: while some pretty predictable things do happen, it's the way it happens and how it happens that make this a pretty memorable show. \r\nThe art style (in addition to the genre) was what attracted me to this show, and it didn't disappoint either. The small town/country setting sets it aside from most other similar anime and gives off a relaxedslice-of-life feeling.  The music does very well to amplify the aura of the situation and is easy to listen to. \\n\\n\r\nSome characters, we don't know enough about them to relate to them, but they still play their roles well enough to make the show enjoyable. Kakeru, for example, goes through some very stressful life disasters and his responses to them may inflict the watcher in different ways. For me, or anyone with depression and symptoms of depression, it really hit home. From his actions to the very words he says in those times, it struck a chord with me just how deep this show was trying to go. Even when he's the character I ended up relating the most to, I also saw myself in Naho, who tries to help him, even when she doesn't quite understand how. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this show. I didn't have many dull moments with it either. The comedic moments made me laugh the most I'd laughed all day when I watched it. And *sniff* there were definitely moments where I just had to cry, out of sheer resonation with the scene or just plain \"why did he do that????!\" and \"oh my god what\" >3< *  /on a side note, the scifi aspect doesn't really start to kick in until towards the end, and when it does it really gets you thinking (if you're the type of person)/ \\n\\n\r\n~~third review \u2022\u2013\u2022/",

            "content": "This is NOT spoiler free, you have been warned.\r\nOrange is not about Oranges! I know, I was shocked too.\r\nOrange is about a girl named Naho and her friends each getting a letter from there future selves respectively. It turns out that a transfer student they befriend Kakeru is no longer with them in the future as he killed himself not too long after they meet and thus they are to use the foresight these letter provide to save Kakeru and give him a future and at the same time they also take care of a few other regrets. \r\nIt's a shoujo so it's got thedrama, the school and the romance. There's also the weird sci-fi element since they have letters from the future which they kinda just gloss over the whole time travel thing. Like they explain it and everything but it's absolute BS and they would of been better off just doing Science-Fantasy instead of Science-Fiction.\\n\r\nBut that's not really a huge issue, it's anime so I'm able to just shut up and accept what it tells me, I have my limits but this is more than acceptable really. Anyway thanks to the letters these group of friends end up trying to save Kakeru from his currently inevitable death, and at the same time basically pair Naho up with him. It's a love story, there's a triangle, the usual but with the letters from the future twist and overall I really like it for that. Even if there were no future letter stuff I would still like it enough, it wouldn't of caught my interest and I may of never watched it but if I had watched it I still would of liked it, cause I like romance anime. Even if it's generic as crap.\\n\\n\r\nNaho is a pretty solid protagonist, you might want me to go into depth for all these characters and what they do and what makes them tick, which I could do. But I don't actually enjoy that, this is my review so it's meant to just be why I like it. So I'll just tell you how I feel about each character. \\n\r\nNaho is the protagonist and being voice by Kana Hanazawa makes her absolutely adorable, I love how cute she is. She looks like the usual shoujo protagonist, she's got the eyes and she just reminds me a lot of Chihaya from Chihayafuru and anything that reminds me that show gets a massive plus from me. A lot of things from this actually remind me of Chihayafuru.\\n\r\nNaho and Kakerus relationship is something I should talk about, and how it looks from Nahos point, Naho does straight up fall in love with Kakeru and due to her foresight thanks to the letters of the future she is able to have a leg up, knowing what Kakeru is thinking during certain points and she also knows how not to act. Even then she still sometimes stuffs it up.\\n\r\nShe really does care about Kakeru and I belive how these people fell for each other, nothing seems fake or forced at all, it all seems very natural and how someone would act. After all Naho has the letters but her feelings sometimes make her still cause the wrong thing to happen. \\n\r\nNaho has very neutral reactions to things too, one part I like is when she tried to ignore the letters and continue to protect Kakeru just by acting on her own feelings and emotions, it's pretty material to think that you might need to do this, after all the letters only go up to a certain point, eventually once Kakeru is saved it's impossible to know what will happen then, she needs to know she can trust herself and not rely on the notes. Of course this proves impossible as she definitely needs foresight to save Kakeru and after the initial save it might be easier she ends up concluding. None of this thought process is directly told to us so maybe I'm just reading to deep but that's the vibe I got as I sat there watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa is a guy in the love triangle that isn't Kakeru. I like him, his solid enough. He supports Naho and Kakeru to an immense level and is constantly helping to save Kakeru and he actually does more work then Naho does to this level. Obviously Naho is his stability and he loves her and all that but what she directly does is way less then Suwa.\\n\r\nSuwa sets up all there time together, he actively goes out of his way to give them time together, he also likes Naho but he gives her up for Kakeru because he can see that she really does love Kakeru and not him. Suwa also finds out in the letters that his future self is married to Naho and that they have a kid, Future Naho says that even if Kakeru was alive then she still would've gone on to marry Suwa and so future Suwa asked now Suwa to keep that aspect the same and confess when he's meant to. But when his meant to confess and comfort Naho he doesn't, he outright just tells her to go after Kakeru, obviously they want to save him but this isn't the night his destined to kill himself. Suwa gives up his future that future Naho claims can still be real even with Kakeru around all for the sake of a better chance at saving him, it's absolutely insane.\\n\r\nIt's crazy but it also just shows what a good guy he is and it doesn't stop there. He is the no.1 at getting Kakeru to tell the truth. Kakeru is extremely unstable and thus he has many moments where he is extremely sad or depressed or thinking suicidal thoughts but won't tell anyone about it, they notice these moments and know how extreme they are thanks to the letter but Suwa is the only one who starts anything. Sure all the friends help out and in the end there all with him and on his side but Suwa starts everything and is the best at getting Kakeru to let them know what's going on and trusting them as close friends. And thank god he's so good because he also reminds me of a character for Chihayafuru, shoujo art style is consistent!\\n\\n\r\nKakeru kinda sucks, not gonna lie. His alright some of the time, mainly when he is actually happy but even then it's a little bland. His best moment is definitely the relay race which is also just one of the best moments in the show, personally I think Azumanga daioh did it better and with more emotion and that's a comedy for god sakes, but still it's really good here. Now I like shoujos and drama in my romances so i get that everyone is gonna be over melodramatic, they need to be. It helps make things more entertaining and it's how something like romance which should only be interesting for those involved, something that can be watched and even be intense at times.\\n\r\nKakeru takes it too damn far those, he's the most moody and overly dramatic character to ever exist and guess what he also reminds me of someone from Chihayafuru but he reminds me of a cool, calm and collected character. But Kakeru is so freaking moody, I get it his depressed I really do. I'm not trying to be insensitive but here's the thing. One of my old friends from high school was depressed and let me tell you, depressed people are not this bad nor are they bad at all this often. Obviously Kakeru has a lot of inner demons and has a lot to deal with, due to his mums illness she became unstable when Kakeru decided to hang out with his friends instead of taking her to the hospital. Thinking she was a bother to him and wanting him to be free to do as she wishes, she killed herself for him. Of course Kakeru doesn't even find this out I'll the end of the show and it's part of the reason he kills himself.\\n\r\nThe point I'm trying to say is that yes his had it rough and his bound to be suicidal and this he is, he even says he thinks about killing himself every day, blaming himself for his mother's death. But here's the thing, he sometimes just brings his mum up and her suicide for no reason, like just out of nowhere he will be a huge buzz kill and bring her up. Let me give two examples.\\n\r\nAt one point we get a wrap up of how major events went in the timeline that lead to Kakeru's death and we get to see differences and such. At one point Kakeru meets up with some old friends of his from Tokyo (his a transfer student remember) and there all sitting there talking, catching up, having a good time and then just out of nowhere he interrupts people to say \u201cmy mum killed herself and now I wanna do the same\u201d now he didn't say it like that but it's the jist of it. Here's the thing, you wanna tell your friends about this, maybe seek there help. That's good, do that. But don't do it like this idiot, everyone is having a good time and it's not even your turn to speak, you interrupted people to say this, the mood wasn't right, no one is going to believe you when you say it at such a time. No one is expecting such a massive buzz kill so they shake it off and assume it's a joke, I don't think the Tokyo guys are bad people, they seem like good friends and fun people to be with, I completely get why they reacted the way they did.\\n\r\nThe other is when Naho and Kakeru are alone and Kakeru is talking about how his grandma has been getting better (she went into the hospital at an earlier point) however he also wants to go home and check on her, Naho thinking his too unstable atm tried to keep him around by saying that she will be fine and all this, she knows that Kakeru's grandma is fine since she's also still alive in the future and the letters say this. However when Kakeru brings up that she can't possibly know, she can't really deny it since she can't let him know about the letters.\\n\r\nAnyway, Naho says that his grandma will be fine and he's just like \u2018I though my mum would be fine\u2019 and then his able to just pull away from her and go off to his home. Now it's somewhat fair to think like this and kinda even to say it but not really in this situation, I've had friends who had there mum die while they were still in school and such and I'll just tell you that one of them was a scum bag and acted just like this to get his way. Like getting more time of school avoiding chores, it was so obvious he wasn't sad but that didn't stop him playing the dead mum card and I kinda feel like Kakeru is playing it a bit too much. I don't really hate him, most of the time his fine really but fine just means bland and other then that he's just a massive asshole, also his love for Naho is nice but it's a little creepy, he\u2019s a bit too happy about it and is just way too like giddy when with her, plus his smile that he has when with her is also kinda creepy. It's sweet overall and Naho is great but Kakeru just has a lot of not so great moments and outside of that his pretty bland.\\n\\n\r\nBut he's not nearly as bad as chino. Chino is a perfect example of a useless character, I actually don't know why she's there, maybe the manga she's more important but she seriously does and adds nothing. So she's another one of the friends of Kakeru and thus also has a note from her future self, but she doesn't do anything at all. She's good friends with Azusa another one of the group, we\u2019ll get to her. But here's the thing, Chino is always with Azusa but Azusa is not always with Chino. This is because Azusa actually has stuff going on with herself and she actually has a role in the story and does stuff, Chino doesn't do anything. \\n\r\nAnything that Chino does is with Azusa as I said, because of this it's all stuff that could've just been done by Azusa alone, none of it needs two people. It's mostly just stopping ueda (a bully to Naho) from being a bitch any longer. Azusa could do this by herself and since she also has other stuff going on it would make her a fine characters and she is fine. But Chino is useless, Chino is also the only main character to not have a love interest, she doesn't love anyone, nobody loves her and she doesn't have any kind of crush or some sort of interaction like that with anyone. The only Character in the main cast like this, it's a romance and everyone has someone to aim for but Chino is just nothing.\\n\r\nShe does nothing on her own, she doesn't love anyone, no body loves her. She contributes nothing, she doesn't give extra interactions to other characters, she barely talks with anyone outside of Azusa and when she does it's pretty bland and generic stuff. She doesn't add anything to anyone else since she has so little interactions, she adds no dynamic nor does she really make comments on anything and the few times she does she's more so just agreeing with someone rather then having her own opinion. I don't really know anything about her, she's just useless and really good friends with Azusa.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, a little less negative now. Since we just spent some time talking about her let's talk about Azusa. Now I like Azusa, she's way better then Chino. Everything they do together should've just been Azusa, obviously that means Chino can also do it alone but Azusa also has stuff going on so it's better to use someone who matter. After Azusa there's only one more friend and main cast member and since I said everyone else had love interests you can be that Azusa and this last character Hagita are totally into each other.\\n\r\nThere relation is a big bland since they both obviously like and dislike each other, massive tsun's but they let there guard down and speak there true feelings more than a tsun would which makes it a bit more real. They speak there mind and are true to themselves they just back track sometimes and maybe be a little tsun every now and again and there's defiantly not in a relationship. But it's more than Chino ever gets and I like the little side relationship anyway.\\n\r\nAzusa is cool, I like her cause she's pretty casual and chill, I'd say she's my favorite girl of the cast with my overall favorite being Hagita, she's not a super main character, after all she isn't part of the main triangle and she doesn't have a shining moment like Hagita but I like her more than Kakeru and she's not Chino.\\n\r\nGod I keep talking about how horrible Chino is, sorry to anyone who likes her but you have the worst taste, she is objectively a useless character. If this was chess she wouldn't even be a piece, because even a defeated pawn is worth more than her. Azusas overall role is the story is a little lacking and she's more so there for the extra relationship but she also helps out with Kakeru and I can understand and warrant her getting a future letter too, she doesn't really need one but I can understand it. Plus she's cute and more cute girls is never a bad thing, overall I liked her alot and I think her somewhat a bubbly dialog and personality really helped a somewhat lesser character shine in my mind.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about Hagita, Hagita is awesome. Hagita in a way is really underrated, he actually has a ton of big moment and he's probably the most important person in reality. In the future we see that he is the one who figures out how they are going to be able to send the letters back in time, also being a voice of reason making sure the others actually understand what they're doing and that it won't change anything for them but just make an alternate timeline where Kakeru may survive. \\n\r\nHagita also manipulates Kakeru's bike toward the end of the series in order to stop him from using it since Kakeru rode his bike in front of a truck to kill himself and this is extremely important since it means that Kakeru has to walk and thus the others get enough time to save him (I warned you there we're spoilers, no one better get mad at me) his the real hero in the end in my eyes.\\n\r\nHe is the reason that the letters are able to be sent back and he also ends up saving Kakeru really, even if everyone else did what they did, Kakeru would be dead without Hagita doing what he did, and everyone else told him not too as well. He did it outside of everyone else's plan.\\n\r\nHagita is also a voice of reasons which is nice to have in a time travel show, he questions the morals and ethics behind what there doing, how they are Changing The future and creating a separate reality basically all for the sake of Kakeru living on, how much is one person really worth. A good line he has is when he talks about how they changes the future of the relay race and now Kakeru won it and thus there team, red team, won the whole athletics day.\\n\r\n\u201cKakeru won now, however in the Original timeline he lost, this means the person who was meant to come first has now come second and red team, we lost but now we have won.\u201d \\n\r\nThis affects so many people, they changed a lot and in the end it was all for Kakeru but they changed the lives in some small way of everyone at that school due to the scale of there change. Hagita a logical thinking, calm head and moments of being the real hero make him a great and awesome character, plus his whole thing with Azusa is cute as I said before.\\n\r\nAzusa and Hagita may be a side relationship but I like them both way more than the actual main relationship, but I'm glad with where everyone is. Kakeru is at least good to have cause he affects others, basically is the reason the story is able to move and gives so much to the group dynamic as a whole, chino is just trash.\\n\\n\r\nThe art style is very shoujo, have you seen a shoujo before? If you said yes then you are a good person and will also know what this looks like. If you never seen a shoujo or don't like them then we can never be friends and you can just look at the screenshots for what the style is. It's almost always the same. I personally like the shoujo style, I think the eyes are great and I also like the way it makes hair looks and everyone just looks so pretty and/or handsome, I don't care if it's unrealistic as fuck, it's good to look at pretty people.\\n\r\nThe voice is great, I mean we got Kana Hanazawa so that's already a strong point. It's also got Sakura Ayane (God I hope I didn't get that completely wrong) even if she is a minor role. So two girls are legit everywhere and have quality acting, everyone does there role well. I don't know about Chino though since she doesn't do anything, I can't even remember her voice, but I. Sure the quality of it was fine, since that wasn't her issue. (God I'm really ripping into her)\\n\r\nThe animation itself is consistent and nice, it doesn't really do anything extra or less but then again the shoujo art style does make nature look really beautiful and the show is defiantly beautiful if nothing else.\\n\r\nThe opening and ending are too generic for my liking, I know I just went on about how much I like the generic stuff and with a lot of anime I enjoy the generic stuff and I say do what works which is why they things can become generic. But I like my opening and endings to have some meat, it not just the bland generic music but it's also the visuals, it's so goddamn stale and generic which is a shame, defiantly one of the worst aspects is the opening and ending. (not as bad as chino)\\n\r\nThe background music does its job but that's about it, it also doesn't do it with flare or super well. It's just kinda there and a sometimes it not for effect but overall I feel like it doesn't make a difference on my score, it's just there. If that's an issue for you though, well, now you know. Overall it's a mixed bag for the presentation.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it, when you get down to it I enjoyed orange for the most part, I spent time watching it and I never really felt like it wasn't worth it. I enjoyed most of the charters, Azusa is awesome guys. And I liked the shoujo style,  it's also just been awhile since I watched a shoujo, I need to watch them more so that was also good. It also had the interesting future element.\\n\r\nThe cliff hangers weren't really cliffhangers, I was never on the edge of my seat or felt like I had to watch the next episode but I kept watching because it was fun enough.\\n\r\nIf you like romance, mainly shoujos then this is for you, if you haven't seen a shoujo but like romances then defiantly check it out. If you just think the future letter element is interesting then maybe don't watch it, it's a romance first and foremost and the future letters are pretty small when there entire value is to advance a romance. Keep that in mind going in, cause I didn't know that going on. For me it only made it better but some people don't like that.\\n\r\nI was never really fully invested though, I was half wanting Kakeru to die in the end, not because I hated him but because it would be the show having some teeth and do something I wasn't fully expecting. I also kinda wanted them to have a replacement, like maybe Kakeru's Ex that they broke him with and basically ruined her life would kill herself, a death costs a death and by saving Kakeru they did make her pretty miserable and she defiantly wasn't happy. But alas, nothing.\\n\\n\r\nOrange was solid enough and for that I give it a 7/10 - good.\\n\\n\r\nWrap-up\\n\r\nThe story is nothing special in reality.\\n\r\nThe characters are mostly great but have a few let downs especially when the main love interest is bad.\\n\r\nPresentation is overall great, I loved it.\\n\r\nEnjoyment was pretty solid, but I wasn't super invested or anything.\\n",

            "content": "Summary-Naho, a second year high school student, receives letters sent from herself 10 years into the future. Her future self asks her to prevent her \"biggest regret\", which has something to do with the new transfer student from Tokyo a boy named Kakeru. At first skeptical Naho begins to believe the letters as they accurately predict events.\r\nAnimation- The animation for the series is done very well. the character designs look very nice as well as the background. problems can be seen from long distance shots, but those rarely happen.\r\n7/10\r\nSound- The soundtrack is average nothing really stands out, but it's not bad. The voice acting wasdone well, so no complaints there.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nStory- Now the main theme about this whole story is about regret. Things that could have been done, but didn't, leading to the first timeline where Kakeru died. It isn't tell the letters are sent back in time where the main story is set that tries to give theses problems. The problem is that the time travel is never explained or presented leading to a cheap plot device where things are already figured out before they happen. It's also ridiculous because it seems they don't read ahead in the letters only what's next.\\n\r\nThe positive note is that they are able to figure out ways to show that things can't be changed so easily or the way they wanted to be. Such as the letters not changing, leading to the idea that it's starting some parallel universe effect where one timeline doesn't affect the other because they're separate. they're where something that still couldn't be stopped like Kakeru's mom killing herself. \\n\r\nalso the romance aspect wasn't that great. sorry not sorry.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\r\nCharacters-Not much too say about them, they're all 2-dimensional with the exception of Kakeru(a bit). they all have unique personality, but nothing really changes about them. however it doesn't mean it's bad since they all have great interaction with me each other.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment-There wasn't much I can say I enjoyed about the show, it was at times boring or endearing. also maybe because I'm a guy\\n\r\n 6/13 episodes\\n\r\nConclusion- good animation, above average soundtrack and characters, good voice acting, and an average story that needs more improvement.\\n\r\n5.5/10\ufeff",

            "content": "I am writing this review because it seems that a lot of people do not understand the purpose of this anime. Orange, is not a masterpiece, however it is pretty darn close. It gives the audience a story and fulfills what it set out to do: telling a story about friendship, love, and depression. Not only does it accomplish this, but it ties it up in a knot, what I mean is that this anime-unlike many MANY others, finishes. It finishes and it feels complete. \r\n    The story line itself is pretty simple, it's about time travelling in a sense, yes, butit doesn't dwell on it or does anything unnecessary with it (like Steins Gate and many other \"time traveling\" anime do). But, this anime isn't really about that. This is one of those stories were the conflict isn't always the purpose of the story. Now, that is not to say that the plot gets pushed aside, it doesn't in any way. But, this anime likes to take a pause every once in a while and focus in on some simpler matters. It does this so that the audience pays close attention. And, it works. In no way is this anime slow or boring. Slow is a relative word anyways as is boring. When the anime is \"slow\" it is with reason. \\n\r\n   The characters are the best part of this anime. There isn't an overwhelming cast; and that's why it is perfect. This isn't like those animes where everyone gets a center episode or everyone gets tragic backstories. No, consider this like a slice of life, but much more minute. Like I said before, this anime is about the characters interactions with the character Kakeru. It is about five friend's sacrifice for their friend. The exception for their platonic love for one another is beautiful. And, even the romance between the main characters Kakeru and Naho is one of the cutest, purest, and best developed relationship's in a shojo anime. A lot of people say that the characters choices are stupid, but they are not really; each character makes a good choice for the situation they are in. And in a scenario where characters are fighting between two versions of their decisions that's a hard choice to make. \\n\r\n   And, here is the other thing, this anime does a wonderful job in diving into deeper issues than is normally explored in anime. Depression, suicide, guilt; all to a different extent to. Yes, some choices by the characters are frustrating, but when someone has depression there are certain things that happen. Orange does a fantastic job at treading lightly-while still showing the effect of these issues. \\n\r\n  Now, where I think the anime falls a bit short, has to be the animation. But, that is because of one thing: it's different. The style of Orange, is unique, maybe in a good way, but to some bad. I particularly wasn't fond of it, but it grew on me over time. Especially the smiles, the smiles are such an important part of the anime, and at firs they look weird-even disproportional. Overtime, it grows on you though and gives you a warm feeling. Fortunately, the animation makes up for it in it's music, maybe the actually scores themselves are not masterpieces but the opening and ending is spectacular. Especially the ending, because it is what you hear after every episode, and it pulls on the hearts strings (look at the lyrics and you'll know what I mean.)\\n\r\n   Overall, I think a lot of people missed the point of Orange. Yes, the plot could have been fleshes out a bit more. The \"letters\" aspect was all over the place at some parts of the story. But, the importance of the letters still stood, it created the base of the story, it led the characters to each other and really found itself by the end. I think that Orange is one of the best shojo animes I have ever watched. And, it is because it was both powerful and emotional enough to have me care. I was hooked on Orange since episode one and it is an anime that I will forever look back on. \\n\\n",

            "content": "Dear TrashDax of the past,\r\nbe less of a dumbass.\r\nYours,\r\nTrashDax of the future.\r\nStory:\r\nAs I probably stated elsewhere, I'm a sucker for time travel stories. Nobody actually travels through time here, but the concept s very similar. Naho is a very reluctant girl, who does not have the \"balls\" to be as active as she needs to be to save Kakeru. Also, it's not certain at all if changing things will really save him or not. Put a developing romance on top of this and you have an interesting story with lots of possibilities. Too bad some of the developments are rather dumb and hurt the overallconcept, like the revelation of how the letter got into the past or how the relationship is handled.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI understand that making an anime is an expensive venture, but if you're making an anime like Orange, that has really beautiful visuals and character designs, it hurts a lot if you put in some \"cheap\" episodes. I know, every anime does that, but that is still not an excuse. There is one episode especially (I think it was 9, but I could be mistaken) where every character looks horrible and it hurts the experience of watching. However, when they actually use their budget, Orange looks pretty awesome.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe seiyuus are doing a very good job. It should be understood that Hanazawa once again does a perfect soft-spoken cutie, but all the others are absolutely on par. Both opening and ending are pretty nice, relaxing pop songs that fit the anime well. I have no memory of the background music, which in doubt is more positive than negative.\\n\r\n9/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nNaho and Kakeru...just Naho and Kakeru. These two have made me really mad. Naho is a very oblivious, ditzy girl that occasionally borders on being mentally retarded. The fact she is too anxious to actively handle the situation is excuseable, yet still a little annoying. Kakeru uses his depression as an excuse to treat others (especially Naho) like shit. I have no idea why the others like him, he has no redeemable qualities at all. The actual star of Orange is Suwa, who is the only one who tries his best to make both main characters happy and acts reasonable. The other three try their best as well, so no hard feelings towards them.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nIf you are looking for \"the feels\", Orange might be your cup of tea. If you can ignore some of the stupid aspects of the main relationship, you will most likely enjoy it a lot. There are enough developments to keep you interested and a thrilling final episode (which is twice as long). I liked Orange, but it also annoyed me many times with the dumb decisions of Naho and Kakeru. In the end it was still worth it however.\\n\r\n7/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n7.2/10",

I was engrossed and hooked on the ideas of futures changed by letters and such. It was a pretty fresh idea and I liked it. However it took a turn for the worst at about episode 7 on wards. At the beginning it was original. It was logical. And then it got plagued by ridiculous theory's about how they sent the letters and it completely took away our attention from the story's of the teenagers. Utterly disappointing to be honest.\r\nArt- 7\r\nAt first (a running theme in this anime) i lovedthe art. I hadnt seen a style like it so it was fresh and crisp. They eyes of the characters were especially nice for me. Then oh my god it went down hill. It crashed harder then the truck that hit kakeru. Episode 7 onwards it just became lazy and unfinished. I would have loved to give art a 8 or 9 but i really couldnt after episode 7. Honestly the 7 rating comes from my fond memories of the beginning. Again it was so disappointing.\\n\\n\r\nSound- 7\\n\r\nVoice actors were nice. Kana hanazawa was great as always, I especially liked her as Naho. The other voice actors were pretty standard. I personally liked the opening alot. At first i was doubtful and was debating to skip it but it grew on me. I really enjoyed the guitar part at the start of the opening as it made the theme sound more original. The ending was standard however and pretty generic. Overall average background music, perhaps below average at times. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter- 6\\n\r\nI didnt like some of the, in my opinion, subpar character development. We were presented with a gang of friends but only really got to know 3 of them. What about Azu and Hagita's seeming blossoming relationship. I want to know more about them. But we got the bare minimum. the absolute bare minimum. Pretty dissapointed tbh\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment and overall score- 8/7\\n\r\nIm a huge tragic romance addict. I love them, meaning im absolutely biased towards animes like orange. Perhaps im slightly dissapointed with the fact that it didnt really end up tragic. I came watching this anime expecting something like Anohana or Plastic memories. I came out getting an anime that didnt turn out anything like the former names animes. There is one word that can essentially sum up this anime. Disappointing. So utterly disappointing.",

            "content": "It's hard for me to write this review because as soon as i knew Orange was getting an anime, i counted the days to watch it, because i loved the manga so much! but OH BOI was i disappointed... I'm not gonna complain about how the manga is better than the anime, because i hate those kind of reviews, so i'll make this review based ONLY in the anime. \r\nSTORY 10/10 \r\nAs a shoujo fan i can tell you this anime has a more complex plot than any shoujo out there, because shoujo animes aren't complex at all lol. \r\nEven though Orange is a shoujothey manage to put a subtle supernatural touch to it, and i liked that. I think the story is the most outstanding thing in the anime, because it's not your typical shoujo with a school setting and the \"pls notice me senpai\" clich\u00e9. This anime is about love, yes, but it focuses on friendship a lot and that's great because people who dislike romance might enjoy it as well, that was my absolute favorite part about this anime. The story seemed a little bit slow at times but i prefer that rather than the story being too rushed, but i really liked the plot.\\n\\n\r\nART 1/10\\n\r\nHow should i start with this?? the animation was shit. The first few episodes were fine, but then at like episode 7 or something the animation went to shit, i feel that the animators said \"well fuck it\". The faces were so poorly drawn, the eyes were uneven and sometimes when they showed them from a distance it felt like a 4 year old draw the body. Maybe they had a low budget idk but this was really disappoiting to me, to the point where it distracted me a lot from the actual story. Animation and art are really important to me, i feel like those are the reasons why i like anime so whenever i see a bad animation is hard for me to watch or i don't like it that much, and i really wanted to like orange but i just couldn't. The characters design was ok but the animation in general was just ugh.-\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER 7/10 \\n\r\nI hate to say this but sometimes the characters seemed like an empty shell with a voive, they didn't expressed a lot of feelings so i didn't sympathized with them a lot, except for Suwa, i think he's the best character out of all the anime. The main characters were annoying and dumb af and i think they could've had a better development, they had the potential but in the anime it just doesn't feel like they advanced that much, they just stay dumb till the very end, but for a shoujo anime the characters are fine, trust me. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT 7/10\\n\r\nI'm giving this anime a 7 only because of the story, i really wanted to like it since i loved the manga but i just couldn't, the animation just didn't work for me. The story is pretty good tho and i have to say i did cryed a lot of times (i'm such a loser for romance anime). So concluding with this review i'd say it's a good anime if you like romance you HAVE TO watch it, obviously if you don't mind the animation. Too bad they did this with an anime i expected for so long. :(",

SPOILERS AHEAD\r\nStory 9/10: The story is not your generic Rom-com, slice of life, drama type genre. It actually adds in a new story to the whole anime scene! I loved the story line! It had a good balance of backstory to main story, it wasn't to confusing to follow and even a kid could of followed it! I didn't expect to see how this anime turned out, I thought it was going to be your typical romance/high school story type anime.. I didn't read intoit at all and actually went in on a limb after watching a few clips on youtube about it! But it was an amazing story that even touched the hardest of hearts! The story was well put together and followed to basic rules of anime.. Pretty girl, pretty guy fall in love, the argue/fight, make up and blah blah blah! BUT it was still amazing! All the cute moments even made me some what sloppy! >.>\\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10: The art kind of threw me off for the anime personally at first but I decided to look at it after all.. After watching a few clips on youtube I realized it wasn't as bad as I thought it was! Nothing seemed outta place and it all looked good!\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10: I don't really care much for music/sound unless it just sounds dead right awful ! :D \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10: Now let me say! I loved each character individually and they all made for such an amazing pairings in the end! Each character was well built and even made the story better with their own little moments! But let me say.. How dense and stupid are these main characters!! At some points they'd turn into baffling idiots and not have a clue! It made me mad sometimes watching it and would actually make me rage! Like damn! But overall, each character was very entertaining to watch develop! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: I really enjoyed it and if you're looking for a good romance anime that has a strong plot with it then definitely check it out. The ending seemed well put together and If I would of searched it and found Orange: Mirai I would of had alot of questions afterwards.\\n\\n\r\n-------------------------SPOILERS----------------------------\\n\r\nI'm glad the orange: mirari showed us the timeline of Kakeru and Naho ending up together! It definitely made me have a little closure to the entire series!",

            "content": "Orange is a wonderful mix of everything that is right with Shoujo manga and everything wrong with Shoujo manga. Great Premise, horrible characters at least Naho and Kakeru are. \r\nI can't talk about the Story though without talking about the Characters. As I said the Premise of the story is great and for some reason these always happen to hook me. But the way it seemed to only get dragged on by Characters that seem to act like there 6 and not 16 hurts the whole plot-line. So if your looking for consistency in your anime avoid this at all cost and just read themanga i heard its a lot better though I'm skeptical. \\n\r\nThe art is actually quite good for the most part it's Shoujo so they go for the lighter colors in almost all the scenes. But just like the Story and Characters it's inconsistent. Usually i can give it a pass but the amount of times where i ended up seeing faces that seem to be right out a 4th graders sketch book is ridiculous. I don't know if they were rushing it or what but the show is all the worse because of it.\\n\r\nI didn't have a problem with the Voice actors/Actresses though Kakeru's voice didn't exactly pop specifically in the more dramatic scenes. The Opening and Closing are just kind of there almost as a after thought.\\n\r\n     I still thoroughly Enjoyed the story line despite Oranges many many flaws. I'm a sucker for happy endings. All I can say is if your coming for a Shoujo title then here it is. Problems and all.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI really like the color orange; it\u2019s one of my favorites from the rainbow.\r\nOrange, like any other color, has symbolism attached to it. Happiness, energy, fun. It\u2019s a pleasant color that keeps the mind and body at peace in its welcoming, warming glow.\r\nOrange, the anime, may be a dramatic tale that ultimately tastes more sour than sweet. But, at its core, it is just as warm and happy as the color it channels.\r\nSTORY\r\nIn Orange, Naho Takamiya receives a paradoxical letter addressed to her \u2013 from her future self. In this letter, events play out exactlyas written, and it lays out what Naho should do differently this time around. Naho can barely believe what\u2019s going on, but, when the letter directs her to protect and save her new friend Kakeru Naruse, she makes it her mission to follow the letter and change the future forever.\\n\\n\r\nWhen first looking at Orange\u2019s narrative, it does not immediately give off the sense that problems will soon arise. That letter seems physically unfair, but it\u2019s simply a way to get the story started. Naho somehow still fails to follow the letter despite how it gets literally everything right, but it\u2019s chalked up to (as Naho would claim) the fact that people cannot change their personality so suddenly (which is true). And Naho\u2019s feelings for Kakeru get sidelined for some jerk girl, but the audience hopes that the two obvious lovebirds will get somewhere eventually.\\n\\n\r\nOnce the story starts to get underway, though, these elements do become problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe idea that a black hole, known for their gravitational warping and massive sizes, exists somewhere within the Bermuda Triangle on Earth treads into ridiculous territory (more ridiculous than future-past letters, anyway).\\n\\n\r\nNaho eventually puts away the letter, believing that she can make the right choices on her own. A valiant effort \u2013 if she hadn\u2019t already been screwing many of the events up even with its help. Worse still, the anime randomly writes in all offhandedly how, after some time, she starts looking at it again. As if the short period without its aid meant very little.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the romance \u2013 if it can even be labelled as such. Strong moments like the hand holding at the pool as the fireworks sound off exist. But when Naho freaks out at even Kakeru\u2019s slightest touch, and when they refuse to officially get together and instead opt for this weird, pseudo-boyfriend-girlfriend-but-not-actually relationship, the anime puts them in this frustrating zone somewhere between friends and lovers (without the benefits).\\n\\n\r\nOn a larger scale, the plot twist, that all of them have their own individual letters, is one of the better moments since it is not that predictable and it makes the rest of their fevered involvement more understandable in hindsight. However, it also invites the inherent problem that, since they all own letters, then next to nothing should go awry because they have five simultaneous people telling them each what to do. That\u2019s with ignoring the fact that they can all just read ahead and plan everything out meticulously.\\n\\n\r\nThis minor plot annoyance leads into one of Orange\u2019s worst plot conveniences. The letters describe, word-for-word, what happens and what they should do. However, as is shown, the plot goes where it wants when it wants to. Sometimes it follows the letter, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. The explanation being that their deviations from the set path rewrite what\u2019s to come. In other words, the anime gets to unnaturally pick and choose whichever plot points it wants to cover, avoid, or have happen without consequence.\\n\\n\r\nDespite all these problems, Orange still manages to give its more dramatic moments justice. Kakeru revealing the reason for his early absence comes as a shock and as a dose of reality. His breakdown with Suwa at school and Naho\u2019s subsequent confession comes from the heart. The final deliverance of the letters from their future selves to Kakeru marks a definitive turning point in all their lives.\\n\\n\r\nThese scenes are personable, earning emotion and empathy through their kindness and understanding. Furthermore, the anime\u2019s themes on hardship and longing and trust are relatable topics, sorrowful feelings that many people have experienced and can easily relate to.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the major takeaway running through everything is its mantra on no regrets. Naho, Suwa, and the others do what they can to correct the wrongs that their future selves made, hoping to not only experience a better life for them and their friends but also save Kakeru in the process.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not an absolute idea; nobody has no regrets. Indeed, the very catalyst for the whole plot \u2013 Kakeru avoiding his mother the day she committed suicide \u2013 is a regret that Kakeru, Naho, and the others must carry for the rest of their lives. And, in the older, future timeline, they must carry an even harsher regret: not having done enough to protect Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nBut these very same regrets inspire them to improve themselves. They learn to listen to Kakeru and one another. They start thinking less about themselves and more about the ones they love around them. And they simply aim for their own cherished happiness. In other words, they reflect on what they have done, and they think about what they will do moving forward.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, that\u2019s what matters most in Orange. Not the unfair letter or the silly decisions they make or the frustrating romantic moments. But rather the lessons one can take away from this anime. Lessons that may not make up for the regrets one already has but makes getting at a life of no regrets easier than ever before.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nOrange finds itself surrounded by controversy during its run \u2013 and for very fair reasons.\\n\\n\r\nBefore getting into this unavoidable discussion, it\u2019s worth noting that Orange is quite a pretty show during its first four or five episodes. Most noteworthy are the character designs and the realistic setting. Their toothy smiles, the detail in their eyes, and the casual, green school clothes they wear which complement their plain yet attractive looks demonstrate a lot of care on the creators\u2019 part. And the backgrounds, which sometimes seem to be ripped right out of real life, give the different scenes their weight through expert use of lighting, realism, and detail.\\n\\n\r\nThen somebody behind the scenes flips the wrong switch.\\n\\n\r\nIt cannot be understated enough: Orange\u2019s art and animation gets bad. Really bad. It possibly goes down as one of the worst decreases in quality ever in an anime and, if nothing else, one of the worst within the last few years.\\n\\n\r\nParticularly, episode nine is almost unbearable. Character reactions are unfitting, models are poorly drawn, and the high amount of activity required by the characters as they run, tackle, and move during the school competition just cannot keep up.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, it got so bad that it redefined how horrible an anime can get on a visual level before it starts to hamper the actual watching and digesting of the show itself. It would not have been so intolerable had the plummet not been so grand. The gap between the crisp, refined looks of the characters to the degraded, laughable mess that appears on screen is huge, making the unfortunate transition from the former to the latter a punch to the gut. And the face. And the eyeballs.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOrange has a decently sized cast: Kakeru, Naho, Suwa, Azu, Hagita, and Takako (in order of relative importance).\\n\\n\r\nOn the low end sits Takako. She arguably has one moment in the whole show: when she threatens Ueda, the mean upperclassman that briefly dates Kakeru, with violence should she try to hurt Naho in any way. Beyond this brief scene, Takako sadly sits on the sideline as little more than a cheerleader. The anime does not explore a possible relationship with Suwa in this timeline, and she doesn\u2019t seem to have any special connection with Kakeru given the lack of interactions between them.\\n\\n\r\nHagita and Azu are similar in that they do not interact with Kakeru all that much. Hagita at least tries to teach Kakeru about comedy, and Azu comes off as the most active of the bunch, bringing them all bread when they hang out or smiling with glee at her efforts to get Naho and Kakeru shacked up. They have an edge over Takako since their meager, implied romantic relationship (that never comes to fruition) provides some fun banter.\\n\\n\r\nAgain, these three do not get much attention throughout Orange. This outcome can be seen in one of two ways. Either as a negative since they are part of the show to a respectable degree or as something not worth worrying about since the other three are more important. It\u2019s most likely a combination of the two.\\n\\n\r\nRegardless, Orange places a lot of focus on Naho, Kakeru, and Suwa.\\n\\n\r\nWith Naho, the anime emphasizes a certain trait of hers. When the group first comes together, and Azu brings her family\u2019s bakery\u2019s bread, Naho does not speak up about wanting the curry bun that she likes. Instead, she says, \u201cI\u2019m fine with anything.\u201d Sometime later, she explains to Kakeru how, if she can, she will do her best not to inconvenience those around her, letting everyone else get what they want before she does.\\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, this very trait of hers gets challenged, becoming the main conflict and drive for her character. For while she remains the same, kind Naho, she now must take it upon herself to \u201cinconvenience\u201d Kakeru. Talking with him about his feelings, pushing matters when he resists, and generally being there for him when she can.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s not easy for her as the audience sees. She expresses how people cannot immediately change their personality, and, despite knowing exactly what not to say, she still doesn\u2019t get through to Kakeru quite right when it truly matters.\\n\\n\r\nEven so, she gets closer to him. More so than anybody has ever done before. He bops her head in a playful manner. He gets her a hairpin that she cherishes. They connect at night, hands holding tight and fireworks booming overhead. While Orange awkwardly keeps this couple in a together-but-not-really status, there\u2019s no doubt Naho\u2019s relationship with Kakeru turns into something special.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough, too many times does Naho fail to understand the situation or refuse to make a necessary move. Either because the anime wants to extend the drama or because Naho seemingly hasn\u2019t grown as a character, her inability to inconvenience Kakeru despite what she experiences only serves to negatively frustrate the audience through her unyielding trepidation.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, this situation is where Suwa comes in.\\n\\n\r\nNot counting Kakeru since he\u2019s the target of their support, Suwa goes down as the most rational of the group. The person who the audience can rely on to say what needs to be said and do what needs to be done. Another common (and perfect) way to put it, Suwa is the bro-est of bros through and through.\\n\\n\r\nSuwa\u2019s initial characteristics paint him as gluttonous for food, tall in height, and skilled at soccer. His affable personality puts his friends at ease and brings them together. But, most important of all, he truly cares for everyone. Especially Naho and Kakeru. He encourages Naho not to run away at crucial moments, pushing aside his own feelings for her to save his good friend. And he doesn\u2019t back down from Kakeru, embracing him and yelling at him to demonstrate just how much he means to him.\\n\\n\r\nHe\u2019s not like Kakeru who changes as a person over the course of the season, and he\u2019s not like Naho who has a fundamental part of personality challenged. Suwa is simply the right guy in the right place at the right time, and, without him, nothing would have changed for the better, making him arguably the most important person of this story.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, though, this story is not about Takako, Hagita, Azu, Naho, or Suwa \u2013 it\u2019s about Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru is a quiet kid. A main reason why he connected with Naho rather early on given how energetic and forward the other members of the group are. However, the group does not get to be with him for very long early on because he misses school for many days in a row.\\n\\n\r\nHe later confides in Naho why: His mother committed suicide the day they invited him out. While he seems somber about what happened, he never outright complains or shows emotion. In fact, he goes so far as to apologize to Naho for speaking about something so personal.\\n\\n\r\nLike Naho, it\u2019s in this moment that the anime highlights a certain trait about Kakeru: his reluctance to express emotion. He\u2019s a very troubled person who does not like sharing his thoughts with anyone. Be that because he does not want to harm those he loves or because he feels as though nobody else will understand his grief, Kakeru often keeps his true feelings contained.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, his emotions can and do escape him. His infectious smile rarely appears, but, when it does, the audience knows that he is truly happy. His tears of sadness prove how much he has been hurting. His outburst towards Naho, the girl he loves, indicates his anger easily enough.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru\u2019s struggles with his emotions are nowhere more evident than in episode twelve. As the entire plot of the future timeline plays out, he hides his thoughts, he maintains his somber quietness, and he ultimately (and semi-accidentally) ends his own life. In other words, this timeline shows what happens to Kakeru when he keeps everything bottled up and nobody tries to open what he has sealed shut.\\n\\n\r\nWith this characterization in mind, Kakeru represents a realistic portrayal of someone fighting desperately with deep depression. That unwillingness to share what\u2019s inside him, the outward signs that are tough to catch, his negative feelings of worthlessness and self-blame. Even when he tries to talk about his current state with his old friends, they dismiss him. An all too common occurrence for people, depression or otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nTruthfully, it can be annoying watching Kakeru only reveal part, rather than all, of what he\u2019s feeling to Naho when they sit on a park bench at night after the local festival. And it gets extremely frustrating when, near the end of the season, he continuously distances himself from her after their small argument. But this annoyance and frustration means that it\u2019s real. Many people act in a similar manner when they are going through something as or even more tumultuous.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, Orange treats his character with respect. Yes, maybe slamming his phone on the ground is a bit over the top, but, for the most part, his troubles and his representation make him someone not only relatable to those who have experienced similar thoughts but also understandable to those who have encountered another person like him.\\n\\n\r\nThankfully, Naho, Suwa, Azu, Hagita, and Takako are there for him. They encourage him during the school competition, each friend carrying one part of the mat as they listen to what he wants to say. They each ask about and get him a present for his birthday. And they each run out late on the fateful night to search for him before he does something that he and the others will regret forever.\\n\\n\r\nThrough their efforts, both big and small, Kakeru does not follow through on getting himself hurt. The time he spent with them \u2013 the relationships he formed, the thoughts he shared, and the fun he had \u2013 stick in his mind and let him realize that he has a lot in his life to live for.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that it\u2019s exactly the same for the audience, too.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe strength of Orange\u2019s opening track does not just come from the acoustic guitar and the passionate singing. It also comes from how it synergizes with the anime itself. The piece feels like having no regrets, capturing the spirit of the story that it precedes and filling the audience with a satisfying sense of direction. It\u2019s a wonderful track that stands as the highlight of all the music offered.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending track goes directly for a bittersweet tone with a slow pace, emphasis on violin, and some harmonizing vocal work. The length of the track is perhaps a bit too long, but the piano, chimes, and softer guitar playing are gentle on the audience\u2019s ears, keeping the ED from completely overstaying its welcome.\\n\\n\r\nAnd while the voice-acting performances are nothing worth praising, the original soundtrack sticks with what it does best. Tons of acoustic-guitar-heavy pieces, added piano for sadness here and there, and woodwind instruments for that slight sense of hope. Like the OP, these tracks get at that feeling of no regrets that drives Orange, adding to the show\u2019s overall level of execution.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nWhile watching this one, I had one of those moments where I said, \u201cAre you me?\u201d with one of the characters: Naho.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve thankfully never lost anyone close to me to suicide, and I\u2019m not a female, so these characteristics of hers are not ones that I relate to. So, what is it about her that I not just empathize with but actively take part in myself? The answer: not wanting to inconvenience others.\\n\\n\r\nNaho says, \u201cI prefer it if it\u2019s just my loss. As long as I\u2019m not a bother to others.\u201d I cannot list how many times my family has gotten frustrated with me when I maintained a similar mindset. Not bothering the waitress if she sends the wrong side dish with my meal. Accepting whichever movie gets proposed for viewing that night. Saying nothing when I have a headache because everyone seems to be having fun.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, I don\u2019t like making more trouble for those around me. So, when Naho felt or acted the same, I understood where she was coming from. She was obviously in a much more serious situation than ordering dinner, but it was still interesting to see a part of myself in animated form and know that I, too, can learn to be a bit more assertive in my everyday life.\\n\\n\r\nBesides Naho, I also liked Suwa. I felt sad that he was passing up his own chance at romance, but his sacrifice is something commendable and something I only hope I could replicate if I were also stuck in the same position. Hagita and Azu\u2019s bickering had me laughing. And Kakeru, despite his (understandable) sometimes standoffish attitude was someone that I wanted to find comfort and peace of mind, and I was glad when the ending gave just that after everything he and the others had to go through.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the bigger picture, I took away a lot from this anime. Enough to write a whole essay on it and reconfirm my own personal tenets. The anime emphasizes listening to others, thinking of loved ones more dearly, and finding happiness in whatever form that takes. Three life lessons that I more than resonate with and which made me very happy to see.\\n\\n\r\nI do wish the romance was not so wishy-washy all the time and that Naho stopped overreacting at even Kakeru\u2019s slightest movements. Plus, I thought for sure that they would have depicted Naho and Kakeru together (with everyone else) in a second future timeline. Still, I had the heart skips and the cheers and the smiles for many of their romantic exchanges.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, this anime is one that I may not rank too highly, but I still appreciate what it set out to do.\\n\\n\r\nOrange unfortunately has a lot of problems the further along it goes. Its story gets riddled with oddities and frustrations, and the quality of the art severely plummets. But these issues do not completely take away from some of the characters\u2019 roles, the thoughtful music, and the lessons that it teaches its audience. The anime is not as colorful as it could have been, but it is by no means fully desaturated.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, despite the plot conveniences and frustrating romance, the narrative still hits its emotional moments, resonating with its ideas on how to live a fulfilling, happy life\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Terrible, one of the worst degradations in art and animation quality within the last few years that redefines just how off-putting visuals can unfortunately get\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Naho\u2019s trait of inconvenience gets challenged, Suwa is a super bro, and Kakeru respectfully represents someone battling depression\\n\\n\r\nSound: Good, great OP, okay ED, good OST, and okay VA performances\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, Naho was relatable, the life lessons were spot on, but the romance needed to be less wishy-washy\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10",

The form found for this is not surprising or flashy, but this anime is not meant to be a great Sci Fi, the focus is totally emotional, so I found this part to be rewarding and even beautiful for having a fanciful and dreamy side: If we write a letter and release it in the wind, is it possible that in another reality we can find it in time to avoidrepentance?\\n\r\nThe protagonist must overcome her own insecuritys and introversion throughout the episodes, to ensure that the greatest regret of her life is not repeated. The development of the protagonist and the other characters shows the importance of showing affection and concern for those we love and overcoming barriers if it's necessaire to their sake.\\n\r\n A weak point of the work is the obfuscation of some characters, while the main trio gains great prominence. The opportunity to convey valuable lessons about what depression is and how it works has also been lost.\\n\r\nAlthough not especially fanciful in technical details and somewhat flawed in narrative, this does not prevent the story from being a remarkable shoujo  with a creative premise and a strong message.",

            "content": "Landonime Presents... Orange: There is Always Hope, I promise\r\nOrange was an anime I put off watching for quite some time. Luckily my friend picked it out and we decided to watch it. Orange was right up our alley. I feel as though this show connected with us deeply. Sure its a romance story, which is something I love. Though it had so much more than that. Orange is a love letter to those out there with suicidal tendencies. It tells you that you're not alone, and not to leave this world any earlier than you have to. It shows that there is hope, and peopleout there who will go out of their way to be by your side.\\n\\n\r\nOn that note, I must first address the cast of this show. Not just because they are the main characters, but because they are some of the most loving close bonded friends I've seen in anime to date. They are the ones who project the roll of being a shoulder to cry on when you feel like the there of your life should come to an end. Balance that with 5 different characters and a main lead, its pretty heart warming.\\n\\n\r\nThe chemistry between these characters is astounding. You have Hagita, Chino, Azu, Naho, and I think most importantly.. Suwa. They take the cake when it comes to helping Kakeru with his heartache. Sprinkle in his romance with Naho, as well as Azu and Hagita's in the Orange Mirai movie.. You get a solid 8 out of 10 anime. You couldn't ask for better friends than these. It was by far my favorite part of Orange.\\n\\n\r\nAs I now leave Orange and move to other anime, I must say ill miss it. The movie was kind of meh because of most the recap. Though to see alternate worlds become both true endings of the show made it all worth it. Suwa got rewarded for being one of the best written characters and humans just in general. Also, Kakeru got to move on and have his happy ending with Naho. Getting married and starting a family. This is a great show. I love you Orange.",

No one knows what the future lies ahead for us and destiny can sometimes give us happiness or sorrow.\r\nThe story of the anime is very interesting and unique. It will show you what really is friendship and love. Character development is pretty annoying but entertaining to watch. Graphics are OK but itcould be better.

I have never seen another anime come close to doing this. More than anything what I take from the story is a message of hope. Each of the characters is human with different personalities, strengths and weaknesses, but when they commit tocaring, to paying attention, even if they screw up sometimes, they have the power to change someone else's life for the better.\\n\\n\r\nWe all have that power. How hard is it to say hello and smile to a classmate, coworker, or stranger on the street when we see them struggling? Something which is insignificant to us may mean the world to someone else. We don't have to knowingly put blinders on and regret later the things we could have done differently, we can just strive every single day to do it right, be our best selves, and care about our fellow man.\\n\\n\r\nSo here is my one word review to sum it all up:\\n\\n\r\nInspiring\\n\\n\r\nI'm so glad I watched this series and it has had a more profound impact on me than any other anime out there.",

He told Naho that he wanted to go home to be with he`s grandmother because he was worried. I know she had good intentions but if i were in Kakeru`s place i would be so angry.\\n\\n\r\nHe thought that his mother committed suicide because of him, he thought that it was his fault. \"Every day is a struggle\" it was so, so hard for him.\\n\r\nImagine thinking every day that your mother died because of you. He hid his sadness so much to the point when he couldn`t take it anymore. \\n\r\n\"If i went home instead of going out with my friend, maybe i could have saved her\"\\n\r\nImagine living with this \"Only if\"\\n\r\nOf course that he is depressed. He had suicidal thoughts before, but seeing his mother`s last message was the last strike for him. \\n\r\n\"I`m sorry for getting in the way of your happiness\"\\n\r\nThat`s heartbreaking!\\n\\n\r\nHe needed someone. \\n\r\nHis friends look out for each other and they had taken so much effort to help and keep him alive. The support your friends give you is the best. \\n\r\nOne of the best exaple is when Kakeru was carrying the mattres with Naho, it was hard and heavy just like his struggles but when his friends came one by one and lift the mattres it became more and more easy to carry it. It`s hard when you do it alone but when there is someone else that has your back, everything is easier.\\n\\n\r\nThen there`s Suwa; the most brave character i`ve ever seen. I would never be able to give up on the person i love knowing that we will eventually have a future together. He gave up on the girl he loved for his friend. He sacrificed his future with Naho just to keep Kakeru alive. Even if it kills him inside, he did it for their happiness, for her happiness that matters more than his. I find this tragic because it's sad to watch the person you love be with someone else.\\n\r\nMy favorite moment was when he decided to stay home and not go to confess his felings to Naho that night. Imagine that you still have time to change your future, if you go now everything will change, in 10 minutes or maybe 5, if you don`t go, your future will be changed forever, you still have time to change it if you go now. \"Should i go or should i stay\"\\n\r\nThat`s a scary feeling. The worst thing that could happen is that you finally decide to go but you don`t make it and it`s too late. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: In the manga, the art is very beautiful. At first i thought it wasn`t really good but after the first 2 chapters i fell in love with the artstyle. The character`s expressions are so much better in the manga, very beautiful especially when they smile (you know what i mean) adn when they cry <3 \\n\\n\r\nMusic: The voice actors are amazing, a very good job especially when they cry T^T \\n\r\nThe ending song, Mirai, is so beautiful, the lyrics are full of feelings.\\n\r\nA perfect mix with the anime`s theme.",

            "content": "You can't just take two anime and mix them somehow together to create a complete different one. I hope the makers of this anime kept that in mind because it looks to me like they put Clannad: Afterstory and Ao Haru Ride (Blue Spring Ride) into one anime and the result was one of the highlights of the Summer 2016 season-Orange.\r\nPLOT & STORY LINE \ud83d\udcdc\r\nTo explain what I wanted to say in the intro, this anime looks like the makers took the characters along with the Romance and School life from Ao Haru Ride, but the emotions and Sci-Fi element from Clannad. It is notas childish as Ao Haru Ride, it is has a more serious topic, but it doesn't give you an emotional breakdown like the one Afterstory gives. Picture it like this, if anime could evolve, Orange would be kinda in the middle of the evolution from Ao Haru Ride to Clannad. Still, Orange is a completely different story that happens to be emotional, thrilling and exciting at the same time. Let's see what it is all about.\\n\\n\r\nOn her first day of second year high school, our protagonist Naho receives a strange letter addressed to her.  The strange thing about it is that the letter is from herself-10 years in the future! Naho is of course skeptical at first, but after the letter describes events that really happen she realizes that the letter really is written by her 26-year-old-self.\\n\r\nThe letter points out all the regrets that she'll make in the future and that she wants her younger self to fix those. Also one important part of the letter involves the new transfer student Kakeru. She must be especially careful when making decisions that involve him, as Kakeru is not a part of her future. Having the letter, Naho has now the power to protect Kakeru before she regrets it once more.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is set in the usual school setting but it still involves complex character personalities  and intriguing side stories. It actually pictures the true hardship of a high-school student whose mind is everything but just books and classes. Those teenage problems might seem small to the outside world, but in our small world things like a broken heart or a small regret about not listening to our parents can destroy us. Orange is an anime that pictures all that and the extend to witch it changes us and our future. It shows, how every single detail, no matter how small actually contributes to shaping our life.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to that, the story of Orange is extremely exciting and always so unpredictable. You actually know one future, but the thing you're thinking about the whole time is how the happenings in the present will actually change it. Also, you get a cute romance, filled with everyday drama and emotional background story with, as I think, anyone can relate.\\n\r\nIn short, Orange is an anime that pictures the true hardship of every high school student's life but without exaggerating. Its goal from the beginning is to convey one important message, which is: \"You are never alone\".\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS \ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc69\\n\r\nI can't remember an anime that put more detail into characters than this one. Characters in other anime mostly have those superficial personalities, but the ones in Orange are detailed, original and extremely involving. Also, the anime makes it easy to actually display each personality so we really get to know them. My favorite character was definitely Suwa. He is an extremely caring and down-to-earth guy (even though he is extremely popular) who is always putting someone else before him self. He is nice, sweet and also extremely funny. The male lead, Kakeru, has the most complex personality of all which is mainly the result of the events that take place in the anime. Naho, is somehow like Suwa, extremely caring but much more emotional. On the whole, the makers of the anime put a lot of effort in creating good characters for the show and you can clearly see that.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & STYLE \ud83d\udcbb\\n\r\nI just love everything about this anime including the character design. Some of them like Naho, Kakeru and Chino do look like characters from Ao Haru Ride, especially Naho that looks exactly like Futaba and Kakeru looking like Kou. About the animation, it was breathtaking, especially some backgrounds and scenarios like the one after which Orange got its name. It is amazing how the whole anime actually connects to that one beautiful moment bringing together both, the past and the present.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION \ud83d\udccc\\n\r\nOrange is an extremely emotional and exciting anime that follows a really interesting story about friends and life. The anime conveys a simple yet extremely important message in a way that no other anime could. Through beautiful animation and characters that everyone can relate to, it makes you ride an emotional roller-coaster and make you feel like you're also part of their story. Once more, the anime is exciting, interesting, funny, moving and above all beautiful. A true masterpiece in all its aspects that definitely deserves to be part of your list on MAL.",

If you are looking for something serious, that'll make you tear up, then Orange is an unmissable anime. It had its fair share of romance mixed into it which does a fine job of moving the story along. You've also got a great tear jerking story which never seems to be off track, I think that's too oftentaken for granted.\\n\\n\r\nCONS \\n\r\nOrange doesn't really have any flaws, at times the episodes seem a little wasted however even when this feeling occurs, you also feel that the little details count.\\n\\n\r\nSHOULD YOU WATCH?\\n\r\nYes, absolutely. it does all the right things that a emotional anime should do, it is without a doubt one of the best emotional anime's you can watch, period.

            "content": "Orange Review (NO SPOILERS)\r\nI have a certain trend with how I go about watching shows. Usually, I'll start off with knocking out new series, one after another. But then I'll just take a several month gap, mainly because I'm stuck in a mindset that thinks there isn't any show out there that can top the ones that I've already seen. Well if anime is good at anything, it's surprising people. I'm making an effort to get everything off of my \"To Watch List\" this year, so I started off the year with a little show called \"Orange\". And sure enough... I finished the entire thingin one sitting, and wound up crying myself to sleep because of how emotional this show was. But that's not just because I was no longer in my rut and had turned into a marathoning machine. It was because Orange is one of the greatest shows I've ever had the pleasure of viewing. So let's talk about why.\\n\\n\r\nFrom the surface, Orange is like a million other shows that came before it. High school setting, first ever relationship, you get the picture. But that romance is only the result of the actions that occur in the main plot. And I wouldn't dare spoil that plot, because it's one that manages to IMMEDIATELY pull you into this world and make you want to see where these characters end up. The story is simple, yet interesting. Not overly complicated, and it tells you your character's objectives, from the very beginning. The message and the journey is incredibly deep and one that you can relate to, or at the very least sympathize with. Personally, I decided to watch this show at the BEST possible time. This story hit very close to home in a lot of ways. Making me look back on a very special memory of my life that holds both a lot of happiness and a lot of pain. \\n\\n\r\nBut instead of feeling sad when watching this, it only made me feel happy. The reason for this is because the story is so incredibly beautiful and the characters are such WONDERFUL people. When you watch as many shows as I have, you end up expecting every character trope in the dime a dozen high school setting. You know the ones. So when this show comes around and shows me its cast of characters, it's really something to behold. I LOVE shows with NICE people. I know it sounds weird, but I don't really ever like the jokish-bully or punching bag characters. And while this show does have its moments like that, these characters are really good at taking things seriously when it's needed. And in this show, being serious is needed A LOT. But it's never done in a completely serious, overly dramatic way. These characters are just so incredibly nice to one another. And not in just the \"YOU CAN DO IT!\" \"DON'T GIVE UP!\" sort of way. The things they say and the things that they're willing to do for one another is both real and incredibly moving.\\n\\n\r\nProbably my least favorite types of characters in anime are the ones who are willing to let the world end or endanger their friends, because they're so hung up on who they'll get to be in a relationship with, at the end of the day. This show is one of the rare exceptions where they DON'T do that. Even when it gets brought up that someone has feelings for another person, but those feelings will only cause problems for the main objective of the story, the character that has those feelings outright says that they're willing to put those feelings aside for the sake of protecting and supporting all of their friends and the objective that they're all currently facing. And I LOVE that. Orange has one of the nicest and most pleasurable cast of characters to watch. Each one of them is kind, caring, real, and important to the story.\\n\\n\r\nNow let's talk about the animation. At first glance, I was honestly a bit turned off by it's design. It's not that it was bad, but it was a bit too weird looking, to me. However, this opinion quickly changed and I grew to love this show's art style. Orange is animated by a company known as TMS Entertainment. A company that has a VERY large and impressive number of shows under its belt. But surprisingly, the only shows I've ever seen from them are Orange and... Sonic X!? ...Oooook, then? But ya. Orange's art style looks like a bunch of drawings of porcelain dolls, drawn in colored pencil. Probably a VERY weird way of putting it, but in short, I love this art style. It's unique, beautiful, and fits the show to a T.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this show is something that I enjoyed just as much as the artstyle. With all of the shows I've watched, and especially ones with this type of setting and tone, I'm very used to having a lot of piano music to be used. I don't mind much, since the piano is probably my favorite instrument. However, this show is much more centered around music played with the guitar. Honestly, this was a very nice breath of fresh air that led to a beautiful soundtrack that perfectly accompanied the show it was attached to. This is also another one of those shows that has a lot of silent moments that are better off without music, and the silence in a way is SO powerful, that it sometimes feels like the loudest thing you hear in this show. Surprisingly, the only songs I didn't like in this show are the opening and ending themes. Not bad, but nothing really great, on both visuals and audio. Though, I do like the idea of referring people to Orange's opening if they ever ask me to sum up anime in just one opening. A bunch of high schoolers running around an open field, in their school uniforms. That's what it's all about.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, the classic sub VS dub debate. As always, if I'm given the option to watch a show in sub or dub, I will give both shows an equal chance by watching the first episode in both languages. Personally, I can recommend both versions for this show. They both did a good job and I had no problem with either one of them. They honestly sound very similar, so pick whichever one you prefer. I personally went with the dub on this one, since it helped me relate more to these characters. The scenario was already very relatable to stuff that I've gone through in the past, but the english voices remind me of people who are part of my life, right now. They sound real. And I appreciated that. As always, leave it to Funimation for stellar anime dubs. However, this show DOES have a lot of reading in it, regardless of which language you watch it in. So be prepared to pause a couple times per episode, if you're not a fast reader.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Orange was something that came into my life at just the right time. The start of every new year is always usually the worst part of the year for me. So to start the year with a show so beautiful with its messages of love and support and caring for your friends was just the perfect kind of show for me at this moment. A lot of it reminded me of things in my personal past, and it just gave me hope that I'll be able to better myself and do more to better the lives of the people important to me. The characters are all beautiful and lovable people who support each other in a realistic way. And the art and music is both amazing and a breath of fresh air for shows that this one is similar to. Speaking of other shows, if you enjoyed Orange and are looking for shows similar to it, here are some recommendations. The first one would be one of my favorite shows of all time, Ano Hana. An 11 episode show about trying to fix a long lost friendship, with the same amount of small magic that Orange has. My second recommendation will be another one of my absolute favorite shows, Clannad. A show with some of the best characters, storytelling, music and animation in all of anime. These 3 shows fall in a very similar category of shows that will make you ball your eyes out for weeks on end, but you'll be in love with the journey you went on with them. So with that, I honestly cannot give Orange anything less than my highest recommendation.\\n\\n\r\nOrange... gets a 10/10.",

They found their old letters that they wrote 10 years ago and it made them reminiscence. In the past, Naho found the letters from her future self. It will state exactly what will happen on that day and gives instructions on what to do during that time. Whenever they don't follow the advice that was stated in the letter -- it will lead to events that will cause the sadness of Kakeru. While the friends were trying their best to make him happy; Naho starts to develop feelingsfor him & wants to be with him -- however; Kakeru doesn't want to due to the fear of hurting her. Naho & Suwa decided to stop using the letters as a guide and use their own judgment to save Kakeru. One of the episodes was discussing about the future in general. There are various outcomes. It can be risky but to the group, it will be justified in order to help their friend.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS:\\n\r\nKakeru: New transfer student from Tokyo who has a lot of hidden skeletons. He is currently balancing his life and school while dealing with mental health problems. He's athletic and very kind.\\n\r\nNaho: Cute and humble girl who is kind and very caring for her friends (especially for Kakeru). She and Kakeru are alike (when it comes to their vulnerabilities).\\n\r\nSuwa: Nice, out-going guy, very popular with the girls in the school, but also has hidden feelings for Naho.\\n\r\nTakako: One of the friends (not a lot of info)\\n\r\nHagita: Nice guy, seems cold at times, but is actually caring. He has feelings for Azusa (but won't admit it).\\n\r\nAzusa: Outgoing and carefree, probably has feelings for Hagita.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: \\n\r\nGreat anime to watch! It contains a lot of feels (Love, tragedy, slice of life, high school anime). They could explore more towards the lives of Takako, Hagita, and Azusa.",

The 2nd half will contain spoilers but will be separated by an obvious big warning, so you can read spoiler free until then\r\nStory (1/2): 7/10\r\nI generally don't go for Sci-Fi or Fantasy types of anime, but the story in general caught my attention. The idea of some sort of time travel interests me, so the synopsis really sold it. The story is good, well structured, although some main areas have some holes... sort of (Will get into in the bottom half).\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nI don't particularly care forthis art style, although I have seen several anime that use it and I always like it. Like Kimi ni Todoke, or Lovely Complex. Something about it is sort of off putting at first but I usually grow on it each time.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nSound was okay, some background music was noticeably too high compared to the voices, but in general it was fine. The OP is good, ED was okay. Although this category doesn't really matter since I'm not a big OP or ED guy anyways. (Besides Working!! OP)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis anime really has a lot of character development. In fact, too much to some degree. Which is the reason I drop it down from a 10 to a 9, but I'll get more into that on the spoiler half of the review. The characters may take some time to grow on you, but when they do, it's a strong \"bond\" (for lack of a better word).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nI enjoyed watching this anime. As I said before, it took me a bit to get into it, but the overall enjoyment I got out of it is a solid 8. I had a good time watching it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nOverall is basically the enjoyment part anyways :P. But overall, I'd highly recommend watching this if the synopsis interests you, and if you do start, give it some time. It didn't cling to it right away but after 3rd or 4th episode I started binging them. I most likely would not re-watch, but only because it takes a special kind of mood or want to re-watch an anime like this. \\n\r\nI do highly recommend this overall.\\n\r\nThis is the end of the non spoiler section, I suggest coming back to read the next part after you have seen it, if I have somehow convinced you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nWARNING: SPOILER SECTION\\n\r\nSTOP READING IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE ANIME YET\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nStory (2/2):\\n\r\nI couldn't let this review slide without fully digging into the anime. To be clear, this section will not be organized, I'll just be talking about the characters and story as I please.\\n\r\nFirst thing I wanna dig into is the story. Obviously it's Sci-Fi so the story wouldn't make logical sense, but even in the conditions it's given it doesn't. But I have a theory for that. Assuming you have seen the anime, you'd know there's 2 \"universes\". The main one where Kakeru dies, and the one where they receive the letters. To be clear, I'll call the world where Kakeru dies, \"Main World\", and the other \"Parallel World\". Pretty simple and solid right? Especially since they chose the parallel theory of time travel, which makes it much harder to create paradoxes. Now I don't knock them for choosing this path, but there's one flaw and they even acknowledge it. How do they even receive the letters in the parallel world? There's no clear answer of what Main World did with the letters or how exactly Parallel World got them. This is probably what most people would be thinking, but I have a \"theory\" which isn't too far fetched. This isn't a Sci-Fi anime. The Parallel World doesn't exist. It all is a representation of what would happen in the other world. It makes the most sense from all the outcomes, and I actually expected that to be the case, being a lesson which is something like \"Don't do things you'll regret\" or \"Don't focus on what you can't change\". Now it didn't exactly end that way, but there's also a flaw in the end!! From any perspective. The scene where they are burying the time capsule, what universe is that in? Now obviously it's in Parallel World right? Yeah but the thing is, in Main World they buried it after Kakeru died. If he didn't die yet in the Parallel world, shouldn't they have also buried it before he died? This is never really explained, although I could have gone full retard and missed something, no other explanation besides a mistake.\\n\\n\r\nWOW that was just the story!\\n\\n\r\nSpacing/Production/Story Placement:\\n\r\nI can't find the right word for what I'm about to talk about, but you'll get what I mean. There is a really big inconsistency of what they choose to put in what episodes. Throughout the whole anime it always feels like they're trying to eat up episode time with filler extended scene transitions or awkward stares. I know the awkward stares can be fine, but they stand out in a way they shouldn't. The biggest note of this I made was in episode 12, where they spent 13 minutes (more than half the episode) on a flashback of Kakeru in the Main World and his thoughts. This did not need to be 13 minutes long, we only learned 1 new thing, and that's the message on his phone that his mother never got to send. The rest we already knew, and his thoughts didn't really anything to it. The 13th episode is the length of 2, it could've easily been a 12 episode anime all being 22 minutes or so, but they made poor choices with placement and arrangement. Also, this is what I mean with too much development. Did we really need his each and every thought of him in the main world? The main world has the lowest focus in the anime. Quick note on the production, they should've had some sort of indicator on what section is the Main World and the Parallel world, or at least put some sort of special transition or effect to make it clear. Sometimes I wouldn't know it swapped to the main world until halfway in because of them mentioning Kakeru being dead.\\n\\n\r\nThat's all I can remember worth mentioning.\\n\\n\r\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading this overly excessively long review.",

            "content": "Beware ! English review made by french guy !\r\nSo, Orange is a good anime and a shitty one at the same time. Let me explain briefly : Orange is what we could call a \"feel train\". The only purpose of it, it's to make you feeeeeeeel some emotions and make you feeeeeeel the characters. Nothing less, nothing more. It's just this. So, for one who enjoy as hell these types of animes, go for it...I suppose ?\r\nStory:\r\nThe premise is simple : a new guy come to school and makes new friend. But, the main heroine, Naho, receive a letter from her futur self that explainthat she has to save the new guy, Kakeru.\\n\\n\r\nFirst : It's talking about suicide. Second : Wtf time traveling ? Third : The moralisation of this anime is really strange.\\n\\n\r\nSo, during these 13 episodes, Naho and her friend try to be friend with Kakeru, making him happy so that he don't take his life. It's simple, touching and could be really intersting in the character development. But, oh well...\\n\\n\r\nAnimation :\\n\\n\r\nReally good design, drawing and animation. But, some episodes, like 9, seem to have a low budget and there are many many many wrongs things, like derp face. The anime is beautiful, but have many errors.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nGood voice acting like all anime, normal sound design, and really good music. Nothing to say here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters :\\n\\n\r\nHere's the fun. They are all clich\u00e9, but, the catharsis is awesome ! The interactions between them is really well done and maybe is over the normal in the world of anime. So, these clich\u00e9 becomes instantly forgettable. The problem is in the development and the complexity of the characters... The anime just try to make Kakeru alive and forget about the emotion of every other of his friends. So everyone is normal and are able to fully help to 100% Kakeru. In real life, good luck to take 100% of your time for someone who need help. And the anime forget that. Everybody has their own problem and so, everybody has difficulty to understand each other. The anime don't show this. It show friends who are able to forget about themselves to try understanding an other friend with important problems (Kakeru). For Kakeru, this show how hard it's to take someone out of his negative thinking once he is on that, but fail to show how hard and incomprehnsible other people can be about this. Everything is fine, everyone is able to understand each other, what a beautiful and naive utopia.\\n\\n\r\nOh, yeah, don't mind the 8 out of a 10. I think 4 would be more precise. I put 8 just, and only just, for Hagita, who is the best four eyed waifu ever !|\\n\\n\r\nVerdict :\\n\\n\r\nSo, is Orange a good anime ? In term of feel, yes, but nothing incredible. Some overdramatical anime like Clannad are able to show some intersting development with a good level of feeeeeeling. In term of deepness, no. And that only fact is because of the time travel shitty thing (seriously A-1, stop with time travel anime like Erased....it's not good for mental health). Well, yeah. Basicly, what Orange is trying to show is how important it is to be close and talk to our friends. How it is important to be loved and how someone who disgust himself can hurt the ones he loves and be stubbord in his self-confident. The problem is, the time travel here is showing a little breeze of dream about everyone who would want to save an ancient friend or wathever by going back in time. Well, it could have been, farely, the same thing without time travel, so in every way, Orange is to simple and try to be good by touching hard subject that everyone want to talk about, but are unable to, and that's ugly. The anime is showing how hard it is to help someone, but here, Naho KNOW what will happen. Basically, the anime say : \"if you don't know how someone feel, well, you can do nothing for this someone\". And it add : \"It's impossible to know how someone feel, unless you have access to some unbeliveble knowledge\". In other word, the anime don't show how hard it is to understand someone in need, because Naho know what will happen. The anime is just here to feed the utopia everyone want : be able to understand and help eachothers, without having to make reals efforts... And that's really sad, because all the message of the anime, all the reason of the anime, is because of time travel and transform what could have been an intersting dilemma of how to help someone (in fact, it would have been the same....), in some feel train drama that have no other purpose that to make poeple believe they can make a difference without to much trouble... Orange is an insult to people in need.\\n",

            "content": "[Mild spoiler warnings]\r\nI've slowed down watching anime for the last couple of months, that thing called life eventually caught up with me and, after feeling completely burned out with the medium through binging Monogatari, Orange has been a really good pick-me-up that I started watching when it started airing and eventuall trailed off, only just finishing it more than two months after it's final episode aired.\r\nAlthough I've watched it at a slower pace than any shows before, I've felt as invested in Orange as I have for some of my favourites to come before it. I was very excited when this show was announced, Iabsolutely adore Kana Hanazawa in everything I've heard her in so far, and the fact she was one of the leads in a less surreal drama, and because I thought the basis for the show was actually very sophisticated, albeit teetering on both slight surrealness from it's time travel element and not a whole lot of originality, I was excited nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nTo say I feel disapointed would be an extreme, to say I expected this to be perfect would be too, however it definitely falls short of the easy 9/10 I expected it to achieve, even after the first episode. Unfortunately it falls shortest on the merits I was expecting it to hit it out of the park with, it's story and main characters. Yes I've given characters a 9/10, but that's because the supporting cast is absolutely brilliant in every single way. It's only the main characters, Naho and Kakeru that stop me from giving this point a perfect score. Spend a few minutes in an episode review halfway through the show and everyone will agree how Naho is so unrealistically dense, shortsighted, and... well to put it plainly she couldn't do or say more stupid shit in the space of 13 episodes if she tried. It doesn't become quite apparent until episode 3 or 4 (with 1 and 2 easily being the best episodes of the show), but she really is almost dangerous levels of dense, and unfortunately this doesn't stop until right up to the end of episode 12. I love Naho as a person, as a character, she's cute, shy and endearing, sometimes I just wanna scoop her up and hug her, sometimes even when she is being blindingly simple. It is an annoying trait, that for most has lessened their enjoyment of the show overall. While I agree it is a valid point, I can see through it because as hopeless as she may seem, Naho's intentions are only ever the best for everyone around her. She has a heart of pure gold, but the brain of a chimpanzee.\\n\\n\r\nKakeru on the otherhand is a slightly more complex type of 'weak character'. He's definitely a bit of an asshole at times, and the show doesn't explain why untill it's too late (again, episode 12). This lead to me and rather a lot of other viewers not being able to fully sympathise with Kakeru, even though we all knew that he was very depressed, and why. I wanted to sympathise with Kakeru so badly, but he just made himself out to be selfish, closed off and not open to any form of friendship or help, going so far as to slap Naho's hand away when she reaches for him. It makes it almsot impossible to feel sorry for the guy, even though I knew what he was going through, and as dense as Naho is, he was an ass for most of second half of the show. Only after ep 12 was it that I finally understood and started being able to understand why he was the way he was, by then it was pretty much too little too late. That's the thing with Orange, it started off so well, and to be honest it finished very well too, but the middle made me want to put my head through my monitor.\\n\\n\r\nThis isn't just down to the main pair though, the show just felt kind of slow and lifeless through much of the middle. There weren't really any ups and downs, just Mrs Dense and Mr Asshole being more dense and more of an asshole. By no means were they unentertaining though, and this is where my reasoning for giving character s a 9 comes in, the supporting cast kept this show going throughout the rocky middle. It's rare that supporting characters come across as anything than an extra story mechanic, but in Orange, they are the lifeblood of the show for the most part, breaking up the monotomy of Naho's and Kakeru's scenes. Hagita and Azu bring the comedy, and it always feels like a very natural kind of banter you'd have with YOUR friend group too, teasing, being nosy, sarcasm, the works, and actually the duo actually have a romantic flicker of their own going on, and although it's never explicitly explored, at times it felt more interesting than the main pair's love story. Suwa is the kind of friend everybody wants, a bro until the very end, at times even lambasting Kakeru for his behaviour, but always in a caring and loving way, after all he knows what is at stake too. Takako completes the friendship group, a stunning dark haired girl who is incredibly mature for her age, grounds the group in reality when things start teetering off the edge of sanity, but like Suwa, does so because she cares for her friends in a very realistic way, she is definitely the more maternal figure of the group, but never misses the opportunity to tease Hagita or Naho.\\n\\n\r\nSadly, even the excellent support cast couldn't quite save the story from it's rocky middle. The show as a whole, yes, but the story as an isolated component, no.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing that stood out to me in this show however, was the voice acting and and music. What an excellent performance by every VA. Conversations felt natural, like talking to your friends at lunchtime in school. The show isn't afraid of having characters talk over each other, and although it's a little hard to follow with subs, it SOUNDS very natural, and for that I applaud it. This is drama voice acting done as well as it could be done. Not forgetting the music of the show, Orange has a sublime soundtrack, wonderful string arrangements fill scenes with a magic that quite frankly elevates the already brilliant voice acting. The OP and ED are both good, but forgettable. Although they represent the show well, like the music in the episodes, they don't serve as much of a purpose. I still let them play everytime though.\\n\\n\r\nArt in Orange is a funny one, because again it mirrors the whole 'great at the start and end', but again in the middle it feels lazy at points, something others noticed too. The first episode was absolutely stunning, a feast for the eyes is an understatement. Episode 2, again, a lush episode that really brings everything to life. Then after that it's almost standard shoujo candy art. Apparently the art budget for each episode did get smaller and smaller, and boy does it show. Such a shame that it couldn't at least keep up the wonderful backgrounds of the first two episodes, although there are the odd shots (especially in the future segments) that do catch the eye every now and then and capture that beauty of the earlier art.\\n\\n\r\nOrange, then, is definitely worth a watch. Although I haven't explicitly said it yet, I loved Orange. It was, for the most part, a beautiful but distressing look into depression and suicide, friendship and communication, love and loss. Ignore the silly time travel mechanic and we have here a great little show that does exactly what it sets out to do, in that it shouts at you to cherish the friendships you have and grasp the opportunity to make a friend smile. Even if it does take 13 episodes to achieve it.",

            "content": "Orange is underwhelming not really because of bad adaptation or source material, but due to the hype it was riding on.\r\nWhen the announcement and trailer of Orange came out, many are impressed: elements of time travel, romance, and tragedy is enough to garner a good following for the upcoming anime.  In a sense, it supposedly share similarities with the anime that started the crazed hyped over time-travel,  Boku dake ga Inai Machi, two seasons ago.\r\nHere comes my pet peeve: supposed MCs look like clones of Kou and Futuba from Ao Haru Ride, the most successful romance-shoujo-\"drama\" yet. Also, Orange seems to share thissame genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about such a genre is that there's little variance to work with, and many works and adaptations out there simply became clones of each other. I can provide you a list of recent similarities but its very easy to search that up.\\n\\n\r\nSo here comes Orange, which promised us something new from the old and beaten genre, with an additional niche of time-travelling included. The end result of which is utter disappointment, for Orange fails to be out-of-the norm, and the niche is gimmicky.\\n\\n\r\nOrange's Characters fall into the generic characters of this genre. The plotline is also generic, broken to down into mere phases of lovey-dovey and mistrust. Anyone hoping Orange would be different would be left disappointed.\\n\\n\r\nThough, that is not to say there is no merit to Orange. For one, it is the best of its genre in my opinion, beating Ao Haru Ride in terms of enjoyment, with the time travel and impending fate of a certain character somewhat driving the slow plot progression.\\n\\n\r\nWith the announced extra episode, I hope many of the pitfalls to the generic Orange fell into can be remedied, one mainly is the development of the other characters. Unlike the other, I would say Orange's supporting cast is a huge untouched potential that could be (and should have BEEN) developed.\\n\\n\r\nThere is, in my opinion, two camps in viewing Orange. One, not having been exposed to this genre before, would enjoy Orange greatly. The other camp, realising what Orange is, becomes bored, and the only reason they watch the show was to see the conclusion (aka the time-travel gimmick). \\n\\n\r\nWhether Orange is your cup of tea or not, one consensus we can share that at least visuals and audio is impressive enough to give it a shot.\\n",

No, if you are looking for great character development. \r\nStory: 8/10 \r\nThe story portrays the idea of regret. What could have been done? What should have been done? If things were done differently, would the outcome still be the same? This story dwells into the power of friendship and love, the importance of supporting one another. The progression of the story was interesting enough that made it look forward to the next. \r\nI did not give this story 10/10 because I felt there could have been more depth to the storyto better portray the tragedy in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nI quite enjoyed the art style. The style matched very well with the feel of the story, \"dejavu\".  The biggest problem I had is the expressions that characters portrayed. For example, when someone is crying, there is definitely tears but it does not show the \"pain\" in their expression or depth of sadness. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10 \\n\r\nOpening and ending was well fitted to match the story line. The opening was used in parts that were relevant. Honestly, whilst writing this review I cannot remember any strong tunes that stayed in my mind. Such as a replayed of the same sad music. It was good but it did not have the impact on me. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10\\n\r\nOne word, annoyed. Naho being the main character focus along with Kakeru, I am almost shocked by how \"dense\" she can be sometimes. She may be portrayed cute or innocent to some sense, but since it happens from beginning to end, it's almost like she never understood anything. Her friends almost spelt everything out for her. \\n\r\nKakeru as a character was interesting but as you progress along the story, it does not show you how he is actually coping. Personally, I do not believe his character was portrayed well considering his back story. \\n\r\nThe only character that I enjoyed watching was Suwa. One of the major desicions he made was because of his development and his understanding through the story. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10 & Overall score: 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough I disliked some aspects of the show, I did enjoy watching this overall. I looked forward to seeing what happened each episode, but mainly to see the build up before the last episode. I was a bit unsure of the timeline because we were consistently reminded that this big event is going to happen and they needed to stop it (could be just me though, haha) but not when it was actually going to happen. The last episode was a good way to end the anime, which is why I gave it a 8/10 overall. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

Some lapses in the story and plot with the letters and the reasoning of the whole \"time-capsule\" but then again it's not the main focus of the anime (like Steins Gate which is all about this sort of stuff). The sound was really good and the voicing was even better, reallyemotional.\\n\r\nHowever, there are some bigger downsides to this anime that I must admit do make the experience less fullfilling. It is a bit too melodramatic at times and needs a special mood to watch this. Perhaps it's the situation I'm in (just moved to university and it's been really tough being alone and in an unknown environment) that made me connect with the sad aspects of the story as it helped me release my own anxiety. \\n\r\nTo me, this is a great anime that is worth watching. It's not long and by no means unwatchable because of the overly dramatic parts. It does need a specific mood to make the experience enjoyable. So if you're expecting some happy slice of life anime, this isn't it; at least I don't think that's how it was meant to be perceived. \\n\r\nI would recommend this.",

I've been on the train most of the time, and I felt the anxiety of whether or not the anime would live up to the manga's beautiful standards. I must say, it has done that. \r\nIf you're a fan of the manga, don't hold yourself back and go watch the anime. I was honestly shocked at how much it was on par with the manga, it felt like I was reading it for the first time again except in a visual format. Note,that of course a few things were tweaked here and there, as per all manga to anime transitions.\\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest watching the anime, and I hope you enjoy it just as much as I did. ^^\\n\\n\r\n- Otaku-kun, the Otaku in Converse.",

            "content": "Orange\r\nArt/Characters: I really love the art style of this show because of how natural it feels. There is no over the top hair or out of line characters, but it really feels like there are real people on the other side of this animation. That being said, I really enjoyed watching the emotion that came over the characters when it came to the really sensitive parts. The emotion here isn\u2019t even over the top, and that is really fantastic to see a character show that kind of genuine emotion. The characters themselves are really great as well. Naho, the lead has a lot of dynamics,but I must say she can be a little infuriating at times. Kakeru is very much reserved in his actions and is having a hard time fitting in, but his amazing friends are happy to help with that. Suwa is someone who we only get glimpses into his life and I wish I could have seen more when the story began to unfold. Hagita is the stereotypical \u201cglasses-guy\u201d but he has some interesting things to point out from a unique perspective. Finally, Takako and Azusa are a pair that really are just playing off of each other. While each character seems to have a counterpart, these two definitely stick to each other.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound: The music that we hear peppered throughout this series really fills the air and makes the mood great. There were a few parts where I wish the music was a bit stronger and things could have just gotten louder, because that would really have made a better impact. The sound in general made a huge impact, however. There were some scenes that were conveyed almost entirely through sounds rather than images or words, and it speaks volumes when you don\u2019t even have to show something happen and the world holds its breath wondering what will happen next. The opening song is definitely one that I will listen to over and over again because of how catchy it is, but it will always bring a somber happiness because that is the true nature of the show.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Naho Takamiya receives a letter on the opening ceremony day at her high school. She begins to read and is quickly confused because of the letter\u2019s contents. Apparently the letter is from Naho herself, ten years into the future. When the letter begins to predict things that are scary accurate, she starts taking it seriously and reads closer; a new transfer student will be joining them on day one of classes, Kakeru Naruse, from Tokyo. The letter tells about the amazing friendship of this transfer student and how she actually has a lot of regrets regarding him. Then a stinger hits when she reads that ten years, Kakeru is no longer with them. The Naho of that future time begs that she keep a closer eye on Kakeru. The story continues and there are a lot of twists and turns and it really comes out to be an emotional roller coaster that I can\u2019t seem to get enough of.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Reflection: Sadness. That word crossed my mind at the end of nearly every episode of Orange. Now I am not saying that the show is absolutely bathed in sadness, but the story itself really is one that is somber in nature, but the motives of the characters are pure and that is amazing. To be given the information that your friend isn\u2019t around ten years later; it\u2019s sobering. I think of if I was given a similar opportunity to learn that kind of information and how would I handle it. Well Naho and her friends really do absolutely everything that they can do to make sure Kakeru stays with them. I am being intentionally ambiguous for a reason, so please don\u2019t think to much about that and just watch if your interest is perked. There are a few plot holes that don\u2019t get fully answered, and sometimes Naho can just drive me insane because SHE WON\u2019T JUST DO WHAT SHE KNOWS IS RIGHT. Excuse me, lost my cool there. Overall Orange is a show that gets you to feel things. I mean, really experience joy and sorrow in an amazing way that I have not felt in an anime for quite some time. I wish Suwa was developed more as a character, but luckily there was a movie announced, Orange: Mirai, which tells the entire story from the perspective of Suwa, so I am highly anticipating that. If you love dramatic, true romance stories and realistic art, then you will absolutely love Orange.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Rating: 9/10\\n",

The characters have no redeemable or likable personality traits, which made watching this anime feel dreadfully long. I was really excited to watch this when I found out it was going to be adapted but I'm incredibly disappointed. I couldn't even get through two episodes without me getting annoyed every time Naho was speaking or thinking which was all the time.\r\nAll in all, I love Orange. It was bittersweet. But this anime did not do the story justice. I ratedthis a 3 because maybe if you can get past how annoying Naho is, maybe the story would still be good if it's anything like the manga.",

            "content": "This is not just another time traveling story where characters try to change the outcome of some major event. It felt closer to Kate Akinson's Life After Life than something like Groundhog Day. The main character receives a letter from her future self, warning her to save a classmate. This concept was developed very well as the character doesn't believe it at first, then grows to follow the advice, then sees the future diverging from the letter. Additionally, the story addresses what happens when we have this information: we can take it for granted and joke about it, or even callously say something to afriend who doesn't have the same information we might. And what if we're happy in the future, married with kids? Do we still give up that future to save someone?\\n\\n\r\nART: This anime seems like it was put together very quickly. The art style closely resembles the manga, but it could have been much, much better. It seems like a cheap show from the early 2000s with very 2D colors and shapes, with the sky a jarring flat blue. The character style and animation was also somewhat poor, especially towards the end of the show. Characters movement felt awkward and undefined while at times the way they were drawn just seemed off, and it affected the enjoyment of the show. And then from time to time there was random thrown in 3D-CG cell shaded anime (such as of background characters walking around at the shrine, vehicles, etc.) \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: The music was fine and the voice acting was perfect. The actors felt very at home and natural in their roles. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: The main character was your typical, shoujo blah who eventually develops the barest semblance of a personality. And I couldn't accept that she blindly went along with, essentially, erasing her future to save one person. The characters' future selves also come up with a random explanation of how to send letters to the past that I thought felt contrived. Also, the characters all start out with a sense of mystery to them, but are extremely underdeveloped. I kept waiting for episodes devoted to the rest of the group of main characters.... but instead every single episode focused on the two main characters. This is no Kimi ni Todoke. I'm looking forward to the movie sequel to find out if the hilarious Hagita ever got together with his stylish, baker friend Azusa? What happens with sweet Suwa? And please, for crying out loud!, tell us something about Taka! These characters all have such potential! They're, honestly, what makes the show enjoyable! Their conversations seem very realistic and I can't wait to see what happens in the sequel.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: By the end of the series I was glad it was over, but also glad I had watched it.  I'm also looking hopefully to the sequel to see how the others turn out!",
