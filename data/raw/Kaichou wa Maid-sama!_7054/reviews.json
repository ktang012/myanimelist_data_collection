            "content": "When news of this year's new shows began surfacing, Kaichou wa Maid-sama was near the top of the ones I was looking forward to most.  I had read a little of the manga and always found it to be funny.  Last year had featured a pretty good run of romance anime and this looked poised to continue that run.  Despite the series' fabulous artwork and a lot of great comedy, it is unfortunately a bit of a disappointment.\r\nThe premise behind Maid-sama has an initially interesting hook.  Misaki Ayuzawa is the newly elected student council president at a mostly male high school.She is strict and violent in protection of the female students and in making it a place friendlier to girls.  But she has a secret that could ruin her image as the tough and unyielding class president, she works part time in a Maid Cafe to help her family with the bills.  Of course this means that the ultimate alpha male at the school, Usui Takumi, will find out about her secret.  Blackmail, as only shoujo can do ensues... or does it?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the answer is no but what does follow, at least initially is a pretty fun and entertaining back and forth repartee between Misaki and Usui.  Misaki is revealed to not be quite the man hating tyrant she is in school and Usui is not the cold, unfeeling ladies man either.  The romantic chemistry between the two characters is quite good and builds very quickly early on.  But the typical problems that plague shoujo romances soon follow.  Relationship development slows to a crawl and nothing of significance happens after the first third of the series until its end.  Despite this the series does end with a bang and has a very touching and satisfying conclusion which is probably the only thing that saved it from a lower overall score.\\n\\n\r\nMaid-sama at its best is extremely funny and enjoyable to watch.  The series' comedy is really quite good most of the time.  But no amount of jokes can hide the fact that it doesn\u2019t have any kind of story what so ever.  Misaki's job at Maid Latte is mostly just a gimmick, and besides for a handful of episodes it\u2019s totally unimportant to the plot.  Basically what we get is a series of loosely connected stories with the same underlying theme.  Even though they are mostly funny it gets tiring when you realize that nothing significant is ever happening.  When things do finally start to get interesting between our couple, not unexpectedly a rival appears.  Though he is so poorly conceived and much too late to the party to have any real significance.  It was almost like someone in the production staff realized with five episodes to go that they nearly made an entire anime without a love triangle.  Though despite all of this the biggest flaw is the sheer weight of supporting characters and their overall detraction to the screen time and back-story of the lead characters.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki makes for a good heroine.  She is quite funny walking the line between her dictator president and her submissive maid persona's.  However she is a bit of your stereotypical tsundere, but it's easy to root for her.  Shockingly we really don't find out all that much about her with the exception of some flashbacks of when she was a little girl (which in actuality weren't even about her).  Other than learning her father had walked out on her mother and sister, leaving enormous debts and apparently they are also really poor.  An aside to Misaki's family poverty though.  I thought the way they portrayed her family was kind of offensive.  The inside of the house is crumbling and dirty.  Walls have paint peeling off them, the floor has holes in it, and their are spider webs and other cliches.  Yes we get it, they're poor.  Like poor people can\u2019t keep a clean house?  Besides this is completely out of character for someone as meticulous as Misaki.  When you consider how fanatical she is at school about keeping things clean and orderly the very idea that she wouldn't do the same at home is totally implausible.  \\n\\n\r\nUsui on the other hand initially comes off as the kind of love interest I hate.  Aloof, privileged, and apparently great at everything he tries he is precisely the kind of ideal man that makes shoujo romances so unbelievable.  However it is pretty quickly apparent he isn't your typical leading man.  You can tell he is immediately smitten with Misaki from the start and he uses this droll personality of his to push her buttons and amuse himself while at the same time bring her closer to him.  I ended up liking him quite a bit.  Like Misaki,  his past remains as much of a mystery at the end as it was at the beginning.  Especially frustrating considering the amount of time that was given to Misaki's childhood friend Shintani who basically only appeared in 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast really brings down this series though.  As much as I enjoyed the leads, I found the rest of the cast to be uninspired and lacking substance.  The main reason for this is that there are just way too many of them.  Maid-sama features nearly 30 supporting characters and they take way too much from the ones that are actually important.  Even if many of them are likable and funny, they have absolutely zero depth and at best one facet to their personalities.  Stories with lots of characters rarely work that well especially when the majority serve no purpose and overlap one another.  Too many of them are basically identical to each other and were unnecessary.  For example I know having a cross dresser is a shoujo staple but having more than one in the same anime is overkill, regardless of whether or not they both did it willingly.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is well acted and I enjoyed the performances for the lead actors in particular.  Though neither of them are rookies by any means, they aren\u2019t the typical names we are used to seeing at the top of a cast either.  So I enjoyed hearing some fresh voices for a change.  The music is solid but unspectacular.  Saya Mizuno's \"My Secret\" is an appropriate if kind of generic shoujo OP.  Both ED songs by heidi are pretty good though and I liked them a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically Maid-sama is strong.  I did enjoy the character designs and the frequent use of deformed and chibi characters to complement the series comedy.  The art really brings out the emotions of Misaki and Usui and is able to speak volumes about their feelings for one another even with nothing is being said.  The quality of this non audible communication is one of the best I have seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I was ultimately disappointed with this anime, it was not a complete waste of time to watch.  If you enjoy Rom-Com anime then you will most likely not be sorry for watching this.  The comedy is great; the romance is hit or miss.\\n",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed Maid Sama! for a number of reasons. \r\nWhile it may not appear like the most original series, Maid Sama does diverge from the conventional tsundere-falls-in-love-with-popular-dude plotline. The protagonist Misaki is the strong and very feminist (quite often man-hating) President of her school council. Maid Sama doesn't stick with the cliche of either the ultra cool bishounen or super strong bishoujo be the best. Usui and Misaki are quite evenly matched; contrary to what some reviews state, Misaki often does NOT always need Usui to come rescue her. She is depicted as capable, feisty and caring. Misaki's a great character, the kind ofgirlfriend you'd want to hang out with and rely on. She makes the series compulsively watchable because she's a character you can actually admire, relate to and empathise with. If anyone is looking for a strong and likeable female protagonist, I would definitely recommend the series to them.\\n\\n\r\nMaid Sama also provides pretty good humour. A lot of this comes from the gender-relation jokes, such as in how Misaki takes control of the boy-dominated school known for being vulgar and smelly. I also really enjoyed how Usui's character sort of undercuts the bishounen stereotype - although Usui's a bishounen, he's also incredibly bizarre, and is capable of saying or doing the oddest things with the calmest expression. He's kind of a semi-parody of the bishounen type, which I find really entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nMaid Sama also does focus to some extent on the other characters (can't reveal exactly how without spoilers, but you're in for some surprises). Despite the somewhat deviant nature of these characters, Maid Sama casts them in a tender, affectionate light, ultimately creating some feel-good moments without downplaying how hilariously odd they are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does also have some touching moments, without being nauseatingly over the top. What I really love about this anime is its ability to convey emotions through subtext, or what is not actually explicitly said, but is instead shown. The viewer is left to infer why Usui behaves the way he does, for example, and to infer why Misaki is so ignorant of his affections (or is she?). Granted, it's in no way rocket science, this is shoujo after all, but I like that the anime builds up some tension and mystery this way, and it really engages the audience's emotions. Each episode also has plenty of events to keep you entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I love about the anime is its music. There's a piano theme in particular that I find quite moving. The composers also go to the effort of using different kinds of music, e.g. a rock theme for Usui's appearance in Ep 9. I think the music is original, appropriate and beautiful in its own right. It definitely sets the tone for the anime. The sound effects are also quite spot on.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything I would criticise about Maid Sama, it's probably that sometimes it does miss the target. A few episodes here and there seem to kind of lose their momentum, especially when focusing on side characters - it doesn't quite get their motivation right, and loses steam in its characterisation then. Some good side characters are also obviously just plot devices, and lack further depth or characterisation as a result. You end up thinking, it could have been so much more! It's a good anime, but ultimately it doesn't have that much depth because it focuses heavily on comedy. That's not a bad thing and I appreciate its focus on comedy, but if you're looking for a meaningful explanation of Misaki's man-hating psyche, you're not going to get that here. I actually like that about the anime though, it doesn't try too hard to be what it isn't, so on the whole, it remains quite spot on.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, I really enjoyed Maid Sama and I found more than enough in it to keep me thoroughly entertained, and enough to re-watch it a few times. I will definitely follow the series to the end and I really recommend that you guys check it out too, especially if you're looking for a less sexist shoujo anime and some great protagonists. Have fun!",

            "content": "Oh dear... Where to start with this... Well for one thing, Kaichou wa Maid-sama has frequently regarded as the star successor to the previous romance anime, Kimi ni Todoke. And I have one thing to say: Kaichou wa Maid-sama doesn't stand a chance against the far superior Kimi ni Todoke. Much of Kaichou's fanbase is probably attributed to how one person or another said it was similar to Kimi ni Todoke and continued to increase its popularity, but I would strongly disagree. Kimi ni is way better than Kaichou. Kaichou is the most stereotypical and cliched anime I have ever seen. This review will bebashed, I know it, but now let's see why it's so horrid in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nSo would anyone care to tell me what the story of Kaichou is? What happened to the antagonist? Did he just up and leave? Kaichou's plot is filled with too many loopholes and missing slices to be a good story. Aside from the disappearing antagonist, there are random, pointless, and cumbersome side stories for all the characters that don't matter. For argument's sake, let's say that it's more of a comedy/slice-of-life where the story is unrelated, where is the comedy? Did I laugh? No. I didn't find a single point where I could laugh, I couldn't even find any good screenshots. The plot is basically Aizawa realizing that she loves Usui and they end of together. Are there any objections to that plot? No? Well then why did it need to be stretched out over 26 episodes? This isn't a good romance like Toradora! where there are massive plot twists and needs it. Even Kimi ni Todoke had some good love triangle moments. Also, even if it did need a lot of time for development, the development of minor characters are unneeded in a romance or a slice-of-life. If it was a good romance story, than the focus on the 2 main characters is all that is needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nYou are calling this art? Most of the art is just facial close ups with sparkling backgrounds. There is no art in this. The animators were too lazy to draw in backgrounds most of the time and left it to facial close-ups. Sparkle here, sparkle there, geez, I could doodle better backgrounds than that. What else? Most of the time in crowded places, all the other people are just gray blobs. Even for the characters that did have artistic design. I could barely tell Usui apart from the other 9001 blonde hair guys in the anime. Just cloning the same character and putting on different clothes and accessories most certainly does not need any artistic talent. It's like dress-up except no one will play it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nSound is probably the best thing there is in this anime. The OP was painfully annoying. I don't even remember the 1st ED probably because I hated the show, but the 2nd ED had a pretty good tune. Voices? Well I guess they were alright. Some voices hurt to listen to... BGM wasn't good or bad enough to grant me and opinion, since I barely paid attention to anything other than the annoying, overused BGM that happens at the end of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nOh my head. There are no good characters in this anime. I hate Usui with a passion that doesn't just destroy cities, but also burn all the inhabitants and open a fissure that swallows up the whole area. I hate all of his terribad clones also. Usui is such a -----. He is annoying and is obsessed, stalker with Aizawa. If I was her, I would have kicked him so hard in the nuts that they would tear off his body, and then I would call the cops for stalking. This is romance? More like stalking. Next: The 3 bakas are more or less, 3 bakas. They are useless, pointless, annoying characters that serve no purpose. The hypnotist and girly guy with him are also fillers for nothing. UxMix or whatever they are called are just more useless junk to dig into other minor and useless characters, like Aizawa\u2019s friends. Why even bother with making a minor character romance here? And I don\u2019t even remember what the other blonde antagonist did. They killed him off and left a gaping plot hole. Shall I go on? The other maids at the caf\u00e9\u2026. What\u2019s the point the same thing applies; filler. Aoi-chan? Only in your dreams. Although Aoi is probably the easiest character to put up with. And I haven\u2019t said anything about Aizawa; . Tsundere? Please\u2026 SHE TAINTS THEM. She's truly a sorry and lame excuse of a Tsundere. Did I miss any characters? If I did then they are just too terrible to mention. Like Hinata for example... A random new character introduced late in the series.... Waste of effort and nothing really \"Triangle\" worthy even happens with him, his sole purpose existing to reveal Aizawa's pointless past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: -1/10\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it. Enjoyment is more of a factor of the watcher and not the anime, so there's not much to say. I found watching it a painful experience and usually just played Touhou or talked to people on the side. I just couldn't enjoy an anime with a terrible plot and horrid cast of characters. -1/10 if I could, because I didn't enjoy it, It was more like torture.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis overall score is a 2/10 with a +1 because I am just so happy that I finished this bad anime. I considered giving this anime lower because a 3 is \"Poor\" in the review box, and it's definitely not poor, (better defined as \"Pathetic\", A score of 1) but I decided to let it go. In the end, this review will just get bashed with unhelpful marks, but I would love to try to tear down the fake fanbases that attempt to compare this with the superior Kimi ni Todoke. To compare them... Let's say Kimi ni Todoke is my foot and Kaichou wa Maid-sama is the bug I just stepped on. Although Kimi ni Todoke deserved a much better status than my foot... Kaichou is bad and that's my solid opinion. Nothing you can do to change it.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line: Don't watch it. It will take off 10 years of your life. Kaichou is just stereotypical, cliched, and just plain dumb.",

            "content": "Although this would look to be the normal cliche type rom/com, it was actually pretty enjoyable with a few different aspects to it. Instead of the male protagonist having to protect the female protagonist, misaki can actually hold her own in most situations, and then usui would come and talk to her about it. The comedy in this story was actually pretty funny, either it be usui messing with misaki about stalking her, or misaki always being super serious and whatnot. I very much enjoy this anime, the romance that progresses through the story is really heartwarming, but at times can be a little sad/wobbly.So now with the review stuffs.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough the base of the story does look to be some sort of cliche, the way they portrayed it was very nice. The romance slowly grows while they go through their daily routines, with a good amount of comical relief. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was pretty nice as well, whether it be a serious scene, or them drawing a dude that just got thrown out of a window. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty clear for the anime, and the japanese voice acting matched the characters very well. However, the english dub I tried to watch sounded pretty bad, the mics were really hot, and the characters did not match up at all. The sound for the english dub was terribly recorded, I don't know if it was the mics they were using or what, I just stuck with the subbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were fairly well developed, there was always something going on with a supporting character, rather than only focusing on the mains 100% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, whether it be the comedy or the romance, it seems to catch my attention. The way the comedy mixed in with the romance was pretty fitting for the characters. Not to mention the way usui and misaki are always in some sort of conflict, and then it comes to a romantic scene that usually has some comedy aspects in it. Also, being that Misaki is a tsundere, it was nice to see how her feelings played out and the way Usui helped her out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this to be a really good anime. Although there are some cliche scenes, that is to be expected from a rom/com in most cases. I still found this to be a funny/heartwarming storyline that was kept me drawn to it. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who likes a good rom/com.",

            "content": "Hmm... Let's see. What can I say about Kaichou wa Maid-sama?\r\nStory: 9 .\r\nKaichou wa Maid-sama is the first anime that has intrigued me enough to lead me into reading the manga. Although the plot line depicts some of the most typical shoujo anime events used and reused in various other circumstances, Kaichou wa Maid-sama throws in a few twists and originality that entices the viewer in a new way. \r\nArt: 7 .\r\nAlthough I wouldn't say Kaichou wa Maid-sama has outstanding artistry, I also wouldn't say it's downright terrible. It's pretty well drawn, in fact. Compared to animes like Fushigi Yuugi (no offense intended) or Itazurana Kiss, both of which I had forced myself to finish a full episode (abandoning ship on that idea), Kaichou wa Maid-sama isn't the worse. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 .\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song really summarizes the whole anime quite well. And for that, I applaud it. The anime itself has correctly initiated sound effects that help bring the real feel of the moments depicted. However, I find it hard to dock marks on sound for any anime, so I'm being quite easy on this area of critique... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 .\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters we've met so far are... interesting. They all have an aspect that's unique and sets them apart from the rest of the cast. Takumi Usui, one of the main characters, is, by far, the most intriguing character in my opinion. However, the protagonist of this story is not far behind.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Ayuzawa . Hmmm... An interesting character. Quite unique, in fact. A boy hater. Fierce. Competitive. Intelligent. Appears to be cold and 'demon' like. However, a girl with a soft side. Nice. Sympathetic. Protective. We get to know the better side of her as the anime grows on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 .\\n\\n\r\nYou'll love this anime, no doubt. Although there are many cliche and typical moments, they're still worth watching, in my opinion. The tsundere effect, moe moments, competitive atmosphere... They all come together to carefully produce the anime that is Kaichou wa Maid-sama. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 .\\n\\n\r\nThis anime scores pretty high in my books. If it continues to unfold the way it does in the manga (and has at least 26 episodes :D), not only will I be happy, but it also has the materials to become one of your most favourite anime. \\n\\n\r\n                                                      -----\\n\\n\r\nSo, for now, all we can do is wait, and see how the plot develops... \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kaicho Wa Maid-sama, another series put in the category of typical.\r\nPlot:\r\nTypical. The main character, Misaki is your not so average shoujo lead, why? Because she is the head of the student council but also conceals and dark secret; she works in a maid cafe. Big whoop. The plot is very linear she meets the handsome, popular bishie of the school and gradually throughout the episodes romance is suppose to flourish. Slice of life is evident because of school activities, competitions, pesky, convenient love triangles and maid service to make the anime seem related to real life. There's is nothing special about the plot, if youseen other shoujos then you can predict what's going to happen next.  On a side note when the words \"Maid Cafe\" appear, I automatically guessed more fan service than the usual. Yup, there is plenty of fan service for both sexes. Hurray. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Development:\\n\r\nVery static. Misaki may appear strong at first but after seeing her character I have one thing to say, Tsundere. Everything about her is \"Tsundere\". How she treats her fellow students with her Iron Fist. How she treats Usui harshly and then tenderly is just plain nonsensical. Did I also mention that she is poor too? Typical. Usui is definitely the worst character in the entire show. He has no flaws, everything about him is perfect and to add he's from a wealthy family. Wikipedia even says so! How is this bad? Usui stalks Misaki... and this is suppose to be sexy?  He does not show any emotion, and character at all. Essentially he is a boring robot. Incredibly indistinguishable if you line up him up with other male leads. Expecting character development? Than you'll be disappointed. Side characters are quit forgettable except Hinata and Aoi. Well there's the egotistical rival of Usui, the fan-boys and Misaki's classmates/co-workers. Blah\\n\r\nI have a problem with people liking the series just because they think Misaki is a \"strong\" lead. If that's the case then why does Usui always comes to the rescue? Even when someone is harassing her, Usui seems to be there to stop it automatically.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nDecent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMediocre. I was expecting something out of the norm since this series was so \"talked\" about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe only thing that is unique about this series is Misaki working in a Maid Cafe. Don't believe the hype.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kaichou wa Maid-sama! is far from your regular romance anime and that is EXACTLY why you'll love it. While most anime if they have a romance element tease you by implying character feelings with subtle interactions but no real physical connection such as a kiss and without spoiling much Kaichou doesn't exactly have a lot of physical connections either but it's just so bluntly put you love it. It literally defines your anime dream romance which is why you should watch Kaichou wa Maid-sama! now!\r\nStoryline; 10\r\nWhile the storyline in Kaichou is not complex and the most intense thing ever you'll fall helplessly in love withevery element of it. From the comedic side-stories to the annoying childhood friend to the stubborn protagonist not admitting their feelings! There are so many elements intertwined within the story that create this bittersweet mood you can't escape.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation Style; 9\\n\\n\r\nKaichou wa Maid-sama isn't the most recent series but it's art style definitely compares to some recent anime and I would argue effortlessly that it is really easy on the eyes. You'll find as you watch the artist do a fantastic job of really visually allowing you to follow the cute story of Kaichou! \\n\\n\r\nSound; 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite not having any of my favorite songs Kaichou does bring some nice songs within it's OST that I can sit down and listen too every now and then to really relive the ever amazing experience of watching Kaichou wa Maid-sama! Now I will say I did love the main theme, and don't get that mixed up with the opening, the maid theme is super cute and plays throughout multiple parts of the series. You'll know it fully after five episodes what I'm talking about, it is just so damn catchy!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters presented in Kaichou are definitely among some of my favorites. Usui being my male role model because we share this quiet/shy nature about us that allows us to appear mysterious to women and that leads to easily teasing them! Usui you'll find is rather comical, reserved but also just out there. He fits perfectly with Misa and I definitely think you all will too! \\n\r\nMisa now, she is your typical yet slightly cuter Tsundere that we all fandom over! Her characteristics are rather aggressive at first but slowly over time she shows more kindness and even some extra stuff all of you romance lovers will just die over! \\n\r\nAs you watch Kaichou you'll find between these two main characters and the perfectly fit supporting characters that you'll be left in the characters shoes on an entertaining adventure of romance, heartbreaks and much more!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I adored Kaichou and really hope you will too! It's cute, funny and all around enjoyable! All you romance lovers I promise you won't be left dissatisfied like other shoes such as Nisekoi, you will definitely get your plateful with this anime and even some of you comedy lovers will get a certain level of laughs out of this wonderful show!\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I gave Kaichou wa Maid-sama a 9/10 for its dazzling ability to keep me on the edge of my seat the entire length of the series! A giant round of applies for the creators of this anime and a huge pat on the back to the author!",

The fact is that this show is all about the COMEDY!!  As a guy myself, i generally avoid shoujo shows, but this show was kept me in for a couple of very good reasons.\r\n1)  Misaki-chan is so cute, adorable, and hot!!  maybe kinda like how those 3 idoits in the Maid cafe feel.  I love seriesthat have a character that i just love, i just get enough of that character, no matter how tsundere she is.  You will begin to get into her character and feel how she feels.\\n\\n\r\n2)  This show is just freaking hilarious.  Like i said, comedy is this shows strong point.  Every episode makes you laugh.  It isn't a serous romantic show how other people expect it to be.  You watch it for the LOL's and character development of Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show has quite a few bad points which is why my overall rating is a 9 and not a 10.  The other reviewers pretty much point out all the bad things so theres no reason for me to say it here.  \\n\r\nFor one more good thing, is that i love the ED song.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show is also unique in some ways.  Recently it a really cool \"special\" ep, but i dont want to go into too much details because it might spoil it for some people.  And some with the other unique thing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler-free review:\r\nI tend to be very wary when it comes to the Shoujo genre due to the amount of clich\u00e9s I'll be facing ahead of me. But it's alright, I do not mind a clich\u00e9 as long as it's well executed.\r\nThis one was disastrous. \r\nThe characters: 1/10\r\nI think the worst thing about the anime was its characters. Extremely horrendous, from the main characters to the very useless ones. Let's start with the main characters:\r\nTakumi Usui: I think I should start making a list of my most hated characters, and I'm sure Usui will top that list. I have never seen such an atrocious character inmy life like this before. If I had one word to describe Usui with, it will be: stalker.\\n\r\nUsui is a literal stalker that started following Ayuzawa everywhere she went. We don't see much about his character. We don't see him doing anything but stalking Ayuzawa. It's beyond me why every girl in the school worships him. They don't like him, they literally worship the dude. Every single person in the school worships him, let it be male or female. For no damn reason. Sure, he's good looking, but that's all. He's a cold, emotionless, expressionless character that rejects girls in the worst way possible. He does not to talk to anyone, has no friends, and does not do anything but stalk Ayuzawa. It seriously got creepy. He would even casually pat her head, half-hug her, or calls her 'his maid' or 'his' in front of people, despite her continuously telling him not to 'casually touch her.' He repeatedly makes her uncomfortable and tensed. I don't know about you, but if the girl I like does not like my presence, I wouldn't be around her 24/7. He went as far as pretending to be a stalker when there were rumours of stalkers targeting maids so 'she'd be ready.' That's the kind of a creep he is.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Ayuzawa: The demonic Class President who scares off boys and helps girls. As it's quite obvious in the synopsis, Misaki isn't your average girl. She's not so very feminine, an Aikido kickass, and a workaholic. She's a very cheesy character of the not-like-other-girls theme. But a character can only get so  clich\u00e9. Misaki exceeded the limit. The anime wanted to show how much of an oh so strong independent woman it got so annoying. She's the top in academics, the top in sports, the Class President who handles all kinds of responsibilities and organises events. And she also has a part-time job as a maid in cafe. She's hardworking, determined, selfless, accepting, thoughtful, hot-headed and a tomboy. On top of that, she does not have a single breakdown. She's completely one dimensional, annoying, and boring. I think it's the worst version of a tsundere I have ever seen. A very forgettable character. If anything, she came off as a sadist who likes to scare boys, and a masochist who likes to be in pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters: You shouldn't really expect any meaningful supporting characters when the main characters themselves are one dimensional, so here I am, repeating again, every single supporting character is a stupid, one dimensional airhead. \\n\r\nAnd seriously, what is WRONG with the whole stalker idea? Not only does Ayuzawa have a main stalker, she also has 3 other stalkers that go to her cafe every single day until they're penniless because Ayuzawa is 'kawaiiii', even though she was their enemy at the beginning and they hated her guts. It IS NOT OK to stare at a girl at your school every day at her part-time job.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters can be distributed into 3 groups:\\n\r\nA. The stalkers: mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nB. The dumb airheads: all her coworkers at school and basically every other girl in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nC. The worshippers: Which are the rest of the school: We have\\n\r\n1. 5 boys who look exactly the same, who worship Ayuzawa because of how smart she is and how much they want to be like her. (They also follow her everywhere in the school)\\n\r\n2. The rest of the school: Usui worshippers. Every time he opens his mouth, they fangirl and drool (Not literally) at his words. Like he's a god.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story: 2/10\\n\r\nOne point for the idea. It's your typical tough girl with an oh-I'm-not-like-other-girls theme, and your average hot boi that everyone is head over heels for while the only person who grabs his attention is the one who does not give a damn about him -- the tough girl. It's a very famous clich\u00e9 especially in the Shoujo genre and if it can be done well, then it can be good. I think this version of it was the worst I have ever read/seen. The anime is mostly a very tedious Slice of Life about overused one dimensional characters. It's dragging, extremely boring, full of unnecessary details with a very shitty romance--if I dare call this creepy thing they had a romance. Nothing ever truly happens. Romance lovers should skip this anime as well, there's a very limited amount of 'romantic scenes', and a lot of awkward ones. (Though, to be fair, the final scene at the final episode was decent.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: \\n\r\nIt was alright. The characters are well-drawn but would alternate between a decent drawing and a crappy 5-year-old scribbles a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: \\n\r\nIt was okay. The voices are kind of decent, but the music was a bit underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: below zero.\\n\r\nNothing about the anime was enjoyable, there is not a single thing you can find even slightly amusing and not a single character you can root for. It was torturous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 Appalling. A very terrible experience.",

This is a story of a girl who's clueless that the popular & perfect guy in school likes her. Just add a bit of twist that the girl has a headstrong personality and very stubborn to admit to love.\r\nI have to say that this anime is for the kiddies and who likes to waste time with very slow character relationship development. I felt that I should have skipped 3/4 of the series and just watched the last 3 episodes where there wassense. Lots of moments of boredom, dull, irrelevant scenes that made me want to fast forward. Not to mention, there were fillers. For me, it was in the last 3 episodes that finally got interesting and exciting. Despite that, there are funny scenes and cuteness appeal to it that encouraged me to finish until the end. \\n\\n\r\n20+ episodes of dragging story is just too much for me, so it's a 5. I don't recommend this anime for people who have limited time to watch and dislikes watching an episode with very small connection to the previous. Plus, the anime is incomplete and continues to the manga which leaves plenty of plot holes. Better watch Bokura ga Ita or Lovely Complex than this.",

            "content": "I've been searching for a romantic comedy anime to watch recently, and I was flooded with suggestions for Kaichou wa Maid-Sama. I've tried to watch this series before, but gave up after the first episode because it wasn't really an anime that titillated my brain. But yesterday I gave it a second go, and since I'm not in school until September, I finished it in a day. So, here's my review for the critically acclaimed Maid-sama!\r\nStory: 6.\r\nThere's really not much interesting about this story. It's enough to keep the viewer interested, but it's nothing spectacular. I didn't appreciate the filler episodes seeing as this isa measly 26 episode series. the story was definitely missing the umph factor, but as I said before, it's enough to keep the viewer interested. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is enjoyable and easy on the eyes. Chibi animation isn't usually my thing, but I didn't mind it whenever it popped up in this anime. The character design was nice as well. The thing that I didn't appreciate about the art was that sometimes it was just so damn cheesy. The 'embrace' scenes usually made me laugh and cringe with the amount of cheese. It could have done without the overly flowery backgrounds, wind ruffling the characters' hair when they were inside, and slow motion. Another thing that made my eyes roll was the slow pan on Usui every time he was introduced in the episode. Okay. We get it -- he's attractive. Stop reminding us. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI think that this is one of the first anime where I haven't listened to more than 5 seconds of the ED. There was nothing there for me. And maybe it's because I watched the episodes on repeat, but the OP wasn't doing it for me either. It was annoying after the third time of hearing it, and since I couldn't fast forward it without my screen buffering I muted my computer until it was over. I usually like the OP and ED. As a matter of fact, there was no way that I -- even once -- got tired of the Lovely Complex and Death Note first OP & ED's. They had a good sound, and great corresponding images. But with Maid-Sama, it was pretty much Usui trying to look hot. AGAIN. *RAGEFACE FUUUUU*. I didn't mind the score in the anime, though. A lot of the time it went unnoticed, which I saw as a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nI'm constantly confused with my feelings with these characters. One minute, I love them and the next minute they annoy me. I was definitely up and down with Misaki. I appreciated her dedication and her hard work, but sometimes she was just un-rightfully a bitch. On top of that, she acted clueless when it came to Usui a lot of the time, which annoyed me. I did like her relationships between her girlfriends, though. Because no matter what, she'd do anything for them, and I thought that was nice. Usui I spent most of the anime impartial about. I liked his witty sexual humour, but there was no character development with him. The writer tried way too hard to make him a mysterious character. It was plain annoying. A thing that truly annoyed me about Usui was that he was constantly at Misaki's beck and call. I'm sorry, I don't need realism in an anime, but his 'being there right in the nick of time' was wholly ridiculous. He was such a stalker, and he didn't let Misaki do anything without his guidance. I can't count the amount of times that he has been just waiting for her, saving her, or eavesdropping on her. For someone who was supposedly the most popular guy ever, he REALLY needed a life. Some arcs in the story would have been way more interesting if he wasn't there to stop the progression. The only thing that Usui's got going for him besides his looks, is that he's got a playful personality. I enjoyed a lot of the secondary characters in this anime because they were, a lot of the time, more interesting. My favorite secondary character was Hanata. He actually had a real personality and feelings. He was funny, but dedicated. Out of Usui and Hanata, Hanata is certainly the more desirable one in my opinion, but opinions differ.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI think the fact that I finished this anime in a day says something. It's entertaining enough to watch from beginning to end. The humour is sometimes fresh, and the story was fun for the most part. There were a few episodes that I forced myself through, and a few episodes where I couldn't stop watching. I like these types of anime, so it was easy to get through, but it's certainly not anything spectacular. A lot of the arcs could have been better done, but they were enjoyable none the less. My biggest annoyance with this anime was certainly the amount of cheesiness in certain episodes. Certainly eye-rolling worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIf you want a nice rom/ com anime to watch, I recommend this anime. It's certainly not the best in the genre, but it's certainly not the worst either. I enjoyed it, it just wasn't my favorite. If you want a truly great rom/ com high school anime Lovely Complex is one that does it right, and Maid-sama is one that does it well. Pick your poison. Hope I helped!",

            "content": "Well, let me get started on this review. \r\nStory? There is no story. There is no objective in for the plot, and the same episode plan repeats itself until the very end. It's always Misaki having trouble with something, then Usui does something incredible or they have a romantic moment where she doesn't trust him or what he feels about her. She's always worrying if people will find out she works as a maid, but there isn't drama involving this fact. You would expect to see problems involving the main character being with the popular guy in school, but nothing happens. 4/10\r\nThe art is okay.Just okay. It doesn't have anything special about it, Usui could have been drawn better, but that's just my opinion. Not much details and there is a lot of chibis in the anime for comic relief. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is okay too, even though easily forgettable. Nothing special. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Well, this I feel the need to write about. The characters have absolutely no character development. We see Hinata, that only appears in the last episodes, having more character development than the protagonist! It's just absurd. There is no depth in her character, and not even in Usui's character. All we actually know about Misaki is that she is poor, has a lot of work to do, and hates boys. She's a typical tsundere. We know very little about Usui, except the fact that he is some-like a God, being perfect on everything he does. There are a lot of characters I could name here that appear almost every episode, but don't have any importance. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd put 4/10 on enjoyment by the fact that I had nothing else to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 4/10. Characters were bad, plot was pretty bad(since there was none), and the art and sound weren't enough to compensate those both, that together are just asking for disaster. You could have a bad plot(or none) and good characters, that would probably be a good rated anime. And the other way around too, it isn't that unusual, with great plot but bad characters. When you don't have either of them, it tends to be badly rated.",

            "content": "I follow the MAL rating format; Hence 6 is a fair. However i encourage  you to make judgment on the review rather than staring at my score. I would also like to state i was not a previous fan, nor am i a girl.\r\n-The maid theme is not overused.\r\nThis is refreshing because when i first started watching i was afraid as to how important this detail would be. While it is a catalyst for many events it is refreshing to see other interesting situations occur totally independent of it; The arcs are not exactly unique or unpredictable, but are still rather enjoyable.\r\n-An okay comedy.\r\nItis hard to make me laugh. However, i was surprised at the number of times I enjoyed a joke. The assortment of side characters and their quirks were implemented rather well.\\n\\n\r\n-Good array of characters.\\n\r\nIt is nice to see lots of unique characters and still not overpopulate the cast. It is able to give most of them significance, and have them all interact in many ways. However, they still remain side characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Some development for each of those characters.\\n\r\nMany characters are given their own episode which allows us to see a small amount of growth in everyone one of them. Even without many getting their own dedication it still takes away from the main plot, and draws out the relationship much longer than need be.\\n\\n\r\n-Usui is given the wrong image.\\n\r\nHe could of been our perfect prince charming, but he is also portrayed as a giant tease. We get absolutely not development for Usui, and never learn why he is afraid of commitment and  keeps his distance. Personally, I accepted this since there was no real reason to think badly of him. Yet, in the end we are able to compare him to the more sincere rivals, and I slowly grew to hate him in the later episodes. This point depends on how you feel towards your clich\u00e9 cold, perfect bishounen when he is the one trying to win over Misaki's feelings.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After a series of pretty depressing animes (Hoshi no Koe, Byousoku 5 Centimetres), I decided to pick up something light and fun in a school setting and thought that this series looked promising. As a guy, my only other experience with Shoujo anime has been Ouran High School Host Club (OHSHC), which was really funny and enjoyable, so I thought to give it another go.\r\nThe plot of this anime is pretty straightforward as can be seen from the synopsis. Right from the get-go we already know who the 2 main characters are and how this is going to end, so the only interesting part isin HOW we get there, i.e. the characters and their romantic/comedic interactions have to be tight.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead, Ayuzawa Misaki, is refreshingly strong-willed, independent and decisive, totally unlike the simpering, useless female leads we get in the Shounen genre. Importantly, we see that although she has all these positive qualities, she's gotten to where she is through lots of hard work, study and training. This makes her easily likeable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does not hold true for the male lead. Usui is (and this is what the anime tells us) the most handsome guy in school, the smartest, the best at every sport he tries his hand at (when he tries, because he doesn't actually belong in any clubs) and rich. Basically he doesn't put in any effort into anything but is still the best at everything. The character is poorly developed because there is no revelation of any flaws/weaknesses, his background, or his motivation (I still don't know why he decided to randomly chase Misaki!). He's just an enigmatic, perfect, rich kid. (I also found him to be an insufferably smug SOB who was borderline stalker-ish and overly possessive, but that might be personal bias). To me, this is unacceptable because the anime was 27 episodes long - more than sufficient to devote 1 or 2 episodes to develop him. In comparison, OHSHC with a harem of 6 guys managed to develop each one's personality, strengths and weaknesses in 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast was well fleshed out which made them interesting characters in their own right, from the cross dressing shota to the former delinquent boss to the childhood friend. Each of them got an episode to flesh out their personalities, which again makes me wonder why Usui didn't get any such development. This could be a flaw from the source manga and may not be the fault of the anime, but is a flaw nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, from the mid-point of the series, I started dreading the moments when the main pairing would get together in a romantic sequence. I also ended up rooting for the 'love rival' who appeared towards the end of the series even though I knew it wouldn't work out. This was when I realised that the 'romance', the whole premise on which this series is founded, had fallen flat for me, mainly on the weakness of Usui's character.\\n\\n\r\nComedy wise, the tone was pretty light and pretty enjoyable throughout. I quite enjoyed Usui's teasing of Misaki and her flustered reactions. The art was also top notch, which made it that much easier to finish a series in which I was unable to make any personal investment. Although I have rated it a 6, I try and use the whole spectrum of grades, so it is still above average and watchable. Just don't have too high an expectation for a good romance, for the reasons I have stated above.",

            "content": "\"President of the Student Council at the almost-all-boys Seika High School, the hard-as-nails Misaki Ayuzawa works every day to make life easier on the small population of co-eds who have enrolled there. Though an unholy terror to all things male during school hours, in order to provide for her impoverished family, she secretly works after school at a maid cafe in Akihabara. However, when campus hottie Usui Takumi wanders into the restaurant during her shift, suddenly she finds her reputation in school at his mercy...\"\r\nStory: Even though I finished watching Kaichou wa Maid-sama long ago, I\u2019ve been caught up in some strange and unexpected businessthat made me postpone doing this review sooner, however better late than never. Kaichou wa Maid-sama from the moment it was announced people expected this one to be a big hit. The manga was popular way before the anime was announced, and the content that it has and the theme that it debats at the beginning surely managed to form a big fan-base in no time. What Kaichou presents is actually a simple romantic story but with a comedy aspect, sometimes well thought with very funny moments, with a tasteful humour but dragged way too long. The story centers on a high school girl named Misaki Ayuzawa. Even though she appears to be a normal high school girl, she has a big responsibility on her shoulders. Her father left her mother with a huge debt and to repay it she needed to get a job so that she can help her mother to pay the bills and to live a poor but normal life together with her younger sister Suzuna Ayuzawa. In order to cope with such a huge responsibility she had to strengthen up and become a reliable person and also an organized person. She became the student council president in a school where in the past it was an only all boys highschool but recently it got co-ed. By becoming a dictator she placed the welfare of the feminine side first so that the influence of boys may diminish. But this thing proved to be very difficult since all the time she had to do more than just her normal job. One boy in particular always proved to be very annoying since he did not do anything bad for the school nor for the teachers nor for other people but he attracts attention with his good looks and by the fact that he always rejects the proposals coming from other girls. Misaki stands firm and confronts the boy, his name is Usui Takumi. However this ends when Misaki\u2019s secret has been exposed to Usui, he sees her when she was working part-time at a maid caf\u00e9, which Misaki did her best to keep it as a secret so that her reputation won\u2019t fall. Thinking about it, since the school at that time was filled with delinquent boys, the fact that she was seen as a ruthless dictator might\u2019ve been a stimulant so that they should stop harassing the girls, however if the secret was known by the guys they would have used it to exploit her weakness and all the thing would\u2019ve went out of control. Nevertheless, Usui offered his help since Misaki is the kind that works too hard for other people\u2019s sake while ignoring her own welfare, in other words a workaholic, and from this point on a strange but an imminent love relationship begins. One thing makes this show so popular, and that is the comedy aspect that I mentioned at the beginning. While the beginning of this show seemed to be a bit more serious, what is about to come are some big waves of laughter and shocking scenes (shocking not in a negative way). The romantic plot moves in slow motion but it surely develops mainly because Usui always hanged around Misaki, when she needed or not. How will their relationship develop and will Misaki be able to accept Usui and his own feelings in the end? What about her own feelings, will she notice them and accept them? I guess we all know the answers since this show does not seem like a melodrama to end in a dramatic way but the one thing that I was kinda disappointed in, was that they needed over 26 episodes so that they can reach a damn conclusion, when this could\u2019ve been ended much earlier with room for more development. Nevertheless, Kaichou wa Maid-sama is not a show to be overlooked that easily, since it provides what fans look for mostly.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound: When we speak about a studio like J.C. Staff (Ai Yori Aoshi, Azumanga Daioh, Hatsukoi Limited, Kimikiss Pure Rouge, Tsukihime, Nodame Cantabile, Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Toradora, etc) we speak about good animation quality, design and directing. Even though this studio has a long history with both good shows, average and bad shows I have to admit that they did their best when it comes to animation issues and Kaichou is yet another example. Somehow this studio has a tendency to adapt romantic shows (with the romance aspect being in the center or as a side aspect is really not important) rather than mindless shounen shows which is another reason why they managed to impress. As for the sound, pretty much forgettable, the soundtracks are so shoujo~ish that it makes you sometimes burst into flames and quickly overlook them, however the only good point about this show regarding sound issues are the background sound where we can see several improvements. As for voice acting, it was pretty good even though there aren\u2019t so many popular names among the cast, Misaki being voiced by Ayumi Fujimura (Kara no Kyoukai, Hatsukoi Limited, Kaze no Stigma, Letter Bee, Shinrei Tantei Yakumo, etc) and Usui being voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto best known for his role Asu no Yoichi and To Aru Majutsu no Index.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Character wise I was once again impressed. Misaki surely has a very interesting personality, a ruthless dictator at school, a kind person around the other female students, a hardworking one when it comes to both school and family issues, she places the welfare of others in front of her own. However the only person which she can\u2019t handle very well and her true self is revealed is of course Usui. He does not have a bad influence around her but somehow he is always around whenever she needs help. By pulling several pranks he managed to see more moods and reactions from Misaki and without knowing a true and strong relationship develops, which Usui does not try to deny while Misaki strongly tries to keep her feelings locked inside, catalogating Usui as a perverted alien whenever he pulls a prank against her and makes her feel embarrassed. As for the other characters, even though they have a less important role to play in this show they help in building the relationship between Misaki and Usui while they are also developed and not left behind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kaichou wa Maid-sama has everything a good show should have. Though sometimes drama is the aspect that makes a romantic show more spicy, for this one it did not need it since the comedy aspect of it did a great job. I admit that I prefer romantic dramas over romantic comedies but this was up until I encountered this show. I hope for a second season of this show.",

            "content": "Kaichou Wa Maid Sama - I picked up this series because I heard a lot of compliments about it being one of the best romance anime ever.\r\nWell, to be honest, I disagree. It's not one of the best romance anime I have ever watched and to call it the best is an overstatement. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nBasically, it's about a man-hating high school president who works part time in a maid cafe and tries her best to not let her secret leak out as it will ruin her reputation as a high school president. However, one fateful day, her secret is found out by Usui Takumi, thehottest guy in school.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems pretty interesting although cliche. But as the series progress, the whole maid thing seemed like it was all just a \"line\" to attract viewers - like me.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki as a maid didn't even seem important in the series - the series was quite jumbled up and I don't even know if there's a story behind it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat bugged me the most was Shintani - Misaki's childhood friend who appeared out of a sudden in the last 4 episodes - I mean why on earth does it has to be in the last 4 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story has lots of unsolved parts like Usui's mysterious background - why is he living alone huh with a cat? What happened to Shintani? :O So how does the maid thing goes? Did the school find out about it?\\n\\n\r\nIf they weren't planning on doing another season of Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, then they should have omit all these \"missing\" parts. But IF there is a second season, I rest my case.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBefore I watched Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, I was watching Sugar Sugar Rune and I know it's pretty biased to do this but I just had to compare Sugar Sugar Rune's art with Kaichou wa Maid Sama although they are two completely different series.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art in Kaichou wa Maid Sama was......decent. I thought it wasn't very detailed and to put it simply, it's unattractive. The characters are alright- lots of chibi art and that makes it really cute :D \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP song is catchy although I'm not a big fan of the ending songs D: They were a bit too rock-ish for me..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI think the main reason why so many people loved Kaichou Wa Maid Sama and regard it as one of the best romance anime is because they either\\n\\n\r\nA) Find Usui cute \\n\\n\r\nTrust me, if you fell in love with an anime character, you would love that anime to death - I've been there.\\n\\n\r\nB) Wishes there was someone like Usui\\n\\n\r\nI'm put off by Usui's personality. Damn! Is he perfect or is he PERFECT? There are absolutely no flaws in him. He can fight, he's handsome, hot, smart, sporty and everything you want in a perfect guy. But that's why I dislike him.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality, there is no guy like that and I do wish Usui had some kind of flaws...(Wearing glasses is not a flaw) HAHAHAHA I did see Usui wearing glasses in some episodes - is he really short sighted or what? Was he wearing contact lenses all these while?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, bear with me, I'm just curious :P\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do like Misaki. She's hardworking, stubborn and strong and let's not forget, she does has some flaws which is why I rated the character part a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters made the series more lively and interesting but to be honest, they were quite useless in all 26 episodes. There weren't much character development till the end of the series and I thought that the ending was really, really awful.\\n\\n\r\nIt was rushed and it's a mix of all 25 episodes crumbled up into 1 last episode - episode 26. That's what I have to say about episode 26.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki's feelings for Usui was so CONFUSING! I don't even know if she likes him or what...she may like him all of a sudden in this episode and then hate him all of a sudden in another episode - it's just so messy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was funny and enjoyable if it's in a \"Slice of life\" category but as one of the best romance anime? NEVER.\\n\\n\r\nTo put in in \"One of the best romance anime\" is simply an offence to all romance anime lovers. \\n\\n\r\nRomance series should leave you happy, warm and fluffy inside - and make you go \"Awwwwwwwwwwwwww\" \\n\\n\r\nKaichou wa Maid Sama didn't really leave me warm and happy inside...it just made me go....\"WTFFFFFF\" cause the series are quite unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nIt was alright overall.\\n\\n\r\nSo I shall rate it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading ^_^",

            "content": "When news of this year's new shows began surfacing, Kaichou wa Maid-sama was near the top of the ones I was looking forward to most.  I had read a little of the manga and always found it to be funny.  Last year had featured a pretty good run of romance anime and this looked poised to continue that run.  Despite the series' fabulous artwork and a lot of great comedy, it is unfortunately a bit of a disappointment.\r\nThe premise behind Maid-sama has an initially interesting hook.  Misaki Ayuzawa is the newly elected student council president at a mostly male high school.She is strict and violent in protection of the female students and in making it a place friendlier to girls.  But she has a secret that could ruin her image as the tough and unyielding class president, she works part time in a Maid Cafe to help her family with the bills.  Of course this means that the ultimate alpha male at the school, Usui Takumi, will find out about her secret.  Blackmail, as only shoujo can do ensues... or does it?\\n\\n\r\nThankfully the answer is no but what does follow, at least initially is a pretty fun and entertaining back and forth repartee between Misaki and Usui.  Misaki is revealed to not be quite the man hating tyrant she is in school and Usui is not the cold, unfeeling ladies man either.  The romantic chemistry between the two characters is quite good and builds very quickly early on.  But the typical problems that plague shoujo romances soon follow.  Relationship development slows to a crawl and nothing of significance happens after the first third of the series until its end.  Despite this the series does end with a bang and has a very touching and satisfying conclusion which is probably the only thing that saved it from a lower overall score.\\n\\n\r\nMaid-sama at its best is extremely funny and enjoyable to watch.  The series' comedy is really quite good most of the time.  But no amount of jokes can hide the fact that it doesn\u2019t have any kind of story what so ever.  Misaki's job at Maid Latte is mostly just a gimmick, and besides for a handful of episodes it\u2019s totally unimportant to the plot.  Basically what we get is a series of loosely connected stories with the same underlying theme.  Even though they are mostly funny it gets tiring when you realize that nothing significant is ever happening.  When things do finally start to get interesting between our couple, not unexpectedly a rival appears.  Though he is so poorly conceived and much too late to the party to have any real significance.  It was almost like someone in the production staff realized with five episodes to go that they nearly made an entire anime without a love triangle.  Though despite all of this the biggest flaw is the sheer weight of supporting characters and their overall detraction to the screen time and back-story of the lead characters.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki makes for a good heroine.  She is quite funny walking the line between her dictator president and her submissive maid persona's.  However she is a bit of your stereotypical tsundere, but it's easy to root for her.  Shockingly we really don't find out all that much about her with the exception of some flashbacks of when she was a little girl (which in actuality weren't even about her).  Other than learning her father had walked out on her mother and sister, leaving enormous debts and apparently they are also really poor.  An aside to Misaki's family poverty though.  I thought the way they portrayed her family was kind of offensive.  The inside of the house is crumbling and dirty.  Walls have paint peeling off them, the floor has holes in it, and their are spider webs and other cliches.  Yes we get it, they're poor.  Like poor people can\u2019t keep a clean house?  Besides this is completely out of character for someone as meticulous as Misaki.  When you consider how fanatical she is at school about keeping things clean and orderly the very idea that she wouldn't do the same at home is totally implausible.  \\n\\n\r\nUsui on the other hand initially comes off as the kind of love interest I hate.  Aloof, privileged, and apparently great at everything he tries he is precisely the kind of ideal man that makes shoujo romances so unbelievable.  However it is pretty quickly apparent he isn't your typical leading man.  You can tell he is immediately smitten with Misaki from the start and he uses this droll personality of his to push her buttons and amuse himself while at the same time bring her closer to him.  I ended up liking him quite a bit.  Like Misaki,  his past remains as much of a mystery at the end as it was at the beginning.  Especially frustrating considering the amount of time that was given to Misaki's childhood friend Shintani who basically only appeared in 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting cast really brings down this series though.  As much as I enjoyed the leads, I found the rest of the cast to be uninspired and lacking substance.  The main reason for this is that there are just way too many of them.  Maid-sama features nearly 30 supporting characters and they take way too much from the ones that are actually important.  Even if many of them are likable and funny, they have absolutely zero depth and at best one facet to their personalities.  Stories with lots of characters rarely work that well especially when the majority serve no purpose and overlap one another.  Too many of them are basically identical to each other and were unnecessary.  For example I know having a cross dresser is a shoujo staple but having more than one in the same anime is overkill, regardless of whether or not they both did it willingly.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime is well acted and I enjoyed the performances for the lead actors in particular.  Though neither of them are rookies by any means, they aren\u2019t the typical names we are used to seeing at the top of a cast either.  So I enjoyed hearing some fresh voices for a change.  The music is solid but unspectacular.  Saya Mizuno's \"My Secret\" is an appropriate if kind of generic shoujo OP.  Both ED songs by heidi are pretty good though and I liked them a lot more.\\n\\n\r\nArtistically Maid-sama is strong.  I did enjoy the character designs and the frequent use of deformed and chibi characters to complement the series comedy.  The art really brings out the emotions of Misaki and Usui and is able to speak volumes about their feelings for one another even with nothing is being said.  The quality of this non audible communication is one of the best I have seen in an anime.\\n\\n\r\nEven though I was ultimately disappointed with this anime, it was not a complete waste of time to watch.  If you enjoy Rom-Com anime then you will most likely not be sorry for watching this.  The comedy is great; the romance is hit or miss.\\n",

            "content": "I thoroughly enjoyed Maid Sama! for a number of reasons. \r\nWhile it may not appear like the most original series, Maid Sama does diverge from the conventional tsundere-falls-in-love-with-popular-dude plotline. The protagonist Misaki is the strong and very feminist (quite often man-hating) President of her school council. Maid Sama doesn't stick with the cliche of either the ultra cool bishounen or super strong bishoujo be the best. Usui and Misaki are quite evenly matched; contrary to what some reviews state, Misaki often does NOT always need Usui to come rescue her. She is depicted as capable, feisty and caring. Misaki's a great character, the kind ofgirlfriend you'd want to hang out with and rely on. She makes the series compulsively watchable because she's a character you can actually admire, relate to and empathise with. If anyone is looking for a strong and likeable female protagonist, I would definitely recommend the series to them.\\n\\n\r\nMaid Sama also provides pretty good humour. A lot of this comes from the gender-relation jokes, such as in how Misaki takes control of the boy-dominated school known for being vulgar and smelly. I also really enjoyed how Usui's character sort of undercuts the bishounen stereotype - although Usui's a bishounen, he's also incredibly bizarre, and is capable of saying or doing the oddest things with the calmest expression. He's kind of a semi-parody of the bishounen type, which I find really entertaining. \\n\\n\r\nMaid Sama also does focus to some extent on the other characters (can't reveal exactly how without spoilers, but you're in for some surprises). Despite the somewhat deviant nature of these characters, Maid Sama casts them in a tender, affectionate light, ultimately creating some feel-good moments without downplaying how hilariously odd they are.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe anime does also have some touching moments, without being nauseatingly over the top. What I really love about this anime is its ability to convey emotions through subtext, or what is not actually explicitly said, but is instead shown. The viewer is left to infer why Usui behaves the way he does, for example, and to infer why Misaki is so ignorant of his affections (or is she?). Granted, it's in no way rocket science, this is shoujo after all, but I like that the anime builds up some tension and mystery this way, and it really engages the audience's emotions. Each episode also has plenty of events to keep you entertained.\\n\\n\r\nThe last thing that I love about the anime is its music. There's a piano theme in particular that I find quite moving. The composers also go to the effort of using different kinds of music, e.g. a rock theme for Usui's appearance in Ep 9. I think the music is original, appropriate and beautiful in its own right. It definitely sets the tone for the anime. The sound effects are also quite spot on.\\n\\n\r\nIf there was anything I would criticise about Maid Sama, it's probably that sometimes it does miss the target. A few episodes here and there seem to kind of lose their momentum, especially when focusing on side characters - it doesn't quite get their motivation right, and loses steam in its characterisation then. Some good side characters are also obviously just plot devices, and lack further depth or characterisation as a result. You end up thinking, it could have been so much more! It's a good anime, but ultimately it doesn't have that much depth because it focuses heavily on comedy. That's not a bad thing and I appreciate its focus on comedy, but if you're looking for a meaningful explanation of Misaki's man-hating psyche, you're not going to get that here. I actually like that about the anime though, it doesn't try too hard to be what it isn't, so on the whole, it remains quite spot on.\\n\\n\r\nOn the whole, I really enjoyed Maid Sama and I found more than enough in it to keep me thoroughly entertained, and enough to re-watch it a few times. I will definitely follow the series to the end and I really recommend that you guys check it out too, especially if you're looking for a less sexist shoujo anime and some great protagonists. Have fun!",

            "content": "Oh dear... Where to start with this... Well for one thing, Kaichou wa Maid-sama has frequently regarded as the star successor to the previous romance anime, Kimi ni Todoke. And I have one thing to say: Kaichou wa Maid-sama doesn't stand a chance against the far superior Kimi ni Todoke. Much of Kaichou's fanbase is probably attributed to how one person or another said it was similar to Kimi ni Todoke and continued to increase its popularity, but I would strongly disagree. Kimi ni is way better than Kaichou. Kaichou is the most stereotypical and cliched anime I have ever seen. This review will bebashed, I know it, but now let's see why it's so horrid in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 3/10\\n\r\nSo would anyone care to tell me what the story of Kaichou is? What happened to the antagonist? Did he just up and leave? Kaichou's plot is filled with too many loopholes and missing slices to be a good story. Aside from the disappearing antagonist, there are random, pointless, and cumbersome side stories for all the characters that don't matter. For argument's sake, let's say that it's more of a comedy/slice-of-life where the story is unrelated, where is the comedy? Did I laugh? No. I didn't find a single point where I could laugh, I couldn't even find any good screenshots. The plot is basically Aizawa realizing that she loves Usui and they end of together. Are there any objections to that plot? No? Well then why did it need to be stretched out over 26 episodes? This isn't a good romance like Toradora! where there are massive plot twists and needs it. Even Kimi ni Todoke had some good love triangle moments. Also, even if it did need a lot of time for development, the development of minor characters are unneeded in a romance or a slice-of-life. If it was a good romance story, than the focus on the 2 main characters is all that is needed.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 3/10\\n\r\nYou are calling this art? Most of the art is just facial close ups with sparkling backgrounds. There is no art in this. The animators were too lazy to draw in backgrounds most of the time and left it to facial close-ups. Sparkle here, sparkle there, geez, I could doodle better backgrounds than that. What else? Most of the time in crowded places, all the other people are just gray blobs. Even for the characters that did have artistic design. I could barely tell Usui apart from the other 9001 blonde hair guys in the anime. Just cloning the same character and putting on different clothes and accessories most certainly does not need any artistic talent. It's like dress-up except no one will play it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 4/10\\n\r\nSound is probably the best thing there is in this anime. The OP was painfully annoying. I don't even remember the 1st ED probably because I hated the show, but the 2nd ED had a pretty good tune. Voices? Well I guess they were alright. Some voices hurt to listen to... BGM wasn't good or bad enough to grant me and opinion, since I barely paid attention to anything other than the annoying, overused BGM that happens at the end of every episode.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 2/10\\n\r\nOh my head. There are no good characters in this anime. I hate Usui with a passion that doesn't just destroy cities, but also burn all the inhabitants and open a fissure that swallows up the whole area. I hate all of his terribad clones also. Usui is such a -----. He is annoying and is obsessed, stalker with Aizawa. If I was her, I would have kicked him so hard in the nuts that they would tear off his body, and then I would call the cops for stalking. This is romance? More like stalking. Next: The 3 bakas are more or less, 3 bakas. They are useless, pointless, annoying characters that serve no purpose. The hypnotist and girly guy with him are also fillers for nothing. UxMix or whatever they are called are just more useless junk to dig into other minor and useless characters, like Aizawa\u2019s friends. Why even bother with making a minor character romance here? And I don\u2019t even remember what the other blonde antagonist did. They killed him off and left a gaping plot hole. Shall I go on? The other maids at the caf\u00e9\u2026. What\u2019s the point the same thing applies; filler. Aoi-chan? Only in your dreams. Although Aoi is probably the easiest character to put up with. And I haven\u2019t said anything about Aizawa; . Tsundere? Please\u2026 SHE TAINTS THEM. She's truly a sorry and lame excuse of a Tsundere. Did I miss any characters? If I did then they are just too terrible to mention. Like Hinata for example... A random new character introduced late in the series.... Waste of effort and nothing really \"Triangle\" worthy even happens with him, his sole purpose existing to reveal Aizawa's pointless past.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: -1/10\\n\r\nI didn't enjoy it. Enjoyment is more of a factor of the watcher and not the anime, so there's not much to say. I found watching it a painful experience and usually just played Touhou or talked to people on the side. I just couldn't enjoy an anime with a terrible plot and horrid cast of characters. -1/10 if I could, because I didn't enjoy it, It was more like torture.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 3/10\\n\r\nThis overall score is a 2/10 with a +1 because I am just so happy that I finished this bad anime. I considered giving this anime lower because a 3 is \"Poor\" in the review box, and it's definitely not poor, (better defined as \"Pathetic\", A score of 1) but I decided to let it go. In the end, this review will just get bashed with unhelpful marks, but I would love to try to tear down the fake fanbases that attempt to compare this with the superior Kimi ni Todoke. To compare them... Let's say Kimi ni Todoke is my foot and Kaichou wa Maid-sama is the bug I just stepped on. Although Kimi ni Todoke deserved a much better status than my foot... Kaichou is bad and that's my solid opinion. Nothing you can do to change it.\\n\\n\r\nBottom Line: Don't watch it. It will take off 10 years of your life. Kaichou is just stereotypical, cliched, and just plain dumb.",

            "content": "Although this would look to be the normal cliche type rom/com, it was actually pretty enjoyable with a few different aspects to it. Instead of the male protagonist having to protect the female protagonist, misaki can actually hold her own in most situations, and then usui would come and talk to her about it. The comedy in this story was actually pretty funny, either it be usui messing with misaki about stalking her, or misaki always being super serious and whatnot. I very much enjoy this anime, the romance that progresses through the story is really heartwarming, but at times can be a little sad/wobbly.So now with the review stuffs.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nAlthough the base of the story does look to be some sort of cliche, the way they portrayed it was very nice. The romance slowly grows while they go through their daily routines, with a good amount of comical relief. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe art in this anime was pretty nice as well, whether it be a serious scene, or them drawing a dude that just got thrown out of a window. \\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty clear for the anime, and the japanese voice acting matched the characters very well. However, the english dub I tried to watch sounded pretty bad, the mics were really hot, and the characters did not match up at all. The sound for the english dub was terribly recorded, I don't know if it was the mics they were using or what, I just stuck with the subbed.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8/10\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime were fairly well developed, there was always something going on with a supporting character, rather than only focusing on the mains 100% of the time.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI really enjoy this anime, whether it be the comedy or the romance, it seems to catch my attention. The way the comedy mixed in with the romance was pretty fitting for the characters. Not to mention the way usui and misaki are always in some sort of conflict, and then it comes to a romantic scene that usually has some comedy aspects in it. Also, being that Misaki is a tsundere, it was nice to see how her feelings played out and the way Usui helped her out.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this to be a really good anime. Although there are some cliche scenes, that is to be expected from a rom/com in most cases. I still found this to be a funny/heartwarming storyline that was kept me drawn to it. I highly recommend this anime to anyone who likes a good rom/com.",

            "content": "Hmm... Let's see. What can I say about Kaichou wa Maid-sama?\r\nStory: 9 .\r\nKaichou wa Maid-sama is the first anime that has intrigued me enough to lead me into reading the manga. Although the plot line depicts some of the most typical shoujo anime events used and reused in various other circumstances, Kaichou wa Maid-sama throws in a few twists and originality that entices the viewer in a new way. \r\nArt: 7 .\r\nAlthough I wouldn't say Kaichou wa Maid-sama has outstanding artistry, I also wouldn't say it's downright terrible. It's pretty well drawn, in fact. Compared to animes like Fushigi Yuugi (no offense intended) or Itazurana Kiss, both of which I had forced myself to finish a full episode (abandoning ship on that idea), Kaichou wa Maid-sama isn't the worse. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 .\\n\\n\r\nThe opening theme song really summarizes the whole anime quite well. And for that, I applaud it. The anime itself has correctly initiated sound effects that help bring the real feel of the moments depicted. However, I find it hard to dock marks on sound for any anime, so I'm being quite easy on this area of critique... \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9 .\\n\\n\r\nAll the characters we've met so far are... interesting. They all have an aspect that's unique and sets them apart from the rest of the cast. Takumi Usui, one of the main characters, is, by far, the most intriguing character in my opinion. However, the protagonist of this story is not far behind.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Ayuzawa . Hmmm... An interesting character. Quite unique, in fact. A boy hater. Fierce. Competitive. Intelligent. Appears to be cold and 'demon' like. However, a girl with a soft side. Nice. Sympathetic. Protective. We get to know the better side of her as the anime grows on. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10 .\\n\\n\r\nYou'll love this anime, no doubt. Although there are many cliche and typical moments, they're still worth watching, in my opinion. The tsundere effect, moe moments, competitive atmosphere... They all come together to carefully produce the anime that is Kaichou wa Maid-sama. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 .\\n\\n\r\nThis anime scores pretty high in my books. If it continues to unfold the way it does in the manga (and has at least 26 episodes :D), not only will I be happy, but it also has the materials to become one of your most favourite anime. \\n\\n\r\n                                                      -----\\n\\n\r\nSo, for now, all we can do is wait, and see how the plot develops... \\n\\n",

            "content": "Kaicho Wa Maid-sama, another series put in the category of typical.\r\nPlot:\r\nTypical. The main character, Misaki is your not so average shoujo lead, why? Because she is the head of the student council but also conceals and dark secret; she works in a maid cafe. Big whoop. The plot is very linear she meets the handsome, popular bishie of the school and gradually throughout the episodes romance is suppose to flourish. Slice of life is evident because of school activities, competitions, pesky, convenient love triangles and maid service to make the anime seem related to real life. There's is nothing special about the plot, if youseen other shoujos then you can predict what's going to happen next.  On a side note when the words \"Maid Cafe\" appear, I automatically guessed more fan service than the usual. Yup, there is plenty of fan service for both sexes. Hurray. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters/Development:\\n\r\nVery static. Misaki may appear strong at first but after seeing her character I have one thing to say, Tsundere. Everything about her is \"Tsundere\". How she treats her fellow students with her Iron Fist. How she treats Usui harshly and then tenderly is just plain nonsensical. Did I also mention that she is poor too? Typical. Usui is definitely the worst character in the entire show. He has no flaws, everything about him is perfect and to add he's from a wealthy family. Wikipedia even says so! How is this bad? Usui stalks Misaki... and this is suppose to be sexy?  He does not show any emotion, and character at all. Essentially he is a boring robot. Incredibly indistinguishable if you line up him up with other male leads. Expecting character development? Than you'll be disappointed. Side characters are quit forgettable except Hinata and Aoi. Well there's the egotistical rival of Usui, the fan-boys and Misaki's classmates/co-workers. Blah\\n\r\nI have a problem with people liking the series just because they think Misaki is a \"strong\" lead. If that's the case then why does Usui always comes to the rescue? Even when someone is harassing her, Usui seems to be there to stop it automatically.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound:\\n\r\nDecent.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nMediocre. I was expecting something out of the norm since this series was so \"talked\" about.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nThe only thing that is unique about this series is Misaki working in a Maid Cafe. Don't believe the hype.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Kaichou wa Maid-sama! is far from your regular romance anime and that is EXACTLY why you'll love it. While most anime if they have a romance element tease you by implying character feelings with subtle interactions but no real physical connection such as a kiss and without spoiling much Kaichou doesn't exactly have a lot of physical connections either but it's just so bluntly put you love it. It literally defines your anime dream romance which is why you should watch Kaichou wa Maid-sama! now!\r\nStoryline; 10\r\nWhile the storyline in Kaichou is not complex and the most intense thing ever you'll fall helplessly in love withevery element of it. From the comedic side-stories to the annoying childhood friend to the stubborn protagonist not admitting their feelings! There are so many elements intertwined within the story that create this bittersweet mood you can't escape.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation Style; 9\\n\\n\r\nKaichou wa Maid-sama isn't the most recent series but it's art style definitely compares to some recent anime and I would argue effortlessly that it is really easy on the eyes. You'll find as you watch the artist do a fantastic job of really visually allowing you to follow the cute story of Kaichou! \\n\\n\r\nSound; 8\\n\\n\r\nDespite not having any of my favorite songs Kaichou does bring some nice songs within it's OST that I can sit down and listen too every now and then to really relive the ever amazing experience of watching Kaichou wa Maid-sama! Now I will say I did love the main theme, and don't get that mixed up with the opening, the maid theme is super cute and plays throughout multiple parts of the series. You'll know it fully after five episodes what I'm talking about, it is just so damn catchy!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter; 10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters presented in Kaichou are definitely among some of my favorites. Usui being my male role model because we share this quiet/shy nature about us that allows us to appear mysterious to women and that leads to easily teasing them! Usui you'll find is rather comical, reserved but also just out there. He fits perfectly with Misa and I definitely think you all will too! \\n\r\nMisa now, she is your typical yet slightly cuter Tsundere that we all fandom over! Her characteristics are rather aggressive at first but slowly over time she shows more kindness and even some extra stuff all of you romance lovers will just die over! \\n\r\nAs you watch Kaichou you'll find between these two main characters and the perfectly fit supporting characters that you'll be left in the characters shoes on an entertaining adventure of romance, heartbreaks and much more!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment; 9\\n\\n\r\nOverall I adored Kaichou and really hope you will too! It's cute, funny and all around enjoyable! All you romance lovers I promise you won't be left dissatisfied like other shoes such as Nisekoi, you will definitely get your plateful with this anime and even some of you comedy lovers will get a certain level of laughs out of this wonderful show!\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I gave Kaichou wa Maid-sama a 9/10 for its dazzling ability to keep me on the edge of my seat the entire length of the series! A giant round of applies for the creators of this anime and a huge pat on the back to the author!",

The fact is that this show is all about the COMEDY!!  As a guy myself, i generally avoid shoujo shows, but this show was kept me in for a couple of very good reasons.\r\n1)  Misaki-chan is so cute, adorable, and hot!!  maybe kinda like how those 3 idoits in the Maid cafe feel.  I love seriesthat have a character that i just love, i just get enough of that character, no matter how tsundere she is.  You will begin to get into her character and feel how she feels.\\n\\n\r\n2)  This show is just freaking hilarious.  Like i said, comedy is this shows strong point.  Every episode makes you laugh.  It isn't a serous romantic show how other people expect it to be.  You watch it for the LOL's and character development of Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nWhile this show has quite a few bad points which is why my overall rating is a 9 and not a 10.  The other reviewers pretty much point out all the bad things so theres no reason for me to say it here.  \\n\r\nFor one more good thing, is that i love the ED song.  \\n\\n\r\nThis show is also unique in some ways.  Recently it a really cool \"special\" ep, but i dont want to go into too much details because it might spoil it for some people.  And some with the other unique thing.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Spoiler-free review:\r\nI tend to be very wary when it comes to the Shoujo genre due to the amount of clich\u00e9s I'll be facing ahead of me. But it's alright, I do not mind a clich\u00e9 as long as it's well executed.\r\nThis one was disastrous. \r\nThe characters: 1/10\r\nI think the worst thing about the anime was its characters. Extremely horrendous, from the main characters to the very useless ones. Let's start with the main characters:\r\nTakumi Usui: I think I should start making a list of my most hated characters, and I'm sure Usui will top that list. I have never seen such an atrocious character inmy life like this before. If I had one word to describe Usui with, it will be: stalker.\\n\r\nUsui is a literal stalker that started following Ayuzawa everywhere she went. We don't see much about his character. We don't see him doing anything but stalking Ayuzawa. It's beyond me why every girl in the school worships him. They don't like him, they literally worship the dude. Every single person in the school worships him, let it be male or female. For no damn reason. Sure, he's good looking, but that's all. He's a cold, emotionless, expressionless character that rejects girls in the worst way possible. He does not to talk to anyone, has no friends, and does not do anything but stalk Ayuzawa. It seriously got creepy. He would even casually pat her head, half-hug her, or calls her 'his maid' or 'his' in front of people, despite her continuously telling him not to 'casually touch her.' He repeatedly makes her uncomfortable and tensed. I don't know about you, but if the girl I like does not like my presence, I wouldn't be around her 24/7. He went as far as pretending to be a stalker when there were rumours of stalkers targeting maids so 'she'd be ready.' That's the kind of a creep he is.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Ayuzawa: The demonic Class President who scares off boys and helps girls. As it's quite obvious in the synopsis, Misaki isn't your average girl. She's not so very feminine, an Aikido kickass, and a workaholic. She's a very cheesy character of the not-like-other-girls theme. But a character can only get so  clich\u00e9. Misaki exceeded the limit. The anime wanted to show how much of an oh so strong independent woman it got so annoying. She's the top in academics, the top in sports, the Class President who handles all kinds of responsibilities and organises events. And she also has a part-time job as a maid in cafe. She's hardworking, determined, selfless, accepting, thoughtful, hot-headed and a tomboy. On top of that, she does not have a single breakdown. She's completely one dimensional, annoying, and boring. I think it's the worst version of a tsundere I have ever seen. A very forgettable character. If anything, she came off as a sadist who likes to scare boys, and a masochist who likes to be in pain.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters: You shouldn't really expect any meaningful supporting characters when the main characters themselves are one dimensional, so here I am, repeating again, every single supporting character is a stupid, one dimensional airhead. \\n\r\nAnd seriously, what is WRONG with the whole stalker idea? Not only does Ayuzawa have a main stalker, she also has 3 other stalkers that go to her cafe every single day until they're penniless because Ayuzawa is 'kawaiiii', even though she was their enemy at the beginning and they hated her guts. It IS NOT OK to stare at a girl at your school every day at her part-time job.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters can be distributed into 3 groups:\\n\r\nA. The stalkers: mentioned above.\\n\\n\r\nB. The dumb airheads: all her coworkers at school and basically every other girl in the anime.\\n\\n\r\nC. The worshippers: Which are the rest of the school: We have\\n\r\n1. 5 boys who look exactly the same, who worship Ayuzawa because of how smart she is and how much they want to be like her. (They also follow her everywhere in the school)\\n\r\n2. The rest of the school: Usui worshippers. Every time he opens his mouth, they fangirl and drool (Not literally) at his words. Like he's a god.\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe story: 2/10\\n\r\nOne point for the idea. It's your typical tough girl with an oh-I'm-not-like-other-girls theme, and your average hot boi that everyone is head over heels for while the only person who grabs his attention is the one who does not give a damn about him -- the tough girl. It's a very famous clich\u00e9 especially in the Shoujo genre and if it can be done well, then it can be good. I think this version of it was the worst I have ever read/seen. The anime is mostly a very tedious Slice of Life about overused one dimensional characters. It's dragging, extremely boring, full of unnecessary details with a very shitty romance--if I dare call this creepy thing they had a romance. Nothing ever truly happens. Romance lovers should skip this anime as well, there's a very limited amount of 'romantic scenes', and a lot of awkward ones. (Though, to be fair, the final scene at the final episode was decent.)\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe Art: \\n\r\nIt was alright. The characters are well-drawn but would alternate between a decent drawing and a crappy 5-year-old scribbles a lot.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound: \\n\r\nIt was okay. The voices are kind of decent, but the music was a bit underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: below zero.\\n\r\nNothing about the anime was enjoyable, there is not a single thing you can find even slightly amusing and not a single character you can root for. It was torturous.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10 Appalling. A very terrible experience.",

This is a story of a girl who's clueless that the popular & perfect guy in school likes her. Just add a bit of twist that the girl has a headstrong personality and very stubborn to admit to love.\r\nI have to say that this anime is for the kiddies and who likes to waste time with very slow character relationship development. I felt that I should have skipped 3/4 of the series and just watched the last 3 episodes where there wassense. Lots of moments of boredom, dull, irrelevant scenes that made me want to fast forward. Not to mention, there were fillers. For me, it was in the last 3 episodes that finally got interesting and exciting. Despite that, there are funny scenes and cuteness appeal to it that encouraged me to finish until the end. \\n\\n\r\n20+ episodes of dragging story is just too much for me, so it's a 5. I don't recommend this anime for people who have limited time to watch and dislikes watching an episode with very small connection to the previous. Plus, the anime is incomplete and continues to the manga which leaves plenty of plot holes. Better watch Bokura ga Ita or Lovely Complex than this.",

            "content": "I've been searching for a romantic comedy anime to watch recently, and I was flooded with suggestions for Kaichou wa Maid-Sama. I've tried to watch this series before, but gave up after the first episode because it wasn't really an anime that titillated my brain. But yesterday I gave it a second go, and since I'm not in school until September, I finished it in a day. So, here's my review for the critically acclaimed Maid-sama!\r\nStory: 6.\r\nThere's really not much interesting about this story. It's enough to keep the viewer interested, but it's nothing spectacular. I didn't appreciate the filler episodes seeing as this isa measly 26 episode series. the story was definitely missing the umph factor, but as I said before, it's enough to keep the viewer interested. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is enjoyable and easy on the eyes. Chibi animation isn't usually my thing, but I didn't mind it whenever it popped up in this anime. The character design was nice as well. The thing that I didn't appreciate about the art was that sometimes it was just so damn cheesy. The 'embrace' scenes usually made me laugh and cringe with the amount of cheese. It could have done without the overly flowery backgrounds, wind ruffling the characters' hair when they were inside, and slow motion. Another thing that made my eyes roll was the slow pan on Usui every time he was introduced in the episode. Okay. We get it -- he's attractive. Stop reminding us. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nI think that this is one of the first anime where I haven't listened to more than 5 seconds of the ED. There was nothing there for me. And maybe it's because I watched the episodes on repeat, but the OP wasn't doing it for me either. It was annoying after the third time of hearing it, and since I couldn't fast forward it without my screen buffering I muted my computer until it was over. I usually like the OP and ED. As a matter of fact, there was no way that I -- even once -- got tired of the Lovely Complex and Death Note first OP & ED's. They had a good sound, and great corresponding images. But with Maid-Sama, it was pretty much Usui trying to look hot. AGAIN. *RAGEFACE FUUUUU*. I didn't mind the score in the anime, though. A lot of the time it went unnoticed, which I saw as a good thing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nI'm constantly confused with my feelings with these characters. One minute, I love them and the next minute they annoy me. I was definitely up and down with Misaki. I appreciated her dedication and her hard work, but sometimes she was just un-rightfully a bitch. On top of that, she acted clueless when it came to Usui a lot of the time, which annoyed me. I did like her relationships between her girlfriends, though. Because no matter what, she'd do anything for them, and I thought that was nice. Usui I spent most of the anime impartial about. I liked his witty sexual humour, but there was no character development with him. The writer tried way too hard to make him a mysterious character. It was plain annoying. A thing that truly annoyed me about Usui was that he was constantly at Misaki's beck and call. I'm sorry, I don't need realism in an anime, but his 'being there right in the nick of time' was wholly ridiculous. He was such a stalker, and he didn't let Misaki do anything without his guidance. I can't count the amount of times that he has been just waiting for her, saving her, or eavesdropping on her. For someone who was supposedly the most popular guy ever, he REALLY needed a life. Some arcs in the story would have been way more interesting if he wasn't there to stop the progression. The only thing that Usui's got going for him besides his looks, is that he's got a playful personality. I enjoyed a lot of the secondary characters in this anime because they were, a lot of the time, more interesting. My favorite secondary character was Hanata. He actually had a real personality and feelings. He was funny, but dedicated. Out of Usui and Hanata, Hanata is certainly the more desirable one in my opinion, but opinions differ.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nI think the fact that I finished this anime in a day says something. It's entertaining enough to watch from beginning to end. The humour is sometimes fresh, and the story was fun for the most part. There were a few episodes that I forced myself through, and a few episodes where I couldn't stop watching. I like these types of anime, so it was easy to get through, but it's certainly not anything spectacular. A lot of the arcs could have been better done, but they were enjoyable none the less. My biggest annoyance with this anime was certainly the amount of cheesiness in certain episodes. Certainly eye-rolling worthy.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nIf you want a nice rom/ com anime to watch, I recommend this anime. It's certainly not the best in the genre, but it's certainly not the worst either. I enjoyed it, it just wasn't my favorite. If you want a truly great rom/ com high school anime Lovely Complex is one that does it right, and Maid-sama is one that does it well. Pick your poison. Hope I helped!",

            "content": "Well, let me get started on this review. \r\nStory? There is no story. There is no objective in for the plot, and the same episode plan repeats itself until the very end. It's always Misaki having trouble with something, then Usui does something incredible or they have a romantic moment where she doesn't trust him or what he feels about her. She's always worrying if people will find out she works as a maid, but there isn't drama involving this fact. You would expect to see problems involving the main character being with the popular guy in school, but nothing happens. 4/10\r\nThe art is okay.Just okay. It doesn't have anything special about it, Usui could have been drawn better, but that's just my opinion. Not much details and there is a lot of chibis in the anime for comic relief. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nSound is okay too, even though easily forgettable. Nothing special. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters? Well, this I feel the need to write about. The characters have absolutely no character development. We see Hinata, that only appears in the last episodes, having more character development than the protagonist! It's just absurd. There is no depth in her character, and not even in Usui's character. All we actually know about Misaki is that she is poor, has a lot of work to do, and hates boys. She's a typical tsundere. We know very little about Usui, except the fact that he is some-like a God, being perfect on everything he does. There are a lot of characters I could name here that appear almost every episode, but don't have any importance. 2/10\\n\\n\r\nI'd put 4/10 on enjoyment by the fact that I had nothing else to watch.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, 4/10. Characters were bad, plot was pretty bad(since there was none), and the art and sound weren't enough to compensate those both, that together are just asking for disaster. You could have a bad plot(or none) and good characters, that would probably be a good rated anime. And the other way around too, it isn't that unusual, with great plot but bad characters. When you don't have either of them, it tends to be badly rated.",

I would also like to state i was not a previous fan, nor am i a girl.\r\n-The maid theme is not overused.\r\nThis is refreshing because when i first started watching i was afraid as to how important this detail would be. While it is a catalyst for many events it is refreshing to see other interesting situations occur totally independent of it; The arcs are not exactly unique or unpredictable, but are still rather enjoyable.\r\n-An okay comedy.\r\nItis hard to make me laugh. However, i was surprised at the number of times I enjoyed a joke. The assortment of side characters and their quirks were implemented rather well.\\n\\n\r\n-Good array of characters.\\n\r\nIt is nice to see lots of unique characters and still not overpopulate the cast. It is able to give most of them significance, and have them all interact in many ways. However, they still remain side characters.\\n\\n\r\n-Some development for each of those characters.\\n\r\nMany characters are given their own episode which allows us to see a small amount of growth in everyone one of them. Even without many getting their own dedication it still takes away from the main plot, and draws out the relationship much longer than need be.\\n\\n\r\n-Usui is given the wrong image.\\n\r\nHe could of been our perfect prince charming, but he is also portrayed as a giant tease. We get absolutely not development for Usui, and never learn why he is afraid of commitment and  keeps his distance. Personally, I accepted this since there was no real reason to think badly of him. Yet, in the end we are able to compare him to the more sincere rivals, and I slowly grew to hate him in the later episodes. This point depends on how you feel towards your clich\u00e9 cold, perfect bishounen when he is the one trying to win over Misaki's feelings.\\n\\n",

            "content": "After a series of pretty depressing animes (Hoshi no Koe, Byousoku 5 Centimetres), I decided to pick up something light and fun in a school setting and thought that this series looked promising. As a guy, my only other experience with Shoujo anime has been Ouran High School Host Club (OHSHC), which was really funny and enjoyable, so I thought to give it another go.\r\nThe plot of this anime is pretty straightforward as can be seen from the synopsis. Right from the get-go we already know who the 2 main characters are and how this is going to end, so the only interesting part isin HOW we get there, i.e. the characters and their romantic/comedic interactions have to be tight.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead, Ayuzawa Misaki, is refreshingly strong-willed, independent and decisive, totally unlike the simpering, useless female leads we get in the Shounen genre. Importantly, we see that although she has all these positive qualities, she's gotten to where she is through lots of hard work, study and training. This makes her easily likeable.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, this does not hold true for the male lead. Usui is (and this is what the anime tells us) the most handsome guy in school, the smartest, the best at every sport he tries his hand at (when he tries, because he doesn't actually belong in any clubs) and rich. Basically he doesn't put in any effort into anything but is still the best at everything. The character is poorly developed because there is no revelation of any flaws/weaknesses, his background, or his motivation (I still don't know why he decided to randomly chase Misaki!). He's just an enigmatic, perfect, rich kid. (I also found him to be an insufferably smug SOB who was borderline stalker-ish and overly possessive, but that might be personal bias). To me, this is unacceptable because the anime was 27 episodes long - more than sufficient to devote 1 or 2 episodes to develop him. In comparison, OHSHC with a harem of 6 guys managed to develop each one's personality, strengths and weaknesses in 26 episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the supporting cast was well fleshed out which made them interesting characters in their own right, from the cross dressing shota to the former delinquent boss to the childhood friend. Each of them got an episode to flesh out their personalities, which again makes me wonder why Usui didn't get any such development. This could be a flaw from the source manga and may not be the fault of the anime, but is a flaw nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nIn fact, from the mid-point of the series, I started dreading the moments when the main pairing would get together in a romantic sequence. I also ended up rooting for the 'love rival' who appeared towards the end of the series even though I knew it wouldn't work out. This was when I realised that the 'romance', the whole premise on which this series is founded, had fallen flat for me, mainly on the weakness of Usui's character.\\n\\n\r\nComedy wise, the tone was pretty light and pretty enjoyable throughout. I quite enjoyed Usui's teasing of Misaki and her flustered reactions. The art was also top notch, which made it that much easier to finish a series in which I was unable to make any personal investment. Although I have rated it a 6, I try and use the whole spectrum of grades, so it is still above average and watchable. Just don't have too high an expectation for a good romance, for the reasons I have stated above.",

            "content": "\"President of the Student Council at the almost-all-boys Seika High School, the hard-as-nails Misaki Ayuzawa works every day to make life easier on the small population of co-eds who have enrolled there. Though an unholy terror to all things male during school hours, in order to provide for her impoverished family, she secretly works after school at a maid cafe in Akihabara. However, when campus hottie Usui Takumi wanders into the restaurant during her shift, suddenly she finds her reputation in school at his mercy...\"\r\nStory: Even though I finished watching Kaichou wa Maid-sama long ago, I\u2019ve been caught up in some strange and unexpected businessthat made me postpone doing this review sooner, however better late than never. Kaichou wa Maid-sama from the moment it was announced people expected this one to be a big hit. The manga was popular way before the anime was announced, and the content that it has and the theme that it debats at the beginning surely managed to form a big fan-base in no time. What Kaichou presents is actually a simple romantic story but with a comedy aspect, sometimes well thought with very funny moments, with a tasteful humour but dragged way too long. The story centers on a high school girl named Misaki Ayuzawa. Even though she appears to be a normal high school girl, she has a big responsibility on her shoulders. Her father left her mother with a huge debt and to repay it she needed to get a job so that she can help her mother to pay the bills and to live a poor but normal life together with her younger sister Suzuna Ayuzawa. In order to cope with such a huge responsibility she had to strengthen up and become a reliable person and also an organized person. She became the student council president in a school where in the past it was an only all boys highschool but recently it got co-ed. By becoming a dictator she placed the welfare of the feminine side first so that the influence of boys may diminish. But this thing proved to be very difficult since all the time she had to do more than just her normal job. One boy in particular always proved to be very annoying since he did not do anything bad for the school nor for the teachers nor for other people but he attracts attention with his good looks and by the fact that he always rejects the proposals coming from other girls. Misaki stands firm and confronts the boy, his name is Usui Takumi. However this ends when Misaki\u2019s secret has been exposed to Usui, he sees her when she was working part-time at a maid caf\u00e9, which Misaki did her best to keep it as a secret so that her reputation won\u2019t fall. Thinking about it, since the school at that time was filled with delinquent boys, the fact that she was seen as a ruthless dictator might\u2019ve been a stimulant so that they should stop harassing the girls, however if the secret was known by the guys they would have used it to exploit her weakness and all the thing would\u2019ve went out of control. Nevertheless, Usui offered his help since Misaki is the kind that works too hard for other people\u2019s sake while ignoring her own welfare, in other words a workaholic, and from this point on a strange but an imminent love relationship begins. One thing makes this show so popular, and that is the comedy aspect that I mentioned at the beginning. While the beginning of this show seemed to be a bit more serious, what is about to come are some big waves of laughter and shocking scenes (shocking not in a negative way). The romantic plot moves in slow motion but it surely develops mainly because Usui always hanged around Misaki, when she needed or not. How will their relationship develop and will Misaki be able to accept Usui and his own feelings in the end? What about her own feelings, will she notice them and accept them? I guess we all know the answers since this show does not seem like a melodrama to end in a dramatic way but the one thing that I was kinda disappointed in, was that they needed over 26 episodes so that they can reach a damn conclusion, when this could\u2019ve been ended much earlier with room for more development. Nevertheless, Kaichou wa Maid-sama is not a show to be overlooked that easily, since it provides what fans look for mostly.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound: When we speak about a studio like J.C. Staff (Ai Yori Aoshi, Azumanga Daioh, Hatsukoi Limited, Kimikiss Pure Rouge, Tsukihime, Nodame Cantabile, Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Toradora, etc) we speak about good animation quality, design and directing. Even though this studio has a long history with both good shows, average and bad shows I have to admit that they did their best when it comes to animation issues and Kaichou is yet another example. Somehow this studio has a tendency to adapt romantic shows (with the romance aspect being in the center or as a side aspect is really not important) rather than mindless shounen shows which is another reason why they managed to impress. As for the sound, pretty much forgettable, the soundtracks are so shoujo~ish that it makes you sometimes burst into flames and quickly overlook them, however the only good point about this show regarding sound issues are the background sound where we can see several improvements. As for voice acting, it was pretty good even though there aren\u2019t so many popular names among the cast, Misaki being voiced by Ayumi Fujimura (Kara no Kyoukai, Hatsukoi Limited, Kaze no Stigma, Letter Bee, Shinrei Tantei Yakumo, etc) and Usui being voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto best known for his role Asu no Yoichi and To Aru Majutsu no Index.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Character wise I was once again impressed. Misaki surely has a very interesting personality, a ruthless dictator at school, a kind person around the other female students, a hardworking one when it comes to both school and family issues, she places the welfare of others in front of her own. However the only person which she can\u2019t handle very well and her true self is revealed is of course Usui. He does not have a bad influence around her but somehow he is always around whenever she needs help. By pulling several pranks he managed to see more moods and reactions from Misaki and without knowing a true and strong relationship develops, which Usui does not try to deny while Misaki strongly tries to keep her feelings locked inside, catalogating Usui as a perverted alien whenever he pulls a prank against her and makes her feel embarrassed. As for the other characters, even though they have a less important role to play in this show they help in building the relationship between Misaki and Usui while they are also developed and not left behind.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Kaichou wa Maid-sama has everything a good show should have. Though sometimes drama is the aspect that makes a romantic show more spicy, for this one it did not need it since the comedy aspect of it did a great job. I admit that I prefer romantic dramas over romantic comedies but this was up until I encountered this show. I hope for a second season of this show.",

            "content": "Kaichou Wa Maid Sama - I picked up this series because I heard a lot of compliments about it being one of the best romance anime ever.\r\nWell, to be honest, I disagree. It's not one of the best romance anime I have ever watched and to call it the best is an overstatement. \r\nStory: 6/10\r\nBasically, it's about a man-hating high school president who works part time in a maid cafe and tries her best to not let her secret leak out as it will ruin her reputation as a high school president. However, one fateful day, her secret is found out by Usui Takumi, thehottest guy in school.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot seems pretty interesting although cliche. But as the series progress, the whole maid thing seemed like it was all just a \"line\" to attract viewers - like me.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki as a maid didn't even seem important in the series - the series was quite jumbled up and I don't even know if there's a story behind it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat bugged me the most was Shintani - Misaki's childhood friend who appeared out of a sudden in the last 4 episodes - I mean why on earth does it has to be in the last 4 episodes?\\n\\n\r\nBasically, the story has lots of unsolved parts like Usui's mysterious background - why is he living alone huh with a cat? What happened to Shintani? :O So how does the maid thing goes? Did the school find out about it?\\n\\n\r\nIf they weren't planning on doing another season of Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, then they should have omit all these \"missing\" parts. But IF there is a second season, I rest my case.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nBefore I watched Kaichou Wa Maid Sama, I was watching Sugar Sugar Rune and I know it's pretty biased to do this but I just had to compare Sugar Sugar Rune's art with Kaichou wa Maid Sama although they are two completely different series.\\n\\n\r\nThe background art in Kaichou wa Maid Sama was......decent. I thought it wasn't very detailed and to put it simply, it's unattractive. The characters are alright- lots of chibi art and that makes it really cute :D \\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nOP song is catchy although I'm not a big fan of the ending songs D: They were a bit too rock-ish for me..\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI think the main reason why so many people loved Kaichou Wa Maid Sama and regard it as one of the best romance anime is because they either\\n\\n\r\nA) Find Usui cute \\n\\n\r\nTrust me, if you fell in love with an anime character, you would love that anime to death - I've been there.\\n\\n\r\nB) Wishes there was someone like Usui\\n\\n\r\nI'm put off by Usui's personality. Damn! Is he perfect or is he PERFECT? There are absolutely no flaws in him. He can fight, he's handsome, hot, smart, sporty and everything you want in a perfect guy. But that's why I dislike him.\\n\\n\r\nIn reality, there is no guy like that and I do wish Usui had some kind of flaws...(Wearing glasses is not a flaw) HAHAHAHA I did see Usui wearing glasses in some episodes - is he really short sighted or what? Was he wearing contact lenses all these while?\\n\\n\r\nOkay, bear with me, I'm just curious :P\\n\\n\r\nHowever, I do like Misaki. She's hardworking, stubborn and strong and let's not forget, she does has some flaws which is why I rated the character part a 7 out of 10.\\n\\n\r\nThe supporting characters made the series more lively and interesting but to be honest, they were quite useless in all 26 episodes. There weren't much character development till the end of the series and I thought that the ending was really, really awful.\\n\\n\r\nIt was rushed and it's a mix of all 25 episodes crumbled up into 1 last episode - episode 26. That's what I have to say about episode 26.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki's feelings for Usui was so CONFUSING! I don't even know if she likes him or what...she may like him all of a sudden in this episode and then hate him all of a sudden in another episode - it's just so messy. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was funny and enjoyable if it's in a \"Slice of life\" category but as one of the best romance anime? NEVER.\\n\\n\r\nTo put in in \"One of the best romance anime\" is simply an offence to all romance anime lovers. \\n\\n\r\nRomance series should leave you happy, warm and fluffy inside - and make you go \"Awwwwwwwwwwwwww\" \\n\\n\r\nKaichou wa Maid Sama didn't really leave me warm and happy inside...it just made me go....\"WTFFFFFF\" cause the series are quite unexpected.\\n\\n\r\nIt was alright overall.\\n\\n\r\nSo I shall rate it a 6/10.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading ^_^",

            "content": "I got this anime recommended as a romance. Given the focus of the anime, it is obvious its most heavy side is romance. But to be honest, thats one of the worst romances i have ever watched. Here is why:\r\nStory - 3: Where should I behin with? When I started watching it, it was all fine and interesting, I would say even fun. That was till episode 6. After that the story became repetetive, one tease after another, useless scenes as those with the 3 guys, which didnt even have the slithest mean of comedy. Just useless at all. The story is not connected atall, just some random events happening. \\n\r\nYou would think that the main thing would be the relationship between the two main characters? Wrong. All its happening in the whole anime could be seen trough 1-6 episodes. The whole story is about how Misaki realises she loves Usui. \\n\\n\r\nArt - 6: The art is somewhat decent, I really like how Misaki is drawn, but I guess this style of characters is not mine. I could say this is the best part of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 2: Most of the time I didnt even realise there was sound, the Opening is annoying as fuck and i try to skip it ASAP.  The best song would be the one they play at 'happy' moments, but after a while it gets annoying. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 2: Basically no depth at the characters. Tho thats the good sides. All the relationships between the characters are bullshit,  there is no progress, no depth at all. The characters that we had in the begining are the same as in the end. The only stuff that caught my eyes were the student's oppinion of the president. But I though i watched a romance? Where is the focus going? The romance side starts to get annoying at some point, given the progress stops at episode 6, only annoying teases occur, with both weakly said tsundere characters. Or 'endure' as they call themselfs. Thats not even funny. Is this teaser or romance anime?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 4: After the first culmination in episode 6 I though: Yes! They will become couple, have sweet moments, then marry or smth, with ofcourse the respectful problems and plot twists, ending in the second, bigger culmination in the end (with marriage or smth). But since the characters dont become couple (?) the anime gets back in the state of episode 1. There is no surprise or interest factors, since you have seen all. Oddly enough, there is second culmination at the end, being what the first one should have been. This anime could be describen with a diagram going up, then sharply down, and after 20 episodes it goes up again. With every single episode i my wish to continue the anime dropped. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - 3: As I said in the previous paragraph, i am greatly disappointed in the anime. Just a dry, streightforward ploth with nothing happening, supposed to be relationship advance, but insread shit stick filled with unfunny moments. We dont even see a couple in such anime. To be honest, such a plot would have been great with other story on top, maybe being some kind of action-fantasy plot, which would take the focus off the romance. And the romance would occur every now and then, gradually advancing the relationship. Such animes which manage to do so are real masterworks, since you are happy to see the characters together, but thats not the only thing happening and you dont get bored. Such anime is Bakuman. Imagine it with only romance, and the manga drawing side be just as a secondary plot which is shown every now and then as a progress with just any regular hobby? That would just be total newbiework. Just as this anime. Dont waste your time - thats 10 hours.",

The worst thing that it showed was that misa was so strong that broke handcuffs and defeated the guys that tried to molest her. Seriously? We girls must be careful! There are so many dangerous people out there and no matter how strong and trained you are you may not be able to take the gun or knife from someone? Seriously? Instead of teaching girls to be strong but careful it shows them that! Do you know how many girls are raped because they pretended to be strong and didn't try to avoid2 or 3 people that attacked them? And it shows all boys being stupid (except usui) and having no personality at all but on the other hand all girls have different personalities and characters!!! And last but not least the protagonist is being racist against all the guys.. Really it is not worth watching. There are plenty of romance anime..",

I don't know about the anime ver. (last episode). But if I comparing those two, they seems changed it a little bit but the story still have the same aim.\r\nTought this anime looks interesting to watch, so I've tried to search it on YouTube but sadly all of'em seems do not have the next episode of this anime (still stuck on episode 7). I'm really curious about it so I keep tried looking for thenext episode, but uh... Now I realized that this anime is really new on Animax (perhaps on my country), since its new.. I can only find the next episode on Animax, every Sunday. It's really sad, that Animax only display 1 new episode per week (it kills me to wait the next episode per week!!!).",

            "content": "I just have to make a review about this one. It's my all-time favourite Comedy/Romance and never laughed so hard. Several times. I have lost count how many times I've seen this Anime...\r\nStory: 6\r\nThe story may lack, but it is the Comedy that lift this series to the top.\r\nWe have Misaki Ayuzawa and Usui Takumi, and it mostly revolves around them.\r\nThe supporting characters does play parts with the 2 main char, but this is a rom/com where you can clearly already see the ending. But It's not the ending that's the best, it's the way there to the ending.\r\nThe story itself, I think is good.It's funny, it has good variations, I never got bored. What people could think the series lack is something bigger, something even more dramatic and more conflicts involving the supporting characters.\\n\r\nThis is nothing you will see from the Main Guy perspective, since the story right from the beginning, you can see that Usui has no interest in any other girl. But you will see some other guys being interested in Misaki. And Misaki responds. This is for you to see ;)\\n\r\nManga is continuing, and I am hoping for a Second Season. This Anime does not end at episode 26. Story actually is as greatest at the last 4-6 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nThis is all about your own taste and what you like. This is Com/Rom on it's very best. If you don't like seeing romantic conflicts, teasing girls, cool guys, perverted guys, struggling girls (girl), funny jokes and display of love. Then you wont like this. Simple as that.\\n\\n\r\nI give it a 6 on Story. The story could have huge improvements. But series like this are good for it's comedy and drama, not particular it's story develop.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe art is fantastic. It's a good standard Anime Look were the Age the character are, does actually match how they look.\\n\r\nThe art displays good use of Chibi in it's comedy, which is super funny. I think this is the best display of Chibi comedy ever.\\n\r\nBackgrounds are good detailed, supporting characters have not been wasted and do look good.\\n\r\nWhat could have been better is ofc more shading and details. But a well worth 9.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\r\nKaichou wa Maid-sama only have 1 opening theme, tho the Ending Theme changes.\\n\r\nThe opening is very good. The lyrics is all about the series and is very good. The song itself has a unique and sweet sound to it, making it very easily to remember. I promise you that. My brain switches on like when a Dog is shown Candy when I hear the Opening.\\n\r\nThe Endings are good as-well, but you never watch them really.\\n\r\nThe background music to fit the specific moment are great. Usui Takumi also performs with music in this series, and it is Beautiful. It's reaches the heart, and is so sweet music to my ears. \\n\r\nSound is given a 9. I have not found anything anyone or bad with the sound parts at all.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nUsui Takumi is a pervert who likes Maids, Maids Cosplay, different kind of dresses on Maids and so on.\\n\r\nIt is not known if he liked Maids before he saw that Misaki was a part-time working maid. I believe no, he did not. ;P\\n\r\nHe is on my favourite list for a number of specific reasons.\\n\r\nI love his attitude, his humor, his /careface are just hilarious. At the same time he displays careface, he is very carefree. He likes to just chill out and focus doing the thing he likes most. Which you haft to see for yourself ;)\\n\r\nHe is the best (in sports) and most attractive guy in the school with top grades. Which is funny cuz you always see him slacking. What makes this character so epic, is that he only has 1 interest.\\n\\n\r\nMisaki Ayuzawa is a hard working, plain looking, VERY hard working girl. She is forced to work hard for her family, and she want to do her best and display her best. She cares for all, but it's hard to care for bunch of perverts in your school when you are the Student Council President. And the school is about 80-90% male.\\n\r\nIt is a well created character and different from what I've ever seen. Usually it' sweet looking, pure hearted, innocent girls. Not here mate. Here we got a real women who works hard.\\n\\n\r\nThe supportive characters do have their traits, but this is what the series lacks in Character which effects the story. The supportive characters are actually very often involved, but not much in a deep matter. That comes more in the few last episodes. It's at least the same amount of time with supportive char, as with the 2 mains alone.\\n\r\nBut I would give it a 10 for this. But for a more general opinion analysing the series. It's an 8 even tho supportive char could have been improved for it's 8. Mains are so good it deserves 8, and the supportive are included a lot.\\n\r\nThis is rom/com, so its supposed to be focused on mains!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nAs said, this is my favourite!\\n\r\nMy personal opinions why I think this series is freaking wicked epic.\\n\r\nThe comedy matches my humour so well. I love teasing girls, show off a more \"cool\" side and this series displays it.\\n\r\nThe series develops in the relationship all the time which a Romance should do, and that is practically the story. So technically the story deserved better rating because the relationship development between the 2 main is all but boring, tedious, hideous and lame. It's wonderful, it's Originality at is best and so unique Romance Story.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI give it a 9 in overall. Sure the story in general (Compared to other animes in all genres) it's not the expected Story development you would see. But it's all about taste, and as said before. This is ROMANCE, the story should be rated accordingly to how the supportive char are involved and the relationships development. Which is great here. But story is 6, because you could amp it up with a lot. But then it would prob have added genre to it.\\n\r\nCharacters, Sound, Art is all superb. I enjoyed it full 10, and it's my all-time favourite.\\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who likes Romance or Comedy. If you don't like Romance, then you would not like this. If you don't like this specific humour in the comedy, then you wont like it as well. \\n\r\nIt's just how it is. We all have our tastes. The kind of humour is explained in the story section.\\n\\n\r\nI would love to receive feedback to make my reviews better and more helpful to everyone!\\n\r\nCheers folks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

(No offense to anyone and if you are a guy and you like it, kudos to you man! You rock; let's be friends :D)\r\nStory 9/10\r\nMaid-Sama is a VERY entertaining romantic comedy that is enjoyable throughout consistently. The only thing I wish that it had was a little more fluidity regarding plot. The storyline just follows the life of Ayuzawa Misaki, a headstrong and sometimes devilish-looking girl, who absolutely hates men with a passion and becamethe first female student council president in her once all-boys high school. Hence, the title of this anime Kaichou wa Maid-Sama (The President is a Maid) Her hatred of men originates from her supposed abandonment by her father towards her, her sister Setsuna, and her mother, who struggle with poverty often, leading our heroine to work at a maid caf\u00e9 doing easy labor for a more generous payroll. One day, Usui Takumi discovers her secret and the plot continues on from there following the development of her romance with Usui and her daily trials as the President and a maid.\\n\\n\r\nOverall a nice story that I thoroughly enjoyed as a hopeless romantic.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9.5/10\\n\\n\r\nVery comfortable to look at overall, with a blemishes here and there.\\n\\n\r\nSound 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing to complain about, so a 10 it is!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10\\n\\n\r\nI loved the individuality of each character and how their personality traits were easily expressed by physical features (ex. Sakura, curly hair= very bubbly and happy personality)\\n\\n\r\nThe strength and hardworking personality of Misaki is amazing and very admirable and it is entertaining to see how she handles her roles as both Maid and President. \\n\\n\r\nUsui. Oh Usui, how can you NOT love him? Good at everything he does, Misaki's competitor/future lover, good-looking (even in glasses!) Cat lover, weird, and as described by Misa: \"a perverted alien from the planet Phermos.\" (XD)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 10/10\\n\\n\r\nLOVED IT. SO HILARIOUS.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 10/10 \\n\\n\r\nNo need to say anything more.",

Of course it won\u2019t be like that for every one, so don\u2019t start watching it already expecting original never before seen stuff, it\u2019s not that type of anime, but it can still be great and light hearted.",

            "content": "[STORY]\r\n-----------\r\nI personally love watching romantic, cute, and shoujo scenes in anime, so I don't really have much to say about the story. The plot was very well written and scripted. The characters went through many adventurous scenes and also had many twists and turns as well.\r\n[ART]\r\n-----------\r\nThe graphics were semi decent, although it was blurry in some episodes. It could've been the case where I was using an average site to watch anime, but I found the episodes a little blurry, but it was still fantastic!\r\n[SOUND]\r\n-----------\r\nThe voice actors, actresses, music, and background noise was very well suited with the scenes and scenery. I have watched bothsubbed and dubbed of this anime, and both were very lovely. I personally am not a big fan of dubbed, but this version was not as bad as the other dubbed I have seen in my life.\\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTER]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThe characters were also very well drawn and animated, especially Usui and Ayuzawa. They both had very cute, serious, and chibi looks at times, and have really made this anime very comedic and romantic. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nBecause of the twists and turns and the mysterious romantic vibe between Usui and Ayuzawa really made me want to keep watching it more until the end. Although, the beginning was a lot more interesting than the end, because you were just starting to get to know the characters, and brought a lot of curiosity among the audience, but the ending was also very romantic as well, especially the last episode.\\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL]\\n\r\n-----------\\n\r\nThis anime is definitely my favorite one, which might sound cliche, but I really enjoyed the romantic, comedic, and shoujo scenes. I'm actually one of the people who don't like comedy at all but this anime had very good comedic scenes and did a very good job of making the audience laugh.\\n\\n\r\nFINAL SCORE:\\n\r\n11/10",

            "content": "This is a review that contains no spoilers, because that is the purpose of every review because reviews are meant for people who haven't watched or read something. You may wonder why have I wrote a review when I have only watched 6 episodes and the answer is simple, it didn't try to do anything new or follow a deep story with deep characters and every episode seemed like a waste of time  because it didn't lead up to anywhere and this show, objectively speaking isn't worth an 8,5/10 that it has and is overhyped by girls fangirling about the main couple who willfinally be together moments before the series ends after a really long pointless journey.\\n\\n\r\nStory: Romance is a category that suffers a lot from cliches like every other category in anime and so does this anime. I had high expectations for this anime because I saw in it in a lot of ''best romance articles'' getting high places top 3 mostly. But when I got in to it was so boring that I couldn't stand it. Although it had a unique setting the maid cafe it didn't use that to it's advantage and just got nowhere, and the pacing was just extremely slow with forced romance by the mc (like every other stereotypical romance anime) and he is more mysterious than the 7 wonders of the world (although not so much in this case but still we get no information about him, his story, or his belief's). The story as I said previously it got nowhere or at least for most of the time with no depth at all although it had some things that it could focus on like how her family struggles because they have no money and that could lead to having some psychological effect on her like her behaviour. But nonetheless nothing new as the story goes. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: The side characters are bland and useless (even more than Sakura) that are there just to be there with no purpose or meaning  with no character development. The guy mc is the classic model of Victoria secret, being perfect in everything and having almost no bad things on him which draws all the fan girls making the show popular and giving it's much needed attention. The girl mc is the classic high tempered shoujo mc that has the mc throwing himself at her, saying clearly that he loves her but she still keeps rejecting him.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I found this show really hard to enjoy as this review shows, because except from all these aspects like story and characters that were boring and with no interest at all, the only part of the show that could have won me, the comedy was just repetitive and and one-dimentional. \\n\\n\r\nAll in all if you wanted to watch a fresh romance anime with a good story and characters I am afraid this is not for you. Also this is the first time for me writing a review so please be gentle :P.\\n\\n",

You will expect a lot of hilarious moments and romantic moments.\r\nThe art is pretty good, but that's probably because I love the constant incorporation of chibi drawings. You will find so many chibi moments in this anime I guarantee.\r\nIntro and Ending music is very good, and the cinematic music is very appropriate for the different scenes. \r\nMain Characters are absolutely to-die-for funny even though they are a little typical. THere are little aspects of them that are very unique and hilarious though, which makes them extremely lovable. If youlove cosplay, this is the anime for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it keeps me in stitches throughout. Please give it a go if you love shoujo, comedy,romance animes, you will definitely not be disappointed! :D",

            "content": "\"I\u2019ll come to save you as much as you want. I\u2019ll make you fall for me as much as you wish.\" Usui Takumi.\r\nKaichou wa Maid-sama is certainly one of the best Shojo ever made. The plotline may look classic at the first glance, but the story captivates your attention without delay, and soon enough, you will realize the uniqueness of the story. Misaki is the president of her high school's council, and works in a maid cafe because of her family debts. She is a strong, capable and caring protagonist, but also a feminist that looks down on men. She has to meet Usui Takumi,the handsome, popular and genius guy who looks utterly annoyed all the time, but who will take a special interest in her after finding out she works as a maid. Takumi is not your classic bishounen, he speaks his mind all the time, can say/do very weird things, but still looks adorable, and his chibi version is way too endearing. His nickname is the perverted alien, which is quite fitting. The tension between Misaki and Takumi keeps building with every passing day which makes the anime thrilling and heartwarming. The humour in Kaichou wa Maid-sama is terribly effective, the supporting characters are well portrayed, and the whole atmosphere of this masterpiece will make you smile often. The animation is beautiful, the voice actors are brilliant, especially Okamoto Nobuhiko, the soundtrack is sweet, and the second ending song absolutely addictive. A must see for every fan of Shojo animes. \\n\\n\r\nA 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "This is my first review so bear with me ^^\"\r\nStory(4 decent) Well for starter where is the story, where is the actual plot of thing? The the point of the anime is the PLOT! But sadly I can't seem to find it. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because this anime is excusable as it is suppose to be a slice of life/ romance and most romance animes don't have a plot. But this one seemed like the mangaka only wanted to draw a couple of fluffy sences revolving around two people and accidently forgot to add a plot. Oops. For meanime needs to me up hook to it and actually have SOME surprises even if its the teeny tiniest portion. But I never even have to guess cause I already saw through the entire season in ep 1. Well other than that I would liek to ask a queston, does misaki being a maid have anything to do with anything whatsoever? The only part it did play is people not finding out about it, and let me tell you it is a minor part. The only other reason is that the plot needed fillers. Loads of it. But in conclusion the anime could have ened in 3 or  less eps. Also this anime is suppose to be relaxing but I can give a similie more sutiable: boring. Yea exactly.\\n\\n\r\nArt(3 poor) The only character desing style I liked was aoi's boy form. The rest it just ....weird. Misaki's maid outfit is blah, her hair is blah, her eyes are too big, the sparkly and shiny background around make my eyes water(srsly tho), oh yea and all those people who saw usui has no flaw, I beg to differ, he has one flaw. He is not good-looking. Well at least not in my taste. I don't like bishonens like him. Well I do like some but usui is not someone I would date if I was in anime land. But my main problem with the art is that its too shiny I prefre classic ones (e.g. Pandora Hearts, Gosick).\\n\\n\r\nSound(5 Mdicore) Squeaky voices. Nuff said. Annoying ops and eds.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters(2 Dreadful) I didn't like one chracter not one. Misaki is the most annoying person I have everrrrrrrrrrrr seen. Ugh annoying annoying annoying. Tsundere? I don't think so, she is just like I said before- annoying. Everytime she speaks it gets on my nerves. She just has two facial expressions : trying to be cool, and being embarresed.Strong female lead? Go watch higurashi no koro naku ni, and you'll see how scary girls can get.Next usui. I don't have any opinion of him. To me he is just a character that is as good as not existing at all. Every other character has no point in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(5 Mdicore) I gave it a five because I have seen way worse animes, way worse so I thought it was fair to give it an average, cause thats what this anime was, average.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5, I am not saying this anime is horrible, just boring, I didn't find it interesting, but then again I watched it right after Pandora Hearts so it should be a surprise. My advice, watch it if you want to, don't watch it if you don't want to.",

            "content": "While the ending was rather abrupt, I thoroughly enjoyed this series. \r\nThe premise of this anime is simple: the main female protagonist, whom is the president of the student council, has a secret that she doesn't want anyone at her formerly all-boys high school to find out about. And of course the main male protagonist discovers her secret in due course. Shenanigans then ensue. The plot isn't unique but it does offer a lot of amusing moments and natural chemistry between the two main character. The ending was disappointing but that was one of the few problems I had with this series. It captured myattention from the start and my mind didn't wander from the events taking place before my very eyes. \\n\r\nIt is for this reason that I give the story a nine out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the art for this series. Takumi Usui appears on many lists for sexiest guys in anime and for good reason. The character designs for the most part are realistic and I felt that they matched the characters personalities well. The characters each had their own unique appearance and for that reason they were easy to distinguish. \\n\r\nI give the art an eight out of ten. \\n\\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed Usui's seiyuu (Nobuhiko Okamoto) for the simple reason that the voice matched the person so well. The opening theme is a guilty pleasure of mine because of its light hearted nature. \\n\r\nI give the sound an eight out of ten.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime focuses primarily on the development of the two main characters Misaki and Usui and how they grow closer together. At the start, they are depicted as practically flawless but they have their own problems which I feel was addressed well. Misaki's reactions were very amusing! And Usui's facial expressions cracked me up every time. The Baka trio while amusing at times could often be annoying. Other characters in the series don't develop to the extent of Misaki and Usui unfortunately (or so I felt anyway). \\n\r\nFor this reason I give the characters aspect of the show a seven out of ten.\\n\\n\r\n I recommend this series if you want to watch something that is light hearted and entertaining. 10/10\\n\\n",

Let's begin,\r\n The story didn't catch me at the beginning. I had heard about the show but moved it aside. My girlfriend kind a force me to watch it of which i love her o much more now. It is a simple story a guy finds about a girl secret and tries to joke around with her but the progress it makes in the guy's life and almost all guys hating girl is quite amazing. The comediesis the best part of all , trust on this your boring weekend will have a blast no doubt. \\n\r\n  The art is just like any other except you'll love the comedy faces in character, it's kind of childish but is lovable.\\n\r\n I kind a like the theme song except japnesgrish like of tone .. the music refreshes  everytime .\\n\r\n The character development is quite focused on main characters mostly but i didn't mind that at all.\\n\r\n  Absolutely enjoyable no doubt about it. \\n\r\nI prefer rewatching it sometime in near future again.\\n\r\n Enjoy you guys.. cheers",

Not sure what it literally means to be MOE!!! but anyway...\r\nLet me begin by saying that Romance was never my favorite genre or at least it never occurred to me that the genre would become my favorite. And as I was searching for more anime that would be related to Romance, I happened to come across this gem of an anime. \r\nKaichou Wa Maid Sama...An anime about school and maids? Sure it sounds pretty dumb at first and you'd think it's like every other anime with butlers and maids but it's NOT! KWMS is actually a heartwarming anime aboutlove and of the walls people need to overcome to reach what we call love. \\n\\n\r\nFrom the story to the characters, you'll fall in love with the anime...however you'll feel disheartened by the end knowing that you've gone through all the episodes and you want more! The story is basically about a female character who falls in love with a guy who has a mysterious background that you won't find out about unless you read the manga beyond the anime...which you should do anyway, because it's a beautiful story really. Along the way, our heroine and hero expresses each others love in different ways...but pride gets in the way and walls begin to arise which complicates the already complex relationship. \\n\\n\r\nIt's a love story, and it's worth your time if you're in to romance or even if you're not - just try it. You might end up loving it as much as I have, which i'd never thought would be possible. It will make you laugh, give you the warm fuzzy feeling in your heart, and eventually will make you fall in love with it. \\n\\n",

            "content": "*My first review ever!!*\r\nHere we have another romantic anime... The best looking, hardest working girl in the school coupled with the most handsome guy in the school. Pretty generic story line but what made this anime stand out was its delivery.\r\nThe story line is nothing special. In fact, it is very predictable. We have our two main protagonists attracted to each other (but Usui finds the attraction first) and they go through many adventures to realize their feelings for one another. There are not many moments where you feel that a story arc is a filler; each story builds upon the relationship between Usui andMasaki. There are some ridiculous moments where Usui saves Masaki that is absolutely impossible in real life but I would give the anime some slack. These impossible moments, in a way, makes you feel closer to their relationship and even root for them to be together.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is solid. When I saw the poster, I was hesitant in watching it because it had Misaki sport a Luffy look and I don't like that style of artwork. But in the anime, Misaki is drawn in a totally different style and it's the kind of artwork that I like. The \"dreamy\" scenes are captured in slow-mo and are absolutely hilarious to watch. Sometimes, the art work for Usui changes to have him look very small and cute (I'm kinda new to shoujo anime so I'm not sure if this is a characteristic of this genre) and it really reflects the light-hearted atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound is where Maid-Sama falls a bit short. It's not terrible but it's not incredible. There is this one upbeat theme that repeats over and over again whenever Misaki gets some determination. When the first time you hear it, it's pretty exciting but after 30 or so times, your ears will tire out. But the opening and ending songs are fantastic and for me, that's what redeems the sound in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe entire cast is absolutely charming. We have Usui, the cool, protective, stalkerish boyfriend, and Misaki, the girl who is strong-willed and refuses to recognize her feelings. These two make a really great duo and you really want them to be together at the end. My favourite secondary characters were Minako, Misaki's sister, and the fanboy trio who follows Misaki everywhere. Misaki's sister doesn't say anything funny but her quirkiness is one component of the comic relief. The fanboy trio is a really cute bunch and are also part of the comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nI absolutely enjoyed this anime and it is no surprise that it is on the top of many YouTube best romance anime videos. Definitely do give this anime a look!",

            "content": "So let's get this straight. As a guy, the main character Misaki is cute as hell. Especially when she blushes, and is wearing a maid-fuku! As far as it goes for moe-characters, she is a 24 carat diamond. However, i must admit that it's not competitive enough to break out of the shoujo fanbase.\r\nStory: 7\r\nIt's innovative enough, but not exactly anything new. The story is also full of loopholes probably designed to appeal to female fans. It is also very shallow and focuses on nothing but gags and blushes. It never gives you room to seriously think about the main character's problems and about relationships,an absolute opposite of many shoujo animes.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6\\n\r\nIt's not that terrible that it's intolerable, but it really makes you wonder if they're really that short on money. Well, at least the maid-fukus are cute enough.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 6\\n\r\nNothing really stands out, but not terrible either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7 \\n\r\nThere's a lot of character in this anime. Most of the mains are unique enough, but don't have enough depth and background to justify their un-human incredibility.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8\\n\r\nIf it needs to be said, this anime is very much made just for the fun of it. It's just great to watch a cute tsundere in a maid-fuku blushing at the molestations of a bishounen, and that's very much all that counts.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nNot exactly good enough to be a gem in the rotting industry, but it's moe enough to keep me watching.",

            "content": "Truly one of the most abhorrent things related to romance I've ever seen, this poor excuse of a TV show is truly why we can't have nice things here in the weeb world. \r\nA prime example of absolutely everything any normal anime or ANY piece of media of romantic nature shouldn't do, it starts on an \"amusing\" ( at best ) concept worth three minutes of comical screen time, only to turn out to be literally nothing more than that, with the rest of the 25 episodes rehashing basically the same plot of other any other cliche-filled anime there is, and kind of applying itsterrible premise at it. It's not really taking any time to justify or explain the utterly dumb progress it thinks it has - the basic plot is all there is, and then the oh-so-funny shenanigans ensue. Furthermore, rather than like a comedy or a romance, it feels like a simply bad experience for its own characters and viewers all the same. The only person aside from the actual audience who seemingly enjoyed the plot going on is the the male love interest, and his character is about as flat as a loli.\\n\\n\r\nAnd what better combo than cardboard characters featuring in a classic story of a harassing romance! You know it can't be true love if it ain't forced here among weebs, and such is the case here too - far too many questionable actions and words, far too much cringe, if I really have to use that word. Additionally, with the main girl's position as a \"maid waifu\", she is truly nothing more than yet another romantic pursuit to be \"owned\", as is the tradition with these things - the male MC really isn't trying to hide this, clearly enjoying the fact he can use the girl MC's secret to his own sick advantage, even if it's just to tease her.\\n\\n\r\nIn a long run, there is really no actual development outside of new, equally as cardboard-ish characters coming into the, khm, \"plot\".\\n\\n\r\nYou might be thinking \"but Reviewer! There are thing happening in this anime, don't you remember the this and the that? The festival and the trip?\" but truly, any sort of \"arcs\" or \"plots\" this anime thinks is working on are ultimately so irrelevant and forgettable in the face of the main two character being pretty and cool and in love, which seems to be a selling point for most of equally empty romance titles. \\n\\n\r\nThis one is no exception.\\n",

            "content": "I picked up this show because I was in the mood for a romance anime and it had a good rating. Unfortunately, this anime was pretty disappointing and it really doesn\u2019t live up to its rating. I would suggest you go elsewhere for your fix of romance if that's what you're looking for, because what exists of a payoff just isn't worth the painfully boring and contrived story, plus every other problem with the series. \r\nThe beginning was promising and exciting. Here we had this atypical female protagonist who subverted tropes and was confident, headstrong, and borderline tyrannical in her student council president role. AlthoughAyuzawa is perfect to the point of being a Mary Sue (amazing at academics, sports, beauty, is the student council prez, etc.), it was excusable because the exaggeratedness of her character was comical but also because her interesting secret identity added something unique to her character in that she had something to hide. The duality in her character was a gap moe in itself, which was charming. Then we had the aloof Usui, the Gary Stu to her Mary Sue (equally amazing at academics, sports, beauty, etc.), but what made him subversive and interesting to watch was that he wore his heart on his sleeve, making it instantly clear that he was romantically interested in Ayuzawa from the get-go. So the first few episodes were really great-- exactly what I was looking for, and I watched on happily for a while, satisfied with the two cute main characters and their dynamic. But from about the middle of the anime and onwards, it went downhill at an increasingly rapid speed. \\n\\n\r\nThe main problems were the characters and the story. I won\u2019t go into too much detail regarding the story, but I will say that there basically isn\u2019t one\u2026 which isn\u2019t a good look. The absence of plot becomes an increasingly painful flaw as the series goes on. However, what exists of a story is essentially a series of contrived scenarios where suspension of disbelief progressively becomes impossible and the people act in more and more aggravatingly stupid ways.\\n\\n\r\nI will go into depth regarding the characters though. First- the supporting cast. The side characters were non-descript and one-dimensional from the beginning, but could even have been considered charming at their best. Ayuzawa's friends, her coworkers, her sister, the delinquents-turned-fanboys, etc. - all were alright in that they were supportive of her, although they unfortunately had no depth. They served their purpose as whatever they were, but that was REALLY as far as it went. This could have been rectified as the series went on given the hefty 26 episodes allotted, but they really just... did nothing with these characters, the ENTIRE TIME. It was as if the series was in stasis for the whole series. Nobody changed at all, nobody became more interesting. The most we got was the delinquents-turned-fanboys' past being revealed, but even that ended up having the depth of a kiddie pool. I had hopes for Aoi too, but after the initial reveal/twist in this character, they remained as shallow as the rest of them. It was impossible to see these characters as anything more than one-dimensional caricatures. Not a single one of those characters ended up seeming like an actual human being, which made the series eventually unbearable for me by the mid-endpoint.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the mains, it was actually exactly the same. They're cute together... but the stagnation of their relationship as well as the stagnation of every other character eventually bogs you down enough that it's no longer enjoyable to watch them together. \\n\\n\r\n[SPOILERS, somewhat]\\n\\n\r\nIt gets really boring. Usui jumps in and saves Ayuzawa over and over again, and Ayuzawa's feelings towards Usui progress at a snail's pace, if even. She obviously likes him. You can see that in how much she relies on him and inadvertently cries out to him for help in times of crisis. But Usui is literally coming to see her at every waking moment of his life and by episode 19, we still haven't seen her return even a fraction of the care Usui has done for her. I want to make it clear that she is not obliged to return his feelings nor all the favors he's done for her, but I wouldn't even treat a friend this apathetically when this friend is taking THAT much time out of their day for you. If someone is pouring in this much effort and time into being with you while you are not, that is something that has to be addressed. Are you two on the same page? By that I mean, are they okay with you not being as proactive in the relationship as they are? Are they in love with you? If they are, do you feel the same way that they do? Because if you don't, then their continued investment in you is clearly a problem and is unfair to the other party. And so on. This goes unaddressed the whole time, which is the main problem with their relationship. Usui is clearly in love with her and she clearly values him too... and yet, there is this discrepancy in the way they treat each other. He invests a ridiculous amount of time in their relationship, initiating almost every interaction/time they spend together while she... does not, which makes their relationship feel imbalanced at best, and injust at worst. \\n\\n\r\nOne more thing that I think is important to address, at least briefly, are some of the problematic elements in the show. At first, it was minor enough for me to be able to put it aside, acknowledge that what was wrong, and keep watching, but the whole thing with Aoi at the beach was my breaking point. The problematic element that stuck out to me the most at the beginning was Ayuzawa being physically assaulted and threatened by the two men who broke into the maid caf\u00e9 and how they played that for laughs. These are serious crimes that were committed by the two men with real repercussions for the victim, and they basically brushed it off with a sex joke-- about them being masochists searching for a dominatrix, and called it a day from there. Needless to say, that depiction was problematic. The other incident I need to talk about is the whole dynamic between Aoi, his aunt, and his father, and what went down at the beach with his aunt. Nobody finds it fucked up or even comments on the fact that the aunt proposes some ridiculous bet, saying that he has to win a contest to prove his \u201cmasculinity\u201d to his father in order to be allowed to dress the way he wants to. He is constantly pushed by his family members to be more \u201clike a boy\u201d, or \u201cact more like a man\u201d. Who\u2019s to say he has to rigidly fit in one category? Why is he forced to stop dressing in a way that makes him feel confidently himself and secure in his identity? When Aoi staunchly says he feels the most comfortable and like himself when he dresses femininely and that he was happy to do that even if everyone shunned him for it, his aunt thinks to herself, \u201cHe truly has a man\u2019s spirit!\u201d, in reference to his adamancy. Caught up in pushing Aoi into what she defines the category of \u201cboy\u201d, she doesn\u2019t even stop to think that if she cared about her nephew at all, she would listen to what he was saying. But that would mean considering his feelings for just one second, which is a degree of empathy and depth that is unthinkable for any of these characters.\\n\\n\r\nWhat it really comes down to is that 2/3 of the way, the show was unwatchable for me which is why I dropped it. It was people I didn't care about doing things I  didn't care about while supporting characters that I didn't care about filled up space. As far as genres go, it failed in every respect. \\n\r\n- Comedy: the show had lost all of its comedic value after the first 10 episodes, if I were to estimate. Probably because of how badly contrived the scenarios were, and not in a humorous way at all (just one e.g. of this story that I didn't mention before: really? that butler arc? So boring I started skipping through it. Nonsense scenarios, with literally no stakes, for nonsense characters. That was a major letdown)\\n\r\n- Romance/Shoujo: I didn't feel a single spark by that point in the series. Even if Usui is doing the most, it's hard to gush over an imbalanced, borderline toxic relationship between characters who show no sign of growth-- especially Ayuzawa, and she's our protagonist... so that's a negative to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it\u2019s a 6/10, although after writing this review I wonder if even that is too high. [Edit: I've since changed it to 5/10 accordingly.] This has become far longer than I expected, but hopefully this review can be useful to even one person. Thanks for reading this far!",

            "content": "Well here 8 years removed, I doubt I\u2019ll find anywhere near an attentive audience, but I felt compelled to write a review. And for the first time ever, I felt compelled to write an unfavorable review. Maybe it\u2019s too edgy to write a poor review for a cult popular show like Maid-sama, but here I go. \r\nAs a side note, I understand that certain anime are tailored toward certain audiences, and I\u2019m not a teenage girl. Even still, I sought this anime out with a positive mindset and with many pros, and instead left with many criticisms. Don\u2019t watch High School DxD if you can\u2019thandle Ecchi and don\u2019t watch Eromanga Sensei if you dislike incest portrayed in anime. But if you come into a romance anime with a profile that is highly comprised of school romances, you bet I can tell the good from the bad. \\n\\n\r\nI will now proceed to review by MyAnimeList\u2019s listed order:\\n\\n\r\nStory (4/10)\\n\r\nThe story, well isn\u2019t really. And that\u2019s okay for something like this, but it needs to make up with other things, which I\u2019ll get into later. Instead, going by premise, the main character is the student council president, feminist, poor, and works at a maid cafe. Hot, cool guy enters and romance ensues. I\u2019ll include recommendations or alternatives at the end, I\u2019m done with the story. \\n\\n\r\nArt (5/10)\\n\r\nThere is nothing inventive about the art. On a scale from Kanon (2002) to Kyoto Animation or Makoto Shinkai, this is like normal 2000s art. There was nothing special about anything to the art. Watching it for 26 episodes really made me realize why it\u2019s either really important to have a good story to back up marginal art or make the anime really pretty. It wasn\u2019t bad and I want to get this weird taste out of my mouth with some beautiful Kyoto animation, so I\u2019ll just slap a 5 on there and move on. \\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\r\nHey, it\u2019s the only thing I gave better than the overall score! Obviously based on averages this is saving the score a little bit, but why? It\u2019s because I\u2019m a weeb that\u2019s far past help, and fanboy over voice actors. Kana Hanazawa is the leading voice actor for a reason. Aki Toyasaki is another popular voice actor that I just caught onto at the right time, which is fortunate for this anime. I thought it was strange how it reused voice actors for other roles (I counted Kana Hanazawa at least 3 Different characters and Aki Toyosaki at least 2 different characters) but I will always accept listening to Kana Hanazawa voice more. OP is ok, other sound is ok. Sound is probably good for a 5 and 2 extra for voice actors bias. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (4/10)\\n\r\nI introduced Misaki and Usui in the story portion (because there isn\u2019t a story to talk about) but that\u2019s basically it. I didn\u2019t feel any sort of character development from them passed what they were described as. In fact, I felt the side characters move more overall by the end than they did. Very generic, and while that\u2019s passable, they continued to ruin it until there were only bad stereotypes left. The only thing good about these characters are their voice actors as mentioned above. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (3/10)\\n\r\nCan you guess what gave it a 3/10? I bet you probably could, if you actually read up until here. If you guessed, \u201cenjoyment rose exponentially every time Kana Hanazawa or Aki Toyosaki spoke\u201d then you would be correct! Of course, that doesn\u2019t always save a series as I can get that same voice from listening to renai circulation on repeat for hours on end. I was so unentertained that while I was watching this in class, it almost inspired me to stop watching anime and pay attention to my AP Chemistry teacher talk about gasses and Avogadro\u2019s hyptohesis. Then, they continued to drag me through this *expletive* for 26 episodes at snail\u2019s pace. Trust me, I am ok with slow pacing and long 20+ episode series, but this torture was the first anime I actively disliked for a 20+ episode series. \\n\\n\r\nOverall (5/10)\\n\r\nThe best thing about this is surviving it. And the voice actors. I could have been watching cute girls doing cute things or maybe a romantic comedy, but this was about the worst thing that could happen to me. If you liked this series (I only judge silently) then I recommend \u201cSpecial A\u201d which is the same things about the female MC romance with Hot guy cool and good at everything saving the day, except not terrible. You can also try EVERY OTHER SHOUJO ANIME ABOUT A GIRL AND A HOT GUY like maybe \u201cKimi ni Todoke\u201d or even better, \u201cInu x boku ss.\u201d I know older romances like \u201cwelcome to the nhk\u201d or \u201cbakuman\u201d can be good, but this one should be forgotten.",

            "content": "NOTE: I ain't no english speaker\r\nA friend of mine reccommended me Maid-Sama! and since I was planing on watching it anyway I decided to go along and get to it. I had a mix of expectations. On one hand I knew that this was going to be just another highschool rom-com with tear-jerking and melodrama. On the other hand the premise seemed more interesting than most and the overall charm of the anime hooked me. In any case, I was expecting an enjoyable watch.\r\nI must gladly say that my expectations were not only fulfilled, but the anime managed to impress me.\r\nPRODUCTION VALUE\r\nThe production is simple,but it works. The art is quite unique with the characters and scenarios, and the overall look of the series having their own charm. It's nothing out of the ordinary though but surely the colorful look of the show stands out in the crowd, even if it is a little \"too colorful\". The animation was more impressive than other anime of the same style. It was consistent and it never fell down hard due to budget (or at least it wasn't noticeable).\\n\r\nAs for the sound, it was good but just like the art/animation it wasn't great. The voice acting was well done and overall the anime sounded clear and nice. The soundtrack is forgettable. Not much to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\r\nAlthough the premise is cliched, it was interesting enough for me to care about the anime and I was specially glad at the fact that the anime didn't use a tear-jerking approach nor teen-agnst. This is basically a rom-com and as one it is entertaining and it delivers good humour and a satisfactory relationship building...for the most part...It is nothing new though so you can't be wrong with it once you decide to watch it or not. The biggest flaw for the show is the horrible pacing. Sometimes it feels rushed and other times it is stuck with filler episodes for characters nobody cares for. This would have worked better as a 12 episodes show I believe.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\r\nI will focus on the two main characters Misaki and Usui. Misaki is your typical \"perfect girl\" with obvious tsundere atributes. She is hard-working, intelligent and athletic, and she IS NOT in love with Usui. Usui is more of a Mary Sue than Misaki. He is handsome, clever, athletic and has that mysterious aura that makes him the most perfect guy in the whole school. Despite those characters being clich\u00e9d and lacking any significant personality, they are somewhat charming and interesting. They lack any kind of serious development or backstory making them just plot devices. You could replace them with any other character from any other show and you would get the same result. I have nothing to say about the support cast since every single one of the side characters is a bland archetype that is there for (a) fanservice or (b) get on Misaki's nerves.\\n\\n\r\nCONCLUSION\\n\r\nDid I enjoy Maid-Sama? Yes, in a way it has its own charm. The comedy is funny enough and the dynamic between the main characters works well. On the other hand, it doesn't stand out in any way when compared to other anime of the same genre and therefore it is not more than just another average clich\u00e9d romcom.",

            "content": "Quite possibly the most pathetic anime I've had the misfortune to experience. The only reason I continued to watch the whole series was out of sheer disbelieve that it couldn't get any worse, yet every episode kept proving me wrong.\r\nStory: 1\r\nYour typical cookie-cutter anime overflowing with terribly overused cliches, except this particular show somehow is lazier than its thousands of look-a-like anime shows. There is NOTHING interesting going on: your typical anime rom-com featuring beautiful characters in a high school environment finding themselves involved in \"wacky anime antics\" with a minute or two at the very end of each episode of forced sentimentality to trickthe viewer into thinking that the show has a heart. Watching a brick tumble around in a washing machine is more emotionally investing than anything Maid-sama can hope to conjure up. A major proponent to this ugly story is the characters, which I will get into next.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1\\n\\n\r\nIf you were to replace all the characters of the show with cardboard cutouts of retired NASCAR drivers, then nothing of value would be changed in the slightest. The characters in Maid-sama are easily some of the most dense, unmotivated, and inorganic I've ever witnessed in any anime. The female MC has a jaded view of all men, believing that they are all perverted scumbags, while the male MC, the run-of-the-mill cool guy who always has his hands in his pockets and his eyes half closed, is trying to convince her that guys are nothing to be scared of. Now, this might make for a good story, if it weren't for the fact that literally every guy in town IS a perverted scumbag. Every episode has a token scene of a group of guys sexually harassing a girl/girls at school, the female MC intervening, then the male MC making some unabashedly rude/insulting remark to irritate her, just generally being a terrible human being, yet because he's the MC, she always lets it slide, allowing him to abuse her emotions and sometimes her private space (in one episode he follows her into a back alley and directly pulls up her skirt to look at her panties. She calls him a \"baka\" and continues on normally). In one episode, the female MC is closing up shop alone at the maid cafe (her workplace), when she suddenly gets abducted, bound and gagged, and threatened at taser-point by two guys who give off some veeeeery unsettling sexual assault innuendos. She manages to break free and beat up her abducters, and walks away from the incident. The male MC, who was watching the scene unfold, tells her that she has to be more \"tolerant\" of men like them, or else people will start to hate her. AND THEN SHE BEGINS TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM. Because that's what real people do, right? These characters are totally believable, right?\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt/Sound: 1\\n\\n\r\nJust as any canned anime, the art is unoriginal and the music is your typical rom-com soundtrack made to fill the episode with more noise, in addition to the mind-numbing voice acting. Nothing really else to say here, because there's nothing to look at or listen to.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1\\n\\n\r\nNo.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that so many people like this anime says a lot about the non-existent standards of the anime viewer base as well as the nosedive that the anime industry is taking right now. Cookie-cutter schlock that is shoveled out in droves every season in order to meet quota, yet since the frequent anime viewers' concept of what makes a good story is so saturated with the utterly lazy plot lines, the cardboard cutout characters shown in EVERY anime, and the complete absence of any real creativity leads them to believe that shows like Maid-sama are not complete audio/visual abominations.",

Usually I procrastinate on doing this as I've noticed a lot of reviews are judged very harshly on MAL.  With that being said, I'll say that this show really surprised me to point that I feel compelled to write a review.  Now I'm a guy who enjoys anime but with a tad bit of romance thrown in.  Been watching that a lot lately and I was reading the recommendations of others for another show when I came upon this gem. The story wasgreat with good pacing; it didn't feel rushed but had a good gradual flow.  The art quality isn't that great compared to others but I have no complaints.  The sound was also okay, no songs that really stuck with me but the intro might be growing on me.  The characters were great also, no wimpy men here.  And I loved the heroine, strong yet insecure with an innocent charm.  Overall I really enjoyed watching this show; I realized I had a dumb smile on my face every episode.\\n\\n\r\nBeing a guy, I'm reluctant to head into the territory of shojou anime as it is for gggiiirrrlllsss.  But if more shojou are like this, then I'll definitely give them a try.  Sick of the wimpy men on the boys side anyway and I think a lot of guys would agree with me.  Now if you liked my review, please rate up.  If you didn't, kiss my...wait, that would be just gay.",

Maid-sama is a cute anime with some interesting aspects and some formulaic stuff thrown in. \r\nFirst off, I enjoy the play of personalities with Misaki and Usui, they seem like total opposites but their personalities click, even if there's some denial on Misa's half. Usui comes off as an odd character to pinpoint at first. You don't really know what's going on in his head or how 'deep' the rivers of his personality really run. He'll surprise you with some of the things he does and his amount of insight into the worldaround him and into Misa. Misa herself isn't all that interesting. Basic plain-Jane, hard-working, man-hating (semi), overachieving character as many. She can come off a bit strong at first and maybe you won't like her all that much, but as the story progresses, you get to see her softer side and they interplay of her and Usui's personalities and you know that he's responsible for her growth in many ways so it makes you want to root for them as a couple even more. I love this kind of stuff, so for me this is fangirling heaven :D\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7- Man-hating president goes undercover as maid, cute guy finds out, she has to keep it a secret. Lol. Yeah. Ok, not the best story ever, but it's cute! And it works!\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6- Ahhh...the art... well, what can I say here? Sometimes it's awesome looking. At certain close-ups and during some scenes, it's down-right pretty (in a basic shoujo romance way) but then most of the time it gets ugly and is VERY inconsistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound: -- Must admit I haven't paid much attention to it. I will talk about the ED and the LOLness that ensued. It's just one of those WTF LMAO kind of things.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: so far...6-7- It's not that I don't enjoy Usui (because I do!) and it's not that I dislike Misaki (because I don't, I just hope she's not like Hikari from SA). I'm just waiting for some in-depth character development or some back-story or SOMETHING! \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8- Laugh out loudness in the form of shoujo goodness. I love it all. You might too.",

Being one of my personal favorites for years, I decided to re-watch it and to my surprise, I came to love it even more and bonded more strongly with the characters. What makes this a masterpiece? The two main protagonists. Ayazuwa Misaki is my role model. She is the perfect definition of feminism: strong, independent and hardworking. Her ideal goal is to to have more female students in a recently opted co-ed school Seika High so she's always fighting for equal rights. She's working extra hard to not only support her family butalso maintain her role as president of the student council to create a more fitting environment for girls in school, while working part-time at a maid cafe. It's always so refreshing to see a strong female lead on-screen and Misaki's character was the perfect touch. On the other hand, Usui is the perfect man any girl/guy could ask for. He\u2019s smart, caring, incredibly sexy and always makes the best dirty jokes (!!). Did I mention that he's an amazing cook as well? He's perfection. Their relationship was key to success of the anime. Both the characters were mature so there weren't any unwanted whiny/dragged out scenes but instead we get to see a beautiful friendship bloom into love. The entire anime was a perfect combination of comedy, friendship and romance with wonderful characters. Definitely a masterpiece when it comes to sh\u014djo anime.",

Is a Romcom/Shoujo following Class President Misaki (yeah you guessed it, she is a maid), an admirer in Usui Takumi and a group of colourful characters such as \"The Moron Trio\". This series can be as light, or serious as you want to take it as it does follow some fairly complex and in depth themes, though there is certainly no problem just watching it for the plentiful humour around, and... the abundance of cross-dressing, if that's your thing!\r\nThe actual plot here is an interesting one and is what drew me in, essentially respectful tyrant in Class President Misaki isforced to play the role of a maid in a Maid Cafe because of her families situation, her biggest admirer and stalker in Usui finds out and blackmails her into a relationship... of sorts. It is carried out fairly well from the awkwardness of a girl with no time to love to an ending that almost gets there, we of course have many other characters with their role to play and fitting serious backgrounds to go with.\\n\\n\r\nThe art itself surely held up, as you can see the different emotional standpoints shine through at times and we have some lovely backgrounds to prove that. Fanservice is surely there as is expected from an anime surrounding a maid cafe, there is no ecchi relations in it though, its just there.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter progression is a big one in this series, we see really a bunch of school kids working through their own problems and getting through life. The peak of one of these problems or even insecurities is of course the aim of this anime so the characters involved (and not) have a lot to play in this progression.\\n\\n\r\nOverall it was just really enjoyable, as I said it can be taken as lightly as you want or you get get head over heals emotionally involved with this one (though I wouldn't suggest it because there is only the one season) exploring the eventual opening up of a girl that has lived a hard and independent life whose job is to stay as emotionally detached as possible. Have fun with this one guys, quite the roller coaster ride!",

It may not bring something new but it's moments never cease to be amusing. Eventhough the outcome looks grim at certain times it will certainly cheer you up with some good lines that that trigger a change as soon as the songs pop up.\\n\r\nI've noticed artwork is somewhat sloppy at times but I believe the overall atmosphere makes it worthwhile watching since it always made me laugh.",

            "content": "Where do I begin. I was hesitant to watch this anime at first. I was actually rewatching OHHC when this anime was on the suggestions list on YouTube and I thought what the heck. \r\nI am so glad I did. \r\nKaichou surpassed my expectations more than I could have ever imagined. I don't think that it is \"typical\" or \"cliche\" because there are many things that are unique to this anime. \r\nStory 9.5/10 \r\nThis is a rom com but the story and the set up where very entertaining. The plot is very maneuverable and flows with ease with lots of comedy and romance and feelsmoments all over. I would say that the manga has a smoother plot but thats because it took the story further than the anime did. \\n\\n\r\nArt 9/10\\n\r\nAt first I didn't like the art but I grew to love it. I guess what I didn't like the most was the hair and to be fair, I was judging this anime a lot based on OHSHC (I'm not sure why) and I liked the smoothness of Ouran's art versus Kaichou's but once I got passed that I could see that the art really is wonderful. (Usui is so gorgeous)\\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nThis was def. the weakest point for me. I love it when animes have beautiful music but I don't \"discriminate\" if they don't. However I wasn't really feeling Kaichou's. I liked the OP and I liked the first ending but thats kind of it. The effects throughout the anime where not appealing but they weren't annoying either. For me it just wasn't the strongest point. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 9/10\\n\r\nI'm giving this 9/10 bc of the supporting cast. They were developed okay. If it was just based on Usui and Mikasa it would be a 10 for me. Not that the suporting cast WASN'T developed its just that they weren't AS developed as the main leads and i think they could have done more with it. \\n\\n\r\nOverall and Enjoyment 10/10\\n\r\nI finished this anime in 2 days. I was so hooked and I went immediately to finish it through the manga. It had me squeeling and I loved every second of it. I think that it's one of the best romance anime's that there are and if you haven't seen this anime yet and you are a fan of romance I recommend you do that ASAP.",

Really, it's almost a good thing to be able to fully appreciate the nothingness and the emptiness of these episodes sandwiched together and called, beyond my comprehension, an anime : because if you're being able to enjoy that one, then believe me, every other animes with similar theme will transport you WAY farther.\r\nAlong the lines, and with the very first episodes at that,you will first notice the total absence of a scenario. Kaichou wa Maid-sama is not a story, it's a setting. And that's it. It could have been not that badif this setting was explored at least thoroughly ... but forget it : with old jokes, inconsistent scenes, confusing dialogues, that was not going to happen.\\n\\n\r\nWith that, you could expect tremendous cute characters drawings and art, yes ? \\n\r\nSorry, not happening either. The authors must have spend a far amount of time away, on a desert island, watching each other faces on a close-up and have selfishly decided it was good enough to put this exercise into an anime. Prepare yourself :\\n\r\nIt's not that bad, but still your eyes could get hurted along the way.\\n\r\n...\\n\r\nSince I don't want to give up more time to this anime than I already have, I will wrap things here and now and tell you this :\\n\r\nIf you are a veteran anime fan, or if you have already watched a few romance anime, stay far away from this one. It's not that the anime is actually so bad, and if i could describe it more accurately, I would dare to say it's kind of \"pointless\". You're going to end up, midway, totally indifferent to the setting, the characters, the story (ouch! the word hits me !) etc ...\\n\r\nIf you're new to the romance anime theme, don't give up. Sure, this one lacks a bit of the warm, strong and lovely feelings you could find in others, but perhaps it's still watchable as it could satisfy you in its own pace...",

Despite her hatred towards all male beings. She decided to make the most of her time here and become student council president to rule over the boys her top priority to have more girls enroll to even out the amount of students so girls can have there say. even with the authority andpower it cant hide the shame she would feel if one of the students at seika high caught her at her embarrassing part time job maid latte as you can tell from the tittle the role is to dress up as a maid waitress to serve customers and to make them feel at home in a warm environment. so imagine what she felt when she is caught by Usui.\\n\\n\r\nUsui is also a student at seika high  AKA mister perfecto except his ways of making girls at seika high cry. scolded many times by the prez ( misa ) he finds out the truth about Misa's lifestyle and they become very close even when Misa refers to him as the perverted alien.  I love this anime because of the Misa the main chick if you love Tsundere girls as much as I do you will enjoy this anime there's a very small love triangle towards the end but only very small no tears will be shed children. Usui and Misa have a perfect example of a love/hate relationship except its only one sided though unfortunately you will have to suffer through the painful experience of Misa chan's denseness towards Usui's  feelings but I suppose that's what makes the drama if your a fan of shugo chara,kodocha,gakuen alice, or wolf girl & black prince then you will LOVE this anime!",

            "content": "This story is\u2026 interesting. I consider it very much like Chibi Vampire with how the characters act. We got our main character, Misaki Ayuzawa, who is a lot like Karin in how she sort of freaks out. She has a secret she doesn\u2019t want anyone else to know about and jumps if even a mention of her secret might be leaked out, instead of Vampire it\u2019s a maid. Then we have the love interest, Usui\u2026 OH COME ON! That\u2019s the same name as in Chibi Vampire Karin! They could have at least made it a different name then something that is so similar. And evenhis personality is the same with his rather cold nature and quiet disposition. I think the only difference in the two characters is that Misaki is rather headstrong and rather harsh, not letting anyone help her but pushing them away thinking they are beneath her, and Usui is basically loved by every girl instead of feared by them. \\n\\n\r\nSo I guess I should get into the characters more. Misaki is a really strong willed girl with a deep hated of men though would protect them if they were about to get hurt. And really why wouldn\u2019t she? Her father left her family with a large amount of debt and ran off. Her stubborn nature is only shown when she is outside of her home. Inside, she is rather nice to her younger sister and mother who is rather sick. Why is it that the parents are always needing their kids to grow up so fast in these types of anime, its either they are gone, sick, or left the child all alone. Why can\u2019t we just have a character who has both a mother and father, a loving family that cares for her? It just makes Japanese families look really messed up if this is always the case. (I know this is not reality but sometimes people get the strange idea that Anime reflects exactly what is going on in Japan.) I would consider Misaki a \u2018Hot then Cold\u2019 type of girl, the tsundara type. She also is very head strong and will try and deal with things on her own instead of asking for help, pushing people away. I think its one of the reasons why she pushes Usui away so much. By the way, get used to her yelling \u2018Stupid Usui\u2019 a lot. \\n\\n\r\nAs the show goes on, you see her growing and learning how to actually deal with them through Usui. Now, going with Usui, I consider him slightly like a stacker and slightly like a typical boy who just loves to tease a girl he has a crush on. I would love a guy like him king of since he pretty much seems dedicated to Misaki in almost every way, even when she is mean to him. So many girls keep asking him to go out with them but he always tells them no just so that he can be with her. He cares for her so much that he just seems to do anything he can think of to protect her, even if she can protect herself most of the time. There were a lot of times I thought that things were going to happen a certain way and ended up being different. On the other hand, I would hate it if the guy who was interested in me seemed to have no real personality in his voice for the most part and will show his personality through his actions alone. It would annoy me like it does for Misaki.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters really just seem to end up being background characters, not really sticking out all that much. We have normal personalities like the cute one, the ditsy one, the normal perverted boys, and so on. They don\u2019t really stand out except maybe the first three boys we see Misaki yells at. They are the \u2018comedy trio\u2019 like this show needs any more comedy. The background Misaki fan group. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the most annoying episodes for me I would like to point out was episode 6. I was really annoyed with the Inuyama quintuplet brothers. It just really annoyed me having 5 of the same character talking at the exact same time. It just bothered me even if there was a lot of other things I liked as well Saying anymore though would spoil it so sorry, you just got to watch it yourself and suffer the quintuplets. Just trust me that you don\u2019t want to skip that episode if you watch it.\\n\\n\r\nI really am not sure what to think of this show. I keep finding all these things that make it just like another anime, but yet there are some things that make it a bit different. I guess when you watch a lot of anime like I do, you tend to run into a lot that feel like they are ripping off other anime stories, especially in a slice of life romance like this one. \\n\\n\r\nThe art style is pretty basic for a romance slice of life. The artwork is colorful, the characters pretty looking in a shojo syle. There are random times when comedy is supposed to be pushed that the artwork seems to faultier but nothing really bad. It\u2019s just really standard. Get used to a lot of flowers, sparkles, and colorful backgrounds that sometimes only have a pattern to them instead of actually being a normal area. What I like is that the maid outfit is not like a normal maid\u2019s outfit. It looks pretty cool looking. There is one thing I don\u2019t get though, a strange \u2018ghost\u2019 that keeps showing up every once in a while. It\u2019s awkward and makes no sense since this is a romantic comedy and not an occult horror. The ghost is really cute looking but I can\u2019t figure out why its there.\\n\\n\r\nThis is going to be a little hard for me to review as there are two different dubs to this anime. There is from Animax and then from Sentai. I tried a couple minutes of both to see what version I was going to review, and strangely, I liked Sentai version of Misaki Ayuzawa better then the Animax voice. It just feels like it has a lot more control and isn\u2019t so high pitched that it would bother me when she yells. The Sentai also seemed to be closer to the Japanese sub although it also seems a bit gimmikie. For most of this review, I will be talking about Sentai because it\u2019s really hard for me to watch two different dubs. I just picked the one I liked better. Not all that much better, but slightly better. It still suffers from high voices that sometimes sqweek and slightly off voices. When talking about Usui\u2019s voice, he just doesn\u2019t normally have a personality in his voice. He just seems super bored even when he raises his voice a bit. I can understand the fact that they were trying to make him sound all cool but it just makes me want him to give more personality. I do have to say that his voice is perfect for the romantic parts when he is serious but his joking voice makes me wonder if he really is just teasing her. It\u2019s hard to tell. Now I\u2019m not saying he doesn\u2019t have a personality in his voice, he sometimes does but like I said before, his personality is in his actions.\\n\\n\r\nI did like the show, but it was pretty standard. The story just felt like it was pretty much every other romance slice of life and didn\u2019t bring anything really new to the table. If you seen one, you kind of seen them all. They also didn\u2019t end it with an actual ending. They cleared some things up but left a lot of questions that never got answered. It\u2019s pretty much a read the manga ending.",

I'm really picky about art, since I love more modern types like this one where the characters are cute but also look like teenagers instead of elementary geniuses that have found their way into high school. Usui is so cute and makes a cute couple with Misaki. I had so much fun watching their endlessly humorous arguments and cute moments. It was one fo my first animes and I would definitely recommend it to any girl  (orguy, I don't judge) that loves romantic comedy and a relatioship between a popular guy and  a not-so-popular-but-completely-badass-in-this-anime girl.",

            "content": "While I'm not finished with the series I felt I needed to write something about this anime. It's not your typical romcom by any measure. The romance seems intense at times and the comedy comes in quick to relieve the supposed tension from the encounters but it does so in the greatest way possible. And on the the breakdown thus far:\r\nStory 10/10: This isn't your typical romcom and it doesn't set out to be compared to others like Clannad and Toradora. It may seem more light hearted when compared to those but the subtle inferences that occur get you hooked a few episodes in ifyou like this type of series. Just as the synopsis says it's about a girl who became student president in a largely male dominated school who is pretty protective of the other females in the school and of course a stickler for the rules. The story is largely based off her interaction with the male lead, Usiu, who is known around the school as a heartbreaker since so many girls are interested and he has never found one to feel like that about until he met Mirasaka. He becomes interested in her work and her drive to be the best she can be and he tries to protect and get closer to her whenever he can despite his in-sociable demeanor.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10: The backgrounds definitely could be improved but the character drawing is pretty outstanding.\\n\\n\r\nSound (9/10): The opening and ending themes leave some sort of mystery to the series and the lives or Mira and Usiu. There haven't been many moments where in-episode music appeared but its been pretty good so far in accompanying the moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 10/10: Each of the leads and the supporting cast all have some pretty unique personalities when it comes to this genre and they can easily captivate you. A major reason I can keep watching after I watched 3 or so episodes they got me hooked.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10: As i said the characters are unique and the story is pretty original while still working the comedic points into the overall plot. First time in a long time I actually laughed while watching this type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI would highly recommend watching this anime to anyone. the only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because of the background art but if you do not care for that then this is definitely a series you should pick up if at all interested in the romcom genre.\\n\\n",

Remeber to check the overviews for the gist! \r\n        Story: 9.59/10 *Review Begins\r\nOnce an all boys school, Seika High, a re-owned school with reckless and filthy boys, now has turned into a co-ed. With the female population still being the minority, Misaki Ayuzawa decides to take it in her own hands to make theschool better for the girls. Studying, training, and being the first female student council president, Misaki gained the reputation of being a \"demon that hates boys\". As she works in a maid cafe to support her poor family, a popular boy Takumi Usui discovers her embarrassing secret. *This plot is intriguing, and it applies to many girls trying to prove themselves this day and age. While some parts may be sexist (Misaki working in a maid cafe), it doesn't really focus on her cosplaying at all. Rather it foucu's on her friendships and breaking down the barrier to let people in, and having a normal teenage life when she has to support her poor family. If that isn't inspirational, I don't know what is!\\n\\n\r\nOver View: \\n\r\n+ Plot is original\\n\r\n+ Plot is relatable\\n\r\n- Some parts are cliche (sexist)\\n\\n\r\n       Art: 10/10\\n\r\nThe art is eye-catching, and has a unique choice of colors to design the characters. Misaki isn't your typical big busted girl you see in almost every anime, but rather the kick-ass chick that can clearly pull her own wieght (and even others in some cases). The side-characters are animated in an intriguing way, and the male lead is attractive too (but not overly attractive in a cliche way).\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Characters animated well\\n\r\n+ Characters aren't overly attractive \\n\r\n+ Unique color pallet\\n\\n\r\n       Sound: 9.97/10\\n\r\nThe voice acting (in subbed) is attractive, pleasing to the ear, and very fluent. The voice fit the personalities of the characters (this is a MUST to me), especially Misaki's. Misaki's voice is unique and fits her character very well, it's not the annoying chimpmuck voice, but rather a soothing voice on the deeper end. This suites her personally perfectly. Usui's voice is attractive and pleasing. The opening theme song \"Keep My Secret\" is perfect for the anime, but not as catchy as I would've hoped. The scheme in the begginig in fantastic, and I watch it every episode (even when my iPad is 6 percent). \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Voice acting done well\\n\r\n+ Ending is catchy\\n\r\n-Oening doesn't entirely fit the anime\\n\\n\r\n          Character: 9.96/10\\n\r\nMisaki was a refreshing badass female lead (FINALLY) and is one of my favorites. She has flaws, such as Hero Syndrome (always having to save the day), and this is my faveroite aspect of her. This is found in far too many male leads *cough* SAO *cough*, and having it in a female and having it done well was a punch in the gut! I was surprised that they didn't make her the \"innocent big-eyed beauty\" for a plot being surrounded around a Maid Cafe. She also trains, studies, and is the Student Prez. Finally a female lead that doesnt follow her man around like a puppy! Usui was funny and wasn't an asshole all the time, and wanted to protect her, but he knew she can pull her own weight too. He is handsome, and is a great character while not being the 'perfect' man to set foot on Earth. The side characters were amazing, but didn't go into much depth as I hoped ( i.e Yukirmara). Misaki was a tad bit to ignorant about Usui's love though, I wish the animators had made her realize it sooner.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Personalities weren't cliche \\n\r\n+ Animated well\\n\r\n+ Miskaki didn't follow around Usui like a lost puppy\\n\r\n- Miskaki was too ignorant about Usui's crush.\\n\r\n- Side characters didn't go in depth.\\n\\n\r\n       Enjoyment: 10\\n\r\nI enjoyed this series down to the very last episode (though I was mad when it ended), and it left me scrambling to go to the nearest manga store to pick up the newest volume. The characters were intriguing, plot original, and a female lead I liked. It tooke me about 1 day and and to finish (marathon), and I hope you plan to watch this anime too!\\n\\n\r\nOver View\\n\r\n+ Great characters\\n\r\n+ Interesting plot\\n\r\n+ Kick-ass female lead (I know I keep saying this, but it's true!)\\n\\n\r\n       Overall: 9.89/10\\n\r\nOverall I give this a high nine, and many of the fact were small details that caused this to be a tad bit to cliche (Miaski was wayyyyy to ignorant). I loved the characters (Yukirmara is my absolute favorite!) and I really liked the entire setup.\\n\\n\r\nKey: \\n\r\n*= start of story review\\n\r\n+ = good things\\n\r\n- = bad things\\n",

The manga isn't over yet but it only has 4 more chapers to go.(48/51) The manga is pretty funny so if you read the manga the anime will not be so funny. \r\nThough the anime is not so funny but mixing a funny element and a great plot is making this anime good.\r\nI like the art style though it could be better and the characters are portrayed differently form the manga making NOT funny. \r\nSO anime watchers the main woman character is supposed to behard core, strong and intimidating. I don't know why but the anime doesn't make it look like that at all. Especially as she is called the demon president, people who watch the anime might not really see that. \\n\r\nSecondly Usui is the level headed guy but the anime is forgetting there is a comedic side to Usui! WE WANT THE REAL USUI!!!!!\\n\\n\r\nSo if you read the manga don't consider watching it beacuse the manga rules over the anime greatly. You will be dissapointed.\\n\\n\r\nIf you didn't read the manga this anime is very interesting and enjoyable.",

            "content": "Perhaps i am over stepping my mark by rating a Shoujo which is inherently aimed towards girls, as a guy. But given the MC's reputation as a tsundere, a popular character trait amongst male anime audiences, i feel a certain obligation to report on the content of the show for those looking to consume that kind of content.\r\nThe art is pretty average, though I was impressed by how seamless some of the transitions were between the general scenes and obviously budget panoramic backgrounds. The sudden switch in quality somehow isn't noticeable enough to draw from the overall feel of the show the rest of theart provides. The sound usually isn't worth mentioning unless it's bad, but it's pretty important for comedic timing and the show doesn't stumble there which is worth acknowledging on some level.\\n\\n\r\nMy main problem though is with the story, since there doesn't appear to be one. It starts off about  the male lead who discovers the female lead's secret, embarrassing job; and the need to maintain that secret during her school tenure for reputations sake as the [insert god-like female school president] trope. But after the first 8 or so episodes this somewhat gets forgotten about along with the primary antagonist who implies a revenge that never comes (if only indirectly through and at the convince of a peer of theirs). Nothing of note really happens from here all the way until episode 21 when we finally see some actual character development.\\n\\n\r\nFor about a dozen episodes through all the series' teens the show gets stuck on \"tease\" mode and seriously over stimulates the subtlety of romantic tension where half way through it all becomes a giant chore to sit through. Do they spend any quality time together? Do they have any moments of accidental closeness? At the risk of creating a spoiler, no. There is that gem at the end of episode 21, before stalling and climaxing in the final 2 episodes, 25 and '6.\\n\\n\r\nSo what can we really say about the characters? Well the archetypal tsundere is actually a character development process that improves over time in positive respects. It could be argued that some progression occurs for the female lead as Misaki becomes more susceptible to the teasing of Usui, but the consequences of which just amount to \"more frequent and intense blushing\" and no actual changes of circumstance; but for the late introduction of a childhood friend and eventual love rival (that causes Usui to exhibit his first human emotion, jealousy), which just like the initial plot and antagonist, also gets lost and forgotten about.\\n\\n\r\nYou can tell the show is a Shoujo though since the female MC is the only character with any kind of embellishment; hell even the male lead, Usui has zero character background other than the fact he lives alone in a somewhat expensive apartment. This really makes it difficult to relate to him on top of the fact he's a border line Mary Sue. So perfect that his only flaw is his own perfection. Excellent at studies, excellent at sports, near super human resistance to pain and injury and so charming it'd make the average person puke. He's a text book Disney Prince which actually makes for incredibly boring watching, except presumably for fantasising girls. As for everyone else, they pretty much only exist, but for one random tangent about the local delinquents, solely to drive the plot. Which isn't at all refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nI would like to go into more depth and clarity, but i also want to keep this concise enough that people will actually read it. This show missed a lot of opportunities in my opinion, but such is the nature of foregoing a full story for fan service. I don't think i'd recommend this unless you genuinely had a maid fetish that needed addressing. I don't even think the tsundere is even all that tsundere since she wears the cape of tsun' right up until the closing episode. Which just makes her frustrating to watch more than \"endearing\".",

            "content": "Well I came to see a romance I heard was popular online. While I guess I enjoyed myself, there are a lot more romances that outshine Kiachou wa Maid-sama! I feel that it defines average for the romance genre.\r\nStory: 5/10\r\nThere wasn't really all that much guiding the story besides the fact Takumi likes Misaki. Sure there were interesting short arcs, but no overarching plot-line to push the story forward. Very much slice-of-life, but with no real direction. Lots of cliche episodes like the beach episode. Nothing I particularly disliked, but nothing to keep me interested either. I guess I kind of enjoyed certain plot elementslike the set up of a female lead in a authority position over a bunch of hoodlum guys, but I'm not really sure much propelled me to finish the show other than I was curious if the two mains got together. There was no drive for me to see them together. The very last story arc introduced a new character as well and sort of threw off the whole vibe of the show. Not the best story planning I've seen.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\\n\r\nFine. I may not have seen it in the best quality, but it seemed pretty generic for the romance genre.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nPoor. Like really. I could not find anything that sounded good at all. The sub was so high pitched that I hated it, and the dub was pretty high and seemed off. Maybe it was the quality of the particular video I was watching. I don't think so.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I probably have the most to say. Firstly: I freakin' loved Misaki. She was totally awesome and really fit the strong female lead role. Her responses and actions fit her and seemed real. Loved a scene where she was accidentally drunk. It was hilarious. On the other hand, I positively HATED Takumi. Seriously? This is what the author thought a princely-type guy should be like? I went through the show thinking he would change, but no. This was just what the author thought would be attractive. Yeah, no. Go look at Ouran High School Host Club for a good princely lead. Not a freakin' stalker. Lastly, a somewhat major character was introduced in the last few episodes, and really threw off the show. Instead of focusing on deepening the shallow relationship, they just tried to drive a wedge in between and after the two overcoming it, said \"Ohh I guess we were in love....\" Stupid. This category really depends on your like of Takumi.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\\n\r\nThat all said, it was hard to really not enjoy the show somewhat. Not at all stressful to watch and had a pleasant, if odd, ending. I might just be easy to please. I don't really recommend this show unless you've finished the countless others that are better, but I guess it's not bad. It might be better if you like Takumi more.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 5/10",

The story is really compelling and it does and amazing job of drawing its audience in. It's story is very unique which makes it 10 times more interesting to watch.\r\nArt: the art in the anime is well done I particularily like the type of style they used when drawing the characters because it really matches the characters personality really well.\r\nsound: the sound was alright but It never really stood out much, it was always in the background to the point where I ended up not listeningto it, the voice acting was fine it was mostly the music I didn't like.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: the characters were really well thought out. They all were different and very interesting, I wanted to find out more about each and every character. Sometimes the choices some of them make I couldn't really agree with but it ended up making the plot continue so i could bare with it.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: I think everyone who loves romance anime will absolutely love this anime, I enjoyed almost everything in it and have watched it over and over again. If you watch this I promise it will be a anime you won't ever forget.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I give this anime a 10 because there are so many good points about it that the bad parts seem so small that they don't really matter. Of coarse it's different with all animes but particularily this one is very enjoyable I recommend this anime to anyone who is either looking for really good romance anime to watch or is just starting watching anime.",

Classy, sweet, funny, and hot all at the same time. Where would I find such a ridiculous anime like that? That could give me all of those features and I would find it memorable? Maid-sama has certainly pulled it off.\r\nHow many of you can say you hate that one guy in the class just because he annoys you, he's almost close to perfect, and he's popular? Those type of people are soannoying because they always seem to get the best of you. Why? Because you never measure up to him and certainly not date them. But those are the type of situations that strike up the most wild roller coaster relationships that will make the viewer laugh, smile, frown, and fell remorse all at the same time.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is a little of a cliche taking a girl who is so headstrong, independent, and smart into a high school of mostly boys. She can't officially get a boyfriend because all of the boys are mentally scared of her. Now, here comes the (DING) perfect, hot, sexy boy who secretly falls for her. And in almost every episode you can find them fighting or battling over some sort of thing that brings them closer every time. It was kind of unoriginal but this is one heck of a joyride! I loved almost every second of it and not once did I yawn, which I do in most serious romances. This is truly funny! (& I'm not one to laugh out loud at much Anime)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was fantastic, it's not out of this world great but the design of everyone was great. The sound was kind of a blah, especially the opening buy hey we can't always get everything under the tree! The characters are average but for the girls Usui is very attractive that you will find yourself drooling for the dang guy!\\n\\n\r\nThe enjoyment was great, just pure awesome. It gave everything I wanted to see in a romance. Because real life romance do have funny, love and hate relationships and whether we like it or not, there will be someone you can't absolutely stand but at the end of the day you'll find yourself saying \"Hey, he really isn't that bad\".\\n\\n\r\n(Note: For those of you who think this is like Kimi ni Todoke... I warn you IT IS NOT for various reasons. One it's a comedy and two the girl isn't shy!)\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading! :)\\n\\n\r\nKina-kun signing off!\\n",

            "content": "I\u2019ve been trying to watch Kaichou wa Maid-Sama! (I\u2019ll just call it Maid-Sama from now on) for a while now, but due to one of the worst dubs I\u2019ve ever heard in my life, I gave up on it (I don\u2019t really like to watch romance anime in Japanese and I almost always prefer dub to sub for any show). So, when they finally did a redub (ty Sentai) I was pretty excited. Anyway, back to the series at hand: this show is by J.C. staff and, as hinted about before, is a romance (a Shoujo romance, to be specific). I\u2019ll let you read thesynopsis on your own if you so wish because this is all I really have to say in the preamble. \\n\r\nLet\u2019s get the aesthetics out of the way first:\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt and Animation: \\n\r\nI can start right off the bat by saying that I really liked the art style of this show. It was a really wholesome and fun art style and really fit the show well. Character design was also a real strong point as well; Misaki\u2019s character design was especially great and all female cast members were unique looking. As for the males, it seems like all of the males who were trying to \u201cget\u201d Misaki had blonde/light hair for some reason. This was really weird to me since most Japanese men have black hair. Another thing the show does well in the art department is the use of Chibi. I for one, usually think Chibi is overdone and annoying but, this show pulled it off really well by using it mostly on the \u201c3 idiot\u201d male characters (it was quite funny every time you would see them in Chibi). The colours of the show were great as well, they were very glitzy and sparkly especially when it came to deeper moments between Usui and Misaki; this show was not afraid to showcase its bright colours. The animation was fine as well, there\u2019s not much going on movement wise in shows like these, but when there was a lot of movement, it was solid. Also, I\u2019d like to mention that when something dramatic would happen (Usui \u201cshockingly\u201d saves Misaki) the show would do this slow-mo dramatization thing which I found pretty hilarious because of how corny it was. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nI\u2019ll be honest, the shows soundtrack was not my cup of tea. I always skipped the opening after listening to it once and I didn\u2019t even bother with the ED. As for the OST, there\u2019s usually like 3 main tracks they go to. The very happy and \u201ccute\u201d song they use when everything is fine and normal, the very sad sounding one for when someone is having a flashback or something \u2013 I really hate this one, it always sounded so damn creepy to me, and the excited and glamorous track for when something totally \u201cZANY!!!\u201d is happening. Overall, it\u2019s okay, but just not my taste. Voice actors were solid as well, I thought Misaki\u2019s VA matched her personality very well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: \\n\r\nMaid-Sama features a wide array of characters, but the majority of the focus is put towards our main couple (obviously), Usui and Misaki. I will comment on the supporting cast all at once first though. Essentially, the show mostly uses its background support cast for comedic relief. There are times however where the story revolves around one of the side characters. The most notable comic relief characters are the \u201c3 idiots\u201d as Misaki refers to them in the show. They are easily my favourite characters from the whole show due to their idiotic (yet funny) charm. The rest of the cast usually has one trope attributed to them that defines them really (not much depth for many of them). There\u2019s the 3 idiots as mentioned before, the other employees at the Maid Caf\u00e9, the Vice President from the student council and his sidekick Kanou (I also like him for being pretty much the only sane character towards the end), Aoi (obligatory trap), and the main rival against Usui for Misaki\u2019s love, Hinata. Now, I\u2019m not going to go through each and every one of them so I will say that the most notable ones here are Hinata, Aoi, and Kanou. These side characters don\u2019t really matter much in the long run though since this is a romance between (mostly) two individuals: Misaki and Usui. Starting off with Misaki, I can say she is a very likeable and strong female lead. She doesn\u2019t like to play the damsel and she actually has a personality to her. Sadly, this is ruined about her as the series progresses on as she keeps getting \u201csaved\u201d by Usui. It really gets tiresome and repetitive when you keep seeing that she can\u2019t do things she heavily resolves to accomplish alone (which is the main point and drive of her character) and then this perfect alpha male saves her. Speaking of Usui, well, plain and simple he\u2019s pretty much a douchebag. He is \u201cperfect\u201d in everything he does and has no personality or backstory at all (no backstory yet, until the girl figures it out like many other shoujo). His only goal in life (as far as we see and know) is to get with Misaki, but he\u2019s such a little twat about it that it\u2019s unbearable to watch sometimes. Other than that, we know nothing about him at all and it really isn\u2019t the sign of a good character to be perfect at everything he does. This makes Usui very very irritating towards the end of the series. I didn\u2019t mind him at first (I actually kind of liked him), but as the series progressed, especially when Hinata was introduced, it seemed more and more clear to me that he was just an arrogant, hollow, maniac for the fan girls to fall in love over. \\n\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story is about a hardworking girl who is the strict student council president of her high school while also working as a maid at a caf\u00e9 (to her embarrassment) and how she falls in love with a guy who figures out her secret. The antics mostly revolve around her trying to cover up her secret of being a maid from everyone she knows from her high school. As with any romance, the show heavily relies upon the dynamic between the two main leads. This dynamic is the driving point of the story and is what keeps you invested to keep watching. There are story arcs within the show that focus on different side characters but, usually it comes down to our main heroine who has to make a choice or take on a task and our male lead will always help her on the way whether she likes it or not. Essentially, this show is a romance with a tsundere through the eyes of the tsundere. As I mentioned before, the show relies heavily upon the chemistry and bond between the two leads. In the beginning, the couple seems very natural and likeable, but later on things turn for the worse as Usui\u2019s major flaw of being flawless becomes apparent. Essentially so, if they spent more time developing Usui as much as they tried to develop Misaki i.e. give Usui an actual personality, not make him a knight in shining armour deus ex-machina, then the show\u2019s romance aspect would have flowed much better. The romance between the two becomes really irritating and rushed towards the end when the love triangle between Hinata, Usui, and Misaki is formed. Usui shows his truly irritating possessive side and Hinata is thrown away like trash, making you dislike both main characters even more. On top of this, it doesn\u2019t help that they rush Usui and Misaki\u2019s romantic development greatly in one episode. They do the same thing as they\u2019ve always done in this last episode but, instead, *SPOILERS* Misaki finally draws this conclusion that she loves Usui. This doesn\u2019t really make any sense, comes out of nowhere and had very little foreshadowing, seeing the fact that she was acting pretty much the same before this towards him as she was throughout the whole story.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall: \\n\r\nDespite the gripes with it, I\u2019d say Maid-Sama is, overall, actually a really enjoyable show for the most part. It becomes a little unbearable to watch and cringy for me after episode 20. Though enjoyable, it is flawed, character-wise and plot-wise (the romance). The show was very funny at times, so in a sense it did serve its purpose there. But, if you\u2019re going to have serious moments in a comedy-romance (you usually do) you have to make sure they are executed well. A lot of this shows dramatic faults came from Usui and how unrealistic he could be. The dynamic between the two main leads fell apart as the show went on and you were left with a hollow slice of life with a rushed ending and no feeling of satisfaction. I\u2019m pretty sure the ending was Manga-bait so don\u2019t spaz out for me for my thoughts here. Also, I know some of you fangirls/boys will think I hate this show, but I don\u2019t, I just think they could\u2019ve done better. Please don\u2019t get your panties in a twist; if there is a sequel and Usui gets some development and overall, the show improves, I will give it a higher score (lol definitely won\u2019t catch me reading the manga, sorry). As for now though, this show is a 'meh' for me. \\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 5/10\\n",

Again a great anime who shows two totally different worlds who meet by accident in the back of a Maid Cafe where it happens to be that our main protagonist Misaki the Council President works, and who else would meet her there than Usui the coolest boy in the high school. Now the fun starts . Follow those two through their adventure.To not spoil anythingI will stop here, what will happen next , well check it out yourself.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNicely drawn anime with a lot of humor into it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThe story is focused mostly on the main characters Misaki and Usui. Usui is  the chill cool guy who takes everything easy, you could say life has given him everything on a silver plate, on the other hand we have the hard working Misaki who besides her activity as the president also works at a part time job as a maid in the Maid cafe in the next town. She is hats Usuis relaxed way of going through life and cant stand him for being a male. She has a complex because some family troubles and therefor hates males and takes every chance she gets to punish them at school. There are a  lot of funny moments  I enjoyed with those two involved.\\n\\n\r\nMy Thoughts:\\n\r\nNow I read some reviews saying that if you are looking for romance you shouldnt watch this. I disagree on that point of view. There is romance here, its not so much as some would like maybe, but there sure is. For me there are  3 aspects of this anime that made it worth watching:\\n\r\n1)Comedy\\n\r\n2)Romance\\n\r\n3)Life's Problems\\n\\n\r\nNow I wont comment on those 3 as it would spoil a lot of the anime, but as soon as I get the permission to post blog posts, I am sure I will start reviewing the anime with spoilers(Of course  I will announce it in the title that there are spoilers so people wont ruin their fun).\\n\\n\r\nAnyhow this anime is worth watching , even I went around it first time I seen the title and  description, I actually thought \"This must be some pervy show for sure\" , boy was I wrong. \\n\r\nAnyhow I now recommend this anime and it is now actually one of my favorite anime's , I even went so far and rewatched it which is really something considering that I do not like to rewatch anything at all as I consider it a waste of time.\\n\\n\r\nSo from me its a strong 9 as its probably one of the best Romance-Comedies I have seen.\\n\r\nIf you disagree or want to discuss the topic further, comment on my profile or send me a pm :)\\n\r\nThanks for reading",

            "content": "Kaichou wa Maid-sama... Where do i start? \r\nBe cautious, I tried not to say any spoilers, but if you are very sensitive about any sort of spoilers, you might not want to read. (Only 'Spoilers' contained includes vaguely explain the concepts and story of certain episodes, it's not enough to spoil the whole plot or anything of similar caliber).\r\nStory 1/10:\r\nThis anime didn't seem to carry much of an overall story. It reminded me highly of many American cartoons, in the sense of a new event happening every episode, with many fillers. I felt like there was no clear objective that the writers were going for.They kept compiling events were it seemed like Ayuzawa needed help, and Usui either came to the rescue, or if Ayuzawa was able to get out of the situation herself, he would talk to her about what just happened. I admit that I'm a sucker for anime romance, but I felt like it dragged out. I did not think that this show needed 26 episodes, they could have easily wrapped up the story within 12 or 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nArt 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe art in this anime wasn't particularly bad, I just felt like there is a lot of room for improvement. I personally felt like during the kissing scenes, the mouths looked strangely smaller than what i'm used to, but i'm not completely sure about that one. Besides that, they seemed to use chibi like designs and\"gray blobs\" more often than not. I also found that the backgrounds seemed very repetitive, especially the episode where Ayuzawa and her friends followed Usui around. A lot of the streets, houses, shops, and such were very similar in design. Lastly they seemed to rely on closeup shots for a large portion of each episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound 5/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting (besides the small portion of English voice acting), is pretty solid. Regardless there are always going to be that one voice that you hate, and this anime definitely had some. Overall, they seemed to rely on their theme music (which i personally find catchy, but almost overused) and sound effects to create the drama points. This is a trick that many anime use. Furthermore it is something that should accompany more appropriate scenes to either pump up viewers for an upcoming fight, or even shock viewers with silence during a dramatic scene. This anime didn't seem to connect the story and the sound as nicely as other series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 2/10:\\n\r\nThe characters in this series were extremely recycled. Many of the male characters were shown as disgusting, unorganized, porn-loving, perverts. In a lot of other series you will come across the pervert characters, but this series was practically all about the fact that every guy wants to abuse girls (sexual harassment is shown often, but not followed through in this anime) including every single guy at the school, except for the innocent Yukimura. Besides similar personalities, many characters have similar appearances as well. There are multiple guys that look the Usui, two characters that look like Yukimura, many of the background charaters looked very similar and generic, many of the girls all had similar short hair cuts (including background characters). I felt like this series didn't have much development or creativity when it came to creating characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 1/10:\\n\\n\r\nI did not enjoy this series at all. It did not feel like an anime, it felt like a cartoon. There wasn't anything to attach me to the show after I watched the first couple of episodes. Once the characters and their environment was set up, it really didn't grab my attention any longer. I felt like watching the show was very boring and I don't even know if i'll be continuing the series after watching half of the show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 3/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime did have fair art, but the lack of story, character, and sound creativity, off balances that. I didn't enjoy watching this anime because it slowly turned cliche. However I admit that the whole concept of the show (as in a 'good girl' working at a maid/cosplay restaurant) is capturing. I just didn't think they did the best job writing a story to go alone with the subject. However I can understand why many people would love a series if they are interested in romance/slice of life series, you might find this one has a flavor of originality. I am only giving this anime a poor score because I don't enjoy anime that are all about goofing off, without any real form of a serious side.",

            "content": "Overall, I really love Maid Sama. It's adorably romantic. However, I do believe the series dragged on quite a bit, and this is why it's given a 9/10. Let me explain.\r\nThrough the first 8ish episodes, I was extremely hooked. I thought Usui's attempt at Ayuzawa was extremely adorable. This drive, really kept me in the series for future series.\r\n However, I believe in many later episodes; they hardly focus on the original plot itself. She's a maid and student body president, and she doesn't want anyone to know, correct? I felt as if it swayed (many times) away from that original idea of having hersecret kept. I mean, in many terms I get it. The writers cannot keep going back to that always, but I believe it should've had something to contribute to it most of the time; and those later episodes hardly did for me. \\n\r\nUsui and Ayuzawa's ongoing romance (before becoming a couple) was also really dragged out, longer than it needed to be. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, overall the series was incredible adorable. It did make me laugh, extremely, and the ending was not near disappointing. It's a heart-warmer.",

            "content": "When I was a young lass I adored shoujo, and I adored this anime. But the problem is, it's aged terribly. I suppose those new to the anime scene could find a basic enjoyment of it, but I personally found myself quite uncomfortable re-watching. It, like many romance animes of the time, relies on tropes. Don't get me wrong, tropes can work, that's why they're there. Unfortunately they were more popular when Kaichou was released than now.\r\nSo why did I feel uncomfortable watching a silly romance? Well, here's the tea, sis. All the male characters (except the cross dressing boy, I don't remember his name-I only remember he was quite obnoxious) have very rape-y tendencies. That includes the comic relief, 90% of the re-occurring villains, and the main love interest, Usui. He's a stalker, harasser and overall creep. Tbh, I've met real-life Usui's before and I've had to call the cops on them.\\n\r\nDon't think this shields the main character from critique, the titular maid. She is an example of another, thankfully, dead trope. The strong independent Tsundere. Except she's just as bad as the guy who likes her; she's abusive to all men, so she'd probably get a job at Buzzfeed. Aw, but she's poor so she has to do her best. Except she has an unrelentingly violent personality and her 'independence' never gets endearing, rather you find yourself progressively angrier at her.\\n\r\nI don't want to be that nasty person who says don't watch this. Some people will enjoy it. But if you enjoy well built romances between well rounded characetrs that actually have personality then this isn't for you. I wanted to enjoy watching you Kaichou, you were my childhood. But I suppose I've outgrown you and it's time to put you in the trash.\\n",

            "content": "Story [4]\r\nOne of the main flaws of this particular show is the way that it relies on archetypes and cliches to tell it's story. Kaichou wa Maid-sama is the genericl romcom in which the richest/hottest/most popular guy in the highschool falls in love with the protagonist for no real reason. The story still manages to score a 4 simply because it is a relatively interesting rendition of mediocre shoujo stereotypes.\r\nArt & Sound [5]\r\nThere isn't much to say when it comes to the art in Kaichou wa Maid-sama, and likewise for the audio. They are about what is expected, and they don't have any glaring flaws,but nothing more.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter [3]\\n\r\nThe worst part of Kaichou wa Maid-sama are the characters. They are flat, have no real character arcs, and are stereotypical. That being said, the main girl is not absolutely terrible and has a few character traits of her own. Although Misaki Ayuzawa has been written off as a tsundere (and this isn't false, per se) there is reasoning behind it. Unlike many other shoujo heroines, Misaki is a feminist and has something of a hatred for men. The latter trait isn't positive, but that's exactly what makes it meaningful and lets Misaki stand out, even a little, amongst an ocean of bad main characters.\\n\\n\r\nStill, this series gets a 3 in character because aside from Misaki, everyone is reeaaally flat. Misaki herself isn't anywhere near being impressive enough to salvage that train wreck. :/\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment [10]\\n\r\nThere is a reason that this anime has managed to be as popular as it is- and I'll give you a hint, it isn't just by riding on hype or the coattails of another anime. Kaichou wa Maid-Sama can't stand up against any sort of formal review or critique, but it's well loved simply because it is enjoyable (as long as you haven't declared war against all shoujo tropes, that is).\\n\\n\r\nOverall [9]\\n\r\nDespite the bad scores in almost every department, I gave Kaichou wa Maid-Sama a overall score of 9 simply because it achieves it's goal. It's not trying to be unique- it's just a cliche romance anime with a cliche plot and a cliche cast of characters. What makes this anime notable is that it uses the cliches to their utmost extent. Kaichou wa Maid-Sama is the picture perfect shoujo, and for those who love that sort of thing, this anime is a must watch. For others, not so much.",

            "content": "I personally liked KWMS very much because of the qualities the main character, Misaki, has. She is a very independent, smart, and headstrong girl, who does what she can to help everyone. I think she makes for a very relatable character or at least a good role model. This anime is a romantic anime, but I find it very refreshing as the story revolves around a girl who knows what she wants to do and why; she is a girl who does not depend on people much, but she is also not without fault. Her nemesis is a good-looking boy who is too cool forwords and seems to enjoy teasing her. The outcome is inevitable.\\n\r\nThe story has comedy and romance (of course) showing how Takumi has taken a liking to Misaki. But Misaki doesn't like him, she actually hates him. But the story develops where in Misaki, bit by bit, falls in love with him. Along the way, the series show how the characters develop as well, and the story has an abundant set of characters. All of them are used until the end of the series, so the story actually has consistency. The story also tackles about future goals in the later part of the series. The animation is quite normal actually. Nothing too bad, nothing too good as well, average. But it properly depicts the story from the manga series.\\n\r\nSo it's actually a really good series all in all, gives you that wonderful essence of romance, along with humorous comedy beside it. And the story is consistent, and it shows the character's development.\\n\r\nI recommend this to all ages. The series is rather easy to follow and understand, so if you are a first time Anime watcher, then I recommend something like this. It's not too complicated, it's not too fancy, but it still has that uniqueness to its story. And it has a romantic-comedy nature so it is very easy to follow.I don`t want to say anything to spoil the show, but in my opinion it is a refreshing change from all the fantastical anime out there because of its realistic setting and characters.",

It is basic and straight forward. Nothing too complex about nor is there anything really boring about it. \r\nIt follows a simplistic storyline about a Student President who works as a Maid for a maid cafe in secret and gets found out by one of the hearthrobs of the school. Simple no? What amazed me about this, is just how muchthey expanded on it. Little bit of action, little of romance and comedy that came in a package tied in a bow. \\n\\n\r\nSure, you may see a repetitive streak of \"chase and save\" from Usui (Male MC) but that's the fun. I say it all the time - The chasing in romance genres is what makes an anime. The wishing and hoping for them to be together, waiting for a knight in shining armor, waiting for the heroine to be swept off her feet and dramatically fall in love. \\n\\n\r\nThroughout the series you see minor development on characters and little to no serious dead beat drama but this isn't the type of anime to suggest it. There really is nothing more to say than, it is fun and thoroughly enjoyable. If you are looking for a serious romance or a serious drama then go watch something else, this anime cannot be taken too seriously or you won't enjoy it.",
