            "content": "Cross Ange is a travesty. It's a horrible, stupid, illogical trainwreck of a show with shoddy production values that relies almost entirely on pandering to the lowest forms of human life and waving shallow moments of shock value all over the screen. The series has a narcissistic sense of self-awareness, and in each episode you can nearly hear a subtle narration by the director and other Sunrise execs laughing at how much of a moron you are for watching this garbage that they've put in front of you.\r\n\"Ha, I bet those glass-eyed imbeciles are getting bored, let's put in another lesbian threesome.\"\r\n\"No, not yet. Onlyafter we show the loli whipping someone again.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it's one of the best things I've seen out of this studio in years. With a big \"Fuck you, Sunrise.\", let's go into this.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is a lot of different things. Cross Ange is a magical princess show about knights and dragons. Cross Ange is a prison drama. Cross Ange is Mean Girls. Cross Ange is borderline yuri hentai. Cross Ange is Gundam Seed. Cross Ange is a catharsis for the type of person who has a Fetlife account. Cross Ange is what would happen if you made a Princess Peach anime starring Ronda Rousey. Cross Ange is proof that not only will Mizuki Nana play any role, but that she is also good at it. Cross Ange is anime madlibs where your only word choices are \"lesbians\", \"dragons\" and \"kill\".\\n\\n\r\nThe actual premise of the story is that a pampered princess named Angelise, a thoroughly awful person, is thrown out of her castle and put in an all-ladies jail when it's found out that she's a fraud. She's then forced to pilot a Gundam and fight dragons, because. And then she's bullied, molested or beaten up a lot, until she finally becomes \"Ange\", the greatest main character to ever appear in a Sunrise mecha show. Then the story becomes about rebellion, alternate timelines and dimensions, fighting god, virtual realities, and uhhhhh... Yeah. The story progresses through a flurry of ridiculous plot twists, comically evil villainous acts, and lesbian sex scenes. It's certainly not boring, but you will hate yourself for watching it. One of my favorite things about this series is what they do with the episode previews, where the characters break the 4th wall and banter about how ridiculous all this shit is.\\n\\n\r\nMy other favorite thing is that there are dragons in this show. But they're not dragons, they're DRAGONs, and they're called that because they're DRAGONs and not because they're dragons.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, the legitimate thing you're watching this for is Ange. Ange is amazing. She's logical, pessimistic, she cheats, she'll insult you and everything you stand for, disarm you and then shoot you through the face, twice. She's so out of the norm for an anime protagonist I can barely deal. She doesn't want harmony, she wants destruction. She wants to demolish everything that's wronged her. She's not a victim. The show is called \"Cross Ange\" because she's cross about 90% of the time. She is the one who knocks.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is surprisingly good too. Cross Ange does a competent job at giving you multifaceted, developing characters to feel things about, even if those feelings are mostly hatred and/or pity. The other central females are almost all emotionally damaged in some way or another, and are in contrast to Ange, very fragile people. I thought this was very interesting, because not only is Ange a strong, domineering, unbreakable character on her own, but those qualities shine even more when you slowly see the deep-seated problems with everyone around her. \\n\\n\r\nThis series only has like two male characters. One of them is Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed, except that he's completely useless and a stooge 90% of the time. If you're ever worried about Ange being overshadowed or saved by her boyfriend, don't worry, he's the bottom in the relationship. This was also refreshing. Except for near the end where he actually starts doing things, that was lame and subverted a lot of the good things about his character and the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major male character is the central villain, Fetus-kun,  who is also the most self-aware jab at otaku I've ever seen. The whole premise of his character is that he's his own OC, and is looking for the perfect waifu. It's insulting and hilarious at the same time, just like the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, Ange looks pretty okay at its best, and pretty bad at its worst. Gundam Unicorn this is not. The character and mech designs are also pretty bland, making the series not seem like anything relevant when looked at out-of-context.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio's good. Nothing to write home about. You get a bunch of Mizuki Nana and stuff. I can't recall much of the BGM at all even though I watch this series week by week. The recurring insert song sung by Ange is pretty memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is a big damn spectacle with one of the best female leads in any anime. It's ridiculous and stupid, and even Sunrise probably hates you for watching it, so that means you should.",

            "content": "The last episode came, many people watched it and at the end one thought was strongly resonating in their brain: \"Why did we underestimate this anime so much?\".  The beginning of this anime may be the biggest hoax in the anime history. Not only it made no sense, but it was like in the middle of night while you were sleeping someone blew up your roof, killed your family and then told you that it was your fault and you should be punished. No sense right? Still, slowly but surely this anime showed that it was a lot more than that. Sometimes  surprisingby the deep philosophical understanding of the human nature, and sometimes using its main card, the fighting, the best way possible. Many could say the entire premise of this anime was to not judge a book by its cover. No mater how ugly it may be, what is inside could be worth thousands of time more than a book with a cover that shines like gold. Anyway, lets do it the normal way: \\n\r\nStory - 9, The story of this anime centers around a girl, Ange a royal princess, who at her coming of age ceremony is shown to be a Norma, a person not considered human in a society where everyone is using mana to control everything around them, thus making life easier. Everything falls into chaos, many sad things happen around her and after that she is sent to Arsenal, no, not the team, but a place where all Norma are disposed of, or so was believed. A lot of whining, hundreds of screams, enough to make you wish she was killed right on the spot. After a few episodes no one would wish the same thing. Not only because her character became a lot more interesting, but because the purpose of Arsenal is becoming clearer.The story becomes more and more complex as time passes so it should be impossible for someone to try to present the story in only a few words. There are betrayals, there is love, there is friendship, sadness,quite a lot of yuri, and we have an awesome antagonist who appears at the right moment. Still, its not like everything was perfect. There are a few blanks in the story, blanks that not only were not explained but it felt like a railway was missing some parts. For better or worse, we were made to forget about this and move on. I don't know if that part is to be explained in a movie, ova or maybe a second season, but it certainly needs one to explain a few missing parts without going back to the plot of the first season. Its the best ending for this anime and I really do not wish for everything to repeat in the same world as before.\\n\r\nNow, after the story comes the art.\\n\r\n Art - 9, Sometimes I wonder, how should we describe art? Some anime have such an ugly art that it would not be a surprise of everyone to hate that anime, but instead there are fans saying it receives a ten just because they feel like it fits. Sadly, I do not have the same opinion. Art is about beauty, about fluidity, about complexity, about impact. This anime excels at most, but some may say they could be even better just because .. . Anyway, every characters, robot, dragon looked awesome. Especially the dragons which didn't try to fit in the same criteria we were used to. Each battle was like a movie. They can make you forget to blink or breath. The only problem was its too fast pace. They moved to fast from one place to another and because of this it became tiresome to try to take in everything and instead were are left with the decision to only concentrate only on a few things forgetting about the rest. \\n\r\nSound - 10, extremely enjoyable. The bgm is very important, but its true role  is to make you feel attracted to the story, which this one did. If a bgm attracts to much attention, be it good or bad, then it failed in its purpose. Some forget about this and rate it poorly or better only based on this. The ost, op, ed and especially the seyuu's are the most important. And all of them are doing their job perfectly.\\n\r\nCharacters - 10, Vivid, strong, beautifully. Each and everyone of them had what you could call charm. Their personalities, feelings, point of view were attractive mostly because there are so many that its impossible to not see at least one that shared your emotions and state of mind. I can say that in my opinion this anime strongest point were the characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9, there is not much to say about this. It was a gem found in the garbage. If you can watch it with an open mind you will not only not regret doing it but you are also going to remember it as one of the most surprising anime in the entire history.\\n\r\nOverall - 9, The story was not perfect, this is clear. A story that is short but also complex can hardly manage what Cross Ange did. Its divergent points were not only large in numbers, but also had its own characters which had to do their job in a way that wouldn't hinder the progress of the story. I'm going to re-watch it later this year for sure. Until then I can only recommend it to anyone who loves anime.",

            "content": "This is possibly one of the most underrated animes from the fall season. \r\nYou can read my overall + my final thoughts/notes at the very bottom of the review if you're feeling lazy and just want some quick feedback on the anime.\r\nI can't lie the first 5 episodes was extremely hard to get through for many which lead to the anime being dropped early on, and also given a poor rating due to its evaluation being solely based off of these first 5 episodes. It is now one of the animes I look forward to watching every week, almost as much as \"Your Lie inApril\". \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, on with the review!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the anime is that of a dystopia, it follows a Princess (Ange) who is stripped of all her rights after being revealed that she is a norma (which are like unwanted humans due to their inability to use \"mana\"). This is one of the weaker points of the anime, although the story isn't bad, it wasn't done correctly for to be anything too special. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't boring in anyway and is fairly interesting, just not above and beyond (hence the 7). \\n\r\nA plus for the anime would be the unexpected twist and turns they have which sometimes really caught me by surprise, they often leave you wondering what may happen in the future. Overall its a decent story, but nothing too amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the art is pretty good the characters, background, \"ragna-mail\", and pretty much everything looks like it was done quite well. The animation is quite fluid and well done, and I honestly have nothing to complain about in this section. The art isn't exceptionally beautiful but it's pretty good, although you can notice the budget slipping in some scenes, but overall the art for all the characters + most of the animation is very crisp.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why you SHOULD watch this anime. The sound track that they have is amazing in my opinion, both their OST and their opening/ending songs. Their use of music is on point for most of the anime, although there were a couple of times I felt that the music could have been used more effectively. I read one of the other reviews saying how the anime's OST + openings/endings were bad, please don't listen to them and give it a chance BECAUSE THE OST IS AMAZING!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nYeah so Ange is possibly one of the most BAD ASS female leads I've seen in a while. She is extremely strong willed and self-righteous and that is the part I love about her. I REALLY like characters that can look strong enough to take on the entire world yet can look really weak and docile the next. The character developments and the revealing of a characters true nature/past is really well done in the anime, although some of the characters story could have had some improvements (cough Embryo).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime, some parts could of had some minor tweeks, but it was a great anime to watch. To those who are able to watch all 25 episodes of this anime at once, I'm really jealous because you won't feel the pain I had to wait for this every week. :'(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI'll repeat this again, I love a strong female lead that can take on the entire world, but in the next second can be really docile, weak and in need of protection and support. Cross Ange is a mecha anime that is really well made, if you look over a few of the poor things that they have done. I promise all you mecha fans that you will thoroughly enjoy the animes OST, great animation, interesting characters and their unique background story (PREPARE A TISSUE BOX WHEN THEY'RE REVEALING SOME OF THE CHARACTERS BACKGROUND). They do quite a few plot twist and a bit of romance in the anime, however little that romance may be. But with respect to the lifestyle transition Ange has been forced to live in, the romance does feels really 'cute'.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE/FINAL THOUGHTS: \\n\\n\r\n-Please understand that this anime DOES contain mature content.\\n\\n\r\n-This anime is definitely one you should give a chance to (please at least give it until episode 6).\\n\\n\r\n-Review may be slightly biased due to my love for mecha animes.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\\n\r\n+Has an amazing OST. Really love their opening and endings + their music choice.\\n\\n\r\n+Ange is possibly one of the best female leads I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\n+Highly recommended for those who enjoy the following genres: Dystopia ,Ecchi, Mecha \\n\\n\r\n+The anime has enough plot twist to constantly surprise you & keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n-Personally I really dislike it when something isn't suppose to happens, not going to say who but when someone is suppose to die, they really should die.\\n\\n\r\n-You may sometimes notice in the animation where the anime was being \"efficient\" with their budget.\\n\\n\r\n-Although their OST is really good, their timing for their background music could use a little work.\\n\\n\r\n-The pacing of the anime is quite good for most of the anime, but some parts could have been slowed down.",

            "content": "To be honest, this was one of the anime I've been looking forward to during the fall season. It looks and sounds interesting but its overall presentation is just so bad.\r\nAs I watched this I realized I saw a lot of plot holes by watching it once. Usually I would watch an anime three times to notice anything but every problem is just so provoking that it's noticeable.\r\nI won't be talking about rape, fanservice, or morality problems as other reviews I've seen have, unless they're problematic in some other way. They're problems in their own right but I'm not one to judge an anime basedoff that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nOn paper, the plot sounds very interesting, enough to drag me in. But the execution is god awful. The problem with Cross Ange is that it tries way too hard and ends up being edgy as hell. There's no coherency because anything it offers is so poorly implicated. The first few episodes were somewhat acceptable but it turns to a lot of illogical dialogue. A few episodes later it plays on a lot high school anime tropes and comedic plays that don't fit the anime's theme. Overall it just doesn't set the tone or setting that it should have. But I've stratched a long and tried to watch it. By the eleventh episodes, I dropped this because of how horribly written it is. At that point it just felt like the creator realized how bad his work and was about to be fired from his job if he didn't do anything good, but he resulted in a cheap product with no good foundation. It has a lot of very interesting concepts but the way it's presented is just so bad.\\n\r\nNow I know I said I wouldn't talk about the fanservice but this is something important. I would be fine if it were used for rape and a prison like environment, but it's used for comedy. It conflicts with the tone and is more annoying than fanservice should be. Only a few anime/manga have been able to be funny and keep a serious story, I.E. Fullmetal Alchemist, but this isn't one of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\r\nI am more critical of art and animation for various reasons, but let's not get into that. The animation is bad to the point where I actually notice the frames. The CG is very straightforward, it's either bad or not. This is bad. It's very out of place and obviously you can notice it. The CG ddoesn't mesh in too well with the background but that's ridiculous because the background when using CG is usually the blue sky.\\n\r\nThe artwork is meh-ish. The designs and concepts arejust so bland and generic. \"Yes let's have a blonde princess like every anime. Whatelse sshould we have?\" \"Oh, I have all these generically designed characters with me.\" Was pretty much what I thought the creator was thinking. The mech designs are pretty stupid. What's with that royal royce on Ange's mech. They try to look cool rather than practical which is something I prefer in mech designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\nI overall hate it. Nothing stood out and I found nothing powerful enough because of how conflictingly unnoticeable it is. That's a fault on Cross Ange itself because of how it can't keep a good atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was average to below. The majority of voices sound so artificial that I can't help but be annoyed. Their voices sound like they're being faked. Like a character faking their voice in a cheesy television show I watched as a kid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThroughout, I have never hated characters so passionately. The characters I do like don't even get screen time. I can't believe how artificial the character development is. The reason is because of the plot contrivances and the lack of solid characterization so that we're given good ideology in the earlier episodes. Any event that provokes development is done so terribly, because there's no foreshadowing nor a natural flow. Everything is planned out like \"IT SHOULD HAPPEN\" rather than \"IT WILL HAPPEN.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nGenerally, I couldn't come to love this because of how boring it is. I would usually watch something for gore regardless of how badly written it is but the gore just feels cheap and needless, because the presentation is just chauvinistically pretentious and overdramatic, and how the atmosphere is wrongly set through every little moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nAt best I think this would be a six but I won't be here to see it get any bette or worse.",

            "content": "\"Are you a fan of anime?\r\nA fan of well-written and intricate plots which leave you completely speechless?\r\nHow about stories which are completely dark and riveting, while completely obscuring the moral boundaries which define human society?\r\nAre you searching for a gem that will change how you view the world and force you to question the value a human life has?\r\nThen look no further - as the masterpiece entitled 'Cross Ange' is the story you've been looking for!\" - said no one ever (at least at the time of writing).\r\nThen do you like Sunrise? (taken both ways, since you'll be seeing a lot of both)\r\nIf you answeredyes, then please read on for this review of a journey filled with much oppai, BDSM, mechas, and made-up words galore!\\n\\n\r\nDo note that I'm an offensive person by nature, so I do apologise for anything further ahead\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe 'Cross Ange' in one single word; I'd have to choose the phrase 'Identity Disorder'. Tabling the fact that that's two words for now - I say this due to the fact that you're presented with an absolutely appalling princess of some generic utopia, who is an idol for the citizens and all their ilk. However, all is not well in genericutopialand as you might expect. This is due to the presence of third-class citizens who are termed as 'Norma'.\\n\\n\r\nNow, these 'Norma', or as luck might have it, sounds similar to the word 'Normal'; and are just normal people, in that they are essentially plebeians like us people here in the real world. Meaning, they can't use magic. They are the minority and are thus prosecuted for some sort of obscure reasons, and are the stigma of humankind's evolution (Not our humankind, but the 'Cross Ange' mankind).\\n\\n\r\nAs this anime was produced by Sunrise, you should expect the obvious trademarks and troupes generic to everything they produce; like strife between a bunch of factions because reasons deem them necessary. You'll also see island episodes, romance, beautiful filial bonds and the long-awaited revival of Kira 'Jesus' Yamato. (Not that you can ever kill him)\\n\\n\r\nThe main character whose name was something along the lines of 'MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi,' is forced to join a ragtag group of girls and fight against dragon-esque creatures, which happen to be called DRAGONs because convoluted acronyms sound cool.\\n\r\nI realize I've digressed, but I'll get to my main point eventually.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, there are a bunch of girls to choose from if you're looking to find a new waifu. For example, early on in the story, you see two girls who try to make friends with MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi, otherwise known as 'Ange'. These two girls are waifu material in that, they make friends with Ange despite her contempt for them. Not only that, they are definitely crucial to the story since they have hair that is feasible for real-life people and don't appear in the opening at all. You've even got your pick of the litter with girls like Ange's friend no. 1 to 50. Top class waifu material if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate, just know that anybody who isn't a Norma is basically a bad person. As for the, rejects of society, they're all either full-blown lesbians or are bi-curious. If you're looking for a male relationship, then you're in awful luck, since there's only three male characters around. The most notable of which is pseudo-RitoKira. As you might expect of anyone who bears resemblance to either of them, he is capable of fixing strange machinery like Gunda- oops, I mean 'Para-Mail'. He is not only capable of being beaten up, but is also capable of living despite having a magnet embedded to his face which attracts him to Ange's crotch.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing much to say about Ange, other than the fact that she seems too good for the show. She's a very likable person for me, but she does seem to suffer from a chronic case of 'falls-in-love-with-king-of-NTR'. At one point, I even worried that he'd steal her position as main character. Luckily, he's as useless as any other harem protagonist. Not in an endearing way though.\\n\\n\r\nI've been ranting too long, so I'll  be brief about my main complaint. The plot. The plot started off simple, and I even considered it pretty decent at one point in time, but it breaks records in my book as the biggest piece of 'what the hell is this? I dont even...'. The plot jumps around so much that it seems to suffers from DID in trying to be so many things a la Samurai Flamenco. \\n\r\nNot only that, I even question what the hell went through the staff of Sunrise's minds when they decided on the premise of Dragons from the Nth dimension fighting robots piloted by the girls of Freezing. Whoever they were, I commend them for absolutely ruining what little remains of my good faith in Sunrise. I'm sure all two of them had fun self-inserting themselves in Tusk's place as he smothered himself in Ange's panties to death.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion; if I'm asked (not that anybody would ask me) if this anime is worth watching.\\n\r\nI'd tell them 'sure, go ahead if you're a fan of kinky stuff'\\n\r\nIf you ask whether it's dark.\\n\r\nSadly the only thing dark here in this anime are the minds of its director, the lighting and the girls panties (in that case, it's be white censorship).\\n\r\nFret not though, since Sunrise will always find a way to shine the morning light of their company on all that darkness through the entity of BD, and Ange's glare-inducing coloured hair.\\n\\n\r\nGood job Sunrise!\\n\r\nDon't give up Sunrise!\\n\r\nGoodwork Sunrise!\\n\r\nLearn to CG Sunrise! (Computer Graphics, not Code Geass)\\n\r\nFarewell Sunrise.\\n\r\nMay you never produce anything better than Code Geass.\\n\r\nCurse you Sunrise!\\n\\n\r\nNote that I'm making fun of them not out of spite, but because they're dear to me.\\n\r\nIt's also for the sake of their own betterment. See, I'm not rude. I'm just Tsundere!\\n\r\nAren't I just a great person? (I know I'm not, but just let me revel in my fantasies)\\n\\n\r\nI'll rewrite or edit this review when I have the time.\\n\r\nI have a lot more to say, but I'll do that another time if need be.\\n\r\nNote that I haven't finished the series yet, so I may change my opinion.",

            "content": "I can say with great confidence that Cross Ange is one of the trashiest, garbage series I have watched in quite a while. Its ridiculous amounts of over the top fan service and emphasis on shock and awe scenes are legitimate lunacy. However, after the travesty that is the first few episodes a compelling story begins to rise from the muck that is Cross Ange and give people a legitmate reason to keep watching besides the fanservice and some some good mecha action. \r\nThe story begins by introducing us to our main heroine Ange, who lives in a world where magic is a used daily,and those without magic are a persecuted group of people called the Norma. Ange is pretty unlikable for the first few episodes,  as she clings to the fact that Normas are inferior, despite the fact that she is revealed to be a Norma herself, apparently not realizing that not using Mana once in your life is a tell tale symptom. From there she is shipped off to a Norma prison island and told that she has to fight DRAGONs to save humanity, why in all caps? Apparently Sunrise thought it looked cool. From there Ange is introduced to the other Norma, who are all young girls, and the fanservice begins, and it's literary ridiculous. There's some weird rapey scenes, lesbian three ways to keep the plot moving, and Ange is naked  for about 60 percent of her on screen time, a trend continues as the series moves on. The first few episodes will test if you are ready for this series, from going for over the top shock affect on issues such as racism, lots of nudity, and little girls getting lopped in half by giant dragons. It is as ridiculous as it sounds, and it sometimes hilarious to watch the over the top nature, and the series seems pretty self aware of just how trashy and bad it is. The cast of side characters initially aren't very important to the plot or are given much attention, besides the leader Salia and the head lesbian Hilda. There is also a guy named Tusk who lives on an island and rescues Ange at some point, and all of their conversations consist of him accidentally bury his head in her crotch or something like that, than Ange shouts \"baka\" and beats the crap out of him. That is basically a summary of that episode. However Tusk shows some interesting characteristics as well as brings up some mysteries about the world of Mana.\\n\\n\r\n The story starts to pick up near the end of the first half, when the narritive shifts from the island back to the mainland, where we are given a lot more depth into Hilda's character that makes her much more likable and understandable, and we once again see how ingrained the fear of the norma is in the people who use Mana. However a large battle breaks out on the Norma battle island, and during this battle we are introduced to the main villain Embryo, whose main attack as well as the other special mechas is powered by song. I wish I was making some of this up, but it seems like Sunrise started throwing crap at a wall until it stuck. The story starts to get more and more interesting after this point, and has some twists and shows us how exactly the earth has ended up in this state and the true nature of the DRAGONs, and some honestly genuine twist regarding the cast of characters and how they have been manipulated by the great Embryo, and seeing how he played off the weaknesses of each girl makes him a cool character to watch. They start throwing a lot of science jargon around during the end that feels like it could be replaced with a recording of Jesse Pinkman saying, \"science bitch\" over and over as it seems like they are just sputtering straight nonsense. Also there is a ridiculous deus ex machina  near the end that left in tears as it tried to explain how a frying pain stopped a bullet and can also apparently save you from falling into a ravine and getting hit by an exploding car, its like they suddenly realized these characters are integral to the plot and has never heard of the no take back rule. But in all honesty, the second half is  a vast improvement and has an interesting plot that can suck you in.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very diverse, with most falling in the categories of being Ange, wanting to bone Ange, or strongly disliking Ange because they want to be her. Ange falls in the being Ange category, and starts off pretty dislikable, but quickly turns into the chosen one who pilots the special mech with great skill and cares deeply for her comrades and friends. Tusk falls into the wanting to bone her category, and is a skilled fighter and nice guy who helps out the Norma and is considered to be Ange's knight, which as a side effect grants invulnerability. Salia is the leader and falls into the hate us because they ain't us category, and is initially a fairly competent leader who keeps a steady head, but is insecure due to the fact that she was not chosen and Ange was. Hilda wants to bone Ange and starts off unlikable, but as she learn more about her and she softens up she is a fairly likable character who goes through some nice development. Embryo wasnt to bone Ange, is the ridiculous Op bad guy with a justified God Complex, and is actually interesting to watch how he toys with others and manipulates them to accomplish his will. i was also impressed with the later development of some of the other side characters, as it really shows what's going through their heads and proves they are more than just boobs and ass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Cross Ange is a train wreck, but is one that you can;t turn away from. It's over the top scenes can make it hilarious, and it seems aware of this fact which is honestly pretty funny. the fan service is up to ridiculous levels, and I would advise if you choose to watch this series do it in a sealed room because if someone walks in on you during some of the more fanservicey scenes you are going to have some explaining to do. The plot really gets going as the show completes it's run, but you have to put up with the trash that is the first few episodes and be able to take a ready helping of fan service. Cross Ange is definitely an experience, and one i would recommend giving a try, even if you can hear cackling Sunrise execs counting their money as you watch the literal crap they put out that somehow turned out to be pretty good. Nest year we'll probably have a mecha series featuring fully naked girls fighting GRIFFINs in space while trying to bring down two gods in a separate dimension, with a healthy dose of lesbian three ways, but that goes without saying.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review is my own opinion, take it for what its worth. I will be breaking this down into the stages MAL uses for rankings as there is a lot to cover with this one. As normal I will do my best not to spoil and keep it to the broad strokes. In addition I will worn you now. Watching this with friends is a no no. YES it is a bit risque, YES there are some very confronting things about this show, but that is not what I am talking about. There are a lot of girls in this one, to the pointwear there are like 4 male characters. And this mas of girls is hot and I mean HOT. I am telling you this now because I will not be held responsible for starting waifu war 4. Why 4? Simple! Because we all know waifu war 3 started when HuniePop was released, get with the times people. Que theme music aaaaaand GO!\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange: Tenshi to so on and so forth is an action, sci-fie, ecchi... ish anime that dose a splendid job of just about everything. It was a masterfully crafted peace from start to finish with only a small handful of what one might call \"glaring\" flows to it, but I don't want to scare you off it so I will leave them until later, like right at the end. For now, I must gush like the fan boy I am.\\n\\n\r\nThis was without question one of the best things I have watched in at least a year. I was  in love with this anime right from the first episode. It was fast paces but was not afraid to slow down the tiniest amount when it wanted you to feel things. It plays with the full gambit of emotions. Love, hate, sorrow and a hole bunch of others I cant seem to name coz well... I'm a guy, but trust me they are there and in spades. Not going to lie, there was a point in time this show jerked a tear out of my eye. Other times I was literally laughing out loud, right before being angry for the same reason. It was like a roller coaster of emotion, not a crazy one but from episode to episode it definitely gets you. Some of the time the feelings are not the sort you should have for animated girls but hey, that's never stopped us before am I right internet? The big kicker to it all though is that its all about the basics of human nature. The need to be in control or how we don't relay function alone. The fact that they tell the story with fuck off robots is just gravy. Ok that may have been a bit of spoils but if you haven't gotten that from the first two eps your likely watching this anime for the wrong reasons. 10 for 10 on enjoyment. Moving on...\\n\\n\r\nThis first thing that hit me about this anime was the outstanding use of colour. I am a devout follower of the high and mighty \"Lord Vivid Colours\" and I can say without a doubt this anime would pleas him. The pallet was vast, all the colours and not just a splash on a brown back drop modern day FSP style. What starts as a peaceful setting drenched in bright pinks, yellows, blues and whites gos down a darker path as the mood of the show changes. The are quickly replaced by blacks, grays and reds but stay with me I am not taking back what I said earlier. It takes an episode or two but the colours return in full force as the disposition of the characters improve and the reality of the world sets in. When the mood is good the colours are bright. When it is bad the pallet changes to reflect it. It is as much a part of the story as anything else and it helps immensely with the fast pacing of the show that there are visual ques like this to help keep the viewer on track. On a less ranty note the art over all was very well done with a lot of sharp lines and easily identifiable shapes, nothing just blended into the back ground. Each peace of furniture and the people on screen were easily recognizable but it very rarely felt cluttered. The distinct lack of copy and paste throughout the show was also very refreshing. 10/10 art  team, well done.\\n\\n\r\nNext down on the list of numbers is the characters. Good ol' characters. You know what? There are lots of them and they are good. Not what you might call amazing but considering the pace of the show (fast as hell), I think they have done really well. Almost everyone has at leas a minor bit of character development no matter how short there life span may be or how close to the main story they are. And on the off chance they don't get developed they are acknowledged strongly enough that you know they are real. No single character feels phoned in and aside from the occasional mob there is no mas melding of opinion, people are always butting heads over something. There are plenty of twists in the development of the main toon pile as well and most of the time it is a bit of a surprise. I say surprise and mean it but occasionally there are some ill timed or even impossible shifts in mood. This is another factor the dev team seemingly utilized in the telling of the story that mostly worked in there favor... mostly. As I mentioned before in my disclaimer there is a lot of girls in this one and it IS a touch ecchi so there was bound to be a good amount of.... let us say lesbianism going around. This is not entirely forced though. On many occasions it is in fact used to make a point about the world they are living in or to legitimately build character. Some times it works quite well as a point puter acrosser, but other times it falls short, and then there are times when it is just strait up fan service. It was unavoidable but it is also mostly good..... 8/10 characters let us move on.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND! Not a lot to say on this one. I am not one to pay much attention to the sound in anime, or anything really. Due to my work I have a gift for hearing when something is wrong but that is about it. With that being said I didn't hear anything wrong as fare as the soundtrack went in this one. The action pacing of it did mean there was always some sort of music going so a lot the background was drowned out but the fight noises were responsive and seemed different enough that they didn't just meld into explosion. Normally this sort of thing would only warrant a 6 or 7 from me but in this case its a solid 8 from the theme music. It just fits. I don't know what the words are in English, I didn't have that sub file, but it sounded right. So 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow the hard sell. Story. I say hard for what seems like a number of reasons, but relay its just one. I found it SUPER hard to pick up and follow over all. It seemed to take forever for the story to kick in and then it would piss off for an episode or two and come back. The hole thing was just so fast paced that each episode up until the last third felt like individual events that some how strung together. It was a simple mater to pick up on the \"foreshadowing\" for me but I cant say if that's because it was obvious or just my veteran status picking up the right bits. I know I have already told you how much I loved the different methods used to tell the story and I do stand by what I said. But telling a story well doesn't make it a good story. The problem being that this IS a good story. It is deep and full of emotion, conflict and real issues that face the human race, though it is a tad embellished (meh its anime). They just over paced it. It felt like they had something truly great in the works.... and then they gave it to Michael Bay. All being said there were no plot holes for me to dig out and the last 8 or so episodes saved it hard. I will be re watching this one down the line, probably after its dubbed, just to see if I can follow it a bit better. It dose have a somewhat \"Blade Runner\" feel to it in that I think I would understand more the second time around. So right now I am going with a soft 6. It was a good story when I could find it and it was told brilliantly and in interesting ways. But I can say it irked me how long it took to kick in and was defiantly not my favorite thing about this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo to cap it all off. Right from the start this show goes hard. Balls to the wall. It's speed setting goes from about 8 up to 11+. It throws things at you constantly in what I assume is an attempt to keep you from following the story 100% but keep you entertained enough to keep watching, and it dos it SO well. All is grand with this show and I would say to all seasoned anime watchers to get on it. On the flip side though, if you are new to the sport of anime watching I would let this one rest till you have a winter or two under your belts. I have been at this game for almost twenty years (that's right I started animes when I was 7), and it took me a bit to latch on to this. I mean, I may just be a dumb ass. Stranger things have been proven true. But as a rule of thumb I find I pick up on things in anime quit well. I stand by the Masterpiece ratting I have given and defy any who think otherwise, but that's what the Internets are for and as I said, personal opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI have been Kergen and you have been reading this review. CONGRATS and go forth to bigger and better anime.",

            "content": "Oh boy this is going to be quite the controversial review to make, The main reason because of how much the show has really made the people who watched it so divided by those who think its good and those who think its bad. Il try to go into detail as to explain what are the pros and cons of this show and maybe dwell why so many people either hate it or dislike it.\r\nThe series is either a hit or a miss\u2026it is a hit because it focuses a lot of how society functions especially towards the discrimination of others which are different andhow they threaten the stability and comfort they already have, as well as what it means to find your own since of individuality and since of moral towards around you, especially of the main heroine who developed from a spoiled, rotten and naive individual into a strong, intelligent, wise and caring leader. \\n\\n\r\nBut it can also be a miss cause of the highly controversial subjects and the extremities of certain scenes as well plot holes and plot armour some of the characters get.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what happened at the studio that produced it but u can practically speculate there was a lot of confusion and divided opinion as to how this show was developed especially towards the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\r\n As a matter of fact if u compare the first 5 or so episodes to the rest of the series, it is like watching two different shows altogether.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation was fantastic at times, especially in the fight scenes but in others the animation looked sloppy and messed up, the soundtrack on the other hand was probably the best thing the show had and the singing of the actors was superb for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the second best thing that the series had, as their development throughout the show was something good to see, especially the main heroine as well as few of the side characters, but they are not perfect as there were a few character flaws that were really obvious or just to clich\u00e9 that sometimes it makes u want to cringe and while the main characters and a few of the side characters did get proper development others were not so lucky in that some of them just simply hid in the background and never got much to say or do at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sec jokes and fan-service might appeal to those who like it and not so much for those who don\u2019t especially since some of the fanservice and jokes were used were so overused and repetitive that it makes u sick to watch after a while.\\n\\n\r\nthankfully these things dropped as the series went on and were not as much frequent as they were in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end I would say this show is either a hit or a miss depending on what a person is actually expecting from this show. There is also that old saying that a show is so bad that it is good and this series would defiantly be a perfect example for that.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: as an enjoyment I would rate it an 8,,, however as a whole series taken into account actually story writing, plot development, animation and characters, flaws and derps I would rate this a 6.75\u2026 as this show really could have been done better\u2026what made it enjoyable despite this was mostly that by the middle of the series the series actually starts to thrive and use it flaws to make it more fun to watch. \\n",

            "content": "I initially got into Cross Ange because of the fanservice and Yuri themes, episode one took me by surprise. It had me hating the main character and enjoying some of the negative things happening to her. However that feeling blew over and soon I started feeling bad for her and enjoying watching her grow, become stronger, and overtake the many obstacles she's had thrown at her. The show also started getting into some of the other main characters, letting a little focus off of Ange, this was also fantastic as the other characters (some you may find yourself hating at first) turn out to bejust as broken as Ange is. This story leads you on some really big emotional rollercoasters, I found myself crying at some scenes before laughing at the next and enjoy the entire experience throughout. This anime can be pretty confusing if you don't pay close attention to detail, but I found myself completely immersed in the story and loving all of the main Characters by the end. Which brings me to my next point, the final episode is very well done and leaves you feeling good. Even though the characters have suffered loss, have been broken down emotionally and physically, and have no doubt been changed, this ending gives you the feeling of \"all is right\" in the world. I've always dreaded endings of anime's because I typically dislike how many of them leave unanswered questions, I typically like to see a \"wrap up\" episode that goes after the \"final battle\" or what-have-you just to leave you on a more warm note as you wrap up the story, but this anime does not need it because it does such a good job on its own over the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime will easily hold one of my top 10 anime's spots for quite a long time and the main character Ange is now easily one of my all time favorite characters. Please give this anime a chance, if you enjoy some fan service paired with an amazing story and characters you'll fall in love with then this is a great choice!",

I honestly never knew these things could elicit such strong emotions, both to characters and the general plot, but now I finally realize what all this is about. For 25 episodes I went on a ride that included great joy, extreme sadness, fantastic music, cool mecha designs, and pretty cartoon women. The entire range of my emotional capacity was tested, and for that reason alone I think Cross Ange is a masterpiece. I only wish there was more!\r\nMy only major complaint lies in the character of God, whose realmotives I never fully grasped. For the first two-thirds of Cross Ange I truly thought he was a neutral observer, only interfering when necessary to steer things on a better path (much like alleged irl gods); but then, his character rapidly changed to a harem-wanting sociopath. The transition was poorly executed in my opinion, without really presenting \"his side\" of the shift. And for a minor complaint, I was ultimately confused about how both women and men weren't...ah...anatomically presented with everything intact. I suppose it's because I'm such a newcomer and I don't understand what is allowed and what isn't, but the lack of certain features was terribly odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of Ange, however, is tremendous. While her arch certainly follows the traditional fall then rise again, it was explored completely and left no doubt as to the why and how. Most Hollywood films don't have this quality of exploration into a character's motives, and it unironically blew me away. \\n\\n\r\nObviously I'm not a season veteran of anime, but I have seen thousands of traditional films and television shows, so at least I have exposure to storytelling: and by that metric, I'm comparing this to the best those fields have to offer.",

            "content": "This show is so horrible I am visibly impressed. Every other reviewer will have commented on the synopsis (or you may have wondered here due to the debate surrounding this show), so I'll skip straight to judgement. \r\nSex, Nudity and the like.\r\nUnlike most other reviewers who rated this show horribly, I do not have (many) problems with the portrayal of nudity, yuri elements and rape in this show. The first episode isn't the problem, it is the structure, backbone and texture of the show which got to me. Also, blatant nudity and/or rape scenes do NOT make a show edgy. Read Punpun if you wanta realistic portrayal of the consequences of abuse. The show sits firmly in the harem/yuri/man-child fantasy genre, and while this does not excuse its portrayal of women, it is reality in anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development.\\n\r\nTl:dr for everything below: don't bother watching this anime for character development, unless you think Guilty Crown was deep. In which case, watch, and ignore this review. You would miss the point I am trying to make and then flame me anyway. \\n\\n\r\nAnge as a character is often praised for having mature and realistic plot development. Her character is viewed as a strong female protagonist, and therein lies the problem. Firstly, I find issue with her character growth. Ange changes from a bigoted, ignorant princess to a tough, independent warrior in the space of six episodes. Throughout the rest of the series, she remains said tough, independent warrior. How in the world is this mature character development? Realistic character development occurs when a character changes so slowly you do not realize the character changed at all. Realistic development is when (spoiler alert for HxH) Gon snaps, and you suddenly realize that Gon's fearlessness and conviction is horrible, not heroic. You will then scroll back to the first episodes of Hunter X Hunter, wondering how this cheerful boy snapped, and you see that the author has been building up Gon's view of the world as black and white since the first episodes. You see the ways Gon ignores advice and is constantly convinced he's right. He's so charismatic that you (and Killua) forgets that Gon is a naive 10 year old boy who will be wrong at some point. Then the understanding dawns on you that Gon (and you) have been taught a lesson in how to behave in the world. (End spoiler for HxH). This does not happen in Cross Ange. How has Ange's character deepened throughout the series? She learns humility. She learns that the world is a horrible place. She learns to make decisions for herself. These messages are explicitly thrown at us, with characters saying them outright, repeating themselves over and over. Ange is shallow enough of a character that you can't portray depth in her, hence the need for the show hammering \"Look! Ange is now developing (insert moral strength here)!\" repeatedly into our brains. So Ange learns humility. Now what? What does she do with it? How is this newly found humility reconciled with her previous arrogance? ( hint: she's still arrogant, only now her arrogance is directed toward the 'evil royal sibling', so it is all okay). So she realizes that the world she knew and had control over is an illusion, easily shattered by a few words and a mana shield cast the the right time. How did she address her helplessness? She became a cold badass warrior (whines in pain as golden opportunity for complex development vanishes). Does she admit that the world is ultimately out of her control? No. Is the world out of her control? No, because she is the protagonist and has the power to change the 'system'. It's certainly a fun trope to watch (remember Lelouch from Code Geass?), but it is hardly realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the claim that she is a strong female protagonist irritates me. Why must a strong female protagonist be a gun-toting, independent sexy female? Why does her fighting her own battles makes her a stronger female character? This is coming from a feminist, so it will be hard to swallow. Skip on to the next paragraph for non-feminist criticism if you don't want to read this. Female protagonists are complicated. Make them into male protagonists with a female body and you have Ange. Make them too weak, and you have a non-existent character. Ange goes too far on the macho route. She is physically superior to most other characters in the show, despite being raised a princess. She is a textbook-tsundere, insulting people while (deep deep deep deep inside) sometimes caring for them. Remember Asuka from Neon Genesis? Ange is Asuka. But with more piloting skill and without the beautiful disintegration of the character near the end. She is the kind of female protagonist that makes me cringe whenever people name her as an example of a strong female character. As much as I wish female characters can be badass and invincible, having a strong female protagonist is more than toughness. It is understanding female limitations. It is realizing that we are fundamentally different from men, and embracing those differences. It is about portraying us as people, rather than as a sexualized, 'I will never cry' masculine female. We see none of this in Ange. \\n\\n\r\nSo Bad It's Good:\\n\r\nI honestly think the author is making a parody with this. The humor and self depreciation that runs through the show makes it better than shows like Guilty Crown, which are inherently horrible AND take themselves altogether too seriously. The author frequently injects moments that keeps me watching until the end because I am half convinced that he/she is making fun of the audience. Take the last episode, for example. (spoiler alert) What self respecting show will have the female lead shout \" I won't let you have me, you lecherous man!\" while slicing apart the main villain? Also, the villain's main goal being 'I want beautiful independent women' is so ridiculous I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the second arc of the show. How about the younger sister going around with a whip? What the hell is happening? (End spoilers). If the anime had wanted edgy, they would have gone the Elfen Lied route, also known as 'killing puppies' induced feels. It feels like the writers started writing this god awful script, and some drunk guy at a party decided to challenge the writers to put the most ridiculous things they could get away with into the script without alerting the audience to the game. Honestly, it is entertaining. But so are many many other anime without the horrible eechi and yuri elements. \\n\\n\r\nComplex Themes ( 1/10 i.e.: What themes? There were themes?!)\\n\r\nRather than rant about the complete lack of \"complex themes\" within this anime, I'll provide examples of other anime where they were executed properly, and you can judge for yourself how well this anime deals with themes.\\n\\n\r\nRape to break the character's will: I'll give this one to Cross Ange, although honestly, the shock value trumps the emotional reward its resolution brings. I've already elaborated on how horribly Ange grows as a character, and this scene is mainly so we feel sorry for the main character. Also you cannot bring in \"realism\" and then have crazy things happening. It does not work that way. The prefect way to communicate dread and agony through abuse is perfectly done in Punpun, not in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nManipulation by powers that be/Discrimination: Watch Shinsekai Yori. That show does not need to use a well loved princess to prove that a certain race can be bred to hate another. You will viscerally feel the hate, I promise. Bonus: yuri scenes in Shinsekai, yay! Psycho pass can be another, though Shinsekai pulls it off better.\\n\\n\r\nClear communication/need for understanding: This. Good lord. Neon Genesis Evangelion dedicates about 99% of the show to demonstrate that clear communication between actual human beings is impossible. Clear communication is impossible. That is a fact we have to work around, not emphasize that ' if we could all just talk to one another properly, it will be fine!'. That is why relationships are messy and friends end up killing one another. Talking to one another will not solve the problem. Talking to one another while wielding giant robots definitely will not solve the problem. Stop telling me it would, baka anime! \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nWarning, do not watch. You will waste about 13 hours of your life watching while clutching your head, and a further four hours typing up a review so you can forever expel the anime from your head. \\n",

            "content": "Simply put, Cross Ange is a masterpiece in my eyes. Many will say \"But Ruggarell, just HOW? CROSS ANGE? MASTERPIECE? WHAT?\". Let me explain.\r\nBefore Cross Ange aired last year, I saw it on the upcoming list of Anime that was coming out in the fall and being a fan of Ecchi it seemed like it would have a decent amount, so I gave it a go. I thought that I would have most likely would have dropped it anyway if the Ecchi segments weren't strong, but boy I got something entirely different. From the first 15 minutes of the Anime, it was blowing my mind.The world that Cross Ange was set in was not indeed an equal or fair one.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st episode of Cross Ange made or broke the entire show for a lot of people but I was one of the few ones who kept going because of how exciting it was. Ange, the Main character, was the daughter of a very wealthy family and pretty much lived a comfortable lifestyle you see. Most of the world used magic as an everyday thing. Those who couldn't were seen as outsiders and thus rejected from society in very unpleasant ways that you will have to watch to find out. Ange, the MC was accused of being an outsider for not being able to use magic(Called normas), and thus sent to a prison. \\n\\n\r\nThe 1st episode of Cross Ange was so well executed and so well made that I never missed a single week of the Anime. Each week had me on the edge of my seat waiting for something insane to happen and oh boy it did each and every week. You will have to watch for yourself. The character personalities are just so good and diverse that you will end up loving(or hating) many characters. The story is just so well paced that I couldn't possibly find anything wrong at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to write a list of every Anime that aired in 2014-2015 and someone asked me which one I loved the most, it would be Cross Ange. It's an Anime I will love forever because of how each episode was so well made. The story never let up at all. The director and writers always wanted you to be scared of what will happen next. It also had some dark humor in between as well that reminded you of the world that Ange lived in. Along the way she meets very crazy characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly wish that I could watch Cross Ange all over again for the first time because of how insane it is.  You might possibly cry and become depressed because there aren't anymore episodes to enjoy. I know I did. I loved the characters that much.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Sunrise thank you so so much for yet another masterpiece. Here is hoping for a Cross Ange 2.",

            "content": "Thirteen years ago, Fukuda Mitsuo was a name that became taboo across the lips of Gundam lovers far and wide for his hand in the creation of Gundam Seed Destiny and the much-maligned character of Shinn Asuka. Ten years on, he creates Cross Ange, a work with many underlying similarities to Destiny, however, infinitely superior due to certain tweaks and adjustments. Cross Ange centres around Ange, a royal princess who at her coming of age ceremony is uncovered to be a Norma, a term for those who cannot use magic and are treated as monsters by society. At its fundamental core, it explores the ideaof a character redefining their perception of humanity as well as following a girl whom has lost everything that she once had and has to rediscover her identity and purpose in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs an audience diving into the first episode of Cross Ange I can say I remained hopeful but unimpressed. The pacing was rushed, the animation quality inconsistent and the characters felt like a cheap ripoff from Code Geass with an unnecessary sprinkling of fanservice. So many fundamental principles of storytelling were broken in that first episode and the show looked destined to be a trainwreck. Glimpses of rough-cut quality were buried underneath a shockingly paced series of events and an obnoxious protagonist whom reflected the deep-cut nature of racism and bigotry within this dystopian society. However buoyed by the positive things I had heard about Cross Ange, I plowed on. The story writing did not improve. Ridiculous plot twists were tossed around and used at ten times the frequency of a typical Sunrise anime. Whenever there was downtime in the fighting, yuri action littered the story as if to forcefully entertain its audience. The plot went through all sorts of nonsensical ridiculousness from dragons to alternate dimeonsions and fighting an immortal god. In writing it is not possible to make the plot of Cross Ange sound palatable. However, this is an extremely rare example where the sum of the parts far exceeded my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I have to digress that not everything about the writing is a travesty. The willingness that Cross Ange expresses in killing of characters is extremely refreshing and provides a genuine sense of urgency and risk to every single scene. Contrasting this to the last mecha show I watched, Darling in the Franxx, is night and day since that anime collapsed under the weight of a lengthy cast that received neither sufficient character development to make a difference, nor suffered any casualties to fish for some cheap feels.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, a huge part of the reason why this anime succeeds is because of its self-awareness. The fourth wall is broken on a frequent basis and as the show continues, it becomes clear that the writers understand that the writing is atrocious to say the least. The show degenerates into self-mockery to the point where as a viewer, it is not possible to treat the story seriously any more. And once that point is understood, Cross Ange truly blooms into a marvellous form of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the writing of Cross Ange never truly improved, there is one thing that Cross Ange did better than any other anime I have ever watched. And that is the manner it was able to believably transform an arrogant pampered princess with a thoroughly condescending attitude into the greatest protagonist in animated history. People often say \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d. Ange is an amazing character like none other and the enormous amount of character development that she undergoes through the course of the entire show is what makes it so sweet. Her surrounding cast is similarly developed far beyond the simple cliched shells that they wore at the beginning of the show into multifaceted characters who evoke powerful emotions in the audience by themselves. On the other hand, the final villain feels like the director\u2019s self-insert as an otaku fan and has truly laughably questionable motivations for wishing to destroy the world. However, the show understands its own farcical nature and makes plenty of self-aware jokes at the antagonist\u2019s expense.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, what truly makes Cross Ange great, is the manner in which the fundamental principles which underline the show are developed and expressed. Despite the mortifying storytelling and writing, Cross Ange expresses masterful control over the themes of racism and information control, prompting all of us to ask ourselves the age-old question of \u201cwhat is human?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is about accompanying Ange every step of the way as she seeks to answer this question herself in a brutal world filled with the most nonsensical of plot devices, and fighting against her own destiny. Ten years on from the completion of Gundam Seed Destiny, Fukuda has truly redeemed himself to the mecha genre with a protagonist as good as any in the business, resulting in the best show Sunrise has made since the turn of the decade.\\n",

            "content": "*May contain minor spoilers\r\nCross Ange is one really good anime that alot of people dropped cuz of the first 4 episodes and i think its not fair to dislike it because of that i hated it as well even though opinions swayed me into thinking that i got around to watching it and i was really interested....it def isn't for everyone its kind of all over the place though.\r\nStory- very good to say the least once it hits episodes 5 and onwards it really depends on your preference the early part will make you dislike the main character like to the point where you wannasee her die but she grows on you overtime and you eventually take a liking to her well i did at least. You can read the synopsis on it for the plot of the story, but without spoiling i will say its a journey to say the least. Mecha is a big part in this anime along with the sci-fi aspect alot of fanservice and gruesome scenes, singing is also a big part of the anime its not like its everywhere but its because it has to do story and fits in but it seems kinda dumb to be really honest but that aside a very good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt- it's good but theres times when you can see that the animations seem kinda laggy like it had frame issues but its really rare the first episode has an audio issue idk if its where im watching from but other sites had the same issue with cross anges first episode. Another thing i didnt like about the art style was the delayed speaking animations what i mean is i mentioned singing is a big part already but some of the scenes while there singing the character's mouth isnt moving at the proper time so it looks off but it sounds great. Other than that No complaints. Mecha looks very well done as well. Other then few inconsistencies i thought the art and animation looked good\\n\\n\r\nSound- Great i liked the first half of the series op and ending not so much the second half but the battle themes are great sometimes. There are moments when a random song doesnt fit into the fight scene like imagine a crazy battle mecha style and then hearing i sad song in the heat of the fight when nothing bad has happend thats what some scenes felt like in cross ange and i wish they removed it while editing the show if they did. Character songs are good some sound angelic honestly why i was so attracted to alot of the scenes and had to rewind if i just wanted to hear it again its that good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Variety of characters although many dont get through by the end of the series they are likeable for what they are as you get deeper into the anime theres a few characters that will grow on you the main character grew on me and a few side characters and 2 other main characters. But im here to tell you cross ange is one of the best ive seen in its 2014-2015 run to me and anime when it comes to main character development i mean it was like you really noticed it and thats what i really loved a minor spoiler ima throw your way not really about the characters themselves but the main character has about 3 character changes in personality and attitude from beginning to end and a few other characters also had more than 1 character change. Although not all the characters are all that loveable the development you get is an easy 9/10 it was really well done even with the anime cliches with hero and villains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 i dont really watch all that mecha anime to be brutally honest ive seen about 5 and aside from code geass. Cross ange slips into my number two and onto my all time favourite anime list when i look back. Character development is top notch, Good story although the fanservice was overkill sometimes im an ecchi lover so it didnt bother me but its not in the ecchi genre yet it had a ton of fanservice moments, visually looked good not great, Great battle songs & character songs as well as the op and end from the 1-12 ep mark and i really just liked it. It goes 24 episodes nothing really seems rushed besides the last episode i guess.....other than that the pacing is well done it was really great i wish more people would give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 id say more so an 8.5 but lets not muddy things up here.\\n\\n\r\nLikes/Dislikes-  Likes: Music, Art, Story, some of the fanservice, main character and few side characters, \\n\\n\r\nDislikes- Short pure fight scene, Too much fanservice, Random events, delayed animations (barely any), Petty highschool girl bullying stuff, Disturbing yuri/ecchi  fanservice scenes and disturbing sexual fanservice scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading a reuploaded final copy review of my thoughts on the series.\\n\\n\\n",

Never have I watched an anime where the characters seem to have more than one dimensional thinking and actually developed like decent human beings.\r\nStory? 10/10 \r\nLoved the unique storyline. It put a real twist on mecha series.\r\nArt? 9/10\r\nI thought the art was amazing at times. Animation was also great with fluid motions. Only downfall was some budgetedanimation where background trees, buildings, and people looked like potatoes but all is well. Some action scenes were cookie cutted from episode to episode but what mecha doesn't do that??\\n\\n\r\nCharacter? 11/10 (if only) \\n\r\nI thought the characters were amazing. Each one had their own story. Each one had their own personality. They weren't stuck with one attitude. It actually felt like they had human minds with human emotions. Development was overall fantastic.",

            "content": "Hey guys! This is my very first review so I hope it being long doesn't bother you guys too much but I'll try my best to explain each category and why I absoutely loved this show. I'm not really into mecha, but ironically Code Geass is one of my favorite shows of all time. A few days ago, I stumbled upon Cross Ange and the first thing that caught me was the female lead, no not in a sexual way, what I meant was it's refreshing to see a main female lead, especially in action shows. So I decided to watch (binge watched the wholeday for maximum experience) without really expecting anything, and by the time the show was finished, I just had to write a review.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the review...\\n\\n\r\nStory: Not the most original concept of stories but the way the plot revolved around its own universe was really thrilling. The world revolved around magic called \"Mana\" and people who can't use it are discriminated. That's story revolves around Ange, our blonde main female lead, who is the First Princess of her own country and how she copes with the world they are in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, nothing is really special about the art, but it does look great although the quality of the animation isn't very consistent. One thing that's very obivous is the CGI for this show, especially the mecha animations which honestly isn't the best looking, but then it's not just about the mechas, it's more on the story that drove me to look past it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Why an 8? The OP is amazing, it's upbeat and thrilling to hear, fitting for an action anime  and is sung by Nana Mizuki, also the VA for Ange. Cross Ange has a lot of quality VAs, and I'm not gonna list each and everyone of them, but what captivated me the most are the songs sung by our quality VAs like Yui Horie and Nana Mizuki. The show DOES use singing during the action scenes but you'll understand if you watch why. The EDs were pretty forgettable though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh boy, I don't know whether to hate or love the characters but, mainly Ange's  team or \"harem\" as people like to call it. Ange, the main character, has one of the most amazing developments in any anime I have ever seen and her character was consistent to the very end. She starts out as a bitchy, arrogant princess but she slowly turns into one very fitting of a 'hero'. The supporting charscters are what baffled me because some of them do have great development, like Hilda, I swear she is easily  one of the best characters out of the show or any anime at least. However the other characters pretty much zigzagged throughout the show. Like their traits, motives are unexplained and such. But still that's just a minor problem that does not really bother the show unless you like nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not gonna lie here, this show is one of my favorite shows of all time, and one of the reasons why I enjoyed it is the fanservice. Yes, this show has fanservice dating back even to the very first one. I know this show isn't very well received and a lot have dropped it in 2 episodes only since they saw how shameless the fanservice was or what a \"trainwreck\" this will be, however, I was not deterred by the early fanservice, and I loved the yuri antics throughout, yes YURI. So, why is fanservice a good factor for the enjoyment? Because it's shameless! It doesn't hide this or that and isn't afraid to show scenes happening and we all know half-assed fanservice is very annoying. But the fanservice alone isn't the only thing that captivated me, the way the story presented all throughout, the hardships of Ange and her team to the very end is what made this show memorable and lovable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Every show has its flaws and Cross Ange is no different, but of course nothing is perfect. This show easily gets a 9 because it knows what it is and it doesn't hide that fact. If you enjoy a good story with great character interaction with fanservice thrown here and there, then you're in for a thrilling ride. If you are one of those people that tend to nitpick each and every small detail of flaws or mistake and expect a lot, then don't bother. However, I do highly suggest you give this show a chance.\\n\\n",

If i could watch the whole series in a day i would definitely do it. This anime is the absolute ecchi,mecha, sci-fi experience which every fan of this genres would enjoy it the most but let's be more specific \r\nStory: well the main character of this anime is a teenage girl named Angelise. She lives in a world that lives by using \"mana\"\r\nEverything is only controlable by this kind of magic. But some girls can't useit and they are known by society as \"Norma\". They are hated by everyone and all calls them monsters. (Anyway it's not bad to be different but it's something extra ordinary) The police which caught these girls sent them to a secret location known to the 5% of the humaniy as Arzenal. These girls are sentenced to spent their life there and fight the D.R.A.G.O.N.s as they called in some kind of planes-spaceships-unifoms\\n\r\nArt: The art i can say that it's absolutely stunning. Everything is well animated and fascinating \\n\r\nCharacters: hmm the characters are at a 98% girls and each of her has her own interesting story \\n\r\nSound: the sound is the best part of this series with Nana Mizuki singing the opening will keep your ears pleased in every single second \\n\r\nEnjoyment : well I'm not a mecha-science-fiction anime fan but i can say that i really enjoyed this anime series. Do not let the ecchi scenes take you away from the main plot. Of course it will have ecchi scenes cause it's based to a group of girls. If you are interested to something new and awesome you will definitely love this anime and i believe it deserves a 1000+ ranking (but that's only my opinion \\n\\n",

            "content": "Cross Ange is a travesty. It's a horrible, stupid, illogical trainwreck of a show with shoddy production values that relies almost entirely on pandering to the lowest forms of human life and waving shallow moments of shock value all over the screen. The series has a narcissistic sense of self-awareness, and in each episode you can nearly hear a subtle narration by the director and other Sunrise execs laughing at how much of a moron you are for watching this garbage that they've put in front of you.\r\n\"Ha, I bet those glass-eyed imbeciles are getting bored, let's put in another lesbian threesome.\"\r\n\"No, not yet. Onlyafter we show the loli whipping someone again.\"\\n\\n\r\nThat said, it's one of the best things I've seen out of this studio in years. With a big \"Fuck you, Sunrise.\", let's go into this.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is a lot of different things. Cross Ange is a magical princess show about knights and dragons. Cross Ange is a prison drama. Cross Ange is Mean Girls. Cross Ange is borderline yuri hentai. Cross Ange is Gundam Seed. Cross Ange is a catharsis for the type of person who has a Fetlife account. Cross Ange is what would happen if you made a Princess Peach anime starring Ronda Rousey. Cross Ange is proof that not only will Mizuki Nana play any role, but that she is also good at it. Cross Ange is anime madlibs where your only word choices are \"lesbians\", \"dragons\" and \"kill\".\\n\\n\r\nThe actual premise of the story is that a pampered princess named Angelise, a thoroughly awful person, is thrown out of her castle and put in an all-ladies jail when it's found out that she's a fraud. She's then forced to pilot a Gundam and fight dragons, because. And then she's bullied, molested or beaten up a lot, until she finally becomes \"Ange\", the greatest main character to ever appear in a Sunrise mecha show. Then the story becomes about rebellion, alternate timelines and dimensions, fighting god, virtual realities, and uhhhhh... Yeah. The story progresses through a flurry of ridiculous plot twists, comically evil villainous acts, and lesbian sex scenes. It's certainly not boring, but you will hate yourself for watching it. One of my favorite things about this series is what they do with the episode previews, where the characters break the 4th wall and banter about how ridiculous all this shit is.\\n\\n\r\nMy other favorite thing is that there are dragons in this show. But they're not dragons, they're DRAGONs, and they're called that because they're DRAGONs and not because they're dragons.\\n\\n\r\nBut really, the legitimate thing you're watching this for is Ange. Ange is amazing. She's logical, pessimistic, she cheats, she'll insult you and everything you stand for, disarm you and then shoot you through the face, twice. She's so out of the norm for an anime protagonist I can barely deal. She doesn't want harmony, she wants destruction. She wants to demolish everything that's wronged her. She's not a victim. The show is called \"Cross Ange\" because she's cross about 90% of the time. She is the one who knocks.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is surprisingly good too. Cross Ange does a competent job at giving you multifaceted, developing characters to feel things about, even if those feelings are mostly hatred and/or pity. The other central females are almost all emotionally damaged in some way or another, and are in contrast to Ange, very fragile people. I thought this was very interesting, because not only is Ange a strong, domineering, unbreakable character on her own, but those qualities shine even more when you slowly see the deep-seated problems with everyone around her. \\n\\n\r\nThis series only has like two male characters. One of them is Kira Yamato from Gundam Seed, except that he's completely useless and a stooge 90% of the time. If you're ever worried about Ange being overshadowed or saved by her boyfriend, don't worry, he's the bottom in the relationship. This was also refreshing. Except for near the end where he actually starts doing things, that was lame and subverted a lot of the good things about his character and the show as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe other major male character is the central villain, Fetus-kun,  who is also the most self-aware jab at otaku I've ever seen. The whole premise of his character is that he's his own OC, and is looking for the perfect waifu. It's insulting and hilarious at the same time, just like the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation-wise, Ange looks pretty okay at its best, and pretty bad at its worst. Gundam Unicorn this is not. The character and mech designs are also pretty bland, making the series not seem like anything relevant when looked at out-of-context.\\n\\n\r\nThe audio's good. Nothing to write home about. You get a bunch of Mizuki Nana and stuff. I can't recall much of the BGM at all even though I watch this series week by week. The recurring insert song sung by Ange is pretty memorable.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is a big damn spectacle with one of the best female leads in any anime. It's ridiculous and stupid, and even Sunrise probably hates you for watching it, so that means you should.",

            "content": "The last episode came, many people watched it and at the end one thought was strongly resonating in their brain: \"Why did we underestimate this anime so much?\".  The beginning of this anime may be the biggest hoax in the anime history. Not only it made no sense, but it was like in the middle of night while you were sleeping someone blew up your roof, killed your family and then told you that it was your fault and you should be punished. No sense right? Still, slowly but surely this anime showed that it was a lot more than that. Sometimes  surprisingby the deep philosophical understanding of the human nature, and sometimes using its main card, the fighting, the best way possible. Many could say the entire premise of this anime was to not judge a book by its cover. No mater how ugly it may be, what is inside could be worth thousands of time more than a book with a cover that shines like gold. Anyway, lets do it the normal way: \\n\r\nStory - 9, The story of this anime centers around a girl, Ange a royal princess, who at her coming of age ceremony is shown to be a Norma, a person not considered human in a society where everyone is using mana to control everything around them, thus making life easier. Everything falls into chaos, many sad things happen around her and after that she is sent to Arsenal, no, not the team, but a place where all Norma are disposed of, or so was believed. A lot of whining, hundreds of screams, enough to make you wish she was killed right on the spot. After a few episodes no one would wish the same thing. Not only because her character became a lot more interesting, but because the purpose of Arsenal is becoming clearer.The story becomes more and more complex as time passes so it should be impossible for someone to try to present the story in only a few words. There are betrayals, there is love, there is friendship, sadness,quite a lot of yuri, and we have an awesome antagonist who appears at the right moment. Still, its not like everything was perfect. There are a few blanks in the story, blanks that not only were not explained but it felt like a railway was missing some parts. For better or worse, we were made to forget about this and move on. I don't know if that part is to be explained in a movie, ova or maybe a second season, but it certainly needs one to explain a few missing parts without going back to the plot of the first season. Its the best ending for this anime and I really do not wish for everything to repeat in the same world as before.\\n\r\nNow, after the story comes the art.\\n\r\n Art - 9, Sometimes I wonder, how should we describe art? Some anime have such an ugly art that it would not be a surprise of everyone to hate that anime, but instead there are fans saying it receives a ten just because they feel like it fits. Sadly, I do not have the same opinion. Art is about beauty, about fluidity, about complexity, about impact. This anime excels at most, but some may say they could be even better just because .. . Anyway, every characters, robot, dragon looked awesome. Especially the dragons which didn't try to fit in the same criteria we were used to. Each battle was like a movie. They can make you forget to blink or breath. The only problem was its too fast pace. They moved to fast from one place to another and because of this it became tiresome to try to take in everything and instead were are left with the decision to only concentrate only on a few things forgetting about the rest. \\n\r\nSound - 10, extremely enjoyable. The bgm is very important, but its true role  is to make you feel attracted to the story, which this one did. If a bgm attracts to much attention, be it good or bad, then it failed in its purpose. Some forget about this and rate it poorly or better only based on this. The ost, op, ed and especially the seyuu's are the most important. And all of them are doing their job perfectly.\\n\r\nCharacters - 10, Vivid, strong, beautifully. Each and everyone of them had what you could call charm. Their personalities, feelings, point of view were attractive mostly because there are so many that its impossible to not see at least one that shared your emotions and state of mind. I can say that in my opinion this anime strongest point were the characters.\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 9, there is not much to say about this. It was a gem found in the garbage. If you can watch it with an open mind you will not only not regret doing it but you are also going to remember it as one of the most surprising anime in the entire history.\\n\r\nOverall - 9, The story was not perfect, this is clear. A story that is short but also complex can hardly manage what Cross Ange did. Its divergent points were not only large in numbers, but also had its own characters which had to do their job in a way that wouldn't hinder the progress of the story. I'm going to re-watch it later this year for sure. Until then I can only recommend it to anyone who loves anime.",

            "content": "This is possibly one of the most underrated animes from the fall season. \r\nYou can read my overall + my final thoughts/notes at the very bottom of the review if you're feeling lazy and just want some quick feedback on the anime.\r\nI can't lie the first 5 episodes was extremely hard to get through for many which lead to the anime being dropped early on, and also given a poor rating due to its evaluation being solely based off of these first 5 episodes. It is now one of the animes I look forward to watching every week, almost as much as \"Your Lie inApril\". \\n\\n\r\nAnyways, on with the review!\\n\\n\r\nStory: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe setting of the anime is that of a dystopia, it follows a Princess (Ange) who is stripped of all her rights after being revealed that she is a norma (which are like unwanted humans due to their inability to use \"mana\"). This is one of the weaker points of the anime, although the story isn't bad, it wasn't done correctly for to be anything too special. Don't get me wrong, the story isn't boring in anyway and is fairly interesting, just not above and beyond (hence the 7). \\n\r\nA plus for the anime would be the unexpected twist and turns they have which sometimes really caught me by surprise, they often leave you wondering what may happen in the future. Overall its a decent story, but nothing too amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\\n\r\nHonestly the art is pretty good the characters, background, \"ragna-mail\", and pretty much everything looks like it was done quite well. The animation is quite fluid and well done, and I honestly have nothing to complain about in this section. The art isn't exceptionally beautiful but it's pretty good, although you can notice the budget slipping in some scenes, but overall the art for all the characters + most of the animation is very crisp.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9\\n\\n\r\nOne of the reasons why you SHOULD watch this anime. The sound track that they have is amazing in my opinion, both their OST and their opening/ending songs. Their use of music is on point for most of the anime, although there were a couple of times I felt that the music could have been used more effectively. I read one of the other reviews saying how the anime's OST + openings/endings were bad, please don't listen to them and give it a chance BECAUSE THE OST IS AMAZING!\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nYeah so Ange is possibly one of the most BAD ASS female leads I've seen in a while. She is extremely strong willed and self-righteous and that is the part I love about her. I REALLY like characters that can look strong enough to take on the entire world yet can look really weak and docile the next. The character developments and the revealing of a characters true nature/past is really well done in the anime, although some of the characters story could have had some improvements (cough Embryo).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI can honestly say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this anime, some parts could of had some minor tweeks, but it was a great anime to watch. To those who are able to watch all 25 episodes of this anime at once, I'm really jealous because you won't feel the pain I had to wait for this every week. :'(\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\\n\r\nI'll repeat this again, I love a strong female lead that can take on the entire world, but in the next second can be really docile, weak and in need of protection and support. Cross Ange is a mecha anime that is really well made, if you look over a few of the poor things that they have done. I promise all you mecha fans that you will thoroughly enjoy the animes OST, great animation, interesting characters and their unique background story (PREPARE A TISSUE BOX WHEN THEY'RE REVEALING SOME OF THE CHARACTERS BACKGROUND). They do quite a few plot twist and a bit of romance in the anime, however little that romance may be. But with respect to the lifestyle transition Ange has been forced to live in, the romance does feels really 'cute'.\\n\\n\r\nNOTE/FINAL THOUGHTS: \\n\\n\r\n-Please understand that this anime DOES contain mature content.\\n\\n\r\n-This anime is definitely one you should give a chance to (please at least give it until episode 6).\\n\\n\r\n-Review may be slightly biased due to my love for mecha animes.\\n\\n\r\nPROS:\\n\\n\r\n+Has an amazing OST. Really love their opening and endings + their music choice.\\n\\n\r\n+Ange is possibly one of the best female leads I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\n+Highly recommended for those who enjoy the following genres: Dystopia ,Ecchi, Mecha \\n\\n\r\n+The anime has enough plot twist to constantly surprise you & keep you interested.\\n\\n\r\nCONS:\\n\\n\r\n-Personally I really dislike it when something isn't suppose to happens, not going to say who but when someone is suppose to die, they really should die.\\n\\n\r\n-You may sometimes notice in the animation where the anime was being \"efficient\" with their budget.\\n\\n\r\n-Although their OST is really good, their timing for their background music could use a little work.\\n\\n\r\n-The pacing of the anime is quite good for most of the anime, but some parts could have been slowed down.",

            "content": "To be honest, this was one of the anime I've been looking forward to during the fall season. It looks and sounds interesting but its overall presentation is just so bad.\r\nAs I watched this I realized I saw a lot of plot holes by watching it once. Usually I would watch an anime three times to notice anything but every problem is just so provoking that it's noticeable.\r\nI won't be talking about rape, fanservice, or morality problems as other reviews I've seen have, unless they're problematic in some other way. They're problems in their own right but I'm not one to judge an anime basedoff that.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 2/10\\n\r\nOn paper, the plot sounds very interesting, enough to drag me in. But the execution is god awful. The problem with Cross Ange is that it tries way too hard and ends up being edgy as hell. There's no coherency because anything it offers is so poorly implicated. The first few episodes were somewhat acceptable but it turns to a lot of illogical dialogue. A few episodes later it plays on a lot high school anime tropes and comedic plays that don't fit the anime's theme. Overall it just doesn't set the tone or setting that it should have. But I've stratched a long and tried to watch it. By the eleventh episodes, I dropped this because of how horribly written it is. At that point it just felt like the creator realized how bad his work and was about to be fired from his job if he didn't do anything good, but he resulted in a cheap product with no good foundation. It has a lot of very interesting concepts but the way it's presented is just so bad.\\n\r\nNow I know I said I wouldn't talk about the fanservice but this is something important. I would be fine if it were used for rape and a prison like environment, but it's used for comedy. It conflicts with the tone and is more annoying than fanservice should be. Only a few anime/manga have been able to be funny and keep a serious story, I.E. Fullmetal Alchemist, but this isn't one of them.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 1/10\\n\r\nI am more critical of art and animation for various reasons, but let's not get into that. The animation is bad to the point where I actually notice the frames. The CG is very straightforward, it's either bad or not. This is bad. It's very out of place and obviously you can notice it. The CG ddoesn't mesh in too well with the background but that's ridiculous because the background when using CG is usually the blue sky.\\n\r\nThe artwork is meh-ish. The designs and concepts arejust so bland and generic. \"Yes let's have a blonde princess like every anime. Whatelse sshould we have?\" \"Oh, I have all these generically designed characters with me.\" Was pretty much what I thought the creator was thinking. The mech designs are pretty stupid. What's with that royal royce on Ange's mech. They try to look cool rather than practical which is something I prefer in mech designs.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 2/10\\n\r\nI overall hate it. Nothing stood out and I found nothing powerful enough because of how conflictingly unnoticeable it is. That's a fault on Cross Ange itself because of how it can't keep a good atmosphere.\\n\r\nThe voice acting was average to below. The majority of voices sound so artificial that I can't help but be annoyed. Their voices sound like they're being faked. Like a character faking their voice in a cheesy television show I watched as a kid.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 1/10\\n\r\nThroughout, I have never hated characters so passionately. The characters I do like don't even get screen time. I can't believe how artificial the character development is. The reason is because of the plot contrivances and the lack of solid characterization so that we're given good ideology in the earlier episodes. Any event that provokes development is done so terribly, because there's no foreshadowing nor a natural flow. Everything is planned out like \"IT SHOULD HAPPEN\" rather than \"IT WILL HAPPEN.\"\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 1/10\\n\r\nGenerally, I couldn't come to love this because of how boring it is. I would usually watch something for gore regardless of how badly written it is but the gore just feels cheap and needless, because the presentation is just chauvinistically pretentious and overdramatic, and how the atmosphere is wrongly set through every little moment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 2/10\\n\r\nAt best I think this would be a six but I won't be here to see it get any bette or worse.",

            "content": "\"Are you a fan of anime?\r\nA fan of well-written and intricate plots which leave you completely speechless?\r\nHow about stories which are completely dark and riveting, while completely obscuring the moral boundaries which define human society?\r\nAre you searching for a gem that will change how you view the world and force you to question the value a human life has?\r\nThen look no further - as the masterpiece entitled 'Cross Ange' is the story you've been looking for!\" - said no one ever (at least at the time of writing).\r\nThen do you like Sunrise? (taken both ways, since you'll be seeing a lot of both)\r\nIf you answeredyes, then please read on for this review of a journey filled with much oppai, BDSM, mechas, and made-up words galore!\\n\\n\r\nDo note that I'm an offensive person by nature, so I do apologise for anything further ahead\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to describe 'Cross Ange' in one single word; I'd have to choose the phrase 'Identity Disorder'. Tabling the fact that that's two words for now - I say this due to the fact that you're presented with an absolutely appalling princess of some generic utopia, who is an idol for the citizens and all their ilk. However, all is not well in genericutopialand as you might expect. This is due to the presence of third-class citizens who are termed as 'Norma'.\\n\\n\r\nNow, these 'Norma', or as luck might have it, sounds similar to the word 'Normal'; and are just normal people, in that they are essentially plebeians like us people here in the real world. Meaning, they can't use magic. They are the minority and are thus prosecuted for some sort of obscure reasons, and are the stigma of humankind's evolution (Not our humankind, but the 'Cross Ange' mankind).\\n\\n\r\nAs this anime was produced by Sunrise, you should expect the obvious trademarks and troupes generic to everything they produce; like strife between a bunch of factions because reasons deem them necessary. You'll also see island episodes, romance, beautiful filial bonds and the long-awaited revival of Kira 'Jesus' Yamato. (Not that you can ever kill him)\\n\\n\r\nThe main character whose name was something along the lines of 'MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi,' is forced to join a ragtag group of girls and fight against dragon-esque creatures, which happen to be called DRAGONs because convoluted acronyms sound cool.\\n\r\nI realize I've digressed, but I'll get to my main point eventually.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters, there are a bunch of girls to choose from if you're looking to find a new waifu. For example, early on in the story, you see two girls who try to make friends with MaiAngelIkaMusumeMizugi, otherwise known as 'Ange'. These two girls are waifu material in that, they make friends with Ange despite her contempt for them. Not only that, they are definitely crucial to the story since they have hair that is feasible for real-life people and don't appear in the opening at all. You've even got your pick of the litter with girls like Ange's friend no. 1 to 50. Top class waifu material if I do say so myself.\\n\\n\r\nAt any rate, just know that anybody who isn't a Norma is basically a bad person. As for the, rejects of society, they're all either full-blown lesbians or are bi-curious. If you're looking for a male relationship, then you're in awful luck, since there's only three male characters around. The most notable of which is pseudo-RitoKira. As you might expect of anyone who bears resemblance to either of them, he is capable of fixing strange machinery like Gunda- oops, I mean 'Para-Mail'. He is not only capable of being beaten up, but is also capable of living despite having a magnet embedded to his face which attracts him to Ange's crotch.\\n\\n\r\nI have nothing much to say about Ange, other than the fact that she seems too good for the show. She's a very likable person for me, but she does seem to suffer from a chronic case of 'falls-in-love-with-king-of-NTR'. At one point, I even worried that he'd steal her position as main character. Luckily, he's as useless as any other harem protagonist. Not in an endearing way though.\\n\\n\r\nI've been ranting too long, so I'll  be brief about my main complaint. The plot. The plot started off simple, and I even considered it pretty decent at one point in time, but it breaks records in my book as the biggest piece of 'what the hell is this? I dont even...'. The plot jumps around so much that it seems to suffers from DID in trying to be so many things a la Samurai Flamenco. \\n\r\nNot only that, I even question what the hell went through the staff of Sunrise's minds when they decided on the premise of Dragons from the Nth dimension fighting robots piloted by the girls of Freezing. Whoever they were, I commend them for absolutely ruining what little remains of my good faith in Sunrise. I'm sure all two of them had fun self-inserting themselves in Tusk's place as he smothered himself in Ange's panties to death.\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion; if I'm asked (not that anybody would ask me) if this anime is worth watching.\\n\r\nI'd tell them 'sure, go ahead if you're a fan of kinky stuff'\\n\r\nIf you ask whether it's dark.\\n\r\nSadly the only thing dark here in this anime are the minds of its director, the lighting and the girls panties (in that case, it's be white censorship).\\n\r\nFret not though, since Sunrise will always find a way to shine the morning light of their company on all that darkness through the entity of BD, and Ange's glare-inducing coloured hair.\\n\\n\r\nGood job Sunrise!\\n\r\nDon't give up Sunrise!\\n\r\nGoodwork Sunrise!\\n\r\nLearn to CG Sunrise! (Computer Graphics, not Code Geass)\\n\r\nFarewell Sunrise.\\n\r\nMay you never produce anything better than Code Geass.\\n\r\nCurse you Sunrise!\\n\\n\r\nNote that I'm making fun of them not out of spite, but because they're dear to me.\\n\r\nIt's also for the sake of their own betterment. See, I'm not rude. I'm just Tsundere!\\n\r\nAren't I just a great person? (I know I'm not, but just let me revel in my fantasies)\\n\\n\r\nI'll rewrite or edit this review when I have the time.\\n\r\nI have a lot more to say, but I'll do that another time if need be.\\n\r\nNote that I haven't finished the series yet, so I may change my opinion.",

            "content": "I can say with great confidence that Cross Ange is one of the trashiest, garbage series I have watched in quite a while. Its ridiculous amounts of over the top fan service and emphasis on shock and awe scenes are legitimate lunacy. However, after the travesty that is the first few episodes a compelling story begins to rise from the muck that is Cross Ange and give people a legitmate reason to keep watching besides the fanservice and some some good mecha action. \r\nThe story begins by introducing us to our main heroine Ange, who lives in a world where magic is a used daily,and those without magic are a persecuted group of people called the Norma. Ange is pretty unlikable for the first few episodes,  as she clings to the fact that Normas are inferior, despite the fact that she is revealed to be a Norma herself, apparently not realizing that not using Mana once in your life is a tell tale symptom. From there she is shipped off to a Norma prison island and told that she has to fight DRAGONs to save humanity, why in all caps? Apparently Sunrise thought it looked cool. From there Ange is introduced to the other Norma, who are all young girls, and the fanservice begins, and it's literary ridiculous. There's some weird rapey scenes, lesbian three ways to keep the plot moving, and Ange is naked  for about 60 percent of her on screen time, a trend continues as the series moves on. The first few episodes will test if you are ready for this series, from going for over the top shock affect on issues such as racism, lots of nudity, and little girls getting lopped in half by giant dragons. It is as ridiculous as it sounds, and it sometimes hilarious to watch the over the top nature, and the series seems pretty self aware of just how trashy and bad it is. The cast of side characters initially aren't very important to the plot or are given much attention, besides the leader Salia and the head lesbian Hilda. There is also a guy named Tusk who lives on an island and rescues Ange at some point, and all of their conversations consist of him accidentally bury his head in her crotch or something like that, than Ange shouts \"baka\" and beats the crap out of him. That is basically a summary of that episode. However Tusk shows some interesting characteristics as well as brings up some mysteries about the world of Mana.\\n\\n\r\n The story starts to pick up near the end of the first half, when the narritive shifts from the island back to the mainland, where we are given a lot more depth into Hilda's character that makes her much more likable and understandable, and we once again see how ingrained the fear of the norma is in the people who use Mana. However a large battle breaks out on the Norma battle island, and during this battle we are introduced to the main villain Embryo, whose main attack as well as the other special mechas is powered by song. I wish I was making some of this up, but it seems like Sunrise started throwing crap at a wall until it stuck. The story starts to get more and more interesting after this point, and has some twists and shows us how exactly the earth has ended up in this state and the true nature of the DRAGONs, and some honestly genuine twist regarding the cast of characters and how they have been manipulated by the great Embryo, and seeing how he played off the weaknesses of each girl makes him a cool character to watch. They start throwing a lot of science jargon around during the end that feels like it could be replaced with a recording of Jesse Pinkman saying, \"science bitch\" over and over as it seems like they are just sputtering straight nonsense. Also there is a ridiculous deus ex machina  near the end that left in tears as it tried to explain how a frying pain stopped a bullet and can also apparently save you from falling into a ravine and getting hit by an exploding car, its like they suddenly realized these characters are integral to the plot and has never heard of the no take back rule. But in all honesty, the second half is  a vast improvement and has an interesting plot that can suck you in.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very diverse, with most falling in the categories of being Ange, wanting to bone Ange, or strongly disliking Ange because they want to be her. Ange falls in the being Ange category, and starts off pretty dislikable, but quickly turns into the chosen one who pilots the special mech with great skill and cares deeply for her comrades and friends. Tusk falls into the wanting to bone her category, and is a skilled fighter and nice guy who helps out the Norma and is considered to be Ange's knight, which as a side effect grants invulnerability. Salia is the leader and falls into the hate us because they ain't us category, and is initially a fairly competent leader who keeps a steady head, but is insecure due to the fact that she was not chosen and Ange was. Hilda wants to bone Ange and starts off unlikable, but as she learn more about her and she softens up she is a fairly likable character who goes through some nice development. Embryo wasnt to bone Ange, is the ridiculous Op bad guy with a justified God Complex, and is actually interesting to watch how he toys with others and manipulates them to accomplish his will. i was also impressed with the later development of some of the other side characters, as it really shows what's going through their heads and proves they are more than just boobs and ass.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Cross Ange is a train wreck, but is one that you can;t turn away from. It's over the top scenes can make it hilarious, and it seems aware of this fact which is honestly pretty funny. the fan service is up to ridiculous levels, and I would advise if you choose to watch this series do it in a sealed room because if someone walks in on you during some of the more fanservicey scenes you are going to have some explaining to do. The plot really gets going as the show completes it's run, but you have to put up with the trash that is the first few episodes and be able to take a ready helping of fan service. Cross Ange is definitely an experience, and one i would recommend giving a try, even if you can hear cackling Sunrise execs counting their money as you watch the literal crap they put out that somehow turned out to be pretty good. Nest year we'll probably have a mecha series featuring fully naked girls fighting GRIFFINs in space while trying to bring down two gods in a separate dimension, with a healthy dose of lesbian three ways, but that goes without saying.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: This review is my own opinion, take it for what its worth. I will be breaking this down into the stages MAL uses for rankings as there is a lot to cover with this one. As normal I will do my best not to spoil and keep it to the broad strokes. In addition I will worn you now. Watching this with friends is a no no. YES it is a bit risque, YES there are some very confronting things about this show, but that is not what I am talking about. There are a lot of girls in this one, to the pointwear there are like 4 male characters. And this mas of girls is hot and I mean HOT. I am telling you this now because I will not be held responsible for starting waifu war 4. Why 4? Simple! Because we all know waifu war 3 started when HuniePop was released, get with the times people. Que theme music aaaaaand GO!\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange: Tenshi to so on and so forth is an action, sci-fie, ecchi... ish anime that dose a splendid job of just about everything. It was a masterfully crafted peace from start to finish with only a small handful of what one might call \"glaring\" flows to it, but I don't want to scare you off it so I will leave them until later, like right at the end. For now, I must gush like the fan boy I am.\\n\\n\r\nThis was without question one of the best things I have watched in at least a year. I was  in love with this anime right from the first episode. It was fast paces but was not afraid to slow down the tiniest amount when it wanted you to feel things. It plays with the full gambit of emotions. Love, hate, sorrow and a hole bunch of others I cant seem to name coz well... I'm a guy, but trust me they are there and in spades. Not going to lie, there was a point in time this show jerked a tear out of my eye. Other times I was literally laughing out loud, right before being angry for the same reason. It was like a roller coaster of emotion, not a crazy one but from episode to episode it definitely gets you. Some of the time the feelings are not the sort you should have for animated girls but hey, that's never stopped us before am I right internet? The big kicker to it all though is that its all about the basics of human nature. The need to be in control or how we don't relay function alone. The fact that they tell the story with fuck off robots is just gravy. Ok that may have been a bit of spoils but if you haven't gotten that from the first two eps your likely watching this anime for the wrong reasons. 10 for 10 on enjoyment. Moving on...\\n\\n\r\nThis first thing that hit me about this anime was the outstanding use of colour. I am a devout follower of the high and mighty \"Lord Vivid Colours\" and I can say without a doubt this anime would pleas him. The pallet was vast, all the colours and not just a splash on a brown back drop modern day FSP style. What starts as a peaceful setting drenched in bright pinks, yellows, blues and whites gos down a darker path as the mood of the show changes. The are quickly replaced by blacks, grays and reds but stay with me I am not taking back what I said earlier. It takes an episode or two but the colours return in full force as the disposition of the characters improve and the reality of the world sets in. When the mood is good the colours are bright. When it is bad the pallet changes to reflect it. It is as much a part of the story as anything else and it helps immensely with the fast pacing of the show that there are visual ques like this to help keep the viewer on track. On a less ranty note the art over all was very well done with a lot of sharp lines and easily identifiable shapes, nothing just blended into the back ground. Each peace of furniture and the people on screen were easily recognizable but it very rarely felt cluttered. The distinct lack of copy and paste throughout the show was also very refreshing. 10/10 art  team, well done.\\n\\n\r\nNext down on the list of numbers is the characters. Good ol' characters. You know what? There are lots of them and they are good. Not what you might call amazing but considering the pace of the show (fast as hell), I think they have done really well. Almost everyone has at leas a minor bit of character development no matter how short there life span may be or how close to the main story they are. And on the off chance they don't get developed they are acknowledged strongly enough that you know they are real. No single character feels phoned in and aside from the occasional mob there is no mas melding of opinion, people are always butting heads over something. There are plenty of twists in the development of the main toon pile as well and most of the time it is a bit of a surprise. I say surprise and mean it but occasionally there are some ill timed or even impossible shifts in mood. This is another factor the dev team seemingly utilized in the telling of the story that mostly worked in there favor... mostly. As I mentioned before in my disclaimer there is a lot of girls in this one and it IS a touch ecchi so there was bound to be a good amount of.... let us say lesbianism going around. This is not entirely forced though. On many occasions it is in fact used to make a point about the world they are living in or to legitimately build character. Some times it works quite well as a point puter acrosser, but other times it falls short, and then there are times when it is just strait up fan service. It was unavoidable but it is also mostly good..... 8/10 characters let us move on.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND! Not a lot to say on this one. I am not one to pay much attention to the sound in anime, or anything really. Due to my work I have a gift for hearing when something is wrong but that is about it. With that being said I didn't hear anything wrong as fare as the soundtrack went in this one. The action pacing of it did mean there was always some sort of music going so a lot the background was drowned out but the fight noises were responsive and seemed different enough that they didn't just meld into explosion. Normally this sort of thing would only warrant a 6 or 7 from me but in this case its a solid 8 from the theme music. It just fits. I don't know what the words are in English, I didn't have that sub file, but it sounded right. So 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nNow the hard sell. Story. I say hard for what seems like a number of reasons, but relay its just one. I found it SUPER hard to pick up and follow over all. It seemed to take forever for the story to kick in and then it would piss off for an episode or two and come back. The hole thing was just so fast paced that each episode up until the last third felt like individual events that some how strung together. It was a simple mater to pick up on the \"foreshadowing\" for me but I cant say if that's because it was obvious or just my veteran status picking up the right bits. I know I have already told you how much I loved the different methods used to tell the story and I do stand by what I said. But telling a story well doesn't make it a good story. The problem being that this IS a good story. It is deep and full of emotion, conflict and real issues that face the human race, though it is a tad embellished (meh its anime). They just over paced it. It felt like they had something truly great in the works.... and then they gave it to Michael Bay. All being said there were no plot holes for me to dig out and the last 8 or so episodes saved it hard. I will be re watching this one down the line, probably after its dubbed, just to see if I can follow it a bit better. It dose have a somewhat \"Blade Runner\" feel to it in that I think I would understand more the second time around. So right now I am going with a soft 6. It was a good story when I could find it and it was told brilliantly and in interesting ways. But I can say it irked me how long it took to kick in and was defiantly not my favorite thing about this show.\\n\\n\r\nSo to cap it all off. Right from the start this show goes hard. Balls to the wall. It's speed setting goes from about 8 up to 11+. It throws things at you constantly in what I assume is an attempt to keep you from following the story 100% but keep you entertained enough to keep watching, and it dos it SO well. All is grand with this show and I would say to all seasoned anime watchers to get on it. On the flip side though, if you are new to the sport of anime watching I would let this one rest till you have a winter or two under your belts. I have been at this game for almost twenty years (that's right I started animes when I was 7), and it took me a bit to latch on to this. I mean, I may just be a dumb ass. Stranger things have been proven true. But as a rule of thumb I find I pick up on things in anime quit well. I stand by the Masterpiece ratting I have given and defy any who think otherwise, but that's what the Internets are for and as I said, personal opinion. \\n\\n\r\nI have been Kergen and you have been reading this review. CONGRATS and go forth to bigger and better anime.",

            "content": "Oh boy this is going to be quite the controversial review to make, The main reason because of how much the show has really made the people who watched it so divided by those who think its good and those who think its bad. Il try to go into detail as to explain what are the pros and cons of this show and maybe dwell why so many people either hate it or dislike it.\r\nThe series is either a hit or a miss\u2026it is a hit because it focuses a lot of how society functions especially towards the discrimination of others which are different andhow they threaten the stability and comfort they already have, as well as what it means to find your own since of individuality and since of moral towards around you, especially of the main heroine who developed from a spoiled, rotten and naive individual into a strong, intelligent, wise and caring leader. \\n\\n\r\nBut it can also be a miss cause of the highly controversial subjects and the extremities of certain scenes as well plot holes and plot armour some of the characters get.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t know what happened at the studio that produced it but u can practically speculate there was a lot of confusion and divided opinion as to how this show was developed especially towards the beginning of the series.\\n\\n\r\n As a matter of fact if u compare the first 5 or so episodes to the rest of the series, it is like watching two different shows altogether.\\n\\n\r\nThe Animation was fantastic at times, especially in the fight scenes but in others the animation looked sloppy and messed up, the soundtrack on the other hand was probably the best thing the show had and the singing of the actors was superb for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the second best thing that the series had, as their development throughout the show was something good to see, especially the main heroine as well as few of the side characters, but they are not perfect as there were a few character flaws that were really obvious or just to clich\u00e9 that sometimes it makes u want to cringe and while the main characters and a few of the side characters did get proper development others were not so lucky in that some of them just simply hid in the background and never got much to say or do at all. \\n\\n\r\nThe Sec jokes and fan-service might appeal to those who like it and not so much for those who don\u2019t especially since some of the fanservice and jokes were used were so overused and repetitive that it makes u sick to watch after a while.\\n\\n\r\nthankfully these things dropped as the series went on and were not as much frequent as they were in the beginning. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end I would say this show is either a hit or a miss depending on what a person is actually expecting from this show. There is also that old saying that a show is so bad that it is good and this series would defiantly be a perfect example for that.\\n\\n\r\nBottom line: as an enjoyment I would rate it an 8,,, however as a whole series taken into account actually story writing, plot development, animation and characters, flaws and derps I would rate this a 6.75\u2026 as this show really could have been done better\u2026what made it enjoyable despite this was mostly that by the middle of the series the series actually starts to thrive and use it flaws to make it more fun to watch. \\n",

            "content": "I initially got into Cross Ange because of the fanservice and Yuri themes, episode one took me by surprise. It had me hating the main character and enjoying some of the negative things happening to her. However that feeling blew over and soon I started feeling bad for her and enjoying watching her grow, become stronger, and overtake the many obstacles she's had thrown at her. The show also started getting into some of the other main characters, letting a little focus off of Ange, this was also fantastic as the other characters (some you may find yourself hating at first) turn out to bejust as broken as Ange is. This story leads you on some really big emotional rollercoasters, I found myself crying at some scenes before laughing at the next and enjoy the entire experience throughout. This anime can be pretty confusing if you don't pay close attention to detail, but I found myself completely immersed in the story and loving all of the main Characters by the end. Which brings me to my next point, the final episode is very well done and leaves you feeling good. Even though the characters have suffered loss, have been broken down emotionally and physically, and have no doubt been changed, this ending gives you the feeling of \"all is right\" in the world. I've always dreaded endings of anime's because I typically dislike how many of them leave unanswered questions, I typically like to see a \"wrap up\" episode that goes after the \"final battle\" or what-have-you just to leave you on a more warm note as you wrap up the story, but this anime does not need it because it does such a good job on its own over the last few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime will easily hold one of my top 10 anime's spots for quite a long time and the main character Ange is now easily one of my all time favorite characters. Please give this anime a chance, if you enjoy some fan service paired with an amazing story and characters you'll fall in love with then this is a great choice!",

            "content": "After 30 years of missing out, I finally finished my first anime--and what a great ride! I honestly never knew these things could elicit such strong emotions, both to characters and the general plot, but now I finally realize what all this is about. For 25 episodes I went on a ride that included great joy, extreme sadness, fantastic music, cool mecha designs, and pretty cartoon women. The entire range of my emotional capacity was tested, and for that reason alone I think Cross Ange is a masterpiece. I only wish there was more!\r\nMy only major complaint lies in the character of God, whose realmotives I never fully grasped. For the first two-thirds of Cross Ange I truly thought he was a neutral observer, only interfering when necessary to steer things on a better path (much like alleged irl gods); but then, his character rapidly changed to a harem-wanting sociopath. The transition was poorly executed in my opinion, without really presenting \"his side\" of the shift. And for a minor complaint, I was ultimately confused about how both women and men weren't...ah...anatomically presented with everything intact. I suppose it's because I'm such a newcomer and I don't understand what is allowed and what isn't, but the lack of certain features was terribly odd.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character of Ange, however, is tremendous. While her arch certainly follows the traditional fall then rise again, it was explored completely and left no doubt as to the why and how. Most Hollywood films don't have this quality of exploration into a character's motives, and it unironically blew me away. \\n\\n\r\nObviously I'm not a season veteran of anime, but I have seen thousands of traditional films and television shows, so at least I have exposure to storytelling: and by that metric, I'm comparing this to the best those fields have to offer.",

Every other reviewer will have commented on the synopsis (or you may have wondered here due to the debate surrounding this show), so I'll skip straight to judgement. \r\nSex, Nudity and the like.\r\nUnlike most other reviewers who rated this show horribly, I do not have (many) problems with the portrayal of nudity, yuri elements and rape in this show. The first episode isn't the problem, it is the structure, backbone and texture of the show which got to me. Also, blatant nudity and/or rape scenes do NOT make a show edgy. Read Punpun if you wanta realistic portrayal of the consequences of abuse. The show sits firmly in the harem/yuri/man-child fantasy genre, and while this does not excuse its portrayal of women, it is reality in anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter Development.\\n\r\nTl:dr for everything below: don't bother watching this anime for character development, unless you think Guilty Crown was deep. In which case, watch, and ignore this review. You would miss the point I am trying to make and then flame me anyway. \\n\\n\r\nAnge as a character is often praised for having mature and realistic plot development. Her character is viewed as a strong female protagonist, and therein lies the problem. Firstly, I find issue with her character growth. Ange changes from a bigoted, ignorant princess to a tough, independent warrior in the space of six episodes. Throughout the rest of the series, she remains said tough, independent warrior. How in the world is this mature character development? Realistic character development occurs when a character changes so slowly you do not realize the character changed at all. Realistic development is when (spoiler alert for HxH) Gon snaps, and you suddenly realize that Gon's fearlessness and conviction is horrible, not heroic. You will then scroll back to the first episodes of Hunter X Hunter, wondering how this cheerful boy snapped, and you see that the author has been building up Gon's view of the world as black and white since the first episodes. You see the ways Gon ignores advice and is constantly convinced he's right. He's so charismatic that you (and Killua) forgets that Gon is a naive 10 year old boy who will be wrong at some point. Then the understanding dawns on you that Gon (and you) have been taught a lesson in how to behave in the world. (End spoiler for HxH). This does not happen in Cross Ange. How has Ange's character deepened throughout the series? She learns humility. She learns that the world is a horrible place. She learns to make decisions for herself. These messages are explicitly thrown at us, with characters saying them outright, repeating themselves over and over. Ange is shallow enough of a character that you can't portray depth in her, hence the need for the show hammering \"Look! Ange is now developing (insert moral strength here)!\" repeatedly into our brains. So Ange learns humility. Now what? What does she do with it? How is this newly found humility reconciled with her previous arrogance? ( hint: she's still arrogant, only now her arrogance is directed toward the 'evil royal sibling', so it is all okay). So she realizes that the world she knew and had control over is an illusion, easily shattered by a few words and a mana shield cast the the right time. How did she address her helplessness? She became a cold badass warrior (whines in pain as golden opportunity for complex development vanishes). Does she admit that the world is ultimately out of her control? No. Is the world out of her control? No, because she is the protagonist and has the power to change the 'system'. It's certainly a fun trope to watch (remember Lelouch from Code Geass?), but it is hardly realistic. \\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the claim that she is a strong female protagonist irritates me. Why must a strong female protagonist be a gun-toting, independent sexy female? Why does her fighting her own battles makes her a stronger female character? This is coming from a feminist, so it will be hard to swallow. Skip on to the next paragraph for non-feminist criticism if you don't want to read this. Female protagonists are complicated. Make them into male protagonists with a female body and you have Ange. Make them too weak, and you have a non-existent character. Ange goes too far on the macho route. She is physically superior to most other characters in the show, despite being raised a princess. She is a textbook-tsundere, insulting people while (deep deep deep deep inside) sometimes caring for them. Remember Asuka from Neon Genesis? Ange is Asuka. But with more piloting skill and without the beautiful disintegration of the character near the end. She is the kind of female protagonist that makes me cringe whenever people name her as an example of a strong female character. As much as I wish female characters can be badass and invincible, having a strong female protagonist is more than toughness. It is understanding female limitations. It is realizing that we are fundamentally different from men, and embracing those differences. It is about portraying us as people, rather than as a sexualized, 'I will never cry' masculine female. We see none of this in Ange. \\n\\n\r\nSo Bad It's Good:\\n\r\nI honestly think the author is making a parody with this. The humor and self depreciation that runs through the show makes it better than shows like Guilty Crown, which are inherently horrible AND take themselves altogether too seriously. The author frequently injects moments that keeps me watching until the end because I am half convinced that he/she is making fun of the audience. Take the last episode, for example. (spoiler alert) What self respecting show will have the female lead shout \" I won't let you have me, you lecherous man!\" while slicing apart the main villain? Also, the villain's main goal being 'I want beautiful independent women' is so ridiculous I thoroughly enjoyed myself throughout the second arc of the show. How about the younger sister going around with a whip? What the hell is happening? (End spoilers). If the anime had wanted edgy, they would have gone the Elfen Lied route, also known as 'killing puppies' induced feels. It feels like the writers started writing this god awful script, and some drunk guy at a party decided to challenge the writers to put the most ridiculous things they could get away with into the script without alerting the audience to the game. Honestly, it is entertaining. But so are many many other anime without the horrible eechi and yuri elements. \\n\\n\r\nComplex Themes ( 1/10 i.e.: What themes? There were themes?!)\\n\r\nRather than rant about the complete lack of \"complex themes\" within this anime, I'll provide examples of other anime where they were executed properly, and you can judge for yourself how well this anime deals with themes.\\n\\n\r\nRape to break the character's will: I'll give this one to Cross Ange, although honestly, the shock value trumps the emotional reward its resolution brings. I've already elaborated on how horribly Ange grows as a character, and this scene is mainly so we feel sorry for the main character. Also you cannot bring in \"realism\" and then have crazy things happening. It does not work that way. The prefect way to communicate dread and agony through abuse is perfectly done in Punpun, not in this anime. \\n\\n\r\nManipulation by powers that be/Discrimination: Watch Shinsekai Yori. That show does not need to use a well loved princess to prove that a certain race can be bred to hate another. You will viscerally feel the hate, I promise. Bonus: yuri scenes in Shinsekai, yay! Psycho pass can be another, though Shinsekai pulls it off better.\\n\\n\r\nClear communication/need for understanding: This. Good lord. Neon Genesis Evangelion dedicates about 99% of the show to demonstrate that clear communication between actual human beings is impossible. Clear communication is impossible. That is a fact we have to work around, not emphasize that ' if we could all just talk to one another properly, it will be fine!'. That is why relationships are messy and friends end up killing one another. Talking to one another will not solve the problem. Talking to one another while wielding giant robots definitely will not solve the problem. Stop telling me it would, baka anime! \\n\\n\r\nConclusion: \\n\r\nWarning, do not watch. You will waste about 13 hours of your life watching while clutching your head, and a further four hours typing up a review so you can forever expel the anime from your head. \\n",

I only decided to watch it because the the site I watch said anime on had tagged it with comedy.\r\nThe first few episodes were a little weird, some being filler and some having blatant lesbians fucking but I honestly can't say it's bad the art is pretty decent, the soundtrack is pretty amazingand though the story line was a little weird at first it actually slowly got better as time progresses and you learn that some of the characters who were mean to Ange weren't actually half bad in the end.\\n\\n\r\nEmbryo is still an asshole though.",

            "content": "Simply put, Cross Ange is a masterpiece in my eyes. Many will say \"But Ruggarell, just HOW? CROSS ANGE? MASTERPIECE? WHAT?\". Let me explain.\r\nBefore Cross Ange aired last year, I saw it on the upcoming list of Anime that was coming out in the fall and being a fan of Ecchi it seemed like it would have a decent amount, so I gave it a go. I thought that I would have most likely would have dropped it anyway if the Ecchi segments weren't strong, but boy I got something entirely different. From the first 15 minutes of the Anime, it was blowing my mind.The world that Cross Ange was set in was not indeed an equal or fair one.\\n\\n\r\nThe 1st episode of Cross Ange made or broke the entire show for a lot of people but I was one of the few ones who kept going because of how exciting it was. Ange, the Main character, was the daughter of a very wealthy family and pretty much lived a comfortable lifestyle you see. Most of the world used magic as an everyday thing. Those who couldn't were seen as outsiders and thus rejected from society in very unpleasant ways that you will have to watch to find out. Ange, the MC was accused of being an outsider for not being able to use magic(Called normas), and thus sent to a prison. \\n\\n\r\nThe 1st episode of Cross Ange was so well executed and so well made that I never missed a single week of the Anime. Each week had me on the edge of my seat waiting for something insane to happen and oh boy it did each and every week. You will have to watch for yourself. The character personalities are just so good and diverse that you will end up loving(or hating) many characters. The story is just so well paced that I couldn't possibly find anything wrong at all.\\n\\n\r\nIf I were to write a list of every Anime that aired in 2014-2015 and someone asked me which one I loved the most, it would be Cross Ange. It's an Anime I will love forever because of how each episode was so well made. The story never let up at all. The director and writers always wanted you to be scared of what will happen next. It also had some dark humor in between as well that reminded you of the world that Ange lived in. Along the way she meets very crazy characters as well. \\n\\n\r\nI honestly wish that I could watch Cross Ange all over again for the first time because of how insane it is.  You might possibly cry and become depressed because there aren't anymore episodes to enjoy. I know I did. I loved the characters that much.\\n\\n\r\nThank you Sunrise thank you so so much for yet another masterpiece. Here is hoping for a Cross Ange 2.",

            "content": "Thirteen years ago, Fukuda Mitsuo was a name that became taboo across the lips of Gundam lovers far and wide for his hand in the creation of Gundam Seed Destiny and the much-maligned character of Shinn Asuka. Ten years on, he creates Cross Ange, a work with many underlying similarities to Destiny, however, infinitely superior due to certain tweaks and adjustments. Cross Ange centres around Ange, a royal princess who at her coming of age ceremony is uncovered to be a Norma, a term for those who cannot use magic and are treated as monsters by society. At its fundamental core, it explores the ideaof a character redefining their perception of humanity as well as following a girl whom has lost everything that she once had and has to rediscover her identity and purpose in the world.\\n\\n\r\nAs an audience diving into the first episode of Cross Ange I can say I remained hopeful but unimpressed. The pacing was rushed, the animation quality inconsistent and the characters felt like a cheap ripoff from Code Geass with an unnecessary sprinkling of fanservice. So many fundamental principles of storytelling were broken in that first episode and the show looked destined to be a trainwreck. Glimpses of rough-cut quality were buried underneath a shockingly paced series of events and an obnoxious protagonist whom reflected the deep-cut nature of racism and bigotry within this dystopian society. However buoyed by the positive things I had heard about Cross Ange, I plowed on. The story writing did not improve. Ridiculous plot twists were tossed around and used at ten times the frequency of a typical Sunrise anime. Whenever there was downtime in the fighting, yuri action littered the story as if to forcefully entertain its audience. The plot went through all sorts of nonsensical ridiculousness from dragons to alternate dimeonsions and fighting an immortal god. In writing it is not possible to make the plot of Cross Ange sound palatable. However, this is an extremely rare example where the sum of the parts far exceeded my expectations.\\n\\n\r\nFirstly, I have to digress that not everything about the writing is a travesty. The willingness that Cross Ange expresses in killing of characters is extremely refreshing and provides a genuine sense of urgency and risk to every single scene. Contrasting this to the last mecha show I watched, Darling in the Franxx, is night and day since that anime collapsed under the weight of a lengthy cast that received neither sufficient character development to make a difference, nor suffered any casualties to fish for some cheap feels.\\n\\n\r\nIn my opinion, a huge part of the reason why this anime succeeds is because of its self-awareness. The fourth wall is broken on a frequent basis and as the show continues, it becomes clear that the writers understand that the writing is atrocious to say the least. The show degenerates into self-mockery to the point where as a viewer, it is not possible to treat the story seriously any more. And once that point is understood, Cross Ange truly blooms into a marvellous form of entertainment.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst the writing of Cross Ange never truly improved, there is one thing that Cross Ange did better than any other anime I have ever watched. And that is the manner it was able to believably transform an arrogant pampered princess with a thoroughly condescending attitude into the greatest protagonist in animated history. People often say \u201cno pain, no gain\u201d. Ange is an amazing character like none other and the enormous amount of character development that she undergoes through the course of the entire show is what makes it so sweet. Her surrounding cast is similarly developed far beyond the simple cliched shells that they wore at the beginning of the show into multifaceted characters who evoke powerful emotions in the audience by themselves. On the other hand, the final villain feels like the director\u2019s self-insert as an otaku fan and has truly laughably questionable motivations for wishing to destroy the world. However, the show understands its own farcical nature and makes plenty of self-aware jokes at the antagonist\u2019s expense.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, what truly makes Cross Ange great, is the manner in which the fundamental principles which underline the show are developed and expressed. Despite the mortifying storytelling and writing, Cross Ange expresses masterful control over the themes of racism and information control, prompting all of us to ask ourselves the age-old question of \u201cwhat is human?\u201d.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is about accompanying Ange every step of the way as she seeks to answer this question herself in a brutal world filled with the most nonsensical of plot devices, and fighting against her own destiny. Ten years on from the completion of Gundam Seed Destiny, Fukuda has truly redeemed himself to the mecha genre with a protagonist as good as any in the business, resulting in the best show Sunrise has made since the turn of the decade.\\n",

            "content": "*May contain minor spoilers\r\nCross Ange is one really good anime that alot of people dropped cuz of the first 4 episodes and i think its not fair to dislike it because of that i hated it as well even though opinions swayed me into thinking that i got around to watching it and i was really interested....it def isn't for everyone its kind of all over the place though.\r\nStory- very good to say the least once it hits episodes 5 and onwards it really depends on your preference the early part will make you dislike the main character like to the point where you wannasee her die but she grows on you overtime and you eventually take a liking to her well i did at least. You can read the synopsis on it for the plot of the story, but without spoiling i will say its a journey to say the least. Mecha is a big part in this anime along with the sci-fi aspect alot of fanservice and gruesome scenes, singing is also a big part of the anime its not like its everywhere but its because it has to do story and fits in but it seems kinda dumb to be really honest but that aside a very good story.\\n\\n\r\nArt- it's good but theres times when you can see that the animations seem kinda laggy like it had frame issues but its really rare the first episode has an audio issue idk if its where im watching from but other sites had the same issue with cross anges first episode. Another thing i didnt like about the art style was the delayed speaking animations what i mean is i mentioned singing is a big part already but some of the scenes while there singing the character's mouth isnt moving at the proper time so it looks off but it sounds great. Other than that No complaints. Mecha looks very well done as well. Other then few inconsistencies i thought the art and animation looked good\\n\\n\r\nSound- Great i liked the first half of the series op and ending not so much the second half but the battle themes are great sometimes. There are moments when a random song doesnt fit into the fight scene like imagine a crazy battle mecha style and then hearing i sad song in the heat of the fight when nothing bad has happend thats what some scenes felt like in cross ange and i wish they removed it while editing the show if they did. Character songs are good some sound angelic honestly why i was so attracted to alot of the scenes and had to rewind if i just wanted to hear it again its that good.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter- Variety of characters although many dont get through by the end of the series they are likeable for what they are as you get deeper into the anime theres a few characters that will grow on you the main character grew on me and a few side characters and 2 other main characters. But im here to tell you cross ange is one of the best ive seen in its 2014-2015 run to me and anime when it comes to main character development i mean it was like you really noticed it and thats what i really loved a minor spoiler ima throw your way not really about the characters themselves but the main character has about 3 character changes in personality and attitude from beginning to end and a few other characters also had more than 1 character change. Although not all the characters are all that loveable the development you get is an easy 9/10 it was really well done even with the anime cliches with hero and villains.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- 10/10 i dont really watch all that mecha anime to be brutally honest ive seen about 5 and aside from code geass. Cross ange slips into my number two and onto my all time favourite anime list when i look back. Character development is top notch, Good story although the fanservice was overkill sometimes im an ecchi lover so it didnt bother me but its not in the ecchi genre yet it had a ton of fanservice moments, visually looked good not great, Great battle songs & character songs as well as the op and end from the 1-12 ep mark and i really just liked it. It goes 24 episodes nothing really seems rushed besides the last episode i guess.....other than that the pacing is well done it was really great i wish more people would give it a chance.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- 9/10 id say more so an 8.5 but lets not muddy things up here.\\n\\n\r\nLikes/Dislikes-  Likes: Music, Art, Story, some of the fanservice, main character and few side characters, \\n\\n\r\nDislikes- Short pure fight scene, Too much fanservice, Random events, delayed animations (barely any), Petty highschool girl bullying stuff, Disturbing yuri/ecchi  fanservice scenes and disturbing sexual fanservice scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading a reuploaded final copy review of my thoughts on the series.\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Hey guys! This is my very first review so I hope it being long doesn't bother you guys too much but I'll try my best to explain each category and why I absoutely loved this show. I'm not really into mecha, but ironically Code Geass is one of my favorite shows of all time. A few days ago, I stumbled upon Cross Ange and the first thing that caught me was the female lead, no not in a sexual way, what I meant was it's refreshing to see a main female lead, especially in action shows. So I decided to watch (binge watched the wholeday for maximum experience) without really expecting anything, and by the time the show was finished, I just had to write a review.\\n\\n\r\nNow onto the review...\\n\\n\r\nStory: Not the most original concept of stories but the way the plot revolved around its own universe was really thrilling. The world revolved around magic called \"Mana\" and people who can't use it are discriminated. That's story revolves around Ange, our blonde main female lead, who is the First Princess of her own country and how she copes with the world they are in.\\n\\n\r\nArt: Well, nothing is really special about the art, but it does look great although the quality of the animation isn't very consistent. One thing that's very obivous is the CGI for this show, especially the mecha animations which honestly isn't the best looking, but then it's not just about the mechas, it's more on the story that drove me to look past it. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Why an 8? The OP is amazing, it's upbeat and thrilling to hear, fitting for an action anime  and is sung by Nana Mizuki, also the VA for Ange. Cross Ange has a lot of quality VAs, and I'm not gonna list each and everyone of them, but what captivated me the most are the songs sung by our quality VAs like Yui Horie and Nana Mizuki. The show DOES use singing during the action scenes but you'll understand if you watch why. The EDs were pretty forgettable though.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: Oh boy, I don't know whether to hate or love the characters but, mainly Ange's  team or \"harem\" as people like to call it. Ange, the main character, has one of the most amazing developments in any anime I have ever seen and her character was consistent to the very end. She starts out as a bitchy, arrogant princess but she slowly turns into one very fitting of a 'hero'. The supporting charscters are what baffled me because some of them do have great development, like Hilda, I swear she is easily  one of the best characters out of the show or any anime at least. However the other characters pretty much zigzagged throughout the show. Like their traits, motives are unexplained and such. But still that's just a minor problem that does not really bother the show unless you like nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Not gonna lie here, this show is one of my favorite shows of all time, and one of the reasons why I enjoyed it is the fanservice. Yes, this show has fanservice dating back even to the very first one. I know this show isn't very well received and a lot have dropped it in 2 episodes only since they saw how shameless the fanservice was or what a \"trainwreck\" this will be, however, I was not deterred by the early fanservice, and I loved the yuri antics throughout, yes YURI. So, why is fanservice a good factor for the enjoyment? Because it's shameless! It doesn't hide this or that and isn't afraid to show scenes happening and we all know half-assed fanservice is very annoying. But the fanservice alone isn't the only thing that captivated me, the way the story presented all throughout, the hardships of Ange and her team to the very end is what made this show memorable and lovable. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: Every show has its flaws and Cross Ange is no different, but of course nothing is perfect. This show easily gets a 9 because it knows what it is and it doesn't hide that fact. If you enjoy a good story with great character interaction with fanservice thrown here and there, then you're in for a thrilling ride. If you are one of those people that tend to nitpick each and every small detail of flaws or mistake and expect a lot, then don't bother. However, I do highly suggest you give this show a chance.\\n\\n",

If i could watch the whole series in a day i would definitely do it. This anime is the absolute ecchi,mecha, sci-fi experience which every fan of this genres would enjoy it the most but let's be more specific \r\nStory: well the main character of this anime is a teenage girl named Angelise. She lives in a world that lives by using \"mana\"\r\nEverything is only controlable by this kind of magic. But some girls can't useit and they are known by society as \"Norma\". They are hated by everyone and all calls them monsters. (Anyway it's not bad to be different but it's something extra ordinary) The police which caught these girls sent them to a secret location known to the 5% of the humaniy as Arzenal. These girls are sentenced to spent their life there and fight the D.R.A.G.O.N.s as they called in some kind of planes-spaceships-unifoms\\n\r\nArt: The art i can say that it's absolutely stunning. Everything is well animated and fascinating \\n\r\nCharacters: hmm the characters are at a 98% girls and each of her has her own interesting story \\n\r\nSound: the sound is the best part of this series with Nana Mizuki singing the opening will keep your ears pleased in every single second \\n\r\nEnjoyment : well I'm not a mecha-science-fiction anime fan but i can say that i really enjoyed this anime series. Do not let the ecchi scenes take you away from the main plot. Of course it will have ecchi scenes cause it's based to a group of girls. If you are interested to something new and awesome you will definitely love this anime and i believe it deserves a 1000+ ranking (but that's only my opinion \\n\\n",

            "content": "This is my second review, after I've watched the last episode, I will say everything fairly with reasons for my views. Cross Ange is one of those anime that 'HAD' potential to be a mind-breaker but the staff didn't realize that and ruined it with ecchi moments, unnecessary romance,etc.. Here's why:\r\nPlot/Story (10): The plot is the best part of the series. Once you've passed through the first 6-7 episodes, the show starts revealing the history. I know you might feel that the first few episodes were disappointing, but 'I' think they just meant to make you understand each character properly. For example, Hilda's character ismeant to be that bully that shows you how the 'New-comer' isn't accepted by all. Every episode revealed bits and pieces of story, You never find out anything until just the perfect moment and you're left amazed. In other words, it adopted a great way of presenting the story. Yes, the first 6 episodes or so, are a bit disappointing but trust me, it gets better and better until your mind explodes. I can take in whatever the first 6 episodes offer without much problem. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9): Voice Acting is an important factor for any character. The Voice Acting is here, is as beautiful as needed, you can feel their emotions just like other great anime. The characters are represented nicely, for example \"Hilda\" being the bully at first who turns her friend. Chris is the 'left-out' type, Jill is the smart commander that always know what to do. Salia feels herself left out too while Vivian is simply \"I'm cool no matter what\" type. You may find Ange to be a bit aggressive, but that is no legit reason to rate it badly, it's part of the story and the anime shouldn't be rated bad considering the behavior of a character. Now for the bad part: The lesbian content in the anime is too high, some people find it unbearable. Of course, I have no problem 'ignoring' it, but that isn't the case with everyone. So this is the point where I deduct a point from my rating.  I did find that ecchi scenes completely unnecessary. If you take out those parts you are left with a perfect masterpiece that deserves 10/10, but unfortunately as the staff tried to push that 'stuff' into the show, it damaged the anime badly. Ange, the main character, was a princess once. She treated Norma like they're not humans. In other words, she hated them just like every other 'human'. I find this great that in a SINGLE day, she is converted from a pampered Princess into her worst nightmare, it happens all of a sudden. Everything was normal in the morning and at the same night, she had lost her mother, father, her identity, her freedom and everything else. Ange finds herself in despair, not accepting the fact that she's a Norma, the same 'creatures' that she found pathetic once, and always disobeys her orders. As time passes by, she starts accepting the fact and loses herself completely, knowing that it's all blood shedding in her life until she dies. Then she meets Tusk, who gives her hope of 'humanity' among Normas, however, she still wants to escape. When she escapes, she finds out that every 'human' including her remaining family members want her dead. She realized that the humans are not actually humans, she then develops a friendly relation with other Normas, determined to destroy the Human world. He then develops a deep relation with Tusk and there you go, till you reach the final episodes, Ange is transformed from a Princess to a Killing tool and then to a caring and daring, bold girl.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork (9): To me, the artwork looks at its best. It's not perfect of course, but it's as good as required. I never saw any flaw in the main characters, I can allow a little relaxation in the background or supporting characters. The mechas(robots) are nicely polished (Pun not intended), and the colors are also beautiful. Yes, the dressing and the uniforms may be somewhat pushing the show towards sexual stuff, but overall, they're not always pushing you into that.\\n\\n\r\nSoundtrack (10): I wouldn't be surprised to see great soundtrack supporting the great plot. The music is amazing. As a vital part of the story, they have inserted those \"Endless songs\"(It has alternate names) that provoke a sense of excitement every time you hear one. The Opening and Ending songs are nothing below amazing. Trust me when I say this, you have to get the OST for this.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10): There was too much hype, at least for me when I was just near the end of an episode. They always left you on a cliff-hanger and that made the next episode even more interesting. I do like many other anime, but this anime, for some reason gave me the most excitement and enjoyment. You just couldn't wait a whole week for the next episode.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion (10/10): There's something I'd like to mention here: I think I'm not the only one who rates many shows 8+. I think the reason behind it is that we bring all our emotions into it. When I hear the ending song of Cross Ange and all those characters pass by, I can't help but think about their dark past and their hard times. I think everyone needs to bring some feelings into such anime. Please, don't always expect action. Try to connect the personality of each character with your emotions. I'm sure it will help you a lot to love all that you've ever hated. Overall, the ONLY thing that I found \"BAD\" in the anime was the insertion of ecchi scenes/ lesbian romance or whatever you call it, into a mecha based anime. It left a bad impact on people otherwise I'm ready to bet on the fact that if the haters ignore these facts, they will rate the series 8+ for everything else it has to offers. Even the show itself, after it comes out of the '6' episodes, makes you realize that while there will still be a few ecchi moments, that isn't the sole thing it has to offer. Otherwise, Everything else is great. I rate it 9/10 for such an amazing work. I expect another season if they can manage without more nudity and lesbian scenes... Thank you for reading this far!",

Out of all the shows that were airing with Cross Ange, it was a long shot to believe I wouldn\u2019t have dropped it early based on first impressions alone. Alas 25 episodes later I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by the turn around that happened here. Ange manages to command her character, becoming a strong female lead despite the odds against her and the general fan service comedy of the show.\r\nThe fact that Cross Ange actually has a fully developed story and characters out of nowhere is really what is surprising about this show. I can\u2019t stresshow off-putting the first episode really is. I\u2019m pretty sure many stopped watching based on the first episode alone. But the world building here is done quite well, slowly unveiling what\u2019s making everyone and everything tick episode by episode. I am still impressed by the level of thought on the whole back story regarding the dragons. My expectations were very low but were more than met.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves though, when we have characters singing pop songs at each other, let\u2019s bring our level of expectation down to reality shall we?\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nThink about something that you did within the past few minutes. Maybe it was clicking a link to read this review or making a phone call to a friend of yours. Now, why did you perform this action? Was it a preordained happenstance that you had no control over? Or did you feel compelled in some way to act accordingly? The long and short of it is, did you make such a decision of your own free will? The idea of will, that you make the choices that govern your life, is something that has beenendlessly debated about for centuries. Cross Ange dabbles into this very topic. And while it might not be completely resonating, it has as much fun with the notion as it possibly can.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange begins in stunning fashion; Angelise, the princess of the Misurugi Empire, is discovered to be a Norma -- someone incapable of using the \"Light of Mana.\" Thus, she is sent away to Arzenal, a prison for other Normas whose only goal in life is to kill the DRAGONS that threaten the non-Normas.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is crazy. This isn't an exaggeration; this show is as wacky as they come. Not in the sense that what it is doing doesn't follow logic, but that its very nature is aimed at being as ridiculous as possible. On the surface, the anime deals with obscene fan-service, machine versus dragon battles, and insane plot developments. But on the inside, Cross Ange treads on very mature subjects, such as sexual molestation, racism, and philosophical questioning. In essence, the anime spans an incredible range of emotions. One instant it is having Ange's bare crotch shoved in Tusk's face while the next has her being the object of ridicule as a means to demonstrate the social disparity that exists in their world. This tonal dissonance isn't a detriment, though; rather, it is a boon for the show. Cross Ange revels in whatever it is currently doing, whether it is comedy or drama. And it knows this: it flits back and forth between the two constantly, never letting itself become too serious. In this way, Cross Ange manages to maintain its craziness and subsequently is able to always \"know\" itself.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the silliness that Cross Ange engages in is its \"home turf\" per se, the nonstop swinging in direction is not something that lends itself to an overall direction. In other words, much of what occurs within the show happens \"just because.\" While there may be some obtuse reasoning as to why the narrative is going one way or there exists particular events that make sense in context, the plot points are isolated instances that never truly feel connected. Ange may be struggling with her new life, then whisked to an island getaway. Only to then be transported back to her birthplace which in turn leads her to an alternate dimension. And this says nothing of the more \"unfair\" ventures that take place. For example, the Vilkiss -- Ange's flying machine -- pretty much has features added to it as the plot deems necessary; characters miraculously survive after being killed off; and once certain happenings come to pass -- such as Zola's death, the \"Old Earth,\" and the betrayal of Salia and Alektra -- they are largely ignored, simply because Cross Ange needs to make room for its next \"big\" scene.\\n\\n\r\nEven when the show is juggling its absurdity and misdirection, it does manage to bring about some personal message. And this is what the introduction introduced: the idea of one's will. This isn't too far-fetched a notion; \"Mana\" is usually a term used in conjunction with magic, which is itself a word connected to a person's fortitude or will. And so that is what is seen through much of Cross Ange: the use of will or lack thereof. Those using Mana are slaves to the system whereas the Norma are free from the chains of constriction -- though ironically being slaves themselves to the aforementioned slaves. This is what the first half focuses on; the second half shifts to the manipulation of will. Alektra demonstrates when one's will is tarnished; Salamandinay represents someone who's will is guided by the very principles she grew up on; and Chris showcases how will can be used for both good and for evil. And that is the show's message: you are not subject to fate nor are you destined to follow some predetermined path. While people -- be it a close friend or a lover -- may be able to influence you, you ultimately have the final say in the actions you take.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange unfortunately suffers from quite the poor art style. The actual locations visited are not that exorbitant: Arzenal (the prison), the open world (lots of sea and sky shots), and Embryo's castle make up the majority of where the show takes place. More so than this, details are often nonexistent, with little attention given to the backgrounds, giving everything quite the boring look.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs are not that impressive either. Besides Ange's various transitions, Hilda's striking red hair, and the revealing outfits that all of the girls wear, the show often experiences terrible quality issues. There are numerous scenes where the designs of their faces or bodies fall below an acceptable level, distracting the audience from everything going on. Granted, one could argue that this simply adds to the charm of Cross Ange's crazy behavior, but this kind of drop in effort is nothing more than a lack of detail.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation, like what has come before it, is below average. The show sticks closely to the use of CG for the machines, but even so, their available movements seem weirdly limited. Often times, the robots would perform the same up-and-down slash pattern or the same volley of rifle shots, with the machines twirling around in an indiscernible manner. And when Ange and the girls weren't flying around haphazardly, the show never had much motion, instead sticking to still shots of the girls' various body parts -- namely their butt, breasts, and crotches.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nInterestingly, there are only two important characters throughout the entirety of Cross Ange: Ange herself and Embryo. The rest of the cast have their small moments here and there, but their true worth is in supporting these two, characterizing them, and reinforcing the ideas that they represent.\\n\\n\r\nAngelise Ikaruga Misurugi is, as her name sounds, royalty. She's arguably the most famous person in the Empire of the same last name...at least, in the beginning. For within the very first episode, she falls from the height of popularity to the bottom of the barrel faster than is physically possible. Her arrogant attitude, lack of empathy, and inability to cope with her new surroundings painted her as an annoying little girl lost among a sea of women. As she acclimates, and like the flip-flop nature of the story, Ange goes to the complete opposite side; she's arrogant not because of status but because of prowess, she acts rudely selfish, and refuses to associate with anyone. But this, too, wasn't working. In both cases, her personality prevents her from being sociable. At first it was due to ignorance and later it was due to misplaced worth. Eventually she finds a balance by retaining her own identity while letting others in to her world. This emotional instability makes sense; the Mana-users cast her out, the Normas mistreated her, and the Dragon people wanted her aide. Nobody bothered to ask how Ange herself felt in these situations, and through her experiences with all of them, she comes to learn that valuable lesson about will. That you alone have the power to make your own life choices.\\n\\n\r\nWhile not as strong of a character, Embryo, or \"The Tuner,\" as he likes to call himself, is a literal manifestation of God. With the ability to teleport, make infinite copies of himself, and possessing the knowledge to alter genetic code, nobody within the millions of dimensions that exist holds as much power as he does. What's nice about Embryo is that he isn't a bad guy for evil's sake. He values beauty and power, while loathing boredom. His actions follow this philosophy; he surrounds himself with hot, \"strong\" women with an overall goal to recreate the world once more. And yet, despite his all-knowing wisdom, Ange wants nothing to do with him. After all of his parlor tricks to coerce her are used, she continues to despise him. The idea here is simple: where Embryo is the epitome of control, Ange is the epitome of freedom. Thus, this dichotomous relationship is always feuding: Embryo has an instinctual need to dominate whereas Ange places all value in choice. And since Embryo, for the first time, cannot have what he wants, he relentlessly pursues Ange to the point of demise. In the end, his death is symbolic: not even God can force you to do something against your will.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe first OP starts off almost Scottish in tone, but then becomes more techno in its beat and instruments. It can be pretty catchy, with the vocalist doing nice work alongside the more triumphant sounds that the track gives off. If anything, it's a zany piece that perfectly fits with what Cross Ange set out to do.\\n\\n\r\nThe second OP starts off slow, with powerful chanting taking up the background. The piece progressively gets more mysterious, with the continued chanting and instruments moving to a crescendo. After the break, the vocalist, still working with the male chanting, shows great range and strength, leading the piece to a resounding conclusion.\\n\\n\r\nThe first ED initially goes against the fast-paced nature of the show, with soft singing and finger-snapping making up most of the piece. But, in true fashion, the track transitions back to quick lyrics and louder instruments. And still following the anime's nature, the song comes to a crawl by the end, filling the listener with an odd sense of hope.\\n\\n\r\nThe second ED isn't as experimental as the others, following a simple beat with equally simple singing. The halfway point gets slightly faster, but the piece itself stays relatively the same from beginning to end and is easily the weakest of the four OPs and EDs.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is very much forgettable. The pieces mostly consist of non-lyric vocals, piano-and-violin melodies, and even Hawaiian tracks that exist as nothing more than background filler.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as voice-acting is concerned, it's generally around average. If anyone deserves some recognition, Nana Mizuki as Ange earns it for her wide range of personalities that she had to portray throughout the show's run.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was probably the funniest \"comedy\" that the season had to offer. There was just so much ridiculousness going on at all times, that I couldn't help but laugh at both the \"drama\" and the actual comedy. The writing at times could be hilariously bad, but it worked in the show's favor. One of my favorite characters from the show was Ange's younger sister, Sylvia. Not only is her \"Angelise-onee-sama!\" something that I still jokingly say in her voice to myself, but also the revelation that her paralysis wasn't real for part of her life? Absolutely classic.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service was rather nice, too. The lesbianism, bikini Twister, and butt-smacking were all nice to see at intermittent points during the anime, and were also the source of more smiles from time to time. Without them, the anime would not nearly be as enjoyable as it was.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, Cross Ange is quite the Ragna-Mail ride. While its characters are average in their execution, and its art can be shoddy at times, the crazy plot, unintentional comedy, and varying levels of fan-service make this an anime you may not have to will yourself to watch.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Good, knows itself, directionless plot, yet willfully thematic\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Bad, boring art style, bad character designs, below average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Ange and Embryo are dichotomous, with the rest of the cast reinforcing their ideals\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, good first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Great, \"Angelise-onee-sama!\", lesbians, and lots of laughs\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",

            "content": "I would be lying if I didn't say this series was dreadful; in fact, it's garbage. I want to get one thing out of the way before we continue, and that's that I don't think the characters themselves are horrible, but that all the effort that did go into this series was clearly from the VA's and nobody else. How does one sit by and watch a trainwreck? Well, aren't you in for a ride.\r\nCross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo is what you get when you mix Gundam with the magical girl genre and toss in some bad writing and worse animation. The serieskicks off with Angelise (A princess of some kind) telling the mother of a \"Norma\" (the people who can't perform magic) that her kid is a freak and to stop giving birth. The next day, the pampered princess is revealed to be a Norma herself (and because her maid did everything magic-related for her, she didn't need to do it herself) and gets sent off to prison. After being bitch-slapped, near-raped, told she's trash, and essentially kicked into the mud, she grows a pair and becomes the equivalent of Buffy cosplaying sailor moon and piloting a gundam.\\n\\n\r\nThe problems with the series isn't the characters; I quite enjoyed myself some lesbian relationships. The issues stem from the production standpoint, where the studio seemed unsure of how strong their \"strong, female protagonist\" should be. This lead to Ange often forgetting how to be strong for her own sake and instead laying down and crying herself silly until someone came by and told her to grow a pair. The other characters often range from silly to endearing and, with the last handful of episodes, just obnoxious. I would suggest first-timers go as far as Arzenal getting wrecked and stop there. You'll thank me later.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is also pretty subpar, and that's complimenting the series. A lack of effort went into the mecha fights (where it should have really shined) and at times you wonder what you're watching. The character designs are, for the most part, your usual fair. The settings and backdrops are unfortunately \"okay\" despite the attempt at some interesting designs. Also, a lot of the fights take place over an ocean because.\\n\\n\r\nWhat can I say about the music? It's personal taste, but only the song the protagonist sings is memorable at best.\\n\\n\r\nThe issues with this series unfortunately overshadow the pluses. The main gundam of the series, Vilkiss, only exists to move the plot forwards and, perhaps self-aware of this fact it picks and chooses when to do so. The villain is hilariously-bad and suffers from being a horny fuck who has gone a thousand years without. Yes, that's the reason he sucks at his job so bad; he hasn't had any in a thousand years. The protagonist earns her applause by telling him so and to go fuck himself right before doing the deed for him. \\n\\n\r\nIn fact, the entire series is an allegory for having sex. The lesson? Sunrise is full of horny, old farts. Now, go watch something better.",

            "content": "Before i even begin reviewing this, let's get one thing out of the way -\r\nThis anime at best looks something Clamp would draw on a bad day and at worst, looks like the Gundam animators were trying to draw with toothpicks.\r\nSunrise really gutted this one in terms of production values; But what you sacrifice in budget, you gain in artistic integrity and auteur-ship.\r\nThere's no other anime that's been as daring with it's plot, it's characters and it's sound design as this. The entire anime is almost composed by Akiko Shikata, who honestly should have equal credit with the director considering how much of this animeis influenced by her music. The tone, the story, the fight scenes, the mise-en-scene are all dictated by and almost conducted by Akiko Shikata's music. The best way to describe this is watching an Orchestra performance, or an Opera.\\n\\n\r\nWhich is appropriate, considering how closely this comes to the latter. \\n\\n\r\nAngelise, a princess within the Misurugi Empire lives within a society in which people known as Norma [notably all women] are sidelined and discriminated against. When it is discovered that she herself is a Norma, she is quickly captured, detained and forced to discover a world which she had been oblivious to as a princess - a world in which day and night, she is forced to fight Dragons for people who care very little for her well-being.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange, at it's core, is above being an anime about race and intolerance. It's an anime about a woman's sexuality, and her awakening to the realities to the treatment of others of her kind. It should be noted that there's a pretty graphic sequence at the beginning of this anime that signals at sexual assault, and the main character's refusal to be subdued and held down by this. Then, she discovers men, women and faces against a man who would do everything to turn her into a sexual object. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps one aspect of this which was a missed opportunity was the connection between Vivian and Ange. That one psychedelic scene in Episode 11 [which i consider the best half an hour of anime of the past 6 years] hinted at something deeper between the two. I had imagined that the story would go on from there to explore a deep connection of sorts between the two characters and explore an incredible character arc, but it seems like we didn't have time for those characters. Perhaps this is a way to sell Blu-Rays, by teasing at a second season.\\n\\n\r\nCorrection: The \"psychedelic\" scene referred to above is episode 11, \"Dragon Song\", not episode 12.",

I wanted to write this review because of how much underrated this show is... \r\nSome people might argue it has some Evangelion or whatsoever Mecha anime cliche, it might has the general concept or idea, but the delivery and the uniqueness of the story is what captivated me. \r\nThere might be small spoilers down the line so, bear with me. \r\nStory: 9/10\r\nWe get a very unique about that amazing princess who seeks peace and everyone looks up to, she has everything a girl could dream of. Yet all of the sudden all is gone. This might somecliche to many weebs, and it is, however the anime holds a very beautiful concept of Utopia, like there is that perfect world without violence or crime and everybody almost equal and happy, yet this world is revealed to be shallow, emotionless, just a bunch of heartless people, living to satisfy their own desires, and prejudicing other people (Norma). Regardless of the world created there will be always discrimination and injustice, the beautiful theme that the anime tries to deliver is that everybody should in harmony with each other, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or even species (lol because there are other species other than humans). \\n\r\nThe story events are really unpredictable and that what made it awesome, however the ending was a little bit cliche and somewhat predicable, but still overall the story is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nI dont want to talk about art, since i am not an artist myself nor that i have that good taste in arts, but the arts and graphics were really good and battle scenes were great.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 100/10\\n\r\nI know this illogical rating, but please accept my childish behavior, since the songs and the music were really amazing. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10/10\\n\r\nThe only character that caught my attention is ANGE, I fell in love with her character, her character development was one of the best of all animes that i have seen, the transition from an asshole to a lovable amazing badass character was captivating.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nI did enjoy ever bit of the anime except the scenes of Embryo with Ange, those scenes made furious Lol. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\r\nIts a show that all anime and non anime fans should see as it has a very strong message, beautiful characters, nice story, and AMAZING Music And SONGS...",

            "content": "The one thing I appreciate the most about this, what I think to be very underrated anime, is the fact that you start off by disliking/hating the protagonist, Ange. \r\nWe are introduced when Ange is Princess of Misurugi, and right from the get-go we see how sheltered she is, when she witnesses a child being ripped away from its mother for being a Norma (a human incapable of using Mana). The mother is furious at her behaviour, about how she tells her to just let her daughter go and that it is the best for the country. \r\nThe mother's hatred is immediately projected unto theviewer, who recognizes how ignorant Ange is. She is the typical princess type that cannot do anything by herself.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when it turns out that she herself is a Norma, Ange is thrust into the Hell that she previously defended. She now experiences cruel treatment from Jill and the other Normas, as well as the terror of fighting DRAGONs. She is first-hand confronted with death and pain, and comes to slowly realize just what she had been defending and turning a blind eye on in the past.\\n\\n\r\nIt is then that we slowly start to warm up to her. Ange goes from a whimpy, helpless princess to a confident, strong woman who is able to hold her own in battle. We see how she realizes that this is now her life, and she decides that she will not simply be killed by a DRAGON, but will fight for her survival and that of her fellow Normas.\\n\\n\r\nThat is what I love so much about Ange. She accepts that her past views were wrong, and at the end does everything she can to help the Normas and overthrow the policies in place that treat them as slaves. She goes against her own family because she realizes the horrors that they have allowed to happen.\\n\\n\r\nConcerning the romance plot, I guess it was pretty solid. Without infringing on the actual problems and battles of the show, the love story between Ange and Tusk is slowly build up, and makes for some quite comedic moments. It's good to see how, slowly, Ange starts to let Tusk in and they end up genuinely loving the other to the point where they are ready to sacrifice themselves for the other.\\n\\n\r\nThe lesbian romance is, in my person opinion, unnecessary and really just pure fan service. However, it does make a lot of sense, given that Normas are solely women. It would be impossible for them to have a male lover since they are never in contact with any men. So, in a world where they can die any day, it would be normal for them to look for some form of intimacy. \\n\\n\r\nI also quite liked the development of the secondary characters like Hilda (whom I greatly disliked at first) and Jill, and even Momoka, who is a loyal friend to Ange. They all get time to be developed and change, going through their own little story as they follow Ange. \\n\\n\r\nI would recommend the anime to anyone who is looking for a solid plot with kickass characters. There is no shortage of death or even gore, as well as comedy and romance. All these things are balanced in a very good way to the point that no element outshines the other. They are simply part of life.",

            "content": "Yes, yes. We all know Cross Ange totally SUCKED at the beginning and all of us had our jaws dropped at the ending of the first episode, but let me say this. When I thought this show wouldn't get better, it DID.\r\n8 - Story: Yes, when we first heard about Cross Ange, it seemed this show was going to be awesome, but did we get what we were expecting in the first episode? Heck no, that ending scene was jaw dropping, but as the story progressed, it became better and had very good plot twist. Some plot twist weren't even anything you would expect either.So, the story came around and did the show good.\\n\\n\r\n8 - Art: The art to Cross Ange is very good to me. I mean, the art and animation can look awkward in some scenes, but who points out and cares about that small stuff? *coughsailormooncrystalhaterscough*\\n\\n\r\n9 - Sound: The music is very good and likeable! I enjoyed all the music! The first opening and second ending are sung by Nana Mizuki, Ange's voice actor. While the first ending is sung by Eri Kitamura and the second opening is sung by Yoko Takahashi. The insert music is also enjoyable!\\n\\n\r\n7 - Character: This show had some great character development. The main character, Ange, was whiny and annoying at first, but then she learned how to become independent for herself and learned that the world she originally lived in was a cruel and unjustified world. The other main characters also had very good character development. The development won't disappoint you.\\n\\n\r\n9 - Enjoyment: I enjoyed this show very much! I was originally going to be one of the ones to drop it at episode 5, but I had faith in this show and kept going! It really did turn out to be something to enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n9 - Overall: Cross Ange was a great show. You have to ignore some of the Yuri themes in there, but the main character ends up with a guy (I'll tell you that). It had a bad and horrible start at first, but it came to where you wanted to know what happened after a cliffhanger, it had emotional episodes and scenes where you could get sad, and the little comedy that needed. All in All, Cross Ange is something I recommend if you need a new anime to watch! :)\\n\\n\r\nAlso, the First Opening Single is totally worth the buy! XD\\n",

            "content": "STORY & CHARACTERS (8/10 and 9/10)\r\nThis is a story about rebellion, growing up, friendship, love... and dragons, magic, mad scientists, science fantasy, princess and parallel universes with mecha action! You won't get bored with this one. Certainly quite unique mix. Surprisingly, story works and is actually good and really hard to not spoil it by telling about it, which just underscores my point. Notably, story works so well because characters develop so well. Which is what really surprised me. And by well I mean they grow to new situations and surroundings like, well, normal non-mental people would do. \r\nStory also takes tragic turns and charactershave it very rough at times. Ange in particular gets worst first episode in my memory and oh yes it still goes downhill for her. She is not the only sad sock either. One of testaments to characters is that I can actually recall most of their names despite vast active cast now that the show is over.\\n\\n\r\nExcellent character development is great, but what makes Cross Ange even better is that good story and characters are combined with massive amount of tits, fanservice and violence! Oh my god there are so many tits! So many! All the time! All different shapes and sizes of milk glands are well represented and each pair of tits is attached to perfectly proportional female body clad in minimum amount of cloth required to pilot mechas against dragons. Yes, in anime that is that heavily geared towards pure entertainment you get actual story plus good character development. In that sense, this show must be historical. At least it warranted my review.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND & ART (6/10)\\n\r\nCross Ange is nothing special and has fair share of QUALITY moments especially towards the end, but nothing too off-putting. It is also about as generic anime style as it gets. In fact, all the designs are extremely generic as well. Soundscape is similar, nothing to get hyped over but not bad either. Seiyuus are generic as well. Didn't bother seiyuu of any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT (9/10)\\n\r\nIt all comes down to enjoyment. With so much fanservice, tits and action, it is enjoyable by default. What makes it especially enjoyable is the good story and the great characters. Combine those two, and you have Cross Ange.",

This way, we can see the greater good of the development, and I'll say one thing they did well in this anime.\r\nCharacter Development\r\nI understood in the beginning when I watch this while others insult it, it was for the sake of character development. This truly deserve to be one of the best for 2014. \r\nThey kept all the side characters involve, and we get tosee how they change as we go further in the episodes. \\n\\n\r\nThe Story was also very creative and unique, you don't see many anime that's unique. I understand that its not in everyone taste, but to me it was epic. I also like the realism, you gotta understand the yuri aren't there for show, its an all girl prison, with no males, so of course there gonna have to be some desperate people for lust.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, it was very good and pleasing for me, but some parts were left unexplained, so its not exactly perfect but definitely one of the best for me.",

            "content": "I haven't written a review in a long while. Mainly due to the fact that MAL got rid of the \"Not Helpful\" option for reviews, but I digress. Watching this fucking show enraged me so much that I couldn't hold back from throwing all of my pure, unadulterated hatred at it by writing a review. So sit back and enjoy my review of this shitty Sunrise show from 2014 called Cross Ange.\r\nHope I'm not too rusty. \r\n[There's spoilers all over this review]\r\nI went into this with whatever can be considered less than no expectations. Really I can't even remember why I wanted to watch itin the first place. Maybe it was that I heard the main character was kind of a bitch (she is), or that I wanted to get my monthly dose of bad fanservice mecha series, fuck if I know. Now despite all that, I watched the first 3 episodes, and was pleasantly surprised. It set up this princess girl Angelise as an idealistic prim and proper dunce who would kill a child if it wasn't like the rest of them, only to tear down everything she believed in, and make her change her ways. Violently forced away from her utopian world, and taken to the unfriendly Arzenal. She was beaten, harassed, defiled, and left with nothing but her self left in the world. With nothing left to believe in, she decided that she indeed would gonna change. She cut her hair and turned into Ange, a straight up bitch who takes no shit from nobody. Now whether you believe that to be good character development or not, it's something at the very least. And it's more than I'd seen in a long while from a protagonist. There was actual change there, and I respected it for happening. \\n\\n\r\nContinuing on now, there's a bunch of lesbian sex scenes, ass shots in the mechs, censored tits and whatnot, blah blah blah, and then Ange wants to go back home. Because her bratty bitch of an Imouto calls for help. She doesn't go back alone though, along with her comes Hilda, fiery redheaded twin tails girl. Another bitch who takes no shit from nobody, but has a goal of her own. She wants to get back home to see her mom who she was separated from years before. They both set their differences aside and set out together, then go their separate ways. When both of them realize that they were fools for even thinking of going back, they get captured, beaten, mocked, nearly die, and then go back to Arzenal. I don't know whether or not that whole sequence was like some kind of social commentary on how society becomes moronic and conforms to whatever they're told to no matter how stupid it is, or like how we insult and degrade those who aren't the same as us, I don't know. I feel like the show was accidentally making sense. Anyway, Hilda and Ange are thrown in a jail cell for a week together for deserting Arzenal. Now, these two really hated each other. But being confined in this tight space together for a long period of time would make them have to connect with each other to make sense of all that has happened. They had both gone home, and befell similar  consequences, and they were able to flesh themselves out with each other in that jail cell. I'll sit here and say that was the best scene in the entire show. Then, they go and make a promise to each other that they'll destroy this awful world, this world that has wronged them for so long. And then episode 11 ends. And so ends everything good about this series. \\n\\n\r\nI'll be honest. I loved the first 11 episodes. I really did. Sure there were tons of things that were just all over the place, but I found a way to really like it. Every character put on screen had some kind of genuine motivation to them, and they felt like real characters for once. They all developed in some ways, no matter how subtly, and it was very interesting to watch. They even began touching upon a possible relationship between Hilda and Ange, which would've been very very interesting, due to how they originally acted towards one another, and how they're lives had intertwined since. But alas, everything I could've wanted to happen, just, well...didn't. And there's one man to blame for it. \\n\\n\r\nTusk. \\n\\n\r\nTusk, I wanted him dead the entire show. This guy, this fucking guy. He comes in early on and helps Ange out of a jam, and I'd hoped I'd seen the last of him, but knew that couldn't be the case because he was so prominent in the Opening. I knew that he would drag this show down. There was no doubt in my mind. And low and behold, he did. The basis of his character can be summed up in few words. He's a guy (there's only really 2 in the whole fucking show), he falls in love with Ange after meeting her once, he inexplicably falls on her crotch 1534289069 times, and...nevermind that's it. He comes in as this living, breathing, infectious pile of generic blandness that single handedly destroys everything good in this show. Ange had new found morals, a new found goal, and was bound to turn into a regular ol anti hero we could all get on board with. But no, Tusk comes in and ruins everything. If you remove him from the show entirely, it wouldn't make a single difference. If you just replace everything he did, with Hilda doing the same, or Ange just being alone, it would've made the show much better. Rather than delve deeper into this budding relationship between Hilda and Ange, they throw Hilda away for a while in order to \"strengthen the bond\" between Tusk and Ange. Every time he was on screen I was filled with anger. He could not be more generic, and I've grown to absolutely disdain generic male characters in anime. There was no effort made towards making him into a decent character. If he wasn't so generic I probably wouldn't mind as much. \\n\\n\r\nMy main issue with him is the relationship between he and Ange. See, Ange comes off as this strong, independent, fearless girl who can do anything she wants and get anything done. But once she meets Tusk, all of that is thrown out the window. She completely changes her goal, and completely forgets about everything that's happened to her along the way. \"Oh I've been beaten and spit on and psychologically damaged and possibly raped and nearly died at the hands of all humans, but I met this one guy so everything is okay now\". It shouldn't have gone this way. It could've been something special, but no. Leave it to anime to add generic bullshit to something that was getting interesting only to ruin everything they set up. Fuck. Anyway, later HE DIES. He fucking blows himself up (or at least that's what was implied). All of my prayers were answered. But then, of course, for no explainable reason, he comes back, without even a scratch. Doesn't even tell us how he got back to his house, he must've just teleported there or something I don't fucking know. \\n\r\nAnd then they have 12 hours of intercourse.\\n\\n\r\nTusk ruined this show. And, while I may be overstating how good I think the first half was, it still was really captivating, even if for all the wrong reasons. If this had just stayed true and turned into a yuri fanservice mecha series throughout, with Hilda as best girl, than this would've been something I'd hold near and dear. But no. Fucking Tusk. Not only the worst character in this show, but I'd argue one of the worst in anime period. Never have I seen one man bring down an entire show just from his mere existence. Just tragic. I don't know if I'm the only one who feels this, but, whenever a romance happens on screen that I really don't like, it like, genuinely hurts to watch it unfold. Like, you know it's going to happen, and you know you can't do anything to stop it. I don't know man, it was painful. Shows that need no romance and yet have romance thrown into them just to appeal to more of a dumbass audience that appreciates these contrived relationships really irk me. I really wish romance could've just stayed out of it completely to tell you the truth. This originally felt like Akatsuki no Yona without Hak for a while (they both cut their hair too). Though I liked it even more when they isolated Ange as opposed to giving Yona a shoulder to cry on. Ange was left alone, and had she stayed alone, it could've made for better storytelling.\\n\\n\r\nOh well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading my review (If this can even be called a review). I was more so venting my steam ranting than trying to make a compelling argument but I hope you had fun reading nonetheless. This felt like by far the most elitist I've sounded in a review, I guess I'm evolving. I'm becoming more and more aware of how bad the anime coming out are, and am starting to lose my faith in the industry as a whole. This show did not help with that. I never drop anime, which leads to me torturing myself with bad shit a lot. And this show just teased me, made me think it was good for a while, only to crumble under itself later. If I ever quit watching anime, I'll look to Cross Ange as the show that really did me in. If that is ever reason enough to tell you not to watch a show, well, then I don't know what is. \\n\\n\r\nGoodnight everybody.",

The only problem is  remembering what happens its the sad part about anime and the brain is that once you do something you start to remember things that happened in the animeso its some what of a spoiler and if you're re planing to watch an you've watched its hard to enjoy the way you enjoyed it when you first watched it without knowing what happens. Enough of that again. I'm saying is that the story the music the characters are amazing.

            "content": "Alright, call me a fanboy if you want but I gotta say it:  Cross Ange is by far one of the greatest anime from 2014 going into 2015.  I mean people may think it is just a yuri fest of ecchiness but here is why you should watch it.\r\nCross Ange is filled with unpredictable plot twists, and I do mean unpredictable, great character progression, a unique story, and quite possibly one of the most interesting anime that pushes the borders of the status quo of anime that I have ever seen.\r\nStory - 10\r\nThe story is a huge round-up of modern day societal problemsor matters of debate such as discrimination, corrupt governmental system, along with pushing the bounds of how human relationships and sexuality are defined.  Taking the ecchi, mecha, supernatural along with other tags and mashing them up into one middle finger to everything you know series is amazing.  Plus how the story follows a spoiled princess who loses everything and rises from her nature through experiencing loss and hatred and evolving into pretty much the strongest anti-heroine I've ever seen is awesome.\\n\\n\r\nArt - 10\\n\\n\r\nObviously the artists from Code Geass had a strong influence over this series, I do believe it is the same company; have to double check but yeah anyways, the art is a plus, the CG is damn near unnoticeable because it blends so well.  The color is vibrant and appealed but of course you ecchi fans will hate the blurred bits.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10\\n\\n\r\nI downloaded the soundtracks and I love every minute of them.  Seriously, it's like Hiroyuki Sawano had sex with Yasaharu Takanashi and gave birth to the Cross Ange soundtrack.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - 10\\n\\n\r\nFINALLY a series that is a limited thing in which shows character growth even for the background characters or non-MCs.  Everyone changes over time except Tusk but Tusk is a badass so who cares.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 \\n\\n\r\nThe moment this series gets its BD release, I plan on downloading it or buying it because I loved every minute of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 10\\n\\n\r\nDon't let the tags fool you.  Yes there is fan service, yes there is a lot of yuri moments but when you consider the shit that is going on in this series and the obvious mental toll it takes, you'll quickly learn to ignore it and just enjoy this show.  For you pervs out there, you'll love the little sex scenes when it comes out uncensored but yeah watch this series.  Total plus.  It beats that shit Aldnoah tried to pull but failed.",

            "content": "(Before i write my review Im going to try my best to not type any spoiler but if i do i will warn you.)\r\nThe anime Cross ange is a straight mecha style anime. at first i thought is was just one of those Fan services anime with a lot of girls ( cant really blame me on that if you seen the OP video of the anime). But it turn out there was more to it than meets the eye and its reason.\r\nThe anime is one of those few that goes really intense on certain subject  and one of the biggest one you willnot immidiatly is racism. There are two races, the human and the Norma..... You might as well called them \"Normal \" because that what it really come lose. anymore would just be spoilers.\\n\\n\r\nok time to hit the main review of each\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~~Story~~~~\\n\\n\r\nThe story was really enjoyable, not something too original but the way they tackle it was good to me. It had a very strong starting and fallow through but the ending might have been soft  and i guess i was expecting a little more to the ending. But it doesnt live you dissatify with it just that for my preference i would have rather it otherwise but for many other they will be very happy of how it ended. To put it simply it get an actual ending.\\n\r\n There are some cliche moment but sometime they make jokes about it but doesnt hide the fact that others are very obvious. Some of you that watch alot of anime might notice a few scene that might have been taken from other anime. Of course the anime itself has its fair share of fan services. you will notice it during the OP Vid and....... well after episode 1 you will see alot of these and i meant it. \\n\r\nWhiles all those i mentioned above is emplimented, the story still does very well to captivate you to desire to know more about the story adn to watch it right through. \\n\r\nTo me there was no funny moment in the anime, fan services were ok but nothing for me to laugh. You might get vey upset or annoyed though but for a good reason.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~Chracters~~~\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were all enjoyable and lovable. I wont lie, their might be some that you wish to see dead or suffer but there are alse those that you will learn to care for envualtualy. \\n\r\nAnge gets alot of story developement, she is a strong minded caring person who you might as well say was very spoiled at first but eventually grows to be a better person.  \\n\\n\\n\r\n~~Art~~\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very nice and the mixture of 3D CGI in to the anime was a good mix. Pretty much all the mecha were all 3d models. and I was very impress on how well it work with the anime. You will not be dissapointed. But there are time when you will notice some characters were also made in 3d which didnt always work but not many notice unless you pay attention to the animation. The thing is that 3d work very well with hard surface objects like vehicles building etc, but things that has alot of movements our eye will perceive as strange.\\n\r\nThe color palette use in the anime might be in my opinion to bright but doesnt take away the dark feel to the anime. \\n\\n\r\n~~Sound~~\\n\\n\r\nI found myself self enjoying alot of the music scores of the anime, especially the one that you first hear in the episode 1 after a few second and the faster versions. There is nothign to complain  about any of the soundtrack. If i had to put it in this way, there are some that i will gladly listen on my ipod but not all.\\n\\n\\n\r\n~~Overall~~\\n\\n\r\nI really did enjoy this anime and i really mean it. ive been watch anime for logn time so i develope a habit of not liking to wait for anime every week for it to be release and would rather wait till it was done. Well this one got me good and i really did wait every weel for it wanting more as the story progress.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this anime to any that love mecha fighting, survival and stupid human\\n\\n\r\nPeece\\n",

            "content": "A friend of mine once told me that if asked to describe Pacific Rim, he could sum it up as \u201ca perfectly good stupid movie.\u201d I enjoyed Pacific Rim. I also enjoyed Cross Ange. \r\nMost of this show falls clearly into the realm of self-parody. The fanservice in particular made me laugh almost every time, and by itself would make Cross Ange the best new anime I've found in a long time. Further, when an episode ended, I actually cared what happened next. Usually I stop watching for a while and do something that feels like work before resuming a show, because nothing holds myinterest anymore. The show even uses a swimsuit episode, but instead of going wild with how stupid swimsuit episodes are, it takes a more prudent path, relegating it to the B story line behind an important section of the main story line. (Maybe its creators found that one too lame to do much with.) Of course, it still finds time for humor. I loved the \"it's a tradition\" explanation after Ange's quizzical response to the sudden, inexplicable swimsuit party.  \\n\\n\r\nThat said, you\u2019ll find nothing revolutionarily new in the story. I\u2019d call it fun, but not groundbreaking. Even the big reveal midway through had me saying, \u201cyeah, I knew that from the moment I laid eyes on those things.\u201d Of course, I seem to predict all kinds of things that people around me find mind-blowing, so maybe it\u2019s not so obvious to everyone else. Either way, I found the characters a refreshing change from the usual cardboard cutouts. The show explores a surprising number of them, expanding its world in the process. (more on that subject later\u2026)\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is certainly not for everyone. Plenty of people find fanservice (humorous and otherwise) terribly offensive. The show also explores hatred, prejudice, violence, and general mean-spiritedness in ways that may scar the timid. \\n\\n\r\nMany people in our own world will never understand that any other point of view besides their own could possibly exist. When they encounter someone who thinks differently, they can only see something wrong with the other party. They can only view the world through their own value system, as they utterly lack the ability for introspection required to recognize that anything they believe could potentially be less than perfect in some way. They can\u2019t place themselves in another\u2019s shoes even for an instant. Angelize faces these problems, and some people hate the show for it. \\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, Angelize (thinks she) lives in a perfect ordered world. Violence, hatred, etc. etc. do not exist because she lives in an age of reason at the pinnacle of human evolution, but oh, wait\u2026 something called norma threatens that order. Obviously this aberration must disappear. Human happiness depends on it. \\n\\n\r\nShe sees a norma for the first time, and stops to talk sense into the child\u2019s mother. Clearly it\u2019s time to try for another child. The police will remove this one, letting everyone\u2019s happiness continue. I laughed out loud, and even took a screenshot of the baby in a cage. Humans of our society may find this absurdity repulsive, but only because we judge it as outsiders. Angelize views these events through her own values: the values her society indoctrinated her with all her life. \\n\\n\r\nNaturally when the world finds out Angelize can\u2019t use mana, she can\u2019t accept it. She can\u2019t possibly be a savage norma. She finds out firsthand how \u201chumans\u201d treat norma, but even when she arrives at a norma facility, she antagonizes everyone around her by treating them as inferiors. How dare they treat a \u201chuman\u201d (and royalty at that) like a norma? \\n\\n\r\nAnge needs a lot of time to accept herself, those around her, and the world as it really is. That last one gets particularly difficult. How the world really is changes every time she meets someone new, because she keeps learning new things and considering things she hadn\u2019t before. By the end of the show, she forms an entirely new value system. She also learns to see things from others\u2019 points of view, even when she disagrees with them. It\u2019s a pretty handy skill for someone so ready to start fights.   \\n",

            "content": "Summary: Giving the caveat that I could not get into the Gundam series... this is the best mech anime series I have ever seen. It is absolutely brilliant and I recommend it to anyone, mech fan or not.\r\nStory: 10/10\r\nThe story is absolutely amazing. Ange starts off as a sheltered Princess and her evolution is ridiculous. This story covers her complete transformation into a badass, has tons of side arcs and character development, covering SO many deep emotional and philosophical topics. Everything you know about the universe changes... at least 3 times! The whole concept of the world and everyone's motivations are spun on their headsseveral times, I assure you that this story will suck you in and keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The pace starts off slow and ramps up and keeps on going until the very last minute. If you want a deep story that isn't afraid to get deep and emotional but also lighthearted and funny you will LOVE this. Also, if you want a story with a concrete and satisfying ending this will definitely give it to you.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10/10\\n\r\nIt's fantastic. The mechs look amazing, the characters are diverse and done well. The color pallet is bright and full of life. Everything is unique and well thought through. As it was made fairly recently it has all of the polish you would expect from something this recent. One thing to keep in mind is it has some ecchi tendencies and shows women topless but without nipples... it is a bit weird but you get used to it.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound is great. The fight scenes sound intense, the Endless Song is catchy and there are some nice duets in there. The OST is diverse and wonderful and you will find yourself humming along during some moments.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9/10\\n\r\nThis is where the story truly shines. Ange transforms from a sheltered Princess into an absolute badass character. You find out so much about each character and their motivations evolve over time. The villain is logical and the good members of the cast who turn bad are all logical as well. Basically, every character has deep development and you understand their motivations. Also, the romance plots are not shallow... you truly feel for the characters and this anime isn't afraid to give characters logical romance scenes (if you're wondering why a romance anime can go a whole season without a kiss because of contrived \"someone walks into the room\" type scenarios this will be VERY refreshing).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10\\n\r\nThis one is a blast. I enjoyed every episode and thought the pacing was excellent. Every aspect of this anime was above and beyond expectations and there isn't much more I would want from it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\r\nYou should watch this. It has excellent mech scenes, gritty and dark moments and lighthearted and fun moments. It is deep, philosophical. The dialogue is well done and the characters are excellent. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't like this. Enjoy!",

The storyline started out a little slow  for the first 3 episodes or so but the succeeding episodes later on reveal a absorbing plot that is a refreshing change from a lot of boiler plate anime storylines that is common place nowadays. If you are into strong willed female protagonists then this anime is for you. Ange shows great resolve without being annoyingly pigheaded and her journey from pampered princess to kick-ass warrior! The character development for this anime is awesome,  the animation is great and the soundtrack is amazing.",

            "content": "Let's just get this out of the way: many elements of Cross Ange are garbage. The animation quality makes frequent, noticeable dips. The plot throws so many disparate things at the viewer, regardless of whether or not they make sense, until it eventually goes off the rails and straight into crazytown. Hardly a scene goes by without the show trying to shoehorn in copious amounts of fan service.\r\nAnd yet I loved every minute of it.\r\nThis really is an example of the sum being greater than its parts, and I think one of the biggest reasons for this is the characters themselves. Most of the girlsare terrible people at the start of the show. They're petty, cruel, cowardly and pathetic... And yet, over time, you get to watch them grow, little by little. They screw up, learn from their mistakes, screw up again and eventually carve out their own places in the world and story. \\n\\n\r\nBy the end of the show, I genuinely cared about Ange and her companions, and how they make it through the harsh situations they frequently find themselves in. It's one of those stories where, once I got to the end, I found myself wanting to stay in the world for even longer.\\n\\n\r\nIt would be extremely easy to write this show off for its silly premise and admittedly problematic sexualization, but if you're okay with that, you might find a fun series that's equal parts over-the-top fantasy, mecha drama and romance.",

Now, if you feel like witnessing an undesestimated anime and enjoying some unexpectedly good content that the mainstream anime community still ignores fear not: Cross Ange can provide you plenty. \r\n    The story contains some mecha, yuri, action and ecchi elements.If you are not very much into those dont rush to drop this anime as, even though they sometimes feel very forced, they do not adulterate the anime to a point that will significantly hurt yourenjoyment. Other than that the story department is propably the weakest point of Cross Ange. Despite having an intresting plot and rapping it up with a satisfying ending Cross Ange's story suffered with some plot holes as well as a very poor start which gives the (false) impression of an uneventfull plot. (6.5/10)\\n\r\n   Visually the anime was decent. Mecha particles were displayed nicely and the character design was above average. Other than the animation becoming somewhat unsmooth(the frames were visible) at certain times the overall art was not dissapointing.\\n\r\n   Moving to the sound, this is where Cross Ange trully shines. Starting with a great opening, the well known Miyano Mamoru amazingly voicing Tusk and some great work done in general, every episode will leave your ears pleased.\\n\r\n   Summing this up, Cross Ange is a nice little adventure with more bathing scenes than it's frames, boobs of every size, many unfulfilled harems as well as unexplainable anime power ups, explosions combined with some really really solid charachter development and an enjoyment value which you would not excpect to see in the 1000+ rank club. Cross Ange is worth giving a shot and please do not be prejudiced: this anime is actually good. (8/10 Overall)",

            "content": "Cross Ange is one of those anime i was eager to watch yet dreading at the same time. Eager because I've always loved Sunrise mecha anime that comes with a original storyline, Escaflowne and Code Geass being prime examples of greatness that was achieved in the past. Dreading it also due to negative comments from my friends who watched it and said it was full of fanservice, ecchi and only worthwhile to watch if your into Yuri. I have nothing against any of those things but in high dosage they can be off-putting, and so finally with lots of mixed feelings I began to watchCross Ange.\\n\\n\r\n-----LONG REVIEW BELOW------\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange starts off as a very innocuous anime with no particular theme, focusing on a fantasy Earth where people use 'magic' and hates on Norma 'muggles' who don't have magic. The main character Angelise (Ange) is discovered to be a Norma and shipped off to an isolated island where the government keeps other Norma. Seems simple enough, on the island the girls (because only girls are born Norma) have plenty of time on their hands to indulge in Yuri sex and the anime is not afraid to showcase nudity. The premise of the anime seems set, viewers are treated to episodes of near naked girls with curves who grope and have sex with each other for fun. Definitely heaven for any (horny) guy. Battles and mecha fighting appears to be a natural addition to the fanservice and ecchi appeal of the anime because mecha suits are naturally skin tight and skimpy and leaves nothing to the imagination. The mecha also happens to transform into a motorbike thing and so the girls naturally fall into a hands&knees ass up position when controlling it, fantastic for any guy who have a thing for tough girls and motorcycle fantasy.\\n\\n\r\nJust when it seems things can't get any better for the men who are watching Cross Ange, it gets worse. A guy is introduced, named Tusk (note this anime has horrendous naming sense) to ruin the Yuri fantasy and to add a Het. element to the show slowly driving it toward a multi genre anime of Yuri and Het. Tusk to note has only one stand out quality, and that is the ability to face plant whenever chance happens into Ange's crotch. Ange and Tusk's interaction is the running gag of the anime, and appears at times to be satire due to the frequency of Tusk's face plants, and at others parody of famous het pairings in Sunrise's production most notably when Ange screams at Tusk 'Osuwari' to sit. You can also draw a similarity to Kira Yamoto who Tusk bare a strong resemblance to and naturally his relationship with a certain 'princess'. Thankfully Tusk is a minor character and only appears infrequently to ruin Yuri fantasy for men watching Cross Ange.\\n\\n\r\nIf the first half of Cross Ange is about Yuri, ecchi, het, nudity and fantasy. The second half of Cross Ange is about harem, sci-fi, mecha, war and romance, think Code Geass crossed over with No Game No Life taking harem, romance, alternate reality, magic from No Game No Life and war, mecha, sci-fi from Code Geass. It feels like the writers were experimenting with the anime not knowing what theme to focus on yet wanting to have everything. Ideas were being tossed together into a blender and being thrown out worse than before and hopelessly tangled with other strands of ideas. Time became a constraint since the anime only started developing story and plot 1/3 of the way in. So in terms of pacing Cross Ange feels like it was running a marathon only to realize it was in fact a 500meter race and they have fallen hopelessly behind. Therefore the later half of the anime became a mad dash towards the finishing line disregarding any attempt at pacing, and with no attention to detail for the story which was full of holes and unanswered questions. The closer the anime got to the finishing line each episode felt more random and pieced together with no prior thought, as if the the writers were deciding on a whim 'the next episode will be a battle scene' and 'the one after will be sex on a beach'. Any attempt at rationalizing the anime was thrown out the window as characters seemingly died under circumstances that were impossible to escape yet ten minutes later emerges completely unharmed.\\n\\n\r\nThe crux of the shoddy plot in large began with the emergence of the villain Embryo, who posses a god complex with a name to match that implies the opposite, as if only to exacerbate the running gag that is Cross Ange. Embryo's appearance spearheads the plot into a world wide, cross species, trans-reality war between three races; the Norma, true humans, and fake humans. Minor characters who before played no further role than being exploited as fan service and Yuri suddenly became important, both as chess pieces and as material for the developing harem revolving around Embryo and his fantasies. Ange who received the bulk of character development in the first half of the anime becomes reduced in the second half. Her determination, fighting spirit, and violence to do justice for the ones who wronged her was what made her an admirable character because viewers found sympathy and empowerment in her cause. However the second half of the anime turned her from a Jeanne D'Arc into a Damsel in Distress who is herself victimized at every turn by Embryo. Tusk thus establishes himself as a main character due to his vital role in rescuing the Damsel in Distress aka Ange from her tormentor and captor.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I didn't regret watching Cross Ange, somehow it fell exactly into my preference for spaceships, and grand battles with mecha blowing things up. The mecha designs were unique being less bulky than usual and compacted with thin limbs to fit a female pilot, and the action was exactly what i signed up for. The music was average in the opening and ending theme, but better during parts where the voice actors sang the verses themselves; the song of choice had a special meaning in the anime and was quite catchy. \\n\\n\r\nFinally one of the aspects of Cross Ange I personally enjoyed the most was the total lack of modesty and things like propriety was thrown out the window. Skin and lots of skinship was shown not always as fanservice but more as a natural part of being self. It's refreshing to watch behaviour wise the complete lack of conformity to social expectations the characters enacted. Freedom is not only in choices but also in the mind as characters like Ange and Hilde shows us.",

            "content": "If I could describe this anime with an amount of words you could count on one hand I'd call it this - an experience.\r\nCross Ange does very few things right. Its CG is generally bad, the characters can be very inconsistent, the story is all over the place, its pacing is a force of nature, and its \"fanservice\" ranges from questionable to disgusting. It uses overdone comedy gags. It has a male lead so uninteresting that you can't help but root for him. The main character is so flawed that you can't help but love her. The anime sometimes forgets what genre it is. Itcan't decide what it wants its setting to be. And I loved it from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nCross Ange is kind of like a movie that so bad that it's good, with the difference being that this actually shows a semblance of a budget and can be entertaining without MST3K or Rifftrax. It tends to not make sense, it has a ton of scenes that don't need to be there, and it poops all over consistency like it was a Taco Bell toilet. However, despite (or because) all of its flaws, it is a very entertaining anime. I'm not kidding. Aside from maybe Kill la Kill, this show is one of the fastest and easiest I've ever binge watched. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is the ultimate \"having fun\" anime. It spits in the face of death. The clothing can barely be classified as clothing. You don't even need to be drunk or high to enjoy it. The lead character is a badass chick who takes shit from nobody, and it's great to see a pragmatic character who pisses on things like honor or friendship so that they can reach their goal. Be it freedom or beating the crap out of a megalomaniac, Ange will  do whatever it takes to get what she wants, and she does it in a way that makes you want to cheer her on.\\n\\n\r\nObviously, it has flaws, and if you're looking for a serious anime, you've taken a VERY wrong turn. This is an anime that can be compared to movies like The Expandables, Samurai Cop, or a rejected Quentin Tarantino movie that he drafted when he was thirteen. It's all action, all fanservice, spitting in the face of its own plot, and having literally no real message by the end.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is not required viewing. If you enjoy \"trash media\", you will love it. I am writing this review immediately after the final episode. I am three rum-and-cokes in, and I jumped back and forth between sober and drunk while watching this series. Hlell, I am writing this review while drunk. It's only really solid between episodes 8 - 11, and everything before and after that is just a poorly designed roller coaster that you can't help but have fun on. This is a very fun anime. You should, however, avoid it if you want anything with a shred of credibility, seriousness, tact, gratuitous sexual assault, fully clothed women, or a compelling male lead character. \\n\\n\r\nI like shit like The Room, Manos: Hands of Fate, etc. This show is nowhere near as terrible as those types, but it falls into a similar category of being terrible technically, but lovable from an enjoyment standpoint. It isn't the anime of the year. From an objective point, it's probably a 4/10, or even a 3/10. But if you told me to rate how much I enjoyed this, it's a 9/10, and it would be even higher were it not for the disrespectful sexual assault scenes.",

            "content": "Alright. So, first off, I agree with Nyron in all points.\r\nCross Ange is a giant trainwreck. By watching it, you will likely experience some levels of self-hatred and you will most definitely question your sanity and self-respect, but.\r\nIf you're the type of person who's in for that - you'll usually know after the first or first three episodes - you'll get a heckload of enjoyment out of it.\r\nIf not, move on, call it a day. Simple as that.\r\nStory - 7. Now, don't get me wrong. I adore the plot. Especially the way it goes up to the end of Hilda's and Ange's arc (episode 11).Nothing is bad about this. It's a solid story, it does an incredibly good job showcasing that racism sucks despite being a fanservice anime. \\n\\n\r\nThe prison action is too edgy at times, but still, really good. The arc where they hang out in another world drags a bit, but establishes relationships we need later.\\n\\n\r\nUp 'til this point, I'd still rate it 8. But then the Embryo deal comes along and honestly, I did not need this. I'm glad that a bunch of lesbians and one heterosexual team up against a mad scientist misogynist otaku crossbreed but, we really didn't need this. I also didn't need Tusk becoming relevant and invoking boring normal fanservice anime tropes. I preferred the sketchy lesbian fanservice a lot. Yeah. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt - 7. The CGI is pretty; I like the chaser and mech designs a lot. Character designs are 'here's your fanservice cast', which, good enough for me tbh. One episode is really awful with off-model shots and since it's overall pretty average aside from the CGI... yeah, 7.\\n\\n\r\nSound - 10. I'm a sucker for Akiko Shikata's ominous chorus-heavy compositions such as the Villkiss theme. It stood out a lot to me. Aside from that, some really good insert songs (El Ragna's one-hundred versions). It just met my aesthetic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6. Alright here is where it gets awkward. It starts out really good on characterization; Salia in particular, desperate and frustrated as she might be, stays consistent until the very end. \\n\\n\r\nAnge is really good, too, with how she turns from 'awful pampered princess' to 'reckless loner jerk with a heart of gold'  to 'capable leader with some reckless tendencies'. It's good. \\n\\n\r\nBut then there's Hilda. Hilda starts out really good. Competent, prone to friendly fire, generally an awful person, would do anything to achieve her goals. That's good. Her arc shattering her was to be expected, the aftermath in prison with Ange is /really/ good, too, but after that she's more of a tsundere archetype than... anything else, really. She was really promising though, so I'll cut her some slack.\\n\\n\r\nSalamandinay was... nice. Exactly what she should be, her dynamic with Ange was a good addition in this cast.\\n\\n\r\nErsha and Vivian were consistent. Tusk was Generic Anime Dude, but with Ange around he was sort of bearable. Their relationship felt forced. Could've been worse.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's Chris, completely ruined by Embryo arc.\\n\r\nRosalie was meh. Expected for a non-focus character, though. And Embryo was as hateworthy as he should be. Sylvia, too.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10. Yeah, you heard me. I don't mind sketchy lesbian fanservice, I don't mind cheap bait, this is fine for me. I admit I got creeped out by the spanking, but it's fine, y'know. I also sort of hate myself for enjoying but, oh well.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall - 8. Welp. That's me being nice admittedly, but come on.",

            "content": "Surprisingly solid for an ecchi action-drama anime mix, Cross Ange explores our titular heroine, Ange, being exiled from her kingdom as a princess when it is discovered that she hasn't inherited the ability to use magic like the majority of humankind and is forced into serving as a mech pilot to combat enemy dragons that enter into her world. But as Ange fights on against said dragons, she comes to realize that the nature of the world is not as what as it would seem on the surface when she discovers some shocking truths concerning it.\r\nBefore I get into what makes the series solid forthe most part, let us explore the rather obvious barrier that will keep many from considering watching this series in the form of its ecchi content. While not as hard with perverted content as titles like Seikon no Qwaser, Cross Ange still tosses in the typical elements of the genre that include scantily-clad attire for the female mech pilots, lingerie and bikini shots, lesbians, sexual humor that includes a running gag of Tusk falling into Ange's crotch, breast groping, bathing scenes, scenes of implied or full-on intercourse, and non-detailed nudity on prominent display. The first third of the series devotes a good deal of its time on its perverted shenanigans and has been known to turn-off first time viewers of the series. While some of these bits do carry over into later episodes, the series fortunately reduces its focus on them as the plot becomes more focused on exploring the truths that Ange comes to discover about her world.\\n\\n\r\nWhat allows Cross Ange to stick out from many of the typical mindless ecchi romps is the engaging storytelling and character exploration it offers up from the events affecting Ange and other non-magic folk. The world that Ange lives in considers non-magic folk to be societal outcasts and are isolated from society upon being discovered. Facing this prejudice upon having her non-magical origins discovered affects Ange's psyche a great deal throughout the span of the series as she becomes cold and detached from others due to the fear and mistrust she develops from being discriminated against and forced into fighting dragons. As she spends more time with the non-magic folk and learns of some shocking truths to how her world is ruled, this drives her to eventually defy the established world order of the series. This development also extends to other non-magic folk in the series as Cross Ange devotes time to exploring the pasts of several of the mech pilots that led them into their present predicaments and develops a number of the characters and their relationships with others. The later villain revealed in the series, Embryo, is also a rather cunning and manipulative one with his knowledge of the world's hostilities and technology, and taking advantage of the vulnerabilities of several characters to bring them to his side.\\n\\n\r\nOutside of the ecchi content, Cross Ange does have some shortcomings in regards to its plotting and characters. There are some unexplored plot elements and holes (Ange and Salamandinay's past connections and how Tusk survives a seemingly suicidal attack being notable ones), and some characters get little fleshing out to make them as irredeemably or over-the-top evil as possible.\\n\\n\r\nStill if you can tolerate the regular sights of ecchi to be found through Cross Ange, it still makes for one of the better quality offerings of the genre thanks to its solid exploration of the issues surrounding its world and how they affect Ange and other non-magic characters.\\n",

            "content": "Cross Ange is...a very singular mecha anime, the diversity of it's elements is something that makes it great. When I watched the first chapters, I tought this anime had potential to develop into a good story, and that's what it did. Do not let the high amounts of fanservice to keep you away from this show...It's a roller coaster of emotions and actual trama untill the last episode.\r\nStory: 8\r\nSo, this starts in a future utopian world where wars are over and people live in peace, but this Utopia has it's flaws, as it condemns those who don't have the \"Mana Light\" power, and forces themto fight Alien Beings known as \"DRAGON\". A curious subversion of the sunrise mecha trope where the MC and it's allies have special talents and powers, as the main characters are actually the only people in the world without the \"Mana\" powers, alsot the adversaries in this anime are incredibly overpowered (specially for the main antagonist). Another thing to add, is the gradual darkening of the story, revelations about the true nature of the enemies and the setting make it for the weak beginnng, later episodes have been awesome, and with a nice story rythm. Be warned: This anime stats as a Real Robot, but eventualy becomes a super robot.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nColorful and lively, the Character design feels very vibrant, as with Sunrise most recent mecha series, Ange and the girls are pretty, Backgrounds have nothing in special most of the time, panoramic views are good, the mecha design is actually pretty good. However, the animation quality falls off hard in some scenes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nFrom Nana's Opening theme, to the OST and Theme Songs, this anime shines in good audio, surely Ange's being voiced by Nana Mizuki adds a point to this, surely BGM is superb at key scenes, the second opening and ending are good in the sound aspect, perhaps the sound is one of the best things in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nWhile being a Mecha Anime, we finally see that Main Character is a Girl, while that hyped the train before this anime's relase, soon it came a little disapointing for too many people. the reason is simple: Ange doesn't start rocking hard, in fact, she starts as a very weak and arrogant person, but that's the key to this series! Ange's development is actually good and interesting, her path from being a little selfish girl to a badass soldier was superb, It didn't feel rushed or incoherent, but the development on Ange is arguably the best thing in the show. Other Characters also become relevant and developed later in the anime, but, the main plot revolves around few relevant characters. But, we don't see a mecha with a ton of bishoujo as badass pilots everyday. At least cross ange went out of the square and tried something a bit different. \\n\r\nSpecial to point out Hilda, that girl went from despicable to lovable in a few chapters. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\r\nAs a fan of mecha series, I can say Cross Ange feels like fresh air for the recent times, as most mecha anime in the last times felt very generic. And, personally, I actually enjoy the ecchi stuff packed with Cross Ange, and I guess more people will enjoy that, perhaps not the old bone mecha fans, but the more casual viewer. That apart, the action, emotionals roller coasters and rythm of the show make the enjoyment rise.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the main antagonist, Is ....simply superb, a Mix between an Utopian God, and a complete Sociopath.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nI waited for so long for a Female MC in a mecha, and I got just what I wished for. Cross Ange is Great. Overall, good music, nice characters, good action, yuri and ecchi service, dragons, and going from real robot to super robot.\\n",

            "content": "Foreword:\r\nFanservice... can't say I hate it, in fact I love it. Fanservice, when done right, is like a harlot standing at the edge of the street. She whispers to you, waves to you with her silken handkerchief.  And, when she gets your attention, she puts forth a leg and begins drawing up her skirt. The skin of her glossy, smooth leg begins to reveal and she keeps pulling higher and higher, only to stop at the top of the thighs. Your imagination starts running wild as you imagine everything beneath it. Black, white, purple? Hairy, shaved, smooth? \r\nAs your thoughts take over, you beginmaking your way to her; unable to resist the seductive lure. And as you are about make contact with her you hear an ungainly shout, \"FANSERVICE\". \\n\r\nYou turn your attention to the voice only to see another harlot with a distorted, unattractive smile across her face, running down the street with her skirt held well at the chest, revealing everything. \\n\r\n\"FANSERVICE\", she yells again. She turns left and right, baring for all to see. People turn and stare, but not out of titillation, but out of its obnoxiousness. The ruse proves ineffective as people begin to turn away and continue on about their business. This woman is Cross Ange.\\n\\n\r\nSo there I was, sitting on a nearby bench, watching this all unfold. I too would have left if it were not for the fact that I had little else to do at this point. The woman continued to twist her face into that unsavoury smile whilst baring her underwear for passer-bys to see. But no one pays her much attention, and, after a while, she gives up and slumps home. Curious, I follow her. She arrives at a dingy house and goes inside, I follow. Standing in the doorway, I see her silhouette in the dark room. She's crying as she holds her hand over a book. \"PLOT\" I think was the book's title. But the tears are short lived as she notices me in the doorway. She turns, and that unpleasant smile begins creeping across her face once more. She lifts her skirt and shrieks, \"FANSERVICE\". Instinctively, I bolt out of there and run. I lose her after crossing the street and blending myself with another harlot. When she gives up, I return home. But with little to do, I decided to grab a pair of binoculars and watch her from afar. \\n\\n\r\nI watch her for several weeks. And surprisingly, she's not your average lunatic, though I am not implying that she isn't just as deranged. But there was more to her than what was initially shown. There was a warrior side to her as she'd often hunt dragons and bounties. There was a vulnerable side to her, as she would visit a select few graves where she would sit on her knees with tears streaming down her cheeks. And of course there was the obnoxious side of her, where she'd run through the streets yelling and baring  for all to see. But alas, my observations come to an end as nothing further develops.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, this woman, Cross Ange, has shown herself to be quite erratic and oblivious as to how to present herself in an appealing manner. Though she appears like this in public, there is a more sensitive and deeper side to her. And whilst I wouldn't say that she's necessarily horrible... she is, after all however... a lunatic.\\n\\n\\n\r\nReview - done short:\\n\r\nStory 7:\\n\r\nI'm surprised I gave this a 7. The problem with the story is that it seems to want to mash together too many concepts. It wants to include dragons because, 'oooooo' dragons. It wants to include mechs because, 'wow' mechs. It wants to include a god-like character because, 'hunger games underdog style tension'. The idea of having a sheltered protagonist go from weak to strong-willed is pretty nice, Ange just gets randomly saved one too many times for me to take her seriously, not to mention the random power buff that she gains which also plagues general shounen. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the good part is that there actually was some sort of story overall, despite its flaws.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7:\\n\r\nThe character designs are somewhat bland and the girls tend to not be that attractive, the backgrounds are pretty average with the smudge, oil paint sort of style. The mechs however, were decent. The strikes had force behind it, giving it weight and I did like the transformations.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 5:\\n\r\nThe characters were so run of the mill that I would often wonder if I'm actually watching a poorer version of To Love Ru. \\n\\n\r\nThe male character is the typical beta male character who doesn't really accomplish much except this time he lacks a harem.\\n\\n\r\nThe female characters, except for the maid, are pretty much either in a love-hate relationship with Ange or they're just jealous of her.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 6:\\n\r\nWhen the ecchi moments came up, it just felt forced. Instead of something that you'd want to rewind and watch again, it was more like something you'd want to fast forward. The character interactions were so poorly written it was like reading a high schooler's essay when they're trying to hit the 1000 word mark by using a bunch of redundant filling words. The combat, however I did find quite appealing and enjoyed that quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 5:\\n\r\nIt's nothing to recommend. In fact, I would tell people to skip this anime unless they want an example of how NOT to make one.",

            "content": "I personally love \"Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo\" both subbed and dubbed. It's with full honesty tied for my number one spot of my favorite anime of all time list. It was great as a drama, mecha, harem, romance, and action packed adventure. The plot was solid, it's characters and lead complex, and was just dripping with atmosphere. I found the story and setting just so emotionally intriguing and interesting. I found all the characters to be surpurbly developed by the series end which is why I was so into it. It showed a complete story arc for almost every character in theseries both supporting and Main. That's something I'm sure is seen in anime but it just felt so well done for me personally. I know it's definitely over the top and cheesy at times, but that just makes me kinda enjoy it more, it knew what it wanted to be and I say it did it right. \\n\r\nIt's various twists and turns had me on the edge and totally invested the whole time, in fact it's one of the few animes I've rewatched more than three times and will definitely rewatch in the future to relive the whole thing for years to come.\\n\\n\r\nMy only complaint is that there isn't more of the series to watch, like an ova. Honestly that's the sign of a true classic, the fact it left me still wanting more even to this day. So if your looking for a anime with solid story, strong female leads, and just all around original epicness, I definitely recommend you check out cross ange. It's defenatley worth the watch.\\n\\n\r\nSo yeah, I know might see this as over praise, but I'm sure we all have something like this in anime and this one is will as always be mine. By the way is my first review, I wanted to keep it short and sweet to hit the high points with no plot spoilers. I had just finished rewatching the dubbed version when I wrote this review, still lived up to its epicness.\\n\\n\r\n (I want to give a shout out to all my fellow Cross Ange: Tenshi to Ryuu no Rondo fans! Keep up the fandom guys\u270c!)",

She must fight everyday to live on and she is pretty damn goodat it. She doesn\u00b4t put up with every bullshit, is though, strong willed and an ace at fighting. Every inch the woman, sexy and a lead character with personality. She surely is memorable and a strong point of the show. (Alongside with the great OST)\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of the Story progression we have the first one or two episodes that feel a bit annoying, sometimes cruel and awkward. Then the show actually starts to become decent and enjoyable. However be prepared that around the middle the pacing will change and we will often see plot twists and weird shit going on.  From that point onward you can\u00b4t really tell what\u00b4s going to happen in the next episode. Illogical stuff occurs and some things aren\u00b4t explained.\\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem I have with this show, is that at a certain point it had no more clear identity. I didn\u00b4t see or get what it wants to be.\\n\r\nThe creators tossed everything, that they thought will be appealing for the viewer, into a blender and pressed ON. The outcome is a smoothie, that tastes like everything, but you can\u00b4t really define one of the flavours exactly, nor does any of them stand out. It\u00b4s purpose is, that it\u00b4s a drink for everyone. \\n\\n\r\nImagine, you watching an episode and there\u00b4s some really cruel shit happenening, lots of blood, people dying, corpses burning. Then the next episodes you feel like you are watching an awkward slice of life romance with supposedly humoric elements. The next episode you are in a postapocalyptic, asian style like, wonderworld. And after that? Guess what, pure Michael Bay\\n\r\naction! Armored combat in mechas above the sea with many explosions.\\n\r\nFeels awkward man.\\n\\n\r\nOn top of that, we have illogical things happenening here and there, that don\u00b4t get explained. One of theese events even made me rage. (Almost ragequit heh!) \\n\r\nOh and lots of Deus Ex Machina of course to kill every bit of tension that could build up.\\n\\n\r\nI wont say it\u00b4s outright bad or horrible, but there isn\u00b4t anything great in it either. \\n\r\nLike I mentioned before there is identity missing. \\n\r\nThe \u201ejack of all trades\u201c mentality is bullshit. And it kills the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\n5 from me\\n\r\nCheers\\n",

            "content": "Overall 8 out of 10\r\nThis is an anime that best described as 'ballsy'. The creators are ambitious not just in terms of the art, animation and music, but also in story and characterizations. The show was not afraid to expose the darker sides of human nature, focusing heavily on displaying bigotry, selfishness, hatred, and jealousy of the majority of the characters including Ange herself, particularly  in the first few episodes. The overall feel of the show is just like the titular main character Ange: courageous, quick to be violent, often reckless, sometime cute, and full of exposed female skin (read: fanservice). But if youare willing to go through these rough bumps in the middle, then you are in for one hell of a roller coaster adventure and character developments ever seen in a 25 episode anime. The show accomplished much in the end, transforming from a dark cynical human drama into a hopeful story of fighting for your own free will, camaraderie, acceptance, and forgiveness.\\n\\n\r\nI think this anime is great in a way that it excels in developing the world and its characters to its full potential. A character in this anime is rarely one-sided and rarely feel wasteful. If you are looking for an anime with plenty character development, then you should watch Cross Ange. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The amount of frivolity and nudity can put you off, but if this is not your first Shounen or Seinen anime, then you'll be fine. \\n\\n",

            "content": "It seems like this anime really polarized the community and reviews here. I discovered it late myself and watched it through in one sitting and I found it very enjoyable. It is not without its flaws though. \r\nSummary: 8/10\r\nCross Ange is a brutal emotional anime in many ways. You will not like the characters in the beginning, in fact I hated most of them, but this is because you are viewing broken characters that are trying to cope in the aftermath of being rejected by society. The beginning is intriguing and full of emotional lurches. It can be hard to stick with it but I'dsay give it a chance. There are redeeming elements and it does go somewhere interesting. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 5/10\\n\r\nTBH the story wasn't anything to write home about. The antagonist was opaque and not well-developed. A standard \"hate this guy\" sort of character. The anime is full of plot holes as well imho and I found myself wishing things were better developed. However, I still enjoyed it. As someone who loves science I found the technology and societies kind of interesting. You have multiple examples of attempts of \"utopia\" and get to see the flaws of each one. Including one without a currency at all. An underlying theme of the anime is that people are selfish and thus a perfect society is impossible. And that even in utopia people want to find racism and something to hate. Also that meeting people's needs does not make them better people or happy as the \"contented\" population soon shows its ugly colors in the face of something new or different. These themes though simple were interesting to me and thus I don't list the story as \"bad\" even though it had its issues. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\n   Damn these characters. xD I hated a lot of them for a long time. They are mean to each other, petty, and the heroine isn't any better for a long time. Some people felt they were 2D. Maybe many were, but to me they seemed to have a realistic depth absent in many other anime. And for a lot of them you got to learn more about their past, see what made them the way they were, and see a kind of hope and redemption begin to kindle in them. That said, they were frustratingly slow and dense at times. That doesn't necessary make them bad characters though, many real humans I know are just like this. In the end I found myself appreciating a lot of the characters and thinking of them as very real people which caused me to rate the characters highly. I also loved the main protagonist which is a pretty strong female lead as far as anime go. She's very stubborn and badass and even in the end when she learns to accept friendships and help she never leans heavily on others. This was pretty refreshing from the norm. \\n\r\n   That said, if you are looking for perfect realism and a diverse cast you won't find it. The story mainly centers around women that have been outcast from society and they are dealing with many issues, not always in a healthy way. There are maybe 2 important men and only one has any sort of development (and not a lot). That said the male character did show some nice development but it was mainly relational. He was extremely stereotypical in the beginning. As for the women: much better. Some break, some become badass, some actually grow a little bit of heart in the end. But the development of most of the characters is not happy or necessarily realistic nor are they completely finished healing in the end. They are just...broken people. Which I kind of liked and the anime certainly tried hard in this aspect. Most anime don't do nearly so well and the characters never emerge from their respective stereoptypes. Where it may be lacking is \"realistic development\" you get to learn a depth for many characters but not all of them change appreciably or realistically due the the adrenaline pace of the show. The changes, if they occur, are generally under stress and sudden and through use of emotional plot devices. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10\\n\r\nI didn't notice it until hindsight but many ppl said this was lazy animation. The CGI is pretty obvious and the motion animation can be a bit choppy. That said, I've watched anime for a long time and I didn't find it too jarring. It was ok, but certainly nothing special. This is probably the place to mention the excessive fanservice. I get it, this is what makes anime sell, but it was kind of jarring in this show. To suddenly see common tropes like the one guy tripping and falling onto the MC's crotch like 10 times throughout the show. For a show that was staying emotional and dark for a lot of the duration the sudden comedic tropes seemed out of place and bad. Like a director ordered in more fanservice or something to make sure the thing would sell. The lesbian scenes are also not very realistic and more to show some skin then anything else. It could have been a lot better done. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 10/10\\n\r\nomg the soundtrack! This is really the best aspect of this show in my opinion. They picked nice music and paired it well with the animation and fight scenes. And the music was very beautiful, I found myself humming along. The voices, harmony, and string instruments were a nice touch to the general pop sounds in many anime. \\n\\n\r\nSo, in summary, I liked this show a lot. Mainly for the unique mix of adrenaline action, good pairing of music, somewhat deeper characters then you often get full of flaws but developed and changing as it progresses, and a main female lead I really liked that stayed strong throughout and really grew as a character into someone the others respected and liked. You may or may not like what she becomes as she does have a brutal and arrogant streak but I liked her. All the characters were this way having good and bad aspects. It is part of what made me believe in them as characters. \\n\\n\r\nThings the show could have done better: Working on the plot more to make a more believable outside world, better coherency, developing the antagonist more as he was incredibly 2D and you learned very little about him, making the few male characters a bit less stereotypical with more development, removing the comedic fanservice tropes entirely (they could have had it but made it less stereotypical and it would have served a nice purpose rather then as a distraction), not relying so heavily on really emotional themes like rape and racism to push the plot along or control who the viewers dislike. Don't get me wrong, those themes added a nice darkness but there could have been better ways of accomplishing what they wanted that weren't so forced. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end though, the show still left me with a great feeling. Flawed certainly, and certainly not close to \"the best\", but better then most of the anime I've watched to date, and I've watched hundreds.",

            "content": "I don't normally watch mecha animes, because I had believed that most of them were nothing and featured only pieces of scrap metal clanging to each other. However after watching Cross Ange, I came to a realization that not all mecha anime are just MECHA only. Some of them had real drama in it, and Cross Ange is one of them. \r\nStory - \r\nWe get a rich-ass and spoiled princess who finds out that she doesn't have any powers, and is therefore brandished as a monster. After realizing that her family doesn't love her anymore, she abandons her old princess identity and takes on therole of a serious soldier.  I find that as this type of story may have been used before, it worked quite well here. \\n\\n\r\nArt - \\n\r\nSunrise Studios. OK, if you want a mecha anime, go to Sunrise. They are the veterans at making these types of shows. From the original Mobile Suit Gundam, they are BACK! I did see Buddy Complex as well, which was also made by Sunrise, and that I liked. \\n\\n\r\nSound - \\n\r\nNo score because I don't normally care about music.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter - \\n\r\nAnge is a former princess who was exiled from her kingdom because of her lack of powers and sent to a military operation to fight DRAGONS. Realizing her former kingdom wasn't her home anymore, she abandons the princess and becomes the soldier. This is quite the development, from a spoiled brat to an independent person. Who can argue with that haha!\\n\\n\r\nWhen we first see Hilda, we see her as a typical bully who picks on the new one, Ange. Her revenge grows when Ange's disabordination causes Zola to get killed. Later on, as Ange is able to steal a ship to try to return home, she clashes with Hilda for it, only for Hilda to lose. She reveals her intent to return home, and Ange supports her, as they both were returning to their families. After their return despite their families disowning them, they sympathize with each other and become friends.\\n\\n\r\nSalia is known to be quite devoted to her job ever since Alektra/Jill lost her arm. Salia is serious and dilligent and very loyal to Jill. After Ange's arrival, she seems to have lost loyally in Jill and became friends with her. But after the battle of Arzenal, she believed that the others abandoned her and joins Embryo. But after Ange is able to foil Embryo's plan, she reverts back to their side. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - \\n\r\n10 because this is one mecha anime that proved to me that not all mecha anime are boring.\\n\\n",

That just because the story may not be to your liking mostly cause of plot it dose not mean it didn't  try it's best to give the message that it was made to convey to you.\r\nFor Example most people don't like SAO , Fairy tail or Bleach for numerous reasons but let be clear that these animes may have it's moments when you say things like \"why\", \"this is stupid\" or worst \"i hated that\". Truth be told there are animes i didn't enjoy because it didn'tsend a message but just something random.Now where i'm going with this is that sometimes no matter the reason you hated the anime is in fact irreverent to the fact did you learn anything from the anime that the creator wanted you to learn.\\n\\n\r\nNow if you say you hate something you have freedom to say but one day when your bored try watching animes you hated to see if you change your opinion of them.\\n\\n\r\nAlso before i'm done let me add that this  anime has similarities to many mecha animes so if you did not enjoy them try looking up there related ones to find a anime that who knows you might likes.\\n\\n\r\nFor Example When i finished Strain: Strategic Armored Infantry i was so emotional so then i looked for similar anime like it. So i found Cross Ange , at first i though this was a like either a duplicate of Strain or a sister to it.\\n\r\nSo i checked out the episodes and as i watched the series i realized that even though it looked surprising weird or similar to strain i  was really enjoying it. When i finished it i was emotional like with strain.\\n\\n\r\nNow I know some people hate and like certain animes but no matter our feeling toward them its good to find something you learned from it even if its small.\\n\\n\r\nI hoped i helped \\n",

This is like a lesson to us to not humiliate or show hatred to people being different, because those people gets bad endings :P \r\nThe first few episodes are the episodes where I think weren't pretty much appropriate in my point of view since it did freak me out when I realised what happened to her. That's why i lowered the enjoyment a little because of that. The first few episodeswere the ones that I will not want myself to watch again. You'll know why when you watch it. \\n\\n\r\nAnge, the protagonist goes through deep hell as her life goes from being deadly respected to the ones at a level where they don't have a place to go except hell. Going through 2 traumas that completely changed her, which makes her the cool Ange now ^.^ Other characters were worth feeling bad for and had different personalities so the personalities won't bump to other mains. EXCEPT FOR EMBRYO WHERE HE\"S THE WORST OF THEM ALL.\\n\\n\r\nThe art was beyond amazing where arts of the para mails and ragna mails were nicely done, the space and time thingy was beautiful and it feels like you're in paradise. Buildings and others were nicely made, place like Dawn Pillar and the Temple was nice.\\n\\n\r\nThere was also fan service, the so called fan service is to watch the stupid Embryo try and torture the shit out of Salia and Ange.  Where the other fan services is something to ship for :3\\n\\n\r\nThe music where Ange and Salako had to sing their songs to release the final keys was superb, as is got me to tears in a few scenes. Always expect good stuff from Nana Mizuki for all the vocal parts. Other OST were nice, only a few were under my expectations but those will happen but others are perfect for Cross Ange",

            "content": "Its probably high time that i should give a piece of my mind on this anime. Perhaps the word ecstasy would describe the show more since probably the production team was super high when making this anime. The unimaginable combos of multiple genres cramped in a 25 episodes of sex and explosions was what made it special and stand out among the rest. The story was so bad it was a brilliant roller coaster shitfest that would leave you craving for more at the end of every episode.\r\nCross Ange was a disaster of a storyline that combines action, sci-fi, mecha and ecchi all together inone. Despite having only 25 episodes, the pacing was so well done that the director doesn't even let you use the toilet. But because of it's rapid story progression we are in for a good ride as Cross Ange doesn't just live in one world, or two... but multiple worlds. Oftentimes you will find watching Cross Ange is better than taking an LSD trip because most of the things doesn't even make sense but it all still comes together in the end. The world of Cross Ange constantly shoves new twists and turns down your throat leaving you craving for more and wondering what would happen next at the end of every episode. Follow our main girl Ange and her bunch of pariahs as they starts off as outcast to guardians of the galaxies before finally becoming the heroes of multiple timelines. The adventure of our female rights group will surely leave you thinking why the hell not give them their rights since you probably wouldn't even mind being dominated by one.\\n\\n\r\nThe art...especially character designs, were brilliantly made as each character had their very own unique and distinctive style to it. Their beautiful designs made them easily remembered and creates lasting impression. Although the female casts were \"kinda\" sexualized but nothing near the point of having physic wrecking boobies that makes you turn away. Cross Ange also presents us with a somewhat average but kinda handsome main guy and lets not forget our sassy but fabulous villian man. If you ask me my favourite girl? It has to be Ange or that sassy as f**k Hilda. Overall, the animation quality was decent although sometimes its obvious the studio yells budget cut when you saw a few recycled scenes or choppyass cgi. Nevertheless, it doesn't affect much of the anime itself since its few and far between.\\n\\n\r\nNow the sound...no beating around the bush, its darn amazing. Be it combat sequences, emotional moments or even steamy bed scenes, Cross Ange bestows you a range of beautiful and irreplaceable soundtracks that accompanies you in your jerking sessions when watching this anime. Personally, my ears had great times getting penetrated by both OPs and EDs, i found them really fits the first and second half respectively.\\n\\n\r\nNow, the character development was really appreciable since all the casts did get their very well deserved screen time. The diverse cast of females, specifically...had more to uncover and they did it marvelously, their character developments were completely fleshed out be it on the robot, off the robot...or even on the bed. Viewers had plentiful of opportunities to observe our casts up close and get to know them better. The male casts? Who cares! Actually, i found our main guy likeable although sometimes it felt like he was there for the female empowerment theme. And our villian guy was as cliched as ever but, his clichedness befits exactly the whole deranged storyline.\\n\\n\r\n**I found Cross Ange really entertaining...really daring...everything was insane, the casts were beautiful, the great adventure through multiple worlds and the world building was simply fantastic...Cross Ange felt like it was written by an uber drunk madman who was really depressed and is ready to move on to the next world in order to find a place where he truly belongs. \\n\\n\r\nIt has a completed storyline so...bonus score!\\n\\n\r\nMy verdict : 10/10\\n\r\nThis work of art right here is truly what i would call...a craptastic masterpiece. \\n",

She's an unhinged fallen princess who will shoot first and ask questions later. No guns? No problem, she'll use swords, knives, or broken china to get stab-happy without ever getting a good bead on thesituation, think Archer meets Excel with blind murderous rage thrown in. She's also quick to point out the absurdity of the situation and has enough snark of someone who has landed far beyond the fourth wall. Honestly, listening to her smartass reactions to serious situations and her total disregard for the genre is comedic gold. Her commenting on that this isn't her first time to be publicly executed more or less sums up the character and the tone of the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhat is it about?\\n\\n\r\nNot-so-magic princesses, Orange is the New Black, parallel worlds, mecha, dragons... and lots of oral sex (lesbian, male on female, female on male... they don't discriminate). There are giant mecha battles set to deafening, cheerful jpop music, stripperific flight suits, increasingly absurd premises, rape... with Ange just shrugging all that shit off and shooting, stabbing, or beating the nearest MFer she thinks is responsible--whether rightfully or not.\\n\\n\r\nThere's a sheer brilliance to the absurd violence and plot twists, and there are token red shirt characters you KNOW will die, and their horrid deaths are predictable and almost funny once you get the insane premise of the world this anime lives in.\\n\\n\r\nIt's like John Wick, Ange is a destructive force of nature that spends most of her time looking for something to curb stomp--which is whatever you put in front of her. It's a story of revenge where she goes after everyone who wronged her and pays them back in absurdly violent and ludicrous ways. It's an exploitation anime that KNOWS it's an exploitation anime and runs with it like an idiot with scissors. It's a genre defying hot mess of plot holes, stupid plot developments, asinine characterization that is a big fat kancho from Sunrise to its viewers. \\n\\n\r\nThe fact that Ange is aware of this, and every snarky comment from her and over the top act of violence only foments this elegant premise. But unlike parody anime, it wants to be taken seriously, and plays it straight.\\n\\n\r\nThis level of absurdity is what got me into anime decades ago, and it's great to see it alive and well today.",

            "content": "Cross Ange is a treat and I'm glad I picked it up. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but despite it's one major flaw I took great enjoyment in watching it.\r\nI'm going to get this out of the way right now though. This show uses fanservice as a means of buying your attention and at times it can be infuriatingly bad because of it. Despite this however, the show does attempt to use most of it for the sake of progressing the stories and the characters so to a point it can be forgiven. The fanservice is not as bad as some might lead you tobelieving and it is at its worst towards the beginning and levels off fairly quickly. I'm not a person who automatically loathes nor condones fanservice so long as sexualtiy is a theme in the story or characters and is at least used for building. Kill la Kill is a good example of a show that uses sexuality and fanservice to convey a message. Cross Ange however falls a bit short in this reguard. The fanservice most of the time is just that, fanservice. But to the show's credit once the ball gets rolling it focuses on the characters and the story first.\\n\\n\r\nWith that out of the way, I will move on to what I enjoyed. The story was quite good. I never got to the point where I was bored with a setting or a situation because the plot stayed dynamic and the stakes kept rising. The world is interesting and you get a better understanding of things as the story progresses. That said it isn't quite perfect. It does use some conveniences and a couple of twists are a little hard to believe but these are minor problems.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Sound I rated about the same. They were both fairly standard with nothing terribly eye-catching or ghastly. The DRAGONs have fairly unique designs though I wish they would have been fleshed out a little better with a little more distinct variety. Additionally the Para-mails and later the Ragna-mails could have used more variety, unlike a show like Code Geass where different models are distinct yet clearly from the same base, the Mails from Cross Ange are mostly generic with slight color changes just so you can tell who is who. Additionally the show makes use of some stock footage which I noticed more and more towards the end and of course CGI. Nothing spectacular but I didn't hate it. The First OP was by far my favorite while the second was a bit lack-luster to me, as were both primary ED songs.  The internal soundtrack doesn't include too much that was overtly interesting. The three character songs were interesting and I wish I had that Operatic vocal track on loop but oh well. \\n\\n\r\nThe meat and potatoes of this show is the characters. Watching Ange evolve through the course of the story was a treat and was a pleasure in comparison to the rather stagnate female characters and archetypes of other shows in recent history. At her worst she is a bit of a typical tsundere but she makes up for it at her best. The supporting cast is also fairly enjoyable. Some could have been played up or been more involved but I forgive them as it is a fairly large cast and it is a fairly short run or episodes. The main support cast are all lively and like Ange all go through a metamorphosis as the show progresses. All of the characters have stakes that effect their decisions and none of the characters seem to make choices merely because \"the plot demanded it.\" Friends become enemies, enemies become friends. It's a dynamic experience to be sure. My only complaint is with two characters, Julio and Sylvia. Anybody who has seen Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion will recognize these characters immediately as they seem to have been pulled straight from that anime, Sylvia in particular at first glance seems to be a Nunnaly clone (admittedly with some twists that I won't spoil) and Julio is a slightly more interesting Clovis Clone.\\n\\n\r\n*Since I have brought it up I also wish to bring up that this anime has taken some major inspirations from Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, which works for better or for worst. Both follow an anti-hero character who is an exiled royal who are fighting against the status quo with science and magic constantly getting involved.  Don't get me wrong, I like Code Geass and it was fun spotting the inspirations but I do wish they would have striven to be a little more subtle. But beyond that I don't think it ruins the integrity of Ange's story.\\n\\n\r\nI loved Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons. I binge watched it over the course of three days and I wouldn't mind owning it on my shelf at home. Despite its problems I was happily watching along and I couldn't wait to see what was coming next. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Cross Ange is a bit of an underrated gem. Yes it has problems but I think the good outweighs the bad in this scenario. Yes, it uses boobs and robots to attract a shonen audience, but so did Aim For The Top: Gunbuster, the anime that I hold as my all time favorite anime, and that show had visible nipples. Cross Ange despite its flaws and despite its fanservice is worth the watch. I highly recommend it. Just give it a shot.",

            "content": "Many Spoilers Below.\r\nI was told that \"Cross Ange is worse than Mirai Nikki.\" I did not believe it. Let me assure you, Cross Ange is worse than Mirai Nikki. None of the characters here are interesting, nor do they have any semblance of rational thought. Tusk, in particular, drags the show down. He has got to be the least intelligent male lead in any show I have ever seen. He is constantly failing to do things, usually because he falls into Ange's crotch and gets beaten up by her. He survives an explosion based on the completely logical explanation : \"The knight of Ange isinvincible!\" Shortly after, in the episode preview, it is explained that in between detonating the explosives strapped to his chest and not-dying immediately, Tusk was able to become a ninja and switch to fire-proof clothing because, of course, that will save you from any explosion. Momoka survives falling off a cliff, and a separate explosion from the aforementioned. At least they explained that her gunshot wound was prevented by a conveniently placed object. My eyes were opened, what masterful turnarounds. Embryo-sama, one suave man, let me tell you. He is the embodiment of power, can alter space and time, yet he can't pop a stiffie. Jill and Salia are literally the same character. Vivian was surprisingly one of the less annoying characters, despite appearing like a trope initially. Hilda was probably my favorite. In the beginning she's mean, but she comes around. I also shipped her with Ange, and when Ange kissed her, that was pretty much the only time in the show when I was thinking, \"oh that'd be good!\" and then it happens. Not saying I am a masterful storyteller and have professional analysis skills, just saying disappointment shouldn't be around EVERY CORNER. Bottom line, while these things are mostly my opinion, bottom line is the show is uninteresting, has bad twists, bad characters, below-par animation, and a decent OST. Now here's a fact: in episode 5, Ange tells Tusk her name, despite having previously written it on a posted bulletin in which she attached to the drapes separating her space in the cave from Tusk's, and it reads, \"Ange's Space.\" Thank for for reading, and please, don't watch this show unless you are really bored and want to laugh/cringe.",

            "content": "Do you have tons of time on your hands? Do you enjoy female fanservice? If you didn't answer yes to both of these questions, then don't watch this show. \r\nThis anime is basically everything that your friend, parent, or significant other say that anime is in a demeaning way: overblown, oversexualized, and totally ridiculous. Usually, I could have a defense for all of those things, but for this show, there is no defense. \r\nCross Ange seems very self-aware in the strangest and most demeaning way possible. Essentially, the show's premise is that a marginalized group of non-magic (Mana) wielding humans (all female) called Norma areforced to fight gruesome(?) battles against DRAGONs who appear from holes in the sky in mechs. It has plot twists, crossing dimensions, crossing time, and overall something out of the mind of a 12 year old boy. That coming along with a narrative filled with plot holes and narrative choices which don't make much sense or are consistent. Every kind of ass-pull, anime trope, and cheap emotional effect are used. Sometimes these are used well. Sometimes, these can even be forgiven. But when they happens in practically every episode, then the story becomes a montage of weird. \\n\\n\r\nThe only reason I watched this monstrosity through is the character writing. This show certainly is character driven, beginning with the main character. Initially a pampered princess, Ange transforms into a cold, distant person. Her personality is used as emotional armor against what is presented as a potentially deadly scenario for her as a Norma \"para-mail\" pilot. This change is actually dealt with fairly well, and that's only within 3 episodes. What's great about her character is that she consistently subverts the expectation that protagonist mecha pilots have to show mercy, compassion, or the like. The rest of the show gradually works her towards a more balanced direction. This made sense and seemed to be the central element of the show, and the show was at its best when developing her character. \\n\\n\r\nMost of the supporting characters get minimal backstory treatment, and many actions seem unmotivated at worst. Some of this is a matter of presentation and execution, but there's really no points for effort here. However, a couple of side characters have nice narrative moments and relatively sensible arcs: Tusk, Hilda, and Momoka among them. Furthermore, I sort of liked the cool psychological evil of Embryo as a villain, though he is the epitome of a lack of power ceiling. \\n\\n\r\nNow onto the most troubling part of this anime: the sex. The show, for the first few episodes, is obsessed with women using sex as a means of control against other women. It's kind of disgustingly presented as fanservice at most parts, and is slightly sickening. This kind of makes sense with the situation presented though, being an all-women's prison/military base. Fine, but then don't try and re-present these characters as morally just characters later in the series! Furthermore, later in the show, having male-female sex seems to be some point of \"purity/impurity\"...which even more undermines the position the show originally takes. For a show supposedly presenting a vision of women as powerful figures, this show certainly has shotty decisions leading up to this point in that respect. \\n\\n\r\nThe OP was originally fine, but then they decided when they were going to do a new OP that reusing animations from the first OP would go unnoticed...it didn't. Furthermore, the soundtrack was medicore at best. I didn't really think that the main \"song\" of the anime was particularly good or even used correctly. There are these laughable moments when the VA goes to sing this song and the recorded track, with no transition and full background music, plays as the character sings along. The idea was good, implementation was not. \\n\\n\r\nThere's not much to say about the art. I thought it served the purpose fairly well without adding to or getting in the way of what was mainly a horrible story. There wasn't much about the animation which necessarily stood out, except for the bodies of questionably aged girls. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, this anime should not be watched by anyone who takes themselves seriously. I can't tell whether this was a serious project or a money grab for studio Sunrise. It seems as though there were some subtle nods here and there to the latter in the anime, but it's no roast. It's not even bad enough to be funny at most parts. If you want to watch blonde Lara Croft fight dragons in a Gundam and you absolutely don't care about anything else, this is your show. If not, stay away.",

            "content": "Wow.\r\n\u2026what did I just watch? An Orange is the New Black/Gundam mashup? \u2026with dragons? Yes. \r\nOkay.\r\nI think if I had to describe Cross Ange in one word, it would probably be \u2018deranged\u2019. There are plenty of anime that walk the tightrope of good taste, but Cross Ange spends most of its 25 episode spinning around the rope like a trapeze artist, simultaneously laughing and pissing liberally over the audience. I very nearly dropped this several times (particularly across the first two or three episodes), but somehow it still ended up at a very solid 8. \r\n\u2026again, what did I just watch?\r\nSo, normally I\u2019d go intothe things I liked about a show before I get stuck into the issues I had with it, but in Cross Ange the major issue is so egregious that I really want to talk about it first, and that issue is fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nNow I\u2019ve watched enough anime over the years that I have built up a significant tolerance to the \u2018standard\u2019 fanservice-ey tropes you\u2019re likely to see in the average male-targeted seinen stuff. I\u2019m also entirely prepared to make a spirited defence of the potentially sketchier scenes in shows like Kill la Kill and Monogatari, where sex, sexuality and nudity is used in very deliberate ways to make a point. \\n\\n\r\nThe problem with Cross Ange is that there are several scenes at both the very beginning and the very end of the series that made me genuinely uncomfortable. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m not easy to shock or disgust, but I really don\u2019t want or need to see rape shot like porn.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s particularly annoying in this case, because there\u2019s not actually anything wrong with the script in principle. To put this into context, the early scenes I\u2019m talking about are all to do with the naive and arrogant main character being unexpectedly thrown into what is essentially a particularly brutal women\u2019s prison. She quickly makes enemies of the wrong people with predictable results, considering the setting. The problem is the direction, which definitely seems to think this is something we should be enjoying instead of appropriately conveying the horror of the situation. Without going into spoiler territory, this again becomes an issue in certain scenes towards the end of the show. The events laid out in the script are hideous, but the \u2018cameraman\u2019 is a drooling lech and it makes the whole thing come off as seriously warped. \\n\\n\r\nCross Ange also has a lot of pointlessly revealing character designs. It\u2019s the kind of thing I would usually start to tune out after a while if I\u2019m getting into the show, but it ends up being compounded by the sketchy directorial decisions, and results in several action scenes featuring unfortunate combinations of sex and violence that again, made me kind of uncomfortable.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition to the above, we\u2019re also presented with a major character who seems to be there entirely to run the \u2018oh no I tripped and fell on you in this compromising position\u2019 joke so far into the ground that it\u2019s annihilated in the molten core of the earth. I really hated Tusk by the end of the show; other than that one \u2018joke\u2019, all he ever seemed to do was undermine the competence and motivation of the considerably more interesting characters around him.\\n\\n\r\nSo, if you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019re very likely wondering \u2018So Starfish-san, why the hell should I watch this show and what were you smoking when you gave it an eight?\u2019.\\n\\n\r\nMy answer is that in spite of the many, many flaws, Cross Ange is a fantastically compelling show, with some unusually interesting character development and a hilariously kaleidoscopic mashup of old mecha-anime ideas. \\n\\n\r\nThe central character Ange is definitely one of my all-time favourite protagonists. She begins the series as a completely generic stock \u2018stuck up princess\u2019, but goes through a really interesting and dynamic cycle of development that I\u2019m really not used to from any character in an anime. There are several key moments where she shifts gears into a new persona, and you get to see three of them right in the first episode. The Princess is then broken by her harsh new reality, but (we know from the initial flash-forward) then hardened into an icy and arrogant ace pilot. This goes on through the show in distinct stages as events unfold, but each stage is deeply engraved with the lessons of those that came before, culminating in a flawed and densely layered character that I felt a real attachment to.\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I\u2019ve complained at length about the fanservice, I\u2019m going to double back on myself a little bit here. Outside of the scenes I mentioned earlier on, Cross Ange actually goes to some interesting and unusual places with sex and sexual dynamics, all centred around the relationships between a quartet of secondary characters. This is the group of the \u2018Alpha\u2019 of the prison; a strong and ruthless woman with a core gang/harem of sexually and socially subservient lackeys that she uses to maintain her status and dominance over the rest of the prison population. Although this is an old cliche that you see in pretty much every prison drama (\u2018Bogs\u2019 in the Shawshank redemption for example), the way the power dynamic of the group changes over the course of the story and the blurring of lines between fear, loyalty, friendship and romance is really surprisingly subtle and well portrayed. \\n\\n\r\nOnce again, Cross Ange makes my head spin; one of my favourite examples of an interesting use of sex in Anime is in the same goddamned show as one of my least favourite, most unpleasantly gratuitous.\\n\\n\r\nI haven\u2019t really gone into the plot, but\u2026 \u2026wow. I read discussions online after finishing the show that suggested the plot had been decided based on someone at Sunrise emptying the bag marked \u2018ideas we all decided were too stupid and/or crazy to work\u2019 and then hammering them all into one script. I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty accurate, but somehow it all kind of  works? It\u2019s like the plot equivalent of getting into a high-security building by turning up at the front desk with a suit and a clipboard and asking to see \u2018Steve\u2019; all the bizarre twists and disparate ideas are presented so matter-of-factly that I found I just kind of accepted them as part of the ride. I won\u2019t spoil the surprise, there\u2019s one utterly, utterly ludicrous thing in particular that happens towards the end of episode 21. Something that in any other show would have completely shattered my suspension of disbelief and yet\u2026 After a couple of minutes of stunned silence to appreciate that they just did that, I found myself thinking \u2018Well, okay then!\u2019 and moving on to the final few episodes. \\n\\n\r\nFor me at least, there was no getting off Cross Ange\u2019s wild ride once it started.",

            "content": "I liked this series more than I anticipated. It has everything I could ask for in an anime. Mecha, fantasy, humor, sexiness and emotion. The art was good, clean and crisp. I liked the characters, plot, story and motivations. I was highly into the tale of a privileged princess becoming the victim of prejudice that her caste mandates upon the populace. I'd say it's the perfect anime were it not it's lack of mass appeal. I once read an article suggesting that women tended to watch shows with primarily all male casts and men watched shows with all female casts. Cross Ange is why. Somewill be immediately repulsed by the constant fan service. Also there are rape elements that might \"trigger\" others. Impractical flight suits, group bathing, crotch flops...it's a 12 year old boys wet dream. But I can't truly knock it for that. It serves it's intended purpose. It delivers exactly what it's offering. What I can knock for is a villain who's powers and abilities are poorly defined. I don't want to spoil it but the villain appears to be able to teleport objects and manipulate matter. So how could he lose? By not putting defined limitations on his powers he simply neglects abilities he showcased in the past, because...plot. Don't get me wrong, I was thoroughly entertained by this series but I can see how some wouldn't based on misogyny. And that's a shame because the fan service isn't the focus here. There's actually interesting character development and interaction. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing. But it's not like Freezing or Maken-Ki where the whole point is to get the ladies naked as fast as possible. So, I say watch it, and if you get past the first four episodes you'll get to the end and won't be disappointed. Not that there's anything wrong with the first four episodes, but rather to determine if this series is for you.\\n",
