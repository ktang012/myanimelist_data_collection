            "content": "If you didn\u2019t already know, there is a subset of the anime community called the Sakuga Community, whose principle value in anime lies solely within it\u2019s production value. No matter how good or bad a show is, considering the hundreds of aspects that go into it\u2019s production, this community will watch or drop a show on it\u2019s quality of animation alone.  While I never thought negatively of these people, I can say that I certainly never understood them. These are people who watched the entirety of Fate/Apocrypha for it\u2019s sakuga, and watching a show THAT bad to completion just to see a few flashyfights simply boggles my mind. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have guessed that I, myself, would watch a show as melodramatic and cheaply written as Hanebado! for it\u2019s gorgeous athletic choreography and animation alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction, the shot composition, the lighting, the angles, the perspective, the editing, the animation, especially the realistic choreography, everything about the visual presentation of the badminton matches was spot on perfect. The direction was often done in perspective animation of the birdie dashing like lightning back and forth across the court, with quick, intense, and energetic frames of the characters\u2019 faces flashing by. The shot composition showed the impact of the birdies on the rackets, the muscle it takes to lean or jump for long shots, and the sweat leaping off the athletes\u2019 faces when they switch directions to dance across the gym. Never does it slow down, drop detail, or pan across still frames, thus spending every second of every game zipping around the court and the characters playing on it. I cannot stress how much time and money was clearly expended hand-drawing these sequences. Do you remember all those production documentaries of the key animation team at Production I.G. studying professional volleyball players to animate Haikyuu? I can guarantee to you, one hundred percent, that the team at LIDENFILMS put in nearly the same amount of effort in animating Hanebado! because it\u2019s almost as impressive as the likes of Haikyuu! and Kuroko no Basket\u2026almost.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the show, well, you know, it\u2019s pretty not great. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is a girl named Ayano who is the daughter of the most decorated female badminton athlete ever to grace Japan, and, as such, has been raised for the sole purpose of playing badminton and living up to her mother\u2019s lofty expectations. As if that plot wasn\u2019t already embellished enough, Ayano is portrayed as a \u201cbadminton monster\u201d (I know it\u2019s stupid, but they actually say it in the anime) who flips her crazy switch in matches that literally makes her eyes dilate and her hair messy. I guess I could take this seriously if her mother beat her or something abusive to warrant this level of distress, but every single flashback to her childhood shows her and her mother happily practicing badminton with no stakes and all smiles, so when the show suddenly cuts back to present day with Ayano looking like she\u2019s ready to murder her opponent over a simple practice game I can\u2019t help but wonder how she became so comically overdramatic. It\u2019s not just her either. Her opponents are just as ridiculous and over-the-top. For example, there\u2019s a Danish girl who threw her life and home country away to come to Japan for the sole purpose of beating Ayano and winning her mother\u2019s favor. How are any of these personalities supposed to be believable or realistic in the slightest?! \\n\\n\r\nDespite the matches LOOKING phenomenal, the script itself can only be compared to shounen battle manga. If I had to give an example, I\u2019d say Fairy Tail, but all shounen battle manga have their own version of \u201cthe power of friendship\u201d, otherwise known as the-writer-is-a-hack-and-the-main-characters-are-just-going-to-win-now-for-no-good-reason. Hanebado! has it\u2019s own version of this too. Instead of following the examples of critically acclaimed sports anime such as Haikyuu! and Baby Steps, wherein the cast has to work for their skill and success with blood, sweat, and tears, Hanebado! just introduces characters with predetermined skill sets that we\u2019re just supposed to accept. At no point in the show do they sit down and actually explain HOW or WHY someone is a good or bad player (even though they continuously use badminton terminology without explanation or demonstration.) After watching Haikyuu! and Baby Steps, I know the rules of both Volleyball and Tennis like the back of my hand. After watching Hanebado! on the other hand, the only thing I really understand about badminton is that when the birdie hits the ground someone gets a point. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the overly convenient script, people competing in this show only win or loose when they WANT to. As I just mentioned, there isn\u2019t any progression in the characters\u2019 skill sets, so the thing that ends up deciding the matches is, you guessed it, their emotions. If Ayano is feeling unmotivated or corrupt, she looses, and if Ayano is feeling determined or righteous, she wins. This is true for every character in the show. If the lesson they have to learn involves suffering defeat, then they loose, and if the lesson they have to learn involves tasting victory, then they win. Skill and especially technique simply do not matter in this anime. Like, you don\u2019t even know. There\u2019s a match wherein the player knows, in no uncertain terms, that her opponent has a weak knee. Her coach knows this too, and he advises her to make her opponent run side to side in order to blow out her already weakened knee, and she then decides to ACTIVELY DISOBEY HIS OBJECTIVELY HELPFUL INSTRUCTIONS AND DELIBERATELY PROCEED IN A MANNER THAT SHE KNOWS SHE WILL LOOSE THE MATCH because his strategy, and I quote, \u201cwas not the badminton I wanted to play.\u201d I guess you could make the argument that this allows the thematic depth of the show to really shine, but it\u2019s only doing so at the cost of the script and logical progression.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, just like the Sakuga Community who finished Fate/Apocrypha for the fights, I ended up finishing Hanebado! for the animation. I can\u2019t say I regretted it, but I can definitely say that I would\u2019ve dropped the show in episode one if it hadn\u2019t been such a feast for the eyes. If you are also enticed by a high quality production like I am, or if you simply don\u2019t mind melodramatic teenagers yelling at each other until they decide to be friends, then I highly recommend you watch Hanebado!. If you don\u2019t, then just pass it off as yet another ambitious production that only got as far as it\u2019s budget would allow it to.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Most people think the 'bad, in Hanebado is for 'badminton.' Unfortunately, it literally stands for 'this show is bad'. Long story short, this show is not impressive in the slightest. Abysmal writing and comic book antagonists (that would actually be disrespectful to comic book villans though)\r\nRemember the show \"Everyone Hates Chris\"? This is pretty much Everyone Hates Ayana. They introduce a new rival every week that just make no sense. The characters don't care about badminton at all for the most part. Everyone seems like they hate it. The whole show is just doom and gloom. Every week we think they are turning a corner,but it stays the same. It is just a really gloomy show. We get it, badminton requires a lot of sacrifice, but this show is over the top dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nBrings me into my next segaway. This show is not funny. Contrary to the cheerful cover poster, there is barely any \"fun\" to be had. It is just drama after drama. There are no lighter moments. The only source of anyone trying to be funny is a the coach who feels like a blatant ripoff of \"Trainer-san\" from Uma Musume (miraculously he is one of the better characters which gives u a good glimpse of this show) I know comedy is subjective, but there isn't even a moment to critique the comedy, because it isn't even there. Serious shows can have lighter moments. Not everyone has to be so miserable. \\n\\n\r\nI will give credit where credit is due and that belongs to the amazing art which is one of the best and solid soundtrack as well as the OP and ED (especially the ED as it signals the end of this show). But in all seriousness, one of the prettiest shows to ever be animated. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Hanabado is everything bad about Sports Anime. No \"falling in love\" with the sport, not meaningful matches, and no realistic characters to like. If you want a sports show, watch Harukana Recieve. It is everything this show isn't and it is airing this same season.",

            "content": "Hanebad AKA Hanesaki Badminton is yet another underwhelming sports series from 2018. This time, our series focuses around edgy feelings stuff, crying scenes and other melodrama, and the title itself already acknowledges it is bad. \r\nApparently, life is pointless and so is badminton, so wearing an edgy face directly from Madoka Magica whenever someone hits the ball, or cringe flashbacks with sad feeling stuff occurs, is obligatory. I have no idea what the series tries to accomplish by anyone crying every 5 minutes and reflecting their suicidal vanity via badminton. Better cut myself some wounds that won't heal to understand how deep it is, Iguess.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are pretty boring. Moeblobs whose character design has gone thru more planning than their personalities, filled with bunch of psychological problems and depression, used by the author in purpose of trying to make someone feel for them because they are so full of these emotions, man. Practically the whole crew is Inside Out's take on what being a bitch in different ways is about. \\n\\n\r\nThis series also contains one of the most random scenes I have ever seen in the history of anime. Girl 1 yells at girl 2 in anger, followed by girls 3-5 yelling at girl 1 for yelling at girl 2, further followed by girl 4 starting to walk off into the sunset while girls 1-3 and 5 watch. All of my wat. \\n\\n\r\nOriginally, I was hyped to see the animated trajectories of badminton, but I have been too distracted by the obviously-an-anime character models and the thought that someone might start crying or kill themselves in the middle of a match, to get impressed by it. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps those who don't find the shonen sports formula to be very appealing, will find some satisfaction from this, but be warned: some edgy series are fun and some are this anime. I will still give this a generous 5 because there seems to be a chance of it getting better, which alone is worth of something because most airing series don't even have that.\\n",

            "content": "Ever wonder what the female version of Haikyuu!! would look like?\r\nNo, you say???  Alright, then\u2026..carry on.\r\nIts just, this anime bears some resem\u2014\u2026.oh, you still don\u2019t care.  Okay.  I\u2019ll just leave you alone\u2026.\r\nF\u2014k you!  I\u2019m writing this review whether you like it or not.\r\nAs regular as the seasons change, another sports-genre anime has graced our computer screens for what seems like the umpteenth time, the flavor of the month being: badminton.  Not the most exhilarating sport in the world, but it definitely has intermittent moments of shock and awe (much like Hanebado!).\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of its male counterpart, Hanebado! isa semi-serious sports anime that deals with the psychological consequences of youth athletics.  As the story progresses, we begin to learn that each girl is plagued by a personal shortcoming that impedes their progress as an individual player.  These visceral, psychological battles become the focal point of the entire series, making the girl\u2019s opponents, more or less, inconsequential, as they are primarily focused on their own internal \u201cdemons\u201d (i.e. battling themselves).  An excellent example of showcasing this internal struggle happens in episode two, where chalkboard animation is used to emphasize the duality of Aragaki\u2019s height \u201cadvantage,\u201d provoking her to overcompensate in other facets of her game.  Not only is her height an emotional weakness (as other children call her a \u201cbeanpole,\u201d and make fun of her masculine appearance) but it turns out to be a physical one, as well.  The astute coach for Nozomi employs a strategy to force Aragaki to move from side to side, putting an enormous amount of stress on her knees, resulting in overexertion and possible injury.  But due to her commitment of staying true to herself (i.e. overpowering her opponent through strength), she is able to circumvent this clever scheme.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is all well and good for our protagonist, but a more pressing dilemma emerges during the match, because while Aragaki simply needs to impose her will \u2014 her identity, if you will \u2014 on the game, Nozomi comes to the realization that she has no identity.  Her entire career has been dictated by \u201cguidance\u201d of her coach; thus, deteriorating her passion and creativity for the game.  The themes that Nozomi and Aragaki experience are quite typical for teenagers in high stress, athletic competition, yet the resolution of said themes felt a bit artificial, too romantic.  Is it truly believable that Nozomi\u2019s coach would transition from yelling at her profusely (like she\u2019s a red-headed step\u2014\u2026you know what, I\u2019m just going to stop right there), to accepting her new perspective on badminton in the middle of a match \u2014 literally, on the drop of a dime?\\n\\n\r\nQuixotic happenings aside, Hanebado! suffers from the same deficiencies that infect its male counterpart, those being:\\n\\n\r\n-Random comedy from which there\u2019s no reasonable explanation.\\n\r\n-A character (i.e. Ayano) with \u201csuperhuman\u201d ability that cannot be matched by anyone else.\\n\r\n-The EYES of Ayano and Hinata both resembling a predator stalking its prey (both are small in stature, as well).\\n\r\n-Displaying unrealistic feat\u2019s that are not attainable in real life for the sake of entertainment\\n\r\n-[Insert 5th point here \u2014 too lazy at the moment, its 3:30 in the morning] \\n\\n\r\nHanebado!, in all seriousness, had an extremely promising start with interesting conceptual ideas about the psychological consequences of competitive athletics; yet, with each passing episode, it quickly decayed into a bizarre, nonsensical comedy with a weird daughter/mother/step-daughter dynamic that was particularly unappealing for the viewer.  Furthermore, the amount of melodrama was off the charts, with an innumerable amount of peaks and valleys, making even the most mundane task feel like it was a life or death situation.  Ayano\u2019s metamorphosis from a timid, reserved girl, to a heartless, animalistic human hybrid was remarkably far-fetched, not to mention tropey.  It seems the desire to emulate its male counterpart was too strong, reducing Hanebado!\u2019s effectiveness as a compelling story that can stand on its own weight.",

            "content": "Sometimes, I wish sports anime gets more attention whether it\u2019s swimming, basketball, soccer, tennis, or anything competitive in nature. Sure, there was Free! from these past few years but it clearly had an audience from the very beginning. Badminton is a one of those sports where it doesn\u2019t get too much attention, at least not on an international level. Yet Hanebado has its own fame when it comes to selling its sports drama.\r\nI would have originally watched this show just for the sheer competitiveness feeling. However, Hanebado persuaded me to invest into its character cast from the first few episodes. We meet a colorful groupthat includes Ayano, Nagisa, Riko, Elena, among others. From my initial impression, it reminded me of characters trying to make a name for themselves. But as more and more the story progressed, it felt like some really were pushing themselves to the limit. The most noticeable character is Ayano where she enter an insane beast-like mode when she is motivated.  Some of her matches are noticeable of being extreme such as the case with Kaoruko. While Ayano is a main character, I find it difficult to root for her. The show chronicles her personality as being overly competitive to the point where it can toxic to watch her matches. On the other hand, I do think that Ayano is able to bring out the nature of badminton to a level that people were not anticipating for.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s probably easy to overlook some other characters at first glance but the show does attempt to bring out the best from others. Nagisa is another noticeable name that I ended up rooting for late in the story. As a way to prove herself, she pushes Ayano to her best in one of the most intense matches in the series. We also got to learn a bit more about both girls along the way. But unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say this series makes Ayano likable. It\u2019s like there\u2019s two completely different characters of her \u2013 one that evokes fear and another that behaves like a casual schoolgirl. It\u2019s much easier to relate to the latter. Ayano\u2019s competitive side often reaches to a point that is unbelievable in this show. I find it even baffling at how she deals with depression because her past shows a case of abandonment. \\n\\n\r\nRealism, in fact, does exist to some extent in the show. The characters skill sets are easily watchable as it\u2019s not hard to tell who can beat who before a game is even over at times. But on the contrary, some matches feel like it didn\u2019t live up to expectations with curb-stomp like moments. I also have some problems with how much characters changes, not just in the case of Ayano. For instance, there\u2019s Connie who develops a meaner attitude after facing off against her. Regarding Ayano herself, it seems no one really tries to help her change either. This extends to their coach, Kentarou Tachibana. I\u2019m not going to lie, this guy is hard to accept. He helps out Nagisa with her own problems but doesn\u2019t attempt to do the same for Ayano. The show did make him likable in the beginning but his development doesn\u2019t get enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, Hanebado isn\u2019t going to spoon feed you information much so you\u2019ll have to learn along the way. Badminton isn\u2019t an overly complex sport but it does require a lot of attention. To me, the pure competitive energy of the sport is enough sometimes. The series sells its drama this way during the matches. It\u2019s a bit strange though. The more I watched badminton, the more I feel like this show mixes in psychology during the storytelling. Every match feels like there\u2019s something at stake such as a player\u2019s pride. As one of the positives in this series, every match carries an emotional weight that I think is worth watching for. If only the main character cast could be worth talking about just as much in a positive light.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say the series is unwatchable even with its questionable character roster. Jumping into Hanebado is a visual feast to the eyes with the production quality. There\u2019s a lot of fluidity in the motions of the characters. Every movement in the series felt real and important especially during key moments of the matches. This ranges from the clever camera angles on the muscles to little details like body language. Character designs also look clean that gives each character a distinctive look. Ayano is an exceptional case once you see both sides of her character. That also leads to character expressions that I see very much as impressive. Ayano\u2019s personality is highlighted with how she reacts to her friends or rivals. Others show their emotions without holding much back. Even during lighthearted scenes, there are moments that defines characters for what the creators wanted them to be in this adaptation. The theme songs (particular opening) contains a variety of dynamic camerawork that is admirable. It\u2019s stylish that enhances the energy of the show. The ED theme song contains carefully crafted framework and artistic coloring. Definitely very thought provoking like a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not too many sports series that hooks my attention and Hanebado did that in the beginning. While I still can\u2019t forgive the character destruction of some of the cast, there\u2019s definitely a few that are worth watching. You can be the judge on who to root for. For a show with sports competitiveness, there\u2019s the feeling of emotional stakes. I did hope the series took better care of its characters in terms of their development and personalities. But Hanebado is a watchable. It\u2019s not perfect by all means or even outstanding. Yet, it has an ability to tell a dramatic sports story.",

I came across Megalo Box and it proved me wrong, so I thought why not give this a try? It might impress me too... but it didn't.\r\nThe story is about a tournament in which challengers play against each other. I guess that's it, that's the most of the story. There's also the unnecessary drama which is also criticized by its fans, but if you dislike the drama, then what do you exactly like about the show?The tournament? Is it really something praiseworthy? I'm not here to judge anyone's taste, you can like whatever you want to, but I really want a legit argument as to why this is likable. Anyway, each character has some sort of story with badminton and they're as forgettable as the characters themselves, with the exception of Hanesaki because the anime shoves down your throat that she plays badminton for her mother and you should not forget that. Then her mother comes back to live with her one day and we don't even get any kind of development or reunion scene. She comes back, and the director thought, let's skip to another scene, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nI'm guessing the animators thought they could win over the fans with some good animation for the games and forget that a story or even character designs exist. The characters were so forgettable that I had no choice but to distinguish them by appearance, but even that was impossible because the characters pretty much look the same, just alter the hairstyle a bit, or not, depends on the character. They even forgot how to draw Hanesaki in episode 12 and made her look like she grew 30 years in the time frame of one game. They tried to have style over substance but couldn't nail both. As for the soundtracks, easily best part of the show, they were chill, intense, or anything that was needed. They didn't stand out much but they made the show a bit more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now come the characters. I mentioned how forgettable they are so I pretty much forgot what I wanna say about them. Hanesaki hates the world for some reason, Nagisa is flat, not her breast though, and she was just... there, possibly to rival Hanesaki. The teacher had Nobuhiko voice him and that alone made him a bit remarkable, he was encouraging I'd say. Other characters had an episode dedicated to them but I can't really recall their names, personality, maybe even their looks, or their motives. They played games constantly and the game were just shortened to add in some irrelevant drama which does not affect the game. Characters keep on playing regardless of their past in their oddly paced matches. But it's notable to say the strategies used in the games were convincing so that's a merit to notice. Anyhow, I kind of lost track on what I was gonna say about them, but losing track is what their personality is best at. They're just bland and present to give you a well animated, oddly paced match featuring characters that look and act the same.\\n\\n\r\nRant of the day is over. You can now go watch this (or not) and ignore my opinion because this is definitely AOTY.",

            "content": "Hanebado is shaping up to be one of the more thoughtful and emotional sports anime. Instead of relying on gimmicks like crazy superpowers and overpowered shonen protagonists, it seeks to tell a more personal story by focusing more on the characters and them dealing with their internal struggles through a sport that they all enjoy.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story setup for this one is about as simple as you would expect for a sports anime. A struggling badminton team is on the verge of closing when a new coach and an ace badminton player show up to join the group. With their powers combined, they begin playing matchesagainst other schools and will probably work towards some grand, national tournament where all of the personal character stories will come to their conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe simple nature of the plot and its inherent predictableness are probably Hanebado\u2019s weakest points. It\u2019s not that outlandish for sports anime to be fairly predictable, but it would be nice if this one threw some kind of curveball towards the viewer with regards to its overarching plot. The real strength of this show will be the characters and their personal stories and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWith only a few episodes out, I\u2019m already a big fan of the show\u2019s two leading ladies: Ayano Hanesaki and Nagisa Aragaki. Hanasaki is the aforementioned ace of the group who, 6 months prior to the events of the show, destroyed Aragaki in a tournament 21-0. Without spoiling too much, this victory ran hollow to her due to the strained relationship she has with her mother, who happens to be a superstar player herself.\\n\\n\r\nThough Hanasaki can come off as a bit edgy early on as she lays out her distaste for badminton really thick, seeing her come out of her shell and embrace her new team members is an absolute treat. Though she is shy and soft-spoken, there is an overwhelming kindness and sweetness to her character. Seeing the internal struggle between these two different sides of her will certainly be the main driving force for me with this show.\\n\\n\r\nAragaki is the more hotheaded and standoffish foil to Ayano. The show brilliantly sets her up by showing her inability to accept her loss and weaknesses by straight-up torturing her teammates to their breaking points. Though this might seem like a really unlikeable direction for this character, she does mellow out fairly quickly. Personally, I\u2019m really interested in seeing how her inner turmoil will affect the team and her relationship with Hanesaki going further.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters feel mostly like background objects that play badminton. None of them have any particularly unlikeable personalities, but I really hope the show has time to touch upon them at least a little. At the very least, Hanebado is teasing some very outlandish personalities for its antagonists which is definitely something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\nThe other strength of this show is its art, animation, and sound. The show beautifully captures the feeling of being at an actual match. Everything from the sharp squeaks of the players\u2019 shoes skirting against the court to the earth-shattering sound of a Forehand Smash to the sweat staining the floors as the characters desperately try to catch their breath bring an immersive intenseness to every match. Coupled with the fact that the protagonists aren\u2019t completely overpowered, there has yet to be a single game that left me losing interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves have also had no problem staying on model, though this aspect is particularly interesting to me considering studio LIDENFILMS doesn\u2019t have the best track record with keeping their quality intact. Though their recent work \u201cKilling Bites\u201d didn\u2019t really have that problem, works like \u201cKoi to Uso\u201d and \u201cBerserk\u201d show that the studio may have problems if they misuse their budget or become heavily reliant on CG. Considering that they are also working on \u201cPhantom of the Twilight\u201d this season, I hope LIDENFILMS will be able to keep the quality of Hanabado\u2019s art and animation within acceptable standards. \\n",

            "content": "Coincidentally, this anime aired when the hype was on Asian Games 2018 and I was fired up to watch sports! Phantom Thieves may have their own show this season but the one who stole my heart in this season actually not them but this very particular badminton anime. While many people resent how this anime flows (being overly dramatic), I am personally love them just because I could analyze everything in this anime scene by scene or even second by second. Hanebado! proofed that sometimes it is not too bad to change course from how the original material works for the sake of character building.\r\nLetme start with how I could be dragged into this anime. Actually, there are two things that dragged me into this anime. And the first one is that first match between our two main characters, Ayano and Nagisa. This very first scene is beautifully animated with very good camerawork, integrated CGI and 2D animation, SWEATS! and the character tension. This very first match settled the whole series' vibe and set the very first bar to how they will animate the rest of the series. When I thought that they were setting the bar too high, I WAS WRONG. They really kept their animation quality as high as that from the first episode to the end. It is a huge kudos for the animators who have been very passionate from the very beginning to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that made me into this anime is Nagisa Aragaki and her character. While I could say that the writer did a very good job  as they did not shy away to make a bad mother character that is Uchika Shindou when the community is full with good mother characters courtesy of Boku no Hero Academia Season 3, I should gave the kudos because of their exceptional job on writing Nagisa as a character. I always love tomboys as they tend to have insecurity conflict. In Nagisa's case, she is overly tall so everyone around her overestimates her and overlooks her hard work. After she lost from Ayano (who still a middle school student at that time), her insecurity came out afloat. Nagisa wants to be acknowledged by her hard work. I love how they made Nagisa's resolution to beat Ayano at the final match is because she wanted to beat herself from the past. You don't know how much I am rooting for her to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe other best part is... The writer is successfully made Nagisa as Ayano's mirror but with a very different characteristic. If I analyze a bit further, while being very different, Ayano wants to be acknowledged by her hard work just like Nagisa. But the reason is very different as her (very bad) mother left her because she was not good enough. And not just Ayano, because in the end, this anime heavily gravitates around acknowledgement while building their characters. Just like what the last sentence of this anime said \"What you see on the other side of that net is always a reflection of yourself.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we enter the sound and music department. I would say that the soundtrack is very fit to the theme of the show as it has this tension around the music and made matches more heated than anything else. The soundtrack is full of determination just like how sports anime should be. I love the opening and the ending songs, too. They are very catchy but sometimes the opening feels out of character as it is too cheerful for the episode and not fit for the high tension and heated episode.\\n\\n\r\nOh my, did I just overdone this review? Just like I said before, the main reason I love this anime is because I could analyze everything scene by scene or even second by second. I just love an anime that invites me to talk about it or giving a huge room for any discussions because that is a very much proof that the writer did a good job to make us speculate while finishing the whole plot. Kudos for Hanebado! and all its production staffs.",

            "content": "When it comes to Sports anime Hanebado is one of the more realistic ones out there when it comes to the actual play of the game. No over the top nonsense like super powers or bring undersized and overcoming tall obstacles (im looking at you Haikyuu) or going down a Yaoi fanbase (im looking at you Yuri on Ice). Instead Hanebado focuses more on two girls who overcome personal issues to better themselves not only in Badminton but in life as well. I really would have liked to give this Story a 10/10 however the introduction of side characters backstories and side stories set thisback as a whole. I would have focused more on Ayano and Nagisa's issues and worked with that instead of bringing in the team issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation was simply flawless throughout the entire series. I cannot wait for the Bluray to be released because it is only going to be BETTER. The last 2 episodes were some of the most beautiful animated Sports action I have ever seen. Simply astonishing. \\n\\n\r\nAwesome opening and ending with great insert music. The voice actors did an amazing job as well. No complaints at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters again would have been a 10/10 if the focus was more on Nagisa and Ayano. Connie and Kaoruko were two characters I really didnt care about along with most of the Badminton teammates outside of Riko and Sora.\\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed this anime because it was different compared to most Sports anime out there. Most Sports anime the MC only gets better with the power of friendship and trust with their teammates even if they are already talented. Ayano is OP from the start and eventually reaches a breaking point mentally and her character just gets better by the week. Same thing with Nagisa as each episode progresses their development is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the best Sports anime I have seen in a long time. Realistic and the Drama in it was very well done. 10/10 anime.",

            "content": "\u201cthis badminton anime has had like 6 or 7 different characters break down crying in the first episode. badminton must be absolutely miserable\u201d -@shaun_jen\r\nThe protagonist of a sports anime will typically have some talent that makes them eligible to be the protagonist \u2013 Kuroko lacks presence, Hinata jumps high, Sawamura has flexible wrists, and the list goes on. This is an ability that they have, that no one else will be able to develop, no matter how hard they try, and it\u2019s what gives them the edge over their competition. Hanasaki Ayano has every talent there could be when it comes to badminton \u2013 handedness,reflexes, etc \u2013 though it\u2019s never quite that simple.\\n\\n\r\nAyano isn\u2019t just talented; she\u2019s also worked hard to hone her skills through a childhood of practicing against her mother Uchika, a champion at the sport. However, said mother\u2019s love was conditional on whether she was able to beat her peers, which forced Ayano into a mindset of viewing the game only in terms of winning and losing, and destroyed her ability to simply enjoy the sport or have any respect for her opponents. Ayano plays not for a love of the game, but for her mother\u2019s approval, and the only joy she seems to find in it is the sadistic glee of destroying those who dare believe that hard work will get them anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about hard work? Luckily, Ayano isn\u2019t really the protagonist of Hanebado \u2013 that honor goes to Ayano\u2019s senior and rival, Aragaki Nagisa. Aragaki is definitely talented (though not on the same level as Ayano), but her true strengths lie in the effort that she puts into every match she plays and her love of the sport. That said, this effort often crosses the line into self-destruction, so her behavior isn\u2019t to be emulated either, even if it is a step above Ayano\u2019s. Still, she embodies the ideals that hard work and perseverance are able to overcome talent, and that winning isn't all that matters, and for that, the show roots for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hanebado is a messy show. It challenges the quixotic foundation of the sports anime, and while it ultimately affirms it, it only is able to do so by being willfully ignorant of its own flaws. It can be repetitive in its ideas, and often borders on melodrama. But for all of its missteps, Hanebado also gets a lot right. The animation for the badminton matches is stunning, and it nails the catharsis factor that\u2019s essential for any successful sports series. If you're looking for a sports series with more focus of the drama outside of the game, and you're willing to deal with tonal whiplash and other issues, then Hanebado might be the show for you.",

            "content": "No words could better describe this series than a progressive trainwreck of its characters, amidst the overall setting, and we literally just got so trolled over the fact that we don't ever know what this anime wants to be anymore. And that was the result of Hanebado!, a pretty intense yet mind-boggling series that has everyone calling foul over many issues that have since happened.\r\nLet's get the bad things out of the way, then we can end this on a good note. (Spoilers be warned)\r\nFirst off, it is the adaptation from the manga that immediately develops its own material while taking snippets from it. Immediately,with how Episode 1 focuses on the introduction of Ayano Hanesaki, a normal looking high school girl with a hatred from playing badminton, and that was displayed magnificently. However, it is from there that the anime adaptation slowly leashes away from the light-hearted manga adaptation, and drops the ball, heavy and hard, on the original drama that we've come to see throughout all this time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me to my next (and BIG) pointer: the biased character development.\\n\r\n3 months of production runtime was more than enough to showcase every character's development of how they had persevered throughout timeless trials and tribulations, but somehow, series composer Taku Kishimoto (Joker Game, Erased, Haikyuu!!) had chosen the route that with the light-hearted manga source material, it wasn't good enough, so the heavy character drama was what we got instead, for good and for bad.\\n\\n\r\nTake our MC Ayano Hanesaki for example. She is the stereotypical character of a lunatic, that is not apparent at first, but throughout the series, we definitely can see why she has to act like a sovereign BS of a character that's crapping over everyone else, and that's due to her upbringing. WHICH immediately questions the single-handedly bashed neglected side of a perfection: her own mom Uchika. Every parent wants the best for their own children, but Uchika's actions paving the way for Ayano's devilish side is really pushing the extreme limits of a stereotypical adult teaching his/her own children of what to do and how to follow in their footsteps. \\n\\n\r\nAnother hindrance followed with competitor Kaoruko Serigaya, wanting to compete dirty with the high consequence of getting Ayano sick and limiting her potential of losing the junior finals, adding onto that with Uchika's \"seeking for perfection\" causes her to abandon Ayano and find her next line of prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (which resulted in another stranger, Connie Christensen). All that pent-up frustration is solely there to give the thought that Connie lives up to Uchika's name and Ayano being the back-burner is seriously excruciating enough. With that set in mind, Ayano has to work her way up again and regain her own neglected mom's very high expectations, to prove to her that no matter her growing-up years of staying away from badminton (and brought back by Elena), she still has the in-game going for her and hopefully her mom will recognize her again.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters had lesser screen-time to focus on their weaknesses and problems to eventually get better at their craft. One such side character, Nagisa Aragaki, falls into that pit. She lost to Ayano at the junior finals, and swore that she will never take anyone lightly, which explains her initial amounts of frustration for perfection from others that limits her potential. Only once did she start to understand that with strength comes confidence in playing better, then she is able to enjoy playing badminton (and that's for Episodes 1-3), and that sets the basis for future matches to try and outwit Ayano's prowess and play badminton her way. In the midst of focusing in both Ayano and Nagisa's efforts, the other members (mostly Riko who has been playing alongside Nagisa) of the Badminton club too have each of their shortcomings, but they do work hard (off-screen, that is) to also prove why they play badminton in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, with so much that the anime has shown us, it almost felt like the character drama was very overbearing to the point where people started to drop this series, and honestly it's a very big flaw on the series overall. The (minimalistic) redeeming part is the small snippets that it actually adapts from the manga, but then again, the overarching mainstay of the drama still will force people to turn away with conviction.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing going for the series is the art and animation. As I've mentioned before in my prelim review, the art is good, but the animation's way leaps and bounds better. The production staff at Liden Films really took extreme care to showcase the realism of the characters from the non-grotesque body motions to the 3DCG stop-gap motions of the badminton rackets and shuttlecock responses, so much so that it stands out from the get-go. And throughout both art and animation didn't let me down as it's mainly used for the badminton matches, which makes me wonder that if this aspect is meant to eclipse the over-the-top character drama that we had seen the ugliest of it. Which side wins, it's up to you to decide.\\n\\n\r\nOn the music side, it helps that Kazuhiro Wakabayashi has maintained his flare when it comes to brilliant OSTs and his work here doesn't let us down as always. This is YURiKA's third OP (accounting for Little Witch Academia and Houseki no Kuni) and as nice as it sounds, it is nothing short of methodical and fantastic and was an OP that I couldn't afford to just skip and let loose. Alongside Yuiko Oohara whom has the same music repertoire with YURiKA (performing the same series songs, plus Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san's sweet OP), it was an excellent song through and through and really spoke life into the host of characters. Overall, another great strike for the win.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! as a series, it's very controversial as much as its realism depict and reflect the happenings of such sports in real life. The reasoning for not being able to follow in the parents' footsteps, to one that eventually makes and breaks oneself is brutal AF (but definitely not the way to go), and I thought that it did justify the case studies of such family-based situations, and for what it does, it did a heck of a job (but not everyone's gonna take it well). So unless you care for such forced unnecessary drama, you can throw this series out of the bag. I never thought I would say this, but if drama is your forte like so many cringeworthy drama-based shows act like the way it should be, then this is your sauce. If you ain't any match for drama, then why are you watching this?",

            "content": "(This review is spoilerless.) \r\nThis series is a very bad sport series.\r\nHonestly, based on the ideas and quality productions alone cannot make this series to be an interesting or even watchable. Personally, I like nothing in this series starting from plots, ideas, characters, pacing, tones, dialogues, progressions and developments. This is one of most pandering and corny sport series I have ever seen for a while. It feel like I'm not even watching sport or let alone the series itself. Everything look fan service to me. \r\nPlots that building up to be an obnoxiously over-dramatic sport life where everyone don't play sport as they feellike or love to play it anymore. They only play sport for winning which in my opinion isn't the purpose or goal of sport itself.\\n\\n\r\nIdeas that having weirdly morals about you can being a jerk and having no sportsmanship to everyone but if you are good at sport or you feel some kind of sorry, everyone will forgive and forget what you do even though they have no reason to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters that are mostly confused because they don't know how to separate sport logic form life logic. You don't have to win every time or have to be the best at it. You can be yourself and happy to do the thing you like. If you don't feel like to play sport, just quit it. It's not like badminton is only occupation in the world right ? \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing and tones that keep going back and forth as director doesn't know how to direct other type of tones and pacing rather than drama and sport that only smack their shuttlecock to each others' face with no plan or strategy. (except the very last match between main character in final episodes which some kind worth to watch)\\n\\n\r\nDialogues that totally horrible as everyone always speak aggressively to each other and keep complain about how life so bad in a metaphoric way. \\n\\n\r\nThese are brief examples of the problems why this series is so bad in my opinion. Now let's get into the detail explanations. \\n\\n\r\n1.) I don't like how this series present the ideas of badminton or sport at all. The ideas of badminton and how social life work seem so separate and don\u2019t go along with each others so much. Even though the series want us to think that badminton is a life for characters or the whole world to move along with. But most of the time the logic and gimmicks to link this two ideas together don\u2019t make any senses. Every scenes and plot points look extremely corny and forced. It feels like everything in the entire series always try to reason with each other by using badminton and sport as an important factor in every arguments. When characters and scenes are executed by using these badminton and sport life as main arguments, they look so stupid and so hard to understand what they are thinking. Some people may say that these combinations of both ideas are just some metaphoric and hidden massage of how realism work, but the point is in the end, these just make everything much more complex and over dramatic for unnecessary reason. Just drop the badminton things for a second and make character do and think like a normal person will make this series much more realistic.\\n\\n\r\n2.) The morals in each episode are so moronic and hard to actually believe and work in real life. Again if this series follow the way of trying to be \u201cREALISTIC\u201d then the morals are actually important and it is the matter of fact that these will make the series to have much more visualize images of \u201cwhat get what after done what\u201d things going on along the entire run. Some scenes and plot points are exaggerated and pandering so much. Doing things that are absolutely not gonna happened in real life and then get away with it or characters and plots just forget about it seem so convoluted and doesn\u2019t make any senses. This will be an exception to cut the score or to even considered as a bad point if the series doesn\u2019t try so hard to become \u201cREALISTIC\u201d though (based on how the series tones and plots were presented). This circumstance actually make me believe that characters and plot points don\u2019t have their own morals and stand points and they are changed over the time with no subtlety and development at all.\\n\\n\r\n3.) This series have one of the worst dialogues I have ever heard in my life. This is the most important key that absolutely ruin this series in my opinion. First, characters usually talk nonsense and metaphoric which kind of annoying and irritating and actually extend the running time to become a boring mess that ruin both tone and story progression and development. Second, this series are extremely over dramatic because of dialogues alone as every characters usually talk like they want to punch each other face for all the time. They insulted and roasted each other for absolutely no reason which even make plots and sequences look so much pandering and fan-service which some time even extend the length of dramatic tone to the maximum limit that later destroyed other tone and plot as well. Third, characters usually repeat the same thing they have been speak and think for several time for no reason which even make this series so long and boring.\\n\\n\r\n4.) Scenes and plots arrangements, pacing and even execution in this series aren\u2019t very good at all. In fact most of them look so confused and hard to tell what viewers should actually focus at the very moment. They are too cramped for the starter. In one episode they have over 100 plots going around and none of them have an impact on each others. Also these plots are always appear randomly with no enough development and subtlety. They cut so many tone and story of an important point that viewers kind of care for the most of time and even make the overall episode to be much more chaotic and confused. Additionally, the storytelling and pacing in this series is sometime totally bad in terms of timing, cliffhanging and swapping. They are so many plot points that are telling in those stage which quite annoying and irritating for those viewers who doesn\u2019t want to watch the three kingdom of badminton.\\n\\n\r\n5.) There are so many stereotype of characters that viewers can actually see and predict their plot for a mile away and even stay the same with no developments or changes during the entire run. The hard strong shounen women who doesn't know how to give up and extremely hot-blood. The want to be winner innocent character. The senpai lover. The girl who look kind and nice outside but her life is very sad. Everything you can easily guess.\\n\\n\r\n6.) This series is easily predictable. Nothing significantly going on during the entire run rather than things that you might seen and think since the very beginning of the series about girls who want to play sport (and win) so much which in each episode will have dramas as a layer to it as always and in the end will conclude with we are friend now kind of cliche'. Furthermore, every morals in each plot arcs (yes, the entire 2-3 episodic sequences) are actually the same. This is so boring in both short and long running viewing experiences. Watching this series only in the beginning and the last would actually give you the same result you want as watching the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all my opinion why this series is so bad even though it has very good productions. If the main important characteristic of the series, plot isn't compelling enough or even downright design to be fan service, then I have no reason to watch such failure series.\\n\\n\r\nThe final score is 1/10. 1 score comes from quality animation productions alone.\\n",

            "content": "Hanebado has proven to being one of the more unique, emotionally driven sports anime. What I mean by that is it tackles the genre by having a more serious tone, focusing on the \u2018dark side\u2019 of competitive sports that sports anime don't usually show. It doesn\u2019t have those stupid \u201cspecial moves\u201d or fanservice crap you see in sports anime. \r\nHanebado is basically a sports anime about badminton. Whilst saying that, I think one of the core strengths of the series is it focuses more on the characters, their inner struggles and overcoming their emotional tramua. Badminton is in a sense the platform to have tohave these characters interact and and advance the plot of the story.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 8\\n\r\nThe foundation of the story revolves around two MCs who are depicted in the classic \u201ctalented prodigy Vs hardwork underdog\u201d tale.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is Ayano Hanesaki, a talented high school girl who was trained by her prodigy of a mother, and has years of built of tramua that are rooted from Ayano wanting to live up to her mother\u2019s expectations who left her. The other is Aragaki, the head strong, hardworking team captain who has earned her stripes through hard work. While she does have her height at her advantage, she has no natural talent. It\u2019s mentioned early on Hanesaki and Aragaki have a history playing each other in middle school. This event gave birth to a new rivalry/relationship between them. Aragaki, fuelled by her loss to Ayano, hardened herself to train harder.\u2028\u2028 These two depressing stories create a beautiful parallel between the girls, where they both ask themselves the question:\\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you play badminton?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are well written, diverse and memorable. Ayano\u2019s rivals (Aragaki, Connie, Kaoruko) especially get fleshed out really well and get a good amount of character development (albeit Connie\u2019s wasn\u2019t the best executed and her changes come off a bit unrealistic imo). We get insight into their characters, their childhood, what shaped them to be the people they are now and their motivation to playing badminton. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ones who stand out and I\u2019m most invested into are the main leads, who I think are brilliant characters. I love the fact that Ayano has a split personality and the way the show portrays the dichotomy between her shy, soft spoken self to this absolute merciless, monster on the court, which is entertaining to watch. It\u2019s a unique and refreshing take on a MC that I haven\u2019t seen in a sports anime.   \\n\\n\r\nI know some may be turned off by \u201cDarth Ayano\u201d and think she\u2019s edgy because of her blunt and rude attitude, her lack of sportsmanship or love for the sport she plays. However, I feel some people fail to grasp the depth of Ayano\u2019s psychological tramua and how badly it\u2019s affected her. Also, seeing Ayano slowly breaking out of her shell slowly and coming to accept her team in her character arc is brilliant to watch unfold.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nThe visuals are beautiful. Every time I see a close up or zoom in of a badminton shot, I\u2019m in awe of how absolutely stunning the animation is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe opening is probably my favourite out of all the anime I\u2019ve watched this season. The OP is energetic, lively and upbeat. The chorus especially is catchy and fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI liked Hanebado. It was one of my most anticipated anime I looked forward to watch of Summer 2018. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s some flaws, for example the input of excessive drama- while removing some of the comedic aspects and moments of lightheartedness were we see the team bonding in the manga annoyed me. The anime changing the characterisation of some of the characters e.g. Connie and Kaoruko, who were portrayed to being more of bitchy rivals to Ayano in order to further along the regression of her mental state so we see Darth Ayano sooner. Also, the overall direction/route it took in some scenes weren\u2019t executed great and I thought were much better handled in the manga. I still think the show gets a lot of unnecessary flack. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not all happy go lucky shit where the team all gets along and everyone has the same mentality reducing their personality to a \u2018herd mentality\u2019 like for instance, in Haikyuu. I don\u2019t mean to throw shade at the show, I just think it\u2019s too idealistic and unrealistic in the way it portrays how everyone puts the team first above themselves in any given situation. That\u2019s why I like the interpersonal drama in Hanebado because it adds realism. Not everyone is going to get along, and their will be some conflict/drama that arises in competitive sports, but we accept each other\u2019s flaws or weaknesses and move on. Here, the characters are treated as people with their own personalities and motivations that drive them to playing badminton, as well as being a team.\\n\\n\r\nI prefer the manga more, but that doesn\u2019t change how much I love the amazing storytelling, visuals, beautifully animated matches, the techniques and information about badminton, and drama potrayed within the anime. Gotta love the drama ;)",

            "content": "I honestly don't know why I bothered finishing this. As a child I grew up with Badminton so to see the first two episodes portraying the sport in such an ugly fashion put me off it for a while before I continued. But here we are and let's have a chat on Hanebado. (Insert joke about how you can't spell \"Hanebado\" without \"bad\" here).\r\nI've watched two sports anime this season based on fanservice-heavy manga. The other one being Harukana Receive. While I can't comment exactly on how faithful each adaptation is, I would've much preferred Harukana's approach to the genre. That is to say ageneric, but decently done sports anime on friendship happiness puppies sunshine and all that nonsense with a heavy dose of fanservice and waku waku shequasars. On paper, Hanebado's approach of forgoing most of the fanservice and light-hearted moments and instead zeroing in on the drama and misery seems right up my alley. After all, Ayano's character is defined essentially by her abandonment by her mother. However, in execution it just doesn't cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nMy largest complaint about the series is its lack of focus. From the first 2 episodes focused almost exclusively on Nagisa's development to the point of making her seem like the main character (she's not, but she's still the most important secondary character), to the side stories on sausage girl and senpai boy which I frankly don't give much a toss on about, the series feels somewhat schizophrenic when it comes to its plot. While ostensibly about Ayanon, she doesn't make much of an impact up until episode 5. I will say however I did enjoy Ayanon's drive and character study, especially the drama surrounding her and her shit mother, though the resolution to that in the final episode is a complete copout. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are either hate-sinks or mostly forgettable. They change personality so quick you'd swear they were bipolar. Prime examples include Connie and Kaoruko where after taunting Ayano several times they show up a few episodes later wanting to be good friends? And to have Ayanon forget all the shit they've done?? What!? You can't just take a shit on my lawn and say you wanna be friends me while I'm bashing your head in with a badminton racket the next day. Good thing Ayano's one of the few characters with consistent personality. Her anger doesn't dissipate and the comeuppance she serves is cathartic. You can feel her breaking point and her insanity leaking out at any moment. It's brilliant. The horror music too perfectly ramps things up a notch. Making this my second favourite unintentional comedy of the season (the other being Happy Sugar Life). Though speaking of Happy Sugar Life, it's awful how Ayanon's mother came out unscathed and without any karmic retribution or even any lasting hatred from Ayanon. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio design in this is pretty bad too. A lot of the times the BGM can overpower the lines of dialogue spoken by the characters. Especially when the horror strings are playing. Ayano with her softer voice is the prime victim in this. It always feels like her voice lines are played loud enough to be heard with any clarity, even when she\u2019s shouting.\\n\\n\r\nAt times I do wonder if the director actually hates the sport. Badminton is portrayed as a really ugly thing in this, being the driving force behind Ayano's trauma and the source of many conflicts throughout. Matches are animated well enough, and they don't bore me to the extent of how Harukana's did, but honestly the characters behind the net ruin the experience for me. Being the horrible people they are. \\n\\n\r\nOh well. I wonder if Yonex ever regrets sponsoring this.\\n\\n\r\n3/10. Would not Wei-wei.",

            "content": "Hanebado! This anime has come under a lot of praise and criticism since it first released this summer. Some have praised it for its realism while others have criticised it for bad writing and character inconsistencies. For me though, I\u2019m actually really happy with the way this anime went. I got invested in this show because there\u2019s a lot I can relate to. To give us out some serious talk, all us have had some kind of issue growing up especially with our parents. Now granted, most of us didn\u2019t have the kind of issue that Ayano has with her mother, but the anime givesa good example of what happens when you make a bad decision that has a long lasting effect along with showing just how bad life can get. This is the reason why so many people are so frustrated with this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I get it. No honestly, I do. I get why people wouldn\u2019t like this show because most of us have never experienced the kind of hardships that Ayano has been through. Most have never even experienced the pain or fear of abandonment. Simply put, the people who hate this show comes from a lack of experience themselves, not because they\u2019re bad people themselves. That\u2019s why I like this show so much. The writers were not afraid to tell this story the way they did instead of playing it safe, even at the risk of being heavily criticized themselves. It\u2019s easy for the younger anime fans to criticize these things because they have yet to experience real hardships themselves. On the other hand though, it\u2019s easy for the adults, the older fans, to forget that they were once teenagers themselves. And since the majority of anime characters are teenagers, we as a whole tend to forget that at that age we are bound to make more mistakes than we would as an adult.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing you need to understand about Hanebado is that this is not a typical moe show with cute girls doing cute things while all sharing the same passion like Harukana Receive or Yuru Camp. And while this anime is about badminton, the sport is not the main focus of the story. In fact, it never has been. This isn\u2019t a sports story with a bunch of drama thrown in, this is a character driven story that is mainly about one character\u2019s tragic journey with badminton being her driving force. The sport itself acts both as a subplot and a driving force for its characters. Every major character you see has their own story to tell. What they went through to get where they are, what hardships they had to face, and ultimately how they feel about each other.\\n\\n\r\nTo give some comparisons, Hanebado shares a lot of parallels to the Rocky movies, specifically the first two, and it\u2019s story is essentially the dark side of the those film. While Rocky Balboa was on quest to prove himself, Ayano is on a quest for revenge. Additionally, many characters in Hanebado represent other characters in the Rocky films, with some obvious differences of course. To truly understand Hanebado and the story it\u2019s trying to tell, we have to look at every character individually. Which is why for this review, instead of doing my usual EASY TO UNDERSTAND kind of thing, I am going to talk about every who has played some role in Ayano\u2019s life. On that note this will not include Nagisa or Nozomi because both of them virtually have nothing to do with Ayano. Hopefully, even if you still don\u2019t like this show after this review, one day you will come to understand and perhaps even appreciate it because as we get older we begin to have a better understanding or not just fictional characters, but the human mind as well.\\n\\n\r\nKAORUKO SERIGAYA - The Arch Nemesis\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the one who inadvertently started the whole thing. When we first see Kaoruko she immediately strikes you as a person who is very arrogant, very disrespectful, and perhaps a little crazy. Her history with Ayano is that of a classic arch nemesis. Being one of the earliest of Ayano\u2019s opponents, Kaoruko was unable to beat her until she deliberately got Ayano sick with her cold, sabotaging their match while using the excuse that she wanted to fight on even terms. Because of that, Ayano ended losing, something that would a devastating effect on her. A few years later she shows up at Ayano\u2019s school unannounced and challenges Ayano, beating not through skill but through psychology.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the beginning it\u2019s easy to dislike Kaoruko. She intimidates her opponents by talking down on them, making them feel that they\u2019re no match for her. She even trash talks her own teammates. However, there\u2019s a lot more to Kaoruko than you realize for she is essentially the Apollo Creed of this anime. In the Rocky movies Apollo also liked to brag and trash talked his opponents, but he also had the means to back it up. He didn\u2019t become the heavyweight champion for nothing, he did it by doing the work that was required. Kaoruko is exactly the same way. She may be rude and disrespectful, but she didn\u2019t get where she was by doing nothing. She\u2019s worked harder than any other player on her team. She doesn\u2019t play badminton for popularity points. She plays it because she wants to, and she wants to be the best out there. She\u2019s earned the right to brag and trash talk.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, her arrogance eventually got the better of her. In her second official match with Ayano, she made the mistake of thinking she was facing the exact same opponent. Well, she soon found out she was wrong and lost because of it. However, she didn\u2019t go down without a fight and this is where I really do admire her. Like Apollo, she\u2019s very knowledgeable about the sport she plays. In addition, she does have a cute side to her which is shown when she develops a schoolgirl crush on Ayano\u2019s badminton coach. However, when it comes to badminton she gets serious. When she realizes she is not facing the same Ayano from before, she changes her strategy. She uses all her knowledge of badminton in a effort to beat her opponent, believing that she can win after falling behind. All the work she\u2019s put in shows, to the point that even her teammates, who she was rude to before, can\u2019t help but cheer her on. But in the end, it\u2019s not enough and she loses, her pride being further damaged by Ayano\u2019s own trash talk.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can say that she had it coming, and she did, but I like to believe that her loss against Ayano finally showed her that she wasn\u2019t invincible, that she was as vulnerable as every other player, and that she finally accepted her human. This may sound crazy but I actually consider Kaoruko to be the best girl of the anime. The reason why I believe that is because in that final scene when she broke down after her loss, it showed me that beneath all that arrogance there is a sweet girl there. The problem is that she lacks the social skills to really express them. So in the end, Kaoruko is not an evil person. Arrogant, yes, but not evil. And she actually respects Ayano because she is the reason she works really hard to perfect her skills. And again, she may have started the whole thing with Ayano, however she is not directly responsible for Ayano\u2019s mother leaving. And speaking of which, let\u2019s now shift our focus to\u2026\\n\\n\r\nUCHIKA HANESAKI - Worst Mother Of The Year\\n\r\nWe have every reason to hate this character, for under no circumstances should a parent ever abandon a child. However, I disagree with everyone who says that she is a terrible person. A terrible mother, definitely, but not a terrible person. The thing you need to understand about Uchika is that she is a badminton fanatic. To her, badminton is her life to the point where it\u2019s her obsession. It consumes her everyday thought. And when you look at her past, it\u2019s understandable. She was a ten time national champion\u2026 who suddenly became pregnant and had a child. Now we don\u2019t know what the exact circumstances were leading to her pregnancy, but even though her life had suddenly changed her obsession with badminton didn\u2019t. And sadly there\u2019s a lot of parents in the real world who are like this.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you\u2019ve had such a successful career in whatever your profession is, settling down and starting a family is the furthest thing in your mind. You\u2019re either ready for it, or you\u2019re not. And that\u2019s the thing with Uchika, she was simply not ready to become a mother yet because her mind was always on badminton even when she was pregnant with Ayano. This carried on through Ayano\u2019s childhood and later Connie\u2019s. In every scene Uchika is in, flashback or otherwise, she is always talking about something related to badminton. It\u2019s never about them. Heck, she doesn\u2019t even see them as her daughters or even as children. She sees them as her proteges. She doesn\u2019t see herself as a mother, she sees herself as a coach. It doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t love them any less, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t know how to be a mother. Her obsession with badminton is her undoing.\\n\\n\r\nHer leaving Ayano initially wasn\u2019t because of Ayano, it was because of herself. When Ayano lost, her badminton mind told her that she had failed as coach. Because of that, she leaves Ayano to relieve her frustration by training her other student Connie but ended staying longer than she planned when Connie started to show potential. Again, her mind is always on badminton. Later on, we discover that the real reason was because she wanted Ayano to develop her skills on her own without having to rely on her. Now of course, this doesn\u2019t excuse her actions but when you look at her character it does make sense and she even acknowledges that she\u2019s been a terrible mother. A terrible person wouldn\u2019t say that. In families who are financially successful, especially the very rich ones, more often than not we see the children of those families grow into spoiled brats, sometimes even violent ones. This is because either the parents are spoiled brats themselves or were so focused of their lives and careers they ended up neglecting their own children. In the case of Ayano and her mother\u2019s successful career, who\u2019s to say Ayano wouldn\u2019t have turn out the same way if she continued to cling to Uchika?\\n\\n\r\nWhen you really think about, Ayano\u2019s strained relationship with her mother is not much different from Indiana Jones and his strained relationship with his father. Both their parents are very much alike and yet they were both trying to teach their children to rely on themselves rather than their parents. Henry Jones ignored his son for the most part partly due to his obsession with the Holy Grail while Uchika took the more extreme method by leaving Ayano behind. Both had the same idea, but Uchika\u2019s method was entirely wrong and she knows it, but again her mind is always on badminton. Her decision has left a permanent scar on Ayano, one that she will have to deal with one day. Luckily for Ayano, she had at her side\u2026\\n\\n\r\nELENA FUJISAWA - The Childhood Friend\\n\r\nAt this point in time Elena was the closest person to Ayano after Uchika\u2019s departure. She had tried to support Ayano the best that she could as a friend though. In a way, she\u2019s essentially Mickey Goldmill, Rocky\u2019s original trainer. Her mistake though was that she didn\u2019t fully understand Ayano\u2019s trauma with her abandonment. You see, a lot of people claim that Elena is entirely at fault for bringing Ayano back into badminton when she didn\u2019t want to when in truth it wasn\u2019t because how was she supposed to know what was going to happen to Ayano? Simple, she couldn\u2019t have and it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t know about Uchika\u2019s other student Connie.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why she forcibly brought Ayano back into the sport of badminton was she because she felt that Ayano\u2019s reason was very foolish, and I agree with her. Why should you abandon the sport you love so much just because you\u2019re mother left you? Elena is basically trying to tell Ayano that, \u201cHey, there are better ways to play badminton. Forget about your mother. Play for yourself, or better yet, play for a team.\u201d. Elena was simply doing was friends do, helping her friend out by telling Ayano she shouldn\u2019t give up her passion just because her mother. And in the first five episodes, Ayano begins to see a new light in the sport. She begins to enjoy it again and becomes fascinated with the idea of being with a team. Elena had done her job by bringing happiness to Ayano again and all was going well. That is until the sudden and unexpected arrival of\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCONNIE CHRISTENSEN - The Other Protege\\n\r\nNow Connie is the most misunderstood character in this anime. A Danish girl who is rather tall, she was trained by Uchika at an early age due to the overseas trips Uchika often took. People write off this character because of how she initially treats Ayano and for her sudden character shifts. I understand perfectly well why people really dislike this character. However, the reason for the dislike isn\u2019t necessarily because of bad writing, but rather the anime\u2019s poor execution of her character especially when she tries to be nicer to Ayano. For me though, Connie is the character I feel the most sorry for because she is basically the innocent victim in this story. Granted, she pretty much brought on herself but let me try to explain Connie\u2019s character as best I can.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about Connie is that she\u2019s very competitive when it comes to badminton. Her coach Uchika is also very competitive in badminton, so naturally she assumed Ayano would be the same. Like Kaoruko, she wants to prove that she\u2019s the best in the sport but the big difference is that she has a more personal reason. She wants to prove that she\u2019s the better student of Uchika\u2019s two proteges. In a competitive sport like badminton where you\u2019ve been trained by the same teacher this is a perfectly normal thing to do. Who wouldn\u2019t want to prove who\u2019s the best of the two? The problem was that Connie was overcome by her overeagerness to prove herself. While it\u2019s never shown in the anime it\u2019s heavily implied that Uchika did not want Connie to face Ayano just yet. Whether this was because Ayano would beat her easily or because she wouldn\u2019t take to well with suddenly having a stepsister is uncertain, but given Uchika\u2019s character it was quite likely both.\\n\\n\r\nNow some of you I\u2019m sure are asking about Connie sudden request for Ayano to accept her as her sister instead of her rival when she was so hostile towards her in the beginning. Well, to understand that you have to look at Connie\u2019s own past for it\u2019s very similar to Ayano\u2019s. Through her flashbacks we see that Connie had lived a very lonely life in her childhood. Every scene we see her she is always alone. We\u2019re never shown why exactly that but considering she was living in a very nice house it\u2019s safe to assume that she had parents that virtually ignored her and not because she was an orphan. She developed a passion for badminton but this did little to cure the loneliness in her heart. Then comes Uchika, who not only becomes her coach but takes her in as her daughter. Despite Uchika\u2019s faults, this is one of the kindest things she\u2019s even done even though it would later have a devastating effect on Ayano.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for Connie\u2019s initial hostility isn\u2019t actually directed Ayano personally, but rather at the idea of being part of a team as shown in their first match. This has nothing to do with any so called rivalry, it\u2019s actually has to with Connie\u2019s insecurity. When you look at her past, it makes a lot of sense. Given the lonely life she\u2019s gone through she\u2019s pretty much taught herself that she doesn\u2019t need to rely on others. However, deep down she wants to be part of Ayano\u2019s family, but now that Ayano is adopting a new family with her team Connie considers this to be a threat. When she realize she that she wasn\u2019t alone through her teammates, she discovered that her entire thinking was wrong and she tried to make up with Ayano. At least, that was the intention. The problem was that the anime didn\u2019t execute very well which is why her sudden change came off as both unrealistic and unbelievable to many. However, by the time she realized this the it was already too late. Her declaration to Ayano about being Uchika\u2019s second daughter ended causing much more damage to their relationship than she realized.\\n\\n\r\nConnie\u2019s mistake though was that she rushed in without thinking. Her even bigger mistake was on how little she knew about Ayano. She only knew what Uchika had told her and had assumed that Ayano would be no different from her. What she didn\u2019t know was the fact that Uchika had abandoned Ayano and that it had left a very deep scar. She didn\u2019t know about Ayano\u2019s mental state until she actually saw it for herself. And when she did, it scared the living hell out her. All of a sudden she found herself right in the middle of ugly family feud, something she wanted no part of. She could have attempted to apologize to Ayano for her reckless behavior, but at that point Ayano had already gone over the edge. Yes, she may have cause it but again this was due to how little she knew about Ayano. Any apology now won\u2019t do her any good. This was now Ayano\u2019s and Uchika\u2019s problem. They have to sort it out themselves. Luckily for Connie, she had her teammates to support her. And now let\u2019s finally talk about\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAYANO HANESAKI - The Near Tragedy\\n\r\nAyano\u2019s story is a very sad one. It is a perfect representation of someone who fell to the dark side. To quote the famous words from Jedi Master Yoda:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOne thing these characters all have in common is the fear of losing, which is quite common in single player competitive sports. All of us who are very passionate about sports hate the thought of losing. It is a bitter pill to swallow. But for Ayano, it\u2019s a much more personal reason.\\n\\n\r\nAyano\u2019s fear started when she lost to Kaoruko and that loss was greatly magnified when she sees her mother literally walk out of her life. No phone calls, no letters, no communication of any kind, nothing. She believed she lost her mother because her loss to Kaoruko was too much Uchika to bear, not knowing the real reason behind it. Because of this, she was afraid she was never see her mother again. She convinced herself that the only way she can get her mother back was by winning again. Winning every game she played would bring her closer to her mother. Any loss would take her further away, so losing for her was not an option. And that\u2019s exactly what she did, she turned into a badminton monster. Then one evening she sees a badminton magazine with Uchika on the cover, the very first time she\u2019s had any contact with her mother. However, when she opens the magazine she see a picture of her mother with a stranger at her side, kissing her on the cheek along with a quote that she won her championship thanks to Uchika as her coach. It is here that Ayano\u2019s fear turns to anger. To her, it is the ultimate betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily she was able to put aside her anger by pursuing other sports such as tennis, as we saw in the beginning, only to be dragged back into badminton by Elena for reasons I\u2019ve already stated. Understandably, she was nothing to do with the sport she once loved. Before then she only playing in the hopes she would get her mother. Now that she knows that Uchika has another student, she no longer has a reason to play. At this point, she feels she\u2019s lost everything. Her rematch against Nagisa reminds her of her loss against Kaoruko. Then Kaoruko herself shows up and Ayano tries to quit the badminton club after Kaoruko beats her again, and then later on when she loses against Connie she nearly suffers a mental breakdown. She tries to make excuses for it but then runs away. However, before that game happened she was beginning to see badminton in a new light. She was beginning to fascinated with the idea of playing for a team. Unfortunately, Connie\u2019s untimely arrival would destroy whatever hope Ayano had from saving herself from her anger. When Connie declared that Uchika was her substitute mother and she was going prove her worth over Ayano, this finally pushes Ayano over the edge. Her anger has now turned into hatred. She now wants revenge for all the suffering she\u2019s gone through.\\n\\n\r\nElena is the first to see Ayano\u2019s yandere like eyes and it scares the living hell out of her. The sweet little girl that she knew from childhood was no longer there. It was now replaced by this monster who is out for revenge. At this point, Ayano wants the people who put her through all this suffering to pay for it. She starts with Kaoruko, the one who again inadvertently started it all. As mentioned before, Kaoruko made the mistake of thinking she was facing the same opponent. But at this point, Ayano\u2019s quest for revenge was in full force. While Kaoruko did fight until the very end, she was no match for this new version of Ayano. All the trash talk she had gave Ayano earlier was thrown right back into her face and it really hurt her pride. Ayano\u2019s next target would be Connie, possibly followed by Uchika who she intends to abandon in the end. She wants to prove that she no longer needs her mother. However, she will have to get one last obstacle who is in the form of Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nTo give an comparison, Ayano in the beginning is very much like John Rambo. In the movie First Blood, Rambo was both abandoned and betrayed by his country simply he was a Vietnam War veteran. He was alone and very depressed. He virtually had no reason to go on. Ayano is very much the same. She was abandoned by her mother for no good reason and later on she lost the will to play badminton. Then Rambo finally snaps due to his mistreatment from police and goes on rampage for survival. The same thing happens to Ayano after Connie\u2019s declaration, except this time it\u2019s more personal. Ayano essentially becomes a more extreme version Clubber Lang from Rocky III. Like Clubber, she develops a very cold and arrogant personality. She treats everyone like they\u2019re below her, even her own teammates. She\u2019s no longer interested in teams, she\u2019s only interested in playing the actually good players with the intent of destroying them entirely and then giving payback to both Connie and her mother.\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION\\n\r\nDespite these great characters and a really powerful storyline, I'm really disappointed with how this anime ended. I had hoped for, and even wanted, a second season. With the way the story was going, I just didn't believe that LINDEN FILMS wouldn't end the way it did. Unfortunately though, that was too much to ask and the ending we got I felt was both underwhelming and it made the story feel incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I didn't expect Ayano to forgive her mother right away, she really learn anything throughout her experience through the whole series. It pretty ended the way it started. Nothing was really resolved between Ayano, her mother, Connie, and to lesser extent Kaoruko. It was just left the way it was, leaving you feeling really unsatisfied. Worse yet, Ayano is still in her her crazed state. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see Ayano go completely to the dark side, but I would like to see some kind of redemption.\\n\\n\r\nThe best characters, heroic characters that is, are the ones who make a mistake, a very big mistake, and then go on a journey to redeem themselves and to make things right again. For this anime I felt that some major tragedy should have befallen Ayano, one that finally wakes her up from her craze state. I knew her being beaten by Nagisa might have some impact, but not one powerful enough to really get through to her.\\n\\n\r\nI would have liked this better if season one ended on a tragic note and then season two picks up right where it left off with Ayano going on mission to redeem herself while receiving help from a completely unexpected source and ending with her biggest and most important match against Connie. And it the end, all are able to forgive each other and peace is brought back into their small world. That would have been a much more satisfying ending, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hanebado! is not a bad anime, but a really underwhelming one. The story and characters are great despite some poor executions. However, the ending does not doe the story justice for how it resolves some things but leaves others unresolved. A prime example of wasted potential. This anime deserved a second season, but sadly it's unlikely we'll ever get one.\\n\\n\r\nI'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!",

In reality I feel Badminton is only the device used to put over the actual plot of the story, and that overcoming emotional distress. \\n\\n\r\nNagasaki-The tall voluptuous take no names badminton player, who has earned everything she has through hard work, she has no natural talent, her height is at her advantage, but she never just relies on that alone. She goes hard at practice so much so in the early scenes you can see the negative effects this has over the entire badminton club. \\n\\n\r\nAyano- Daughter of a prodigy, with overbearing natural skill its almost annoying, the kinda of girl who has natural skill, that in comparison to Nagasaki you really want here to lose until...you see the insights of her back story,were she came from her child hood, and of course there is a picture so damning, so hurtful, that when you see it in the show, you stare at it in show the anger you hope Ayano feels begins to surround you...\\n\\n\r\nThese two depressing stories, make a tie in for an emotional conflicting ride that only wants you to see the best for birth girls...\\n\\n\r\nKey note there is some things the Anime left out in the early story about Ayano, Personally for the Anime this heightens the drama a lot and keep a certain mystery shrouded in total darkness, and very anxious. \\n\\n\r\nThe Manga dampens the blow but in my personal opinion \"same story two different tones\" Thus far I love the anime adaption...\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show 10 across the board\\n\r\n Art 10\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\ncharacter 10\\n\r\nenjoyment 10\\n\r\noverall 10\\n\\n\r\nSometimes you run across a show, you hit play, and you fall into the world, and enjoy the ride. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

(this shouldn't spoil anything for you)\r\nThe art and sound were incredible at least...\r\nNow the story was enjoyable and I would argue the main points were believable for example Ayano's mom leaves her at a young age (guessing between 6-10) and she obviously resents her for it and thinks she left because of her talent. When she starts playing in high school she plays only to win to prove to her mom she doesnt need her (which i think is MORE the reasonable) which i enjoyed because it wasconsistent and it separated her from the crowd of protagonists in sports animes. But of course they needed to have a happy ending so in the last episode she realized how fun badminton is and makes up with her mom when she had shown up three days before the final, and Ayano had refused to talk to her due to the anger she had. That ending felt so forced and unnecessary, she can realize its fun to play badminton without having to do a complete 180 on liking her mother and becoming the stereotypical protagonist?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest i only wrote this because of how mad i was after watching the 13th episode. I liked the first 8 when she was a ruthless player and only thought about winning but after that it started talking about morals and went to shit. well maybe my rant will make you wanna watch it... though i really don't care.",

The worst thing for me was that it felt like they didn't really know if they wanted the show to be your typical \"funny, upbeat with a few serious moments here and there\" sports anime or something more serious and realistic. At times they want to make the whole thing sound really serious and realistic and then they give one of the main characters an \"eye transformation\" power up or an \"i win because of the power of my heart even though i'm actuallyplaying injured\" moment which throws away all the seriousness they'd built up and overall makes the whole thing feel bs af.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are average at best. By the time the last episode came i really didn't give a banana peel about any of the characters involved in the final match. Both were annoying, bland and quite boring, although \"psycho eyes\" mode girl was interesting for a little bit but they also ruined that with a bunch of cheap drama. Their reasons to \"fight\" were lame or even non existent.

            "content": "Ah Hanebado, the sport that is really underrated in all honesty is finally being adapted into a show...except that show is disguised as a cheap drama with a competition to see who can draw the best yandere face at LIDENFILMS \r\nThey don't call it HaneBADo for a reason amirite?\r\n*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\nPlot: \r\nSo Hanebado delves into the perspective of 2 central protagonists. Well I say to but really we just have 1 protag while the other is pretty much disregarded for half the story. If I had to give an analogy over how the story went, let's use a burger shall we? Now Aragaki ourhero...ine represents the buns, shown at both the beginning and the end of the story whereas Hanesaki, is like that weird special sauce that once you bite into the burger just leaks everywhere and covers the entire burger and gets your hands all dirty and gives you a bad time. Anywho our story starts off with a match between our central protagonists, in which one is clearly putting all the effort she's got while the other, yep you guessed it...has a yandere face on. Yandere face wins and our other protagonist goes into deep depression and copes using drugs and alcohol, which leads her to develop anger issues. Well everything except the first and last parts are false. Fast forward years later in high school and what a surprise! They're both going to the same school. Eventually our yandere friend (who is perfectly sane at this point) get peer pressured into joining the school's badminton team even though she clearly doesn't want to, and once she meets Anger issues guess what... she gets anger issues!! Now I would be lying if I didn't say that this setup was pretty promising (barring the obvious issues). What we could've gotten is 2 rivals who are opposed against each other, one who is energetic and the other who is more serious, learn to cope with each other for the greater good of the school's team and rely on each other to develop their own skills. Sounds familiar doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nInstead what we got was 12 eps of utter nonsense ranging from Hanesaki's mother leaving her when she was young (which we'll have fun with that later), to Hanesaki having a non-biological sister (yay yuri shippers) to pointless side character expeditions just so we know that the whole world doesn't revolve around our protagonists and that there are actually other members in the club. Cause y'know, it's a sports anime\\n\\n\r\nSee the main problem with Hanebado is that it tries to fit in a bunch of shounen elements (even though it's a seinen) but it never takes the time to well... actually show them. What we end up getting is a bunch of half-assed executions and all problems getting resolved in a matter of minutes. Athlete is currently in a slump? Yeah just play a few rounds and you're good as new. Can't win a game even when your yandere face is active? Yeah just remember that one time everyone said \"we're a team\" and despite you treating them like absolute shit, they're still behind you. Mother left you for supposedly bad intentions when you were young? Yeah don't worry about it she obviously had good intentions for it, just lose a game and it's all settled\\n\\n\r\nSo how does this wonderful journey end you may ask? Well we do get that typical sports scenario where the last few episodes are all focused on the end-all game of the century where it's round 2 between yandere and anger issues (although she has calmed down at this point so hey, character development amirite). Now usually in shows that do this like Kuroko's Basket, we get these prolonged episodes to build tension and hype into the game, in order for all the elements such as sound, art and characters to come together for the epic ending. In Hanebado's case, what we get is the kind of shaft style art you'd see in ef: slow motion jump cut back and forth, and constant breathing for about a solid minute or 2. Yep that's it. There's no thrilling use of OST, no witty quotes about never giving up, we don't even get to see SPOILER Aragaki smash it or finesse it past Hanesaki. We just get a bunch of uncolored lines, some breathing and then it jumps to the end. Even the crowd were like wtf is going on\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nJudging by the last few sentences you can probably guess where I'm going with sound. It's not really there. Well it is but not where it is needed the most. One of the main purposes of the OST is to set the atmosphere, whether it be tense, joyful or dramatic like we've seen recently with BnHA S3. Part of what makes OST's so outstanding is the ability to recognize certain tracks that play, such as Monogatari's Suteki Meppu, or the infamous hug scene in Clannad AS. Sure there are dramatic tracks in dramatic situations, but there's nothing really that gets me into the mood of the situation. Now you may be complaining \"It's not a shounen so don't expect that kind of stuff\" but even in something like the Chuunibyou movie, the use of the OST provided an excellent set to the situation. Moving on the OP isn't anything too spectacular/funky/outright intriguing. It's not a bad song per se, but the energetic vibes from it really contrast with the show in general\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the one field where I do have to give credit for. Not so much the art, since it was basically yandere faces and especially during the final match it was all over the place, but the animation. For badminton, a sport with a lot of rapid movements, I thought the animation was pretty well done, especially since the use of CGI was scarce (if used at all apart from the shuttlecock). Maybe the animation off the matches wasn't amazing, but definitely the actual matches themselves were some eye candy\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As my old friend Anakin would say, this is where the fun begins\\n\\n\r\nBunch of Side Characters: Literally have no use at all other than to visually show how much Hanesaki/Aragaki are treating them like shit, and to lighten the mood when those 2 can't since they're always mad. There was also a romance subplot going on with some love triangle drama, but that turned out to be rubbish because main girl didn't know if she like the B(adminton) or the D(ick). Spoiler, she chooses the B.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi: Slightly more important side character. She stays by Aragaki's side when she goes batshit crazy and practically causes half the club to leave. Oh yeah, she also's involved in a match or 2 and gets involved with some past beef with big lips and her rapist looking coach\\n\\n\r\nTachibana: New coach that introduced himself by molesting Hanesaki's hands in the beginning. Nice. Literally only there to provide commentary on the game (as every sports anime needs) and to constantly remind Aragaki that her knee is gonna get messed up (but she has plot armor so who cares)\\n\\n\r\nNozomi: Big lips. I say that but they aren't really that big so excuse me. Anywho not much to say other than she was selected because rapist coach though she followed instructions well or something. Pretty much becomes rapist coach's slave until she manages to get saved with the power of Badminton, cause every sports anime needs that slave needing saving right? (Looking at you Major)\\n\\n\r\nRapist coach: By far the most developed character. We see him start off as your generic douche-bag who only cares about winning, but then he suddenly does a 180 and becomes the generic old dude who gives insights on the match. Now that's some serious change! Oh yeah, he also completely analyzed Aragaki and her fitness by staring at her ass for a few seconds\\n\\n\r\nSerigaya: Pink haired ponytail antagonist. Molested Hanesaki when they were young so that she would get sick and therefore lose the game (which led to her mother leaving her). What an asshole. Eventually gets paired up against Hanesaki and gets defeated. Take that dick\\n\\n\r\nErena: Hanesaki's BFF and that girl who peer pressured her into joining. Ngl she's probably my least favourite character. The whole time she acts all confused as to why Hanesaki is so depressed and yandere like when she's literally the reason. And when she gets scolded by Hanesaki she just sits there and sulks (Well I guess what else are you supposed to do)\\n\\n\r\nConnie: Golden haired ponytail antag...actually I don't even know. In the beginning she acts like an antagonist, triggering her period when she realizes that she was at the convenience store with Hanesaki after all. Then she proceeds to rub it in Hanesaki's face that she's her half-sister and all of a sudden she acts all nice and wants to make amends with her? She literally makes no sense and we get an entire episode on her devoting herself to become a family with Hanesaki (like that's gonna work) and then gets dumped on and shat by yanesaki (get it cause yandere Hanesaki? No?) and then is no longer seen ever again. And that doesn't even begin to question the way she got with yane's mom. She literally impressed her with her badminton skills, Uchika tells her that she's her new mom and she just whole heatedly accepts? There are so many things weird about this. Where are her biological parents? Why does she completely ditch said parents and/or guardians to go and live with a complete stranger? Why is she so casual and calm about this even though she's a kid? Why is she at a badminton team if her parent's are nowhere to be found?\\n\\n\r\nUchika: Oh boy here we go. Trying to understand Uchika's mind set is like trying to claim Ousama Game is the best anime of all time. You just don't. Being the all famous pro badminton player that she is, it's normal for her to want to get her daughter into the sport she loves. So, when she loses a game since she was playing while sick, what does Uchika decide to do? That's right, fucking LEAVE HER. Like seriously I don't even know how much weed the author must have smoked to come up with a plot line so random as this. It's about as ridiculous as Snake destroying a tank with solely grenades, but at least that was bad ass, this was just retarded. But wait! At the last minute we're presented with the whole bad mom was good all along, and her reasoning was that... she wanted Hanesaki to get better at badminton? Like seriously that's some ass writing. But because of happy endings and all Hanesaki and Uchika reunite at the end and hold hands and circle jerk over how Connie hasn't been shown for a couple of episodes and everyone lives happily ever after. Speaking of Connie, Uchika literally showed no sign of guilt over leaving Hanesaki, even going as far as casually talking about her and showing photos to a young Connie. I get how Darling in the Franxx was trying to low key promote more births, but if people are gonna give birth to Uchika's then humanities sense is gone.  \\n\\n\r\nAragaki: Arguably the best character in the series, mainly because she wasn't present in half of it. For real, even though she started off being some angsty teen she gradually grew to become more calm and collected in her actions, as if the writers decided halfway through that they forgot to include the quiet type character into the show. Despite constant moaning from coach molester, she soldiers on and eventually wins the whole tournament and goes to nationals. Whoop di dee.\\n\\n\r\nHanesaki: Yay saving the last character for last. If you're ever bored and want to play a drinking game with your friends, drink every time Hanesaki puts on her yandere face. By the end of the show congrats! you'd be in hospital. Seriously the amount of times she puts on her yandere face makes Yuno look like your average harem girl. And the constant mood swings don't help either. Her personality changes so many times even a mathematician would have a hard time finding that angle. As the story progresses, we come to learn more about our protagonist. Like how she got molested, got sick and then got her mother leaving the front door. But don't worry, she wasn't mad that her mother completely abandoned her, she was mad that she thought her mother thought she was shit at badminton. That way at the end, all the pieces were put together for their heartfelt reunion amirite? Oh yeah, she also treats everyone like shit for pretty much her whole time, but as soon as she returns to normal everything's all good and no harm done. If only irl sports teams worked that way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't say HaneBADo is the worst sports anime there is, but it certainly is far from the best. On paper it's good that they took a more dramatic approach to typical sports shows, but if you're gonna do that route, then it kinda makes you look bad when you start adding cliche shounen sports elements to it   \\n\\n",

            "content": "Although I\u2019ve marked this series as \u201cCompleted\u201d, I actually ragequit in the last episode with only a few minutes left to go. I\u2019ve never seen a supposedly character-driven show fail so hard on every plot-related aspect while acing everything else. \r\nThe OP drew me in with its slick, beautiful animation and the charming smile of Ayano Hanesaki. Unfortunately, upon finishing (or near-finishing) this show, the only positive impressions I was left with were indeed the animation and Ayano Hanesaki. \r\nHanebado! seemingly wants to depict the growth of Ayano and her counterpart Nagisa into badminton players who play with a happy, healthy mindset. Yet while itsets that up decently, every step along the way is fumbled. Most damning of all (and it\u2019s hard to pick any one thing here) is the treatment of Ayano. Ayano is depicted as a girl with massive trauma lying underneath her seemingly cute, innocent surface. She\u2019s been abandoned by her mother because of her inability as a child to be a perfect badminton robot and as a result, playing badminton reverts the paltry progress she\u2019s made into having feelings or developing a persona separate from vying for approval from her only caregiver, even if it\u2019s stunted, childish, and a little backwards. It\u2019s actually a nuanced and realistic portrayal of childhood trauma that I deeply relate with. \\n\\n\r\nSomehow, every single character watches her relive her trauma and shift back into a zombie who plays solely to avoid being abandoned and to create some feeble sense of self-worth, with snark and arrogance as her only defense, and NOBODY HELPS WHATSOEVER. As they witness this descent that they themselves brought upon her, her clubmates fail to see that she needs people to care about her and react to her with jealousy and hostility as soon as she really begins falling apart, her coach gives up on projecting his failed Olympic dreams into her when she fails to have any emotional response towards them and dismisses all her hard work as \u201cnatural talent\u201d, her best friend doesn\u2019t realize she needs to take responsibility for pushing Ayano into this until the very end, and worst of all\u2014 her mother. The story idea of \u201cI\u2019m a poor trauma survivor and everybody hates me\u201d isn\u2019t impossible to work with, but everyone here is portrayed with no critical eye, and absolutely nobody has to deeply rethink their worldview. The sideplots with the other club mates whose names I can\u2019t even recall are dumb and boring as a result, and absolutely nobody is likeable. What\u2019s the point when we\u2019ve clearly seen a setup of \u201cAyano\u2019s trigger is badminton and she\u2019s reliving her trauma because of that\u201d and then proceed to have everybody stomp on our protagonist?! Shouldn\u2019t we hate them then?! But, of course, this show doesn\u2019t care about that\u2014 just look at the mother. \\n\\n\r\nThe mother returns to Ayano in the second half of the show. Unsurprisingly Ayano reacts with pure numbness and completely rejects her. The mom doesn\u2019t realize the error of her ways\u2014 AND THE SHOW REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM. Up to the end, her mom holds the same messed up belief that she raised Ayano the right way by abandoning her because she\u2019s better at badminton now (?!?!) and the show STILL attempts to depict her as a sympathetic figure. When Elena weakly calls her out, there\u2019s no follow up. When it\u2019s nearly the end of the show and it\u2019s time for Ayano to magically 180 and decide she loves playing badminton because the club mates who previously hated her also magically 180\u2019d and suddenly don\u2019t hate her for being snarky anymore, Ayano forgives her mom. And that\u2019s when I closed the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThese magical 180s pop up often: sometimes for drama or plot convenience, and sometimes for no reason at all. Whether it\u2019s Connie suddenly coming to Japan and her flip flopping on whether she likes Ayano and what she actually wants with her (wants to be sisters, but is cruel to her? but then sugary sweet? but why?), her club mates randomly changing their opinions on her (sometimes even before she has a breakdown, club mates tell her they hate her... but now they\u2019re friends! Even though she hasn\u2019t talked to them for two episodes.), Nagisa\u2019s Tension Creating Potential Injury, Nagisa\u2019s power level, Ayano\u2019s power level, Nozomi deciding losing is how she wants to play, Nozomi\u2019s coach being okay with that... the character motivations and actions simply don\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019d praise the badminton strategy and technical showings, since it\u2019s a sports anime, but the complete whiffing of the final Big Badminton Final (power levels aside, SWITCHING HANDS BETWEEN HITS?) also makes me strongly question the writers\u2019 ability to write something coherent. Sure, it\u2019s beautiful\u2014 the faces, the unabashed depiction of sweat\u2014 and the breathing sequence is ambitious, but it\u2019s completely soured by the heavy baggage of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, just enjoy the opening. Look at Ayano\u2019s cute smile. And for both her sake and your own, don\u2019t watch Hanebado.",

            "content": "If you didn\u2019t already know, there is a subset of the anime community called the Sakuga Community, whose principle value in anime lies solely within it\u2019s production value. No matter how good or bad a show is, considering the hundreds of aspects that go into it\u2019s production, this community will watch or drop a show on it\u2019s quality of animation alone.  While I never thought negatively of these people, I can say that I certainly never understood them. These are people who watched the entirety of Fate/Apocrypha for it\u2019s sakuga, and watching a show THAT bad to completion just to see a few flashyfights simply boggles my mind. I definitely wouldn\u2019t have guessed that I, myself, would watch a show as melodramatic and cheaply written as Hanebado! for it\u2019s gorgeous athletic choreography and animation alone.\\n\\n\r\nThe direction, the shot composition, the lighting, the angles, the perspective, the editing, the animation, especially the realistic choreography, everything about the visual presentation of the badminton matches was spot on perfect. The direction was often done in perspective animation of the birdie dashing like lightning back and forth across the court, with quick, intense, and energetic frames of the characters\u2019 faces flashing by. The shot composition showed the impact of the birdies on the rackets, the muscle it takes to lean or jump for long shots, and the sweat leaping off the athletes\u2019 faces when they switch directions to dance across the gym. Never does it slow down, drop detail, or pan across still frames, thus spending every second of every game zipping around the court and the characters playing on it. I cannot stress how much time and money was clearly expended hand-drawing these sequences. Do you remember all those production documentaries of the key animation team at Production I.G. studying professional volleyball players to animate Haikyuu? I can guarantee to you, one hundred percent, that the team at LIDENFILMS put in nearly the same amount of effort in animating Hanebado! because it\u2019s almost as impressive as the likes of Haikyuu! and Kuroko no Basket\u2026almost.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the show, well, you know, it\u2019s pretty not great. \\n\\n\r\nOur protagonist is a girl named Ayano who is the daughter of the most decorated female badminton athlete ever to grace Japan, and, as such, has been raised for the sole purpose of playing badminton and living up to her mother\u2019s lofty expectations. As if that plot wasn\u2019t already embellished enough, Ayano is portrayed as a \u201cbadminton monster\u201d (I know it\u2019s stupid, but they actually say it in the anime) who flips her crazy switch in matches that literally makes her eyes dilate and her hair messy. I guess I could take this seriously if her mother beat her or something abusive to warrant this level of distress, but every single flashback to her childhood shows her and her mother happily practicing badminton with no stakes and all smiles, so when the show suddenly cuts back to present day with Ayano looking like she\u2019s ready to murder her opponent over a simple practice game I can\u2019t help but wonder how she became so comically overdramatic. It\u2019s not just her either. Her opponents are just as ridiculous and over-the-top. For example, there\u2019s a Danish girl who threw her life and home country away to come to Japan for the sole purpose of beating Ayano and winning her mother\u2019s favor. How are any of these personalities supposed to be believable or realistic in the slightest?! \\n\\n\r\nDespite the matches LOOKING phenomenal, the script itself can only be compared to shounen battle manga. If I had to give an example, I\u2019d say Fairy Tail, but all shounen battle manga have their own version of \u201cthe power of friendship\u201d, otherwise known as the-writer-is-a-hack-and-the-main-characters-are-just-going-to-win-now-for-no-good-reason. Hanebado! has it\u2019s own version of this too. Instead of following the examples of critically acclaimed sports anime such as Haikyuu! and Baby Steps, wherein the cast has to work for their skill and success with blood, sweat, and tears, Hanebado! just introduces characters with predetermined skill sets that we\u2019re just supposed to accept. At no point in the show do they sit down and actually explain HOW or WHY someone is a good or bad player (even though they continuously use badminton terminology without explanation or demonstration.) After watching Haikyuu! and Baby Steps, I know the rules of both Volleyball and Tennis like the back of my hand. After watching Hanebado! on the other hand, the only thing I really understand about badminton is that when the birdie hits the ground someone gets a point. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the overly convenient script, people competing in this show only win or loose when they WANT to. As I just mentioned, there isn\u2019t any progression in the characters\u2019 skill sets, so the thing that ends up deciding the matches is, you guessed it, their emotions. If Ayano is feeling unmotivated or corrupt, she looses, and if Ayano is feeling determined or righteous, she wins. This is true for every character in the show. If the lesson they have to learn involves suffering defeat, then they loose, and if the lesson they have to learn involves tasting victory, then they win. Skill and especially technique simply do not matter in this anime. Like, you don\u2019t even know. There\u2019s a match wherein the player knows, in no uncertain terms, that her opponent has a weak knee. Her coach knows this too, and he advises her to make her opponent run side to side in order to blow out her already weakened knee, and she then decides to ACTIVELY DISOBEY HIS OBJECTIVELY HELPFUL INSTRUCTIONS AND DELIBERATELY PROCEED IN A MANNER THAT SHE KNOWS SHE WILL LOOSE THE MATCH because his strategy, and I quote, \u201cwas not the badminton I wanted to play.\u201d I guess you could make the argument that this allows the thematic depth of the show to really shine, but it\u2019s only doing so at the cost of the script and logical progression.  \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, just like the Sakuga Community who finished Fate/Apocrypha for the fights, I ended up finishing Hanebado! for the animation. I can\u2019t say I regretted it, but I can definitely say that I would\u2019ve dropped the show in episode one if it hadn\u2019t been such a feast for the eyes. If you are also enticed by a high quality production like I am, or if you simply don\u2019t mind melodramatic teenagers yelling at each other until they decide to be friends, then I highly recommend you watch Hanebado!. If you don\u2019t, then just pass it off as yet another ambitious production that only got as far as it\u2019s budget would allow it to.\\n\\n\r\nThank you for reading.",

            "content": "Most people think the 'bad, in Hanebado is for 'badminton.' Unfortunately, it literally stands for 'this show is bad'. Long story short, this show is not impressive in the slightest. Abysmal writing and comic book antagonists (that would actually be disrespectful to comic book villans though)\r\nRemember the show \"Everyone Hates Chris\"? This is pretty much Everyone Hates Ayana. They introduce a new rival every week that just make no sense. The characters don't care about badminton at all for the most part. Everyone seems like they hate it. The whole show is just doom and gloom. Every week we think they are turning a corner,but it stays the same. It is just a really gloomy show. We get it, badminton requires a lot of sacrifice, but this show is over the top dramatic. \\n\\n\r\nBrings me into my next segaway. This show is not funny. Contrary to the cheerful cover poster, there is barely any \"fun\" to be had. It is just drama after drama. There are no lighter moments. The only source of anyone trying to be funny is a the coach who feels like a blatant ripoff of \"Trainer-san\" from Uma Musume (miraculously he is one of the better characters which gives u a good glimpse of this show) I know comedy is subjective, but there isn't even a moment to critique the comedy, because it isn't even there. Serious shows can have lighter moments. Not everyone has to be so miserable. \\n\\n\r\nI will give credit where credit is due and that belongs to the amazing art which is one of the best and solid soundtrack as well as the OP and ED (especially the ED as it signals the end of this show). But in all seriousness, one of the prettiest shows to ever be animated. \\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Hanabado is everything bad about Sports Anime. No \"falling in love\" with the sport, not meaningful matches, and no realistic characters to like. If you want a sports show, watch Harukana Recieve. It is everything this show isn't and it is airing this same season.",

            "content": "Hanebad AKA Hanesaki Badminton is yet another underwhelming sports series from 2018. This time, our series focuses around edgy feelings stuff, crying scenes and other melodrama, and the title itself already acknowledges it is bad. \r\nApparently, life is pointless and so is badminton, so wearing an edgy face directly from Madoka Magica whenever someone hits the ball, or cringe flashbacks with sad feeling stuff occurs, is obligatory. I have no idea what the series tries to accomplish by anyone crying every 5 minutes and reflecting their suicidal vanity via badminton. Better cut myself some wounds that won't heal to understand how deep it is, Iguess.\\n\\n\r\nOur characters are pretty boring. Moeblobs whose character design has gone thru more planning than their personalities, filled with bunch of psychological problems and depression, used by the author in purpose of trying to make someone feel for them because they are so full of these emotions, man. Practically the whole crew is Inside Out's take on what being a bitch in different ways is about. \\n\\n\r\nThis series also contains one of the most random scenes I have ever seen in the history of anime. Girl 1 yells at girl 2 in anger, followed by girls 3-5 yelling at girl 1 for yelling at girl 2, further followed by girl 4 starting to walk off into the sunset while girls 1-3 and 5 watch. All of my wat. \\n\\n\r\nOriginally, I was hyped to see the animated trajectories of badminton, but I have been too distracted by the obviously-an-anime character models and the thought that someone might start crying or kill themselves in the middle of a match, to get impressed by it. \\n\\n\r\nPerhaps those who don't find the shonen sports formula to be very appealing, will find some satisfaction from this, but be warned: some edgy series are fun and some are this anime. I will still give this a generous 5 because there seems to be a chance of it getting better, which alone is worth of something because most airing series don't even have that.\\n",

            "content": "Ever wonder what the female version of Haikyuu!! would look like?\r\nNo, you say???  Alright, then\u2026..carry on.\r\nIts just, this anime bears some resem\u2014\u2026.oh, you still don\u2019t care.  Okay.  I\u2019ll just leave you alone\u2026.\r\nF\u2014k you!  I\u2019m writing this review whether you like it or not.\r\nAs regular as the seasons change, another sports-genre anime has graced our computer screens for what seems like the umpteenth time, the flavor of the month being: badminton.  Not the most exhilarating sport in the world, but it definitely has intermittent moments of shock and awe (much like Hanebado!).\r\nFollowing in the footsteps of its male counterpart, Hanebado! isa semi-serious sports anime that deals with the psychological consequences of youth athletics.  As the story progresses, we begin to learn that each girl is plagued by a personal shortcoming that impedes their progress as an individual player.  These visceral, psychological battles become the focal point of the entire series, making the girl\u2019s opponents, more or less, inconsequential, as they are primarily focused on their own internal \u201cdemons\u201d (i.e. battling themselves).  An excellent example of showcasing this internal struggle happens in episode two, where chalkboard animation is used to emphasize the duality of Aragaki\u2019s height \u201cadvantage,\u201d provoking her to overcompensate in other facets of her game.  Not only is her height an emotional weakness (as other children call her a \u201cbeanpole,\u201d and make fun of her masculine appearance) but it turns out to be a physical one, as well.  The astute coach for Nozomi employs a strategy to force Aragaki to move from side to side, putting an enormous amount of stress on her knees, resulting in overexertion and possible injury.  But due to her commitment of staying true to herself (i.e. overpowering her opponent through strength), she is able to circumvent this clever scheme.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, this is all well and good for our protagonist, but a more pressing dilemma emerges during the match, because while Aragaki simply needs to impose her will \u2014 her identity, if you will \u2014 on the game, Nozomi comes to the realization that she has no identity.  Her entire career has been dictated by \u201cguidance\u201d of her coach; thus, deteriorating her passion and creativity for the game.  The themes that Nozomi and Aragaki experience are quite typical for teenagers in high stress, athletic competition, yet the resolution of said themes felt a bit artificial, too romantic.  Is it truly believable that Nozomi\u2019s coach would transition from yelling at her profusely (like she\u2019s a red-headed step\u2014\u2026you know what, I\u2019m just going to stop right there), to accepting her new perspective on badminton in the middle of a match \u2014 literally, on the drop of a dime?\\n\\n\r\nQuixotic happenings aside, Hanebado! suffers from the same deficiencies that infect its male counterpart, those being:\\n\\n\r\n-Random comedy from which there\u2019s no reasonable explanation.\\n\r\n-A character (i.e. Ayano) with \u201csuperhuman\u201d ability that cannot be matched by anyone else.\\n\r\n-The EYES of Ayano and Hinata both resembling a predator stalking its prey (both are small in stature, as well).\\n\r\n-Displaying unrealistic feat\u2019s that are not attainable in real life for the sake of entertainment\\n\r\n-[Insert 5th point here \u2014 too lazy at the moment, its 3:30 in the morning] \\n\\n\r\nHanebado!, in all seriousness, had an extremely promising start with interesting conceptual ideas about the psychological consequences of competitive athletics; yet, with each passing episode, it quickly decayed into a bizarre, nonsensical comedy with a weird daughter/mother/step-daughter dynamic that was particularly unappealing for the viewer.  Furthermore, the amount of melodrama was off the charts, with an innumerable amount of peaks and valleys, making even the most mundane task feel like it was a life or death situation.  Ayano\u2019s metamorphosis from a timid, reserved girl, to a heartless, animalistic human hybrid was remarkably far-fetched, not to mention tropey.  It seems the desire to emulate its male counterpart was too strong, reducing Hanebado!\u2019s effectiveness as a compelling story that can stand on its own weight.",

            "content": "Sometimes, I wish sports anime gets more attention whether it\u2019s swimming, basketball, soccer, tennis, or anything competitive in nature. Sure, there was Free! from these past few years but it clearly had an audience from the very beginning. Badminton is a one of those sports where it doesn\u2019t get too much attention, at least not on an international level. Yet Hanebado has its own fame when it comes to selling its sports drama.\r\nI would have originally watched this show just for the sheer competitiveness feeling. However, Hanebado persuaded me to invest into its character cast from the first few episodes. We meet a colorful groupthat includes Ayano, Nagisa, Riko, Elena, among others. From my initial impression, it reminded me of characters trying to make a name for themselves. But as more and more the story progressed, it felt like some really were pushing themselves to the limit. The most noticeable character is Ayano where she enter an insane beast-like mode when she is motivated.  Some of her matches are noticeable of being extreme such as the case with Kaoruko. While Ayano is a main character, I find it difficult to root for her. The show chronicles her personality as being overly competitive to the point where it can toxic to watch her matches. On the other hand, I do think that Ayano is able to bring out the nature of badminton to a level that people were not anticipating for.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s probably easy to overlook some other characters at first glance but the show does attempt to bring out the best from others. Nagisa is another noticeable name that I ended up rooting for late in the story. As a way to prove herself, she pushes Ayano to her best in one of the most intense matches in the series. We also got to learn a bit more about both girls along the way. But unfortunately, I can\u2019t really say this series makes Ayano likable. It\u2019s like there\u2019s two completely different characters of her \u2013 one that evokes fear and another that behaves like a casual schoolgirl. It\u2019s much easier to relate to the latter. Ayano\u2019s competitive side often reaches to a point that is unbelievable in this show. I find it even baffling at how she deals with depression because her past shows a case of abandonment. \\n\\n\r\nRealism, in fact, does exist to some extent in the show. The characters skill sets are easily watchable as it\u2019s not hard to tell who can beat who before a game is even over at times. But on the contrary, some matches feel like it didn\u2019t live up to expectations with curb-stomp like moments. I also have some problems with how much characters changes, not just in the case of Ayano. For instance, there\u2019s Connie who develops a meaner attitude after facing off against her. Regarding Ayano herself, it seems no one really tries to help her change either. This extends to their coach, Kentarou Tachibana. I\u2019m not going to lie, this guy is hard to accept. He helps out Nagisa with her own problems but doesn\u2019t attempt to do the same for Ayano. The show did make him likable in the beginning but his development doesn\u2019t get enough attention.\\n\\n\r\nAs you may have guessed, Hanebado isn\u2019t going to spoon feed you information much so you\u2019ll have to learn along the way. Badminton isn\u2019t an overly complex sport but it does require a lot of attention. To me, the pure competitive energy of the sport is enough sometimes. The series sells its drama this way during the matches. It\u2019s a bit strange though. The more I watched badminton, the more I feel like this show mixes in psychology during the storytelling. Every match feels like there\u2019s something at stake such as a player\u2019s pride. As one of the positives in this series, every match carries an emotional weight that I think is worth watching for. If only the main character cast could be worth talking about just as much in a positive light.\\n\\n\r\nThat isn\u2019t to say the series is unwatchable even with its questionable character roster. Jumping into Hanebado is a visual feast to the eyes with the production quality. There\u2019s a lot of fluidity in the motions of the characters. Every movement in the series felt real and important especially during key moments of the matches. This ranges from the clever camera angles on the muscles to little details like body language. Character designs also look clean that gives each character a distinctive look. Ayano is an exceptional case once you see both sides of her character. That also leads to character expressions that I see very much as impressive. Ayano\u2019s personality is highlighted with how she reacts to her friends or rivals. Others show their emotions without holding much back. Even during lighthearted scenes, there are moments that defines characters for what the creators wanted them to be in this adaptation. The theme songs (particular opening) contains a variety of dynamic camerawork that is admirable. It\u2019s stylish that enhances the energy of the show. The ED theme song contains carefully crafted framework and artistic coloring. Definitely very thought provoking like a work of art.\\n\\n\r\nThere\u2019s not too many sports series that hooks my attention and Hanebado did that in the beginning. While I still can\u2019t forgive the character destruction of some of the cast, there\u2019s definitely a few that are worth watching. You can be the judge on who to root for. For a show with sports competitiveness, there\u2019s the feeling of emotional stakes. I did hope the series took better care of its characters in terms of their development and personalities. But Hanebado is a watchable. It\u2019s not perfect by all means or even outstanding. Yet, it has an ability to tell a dramatic sports story.",

            "content": "I'm not a fan of the sports genre, I may be missing out on some treats, but I'm not interested in cliche games where the main character always wins. I came across Megalo Box and it proved me wrong, so I thought why not give this a try? It might impress me too... but it didn't.\r\nThe story is about a tournament in which challengers play against each other. I guess that's it, that's the most of the story. There's also the unnecessary drama which is also criticized by its fans, but if you dislike the drama, then what do you exactly like about the show?The tournament? Is it really something praiseworthy? I'm not here to judge anyone's taste, you can like whatever you want to, but I really want a legit argument as to why this is likable. Anyway, each character has some sort of story with badminton and they're as forgettable as the characters themselves, with the exception of Hanesaki because the anime shoves down your throat that she plays badminton for her mother and you should not forget that. Then her mother comes back to live with her one day and we don't even get any kind of development or reunion scene. She comes back, and the director thought, let's skip to another scene, shall we?\\n\\n\r\nI'm guessing the animators thought they could win over the fans with some good animation for the games and forget that a story or even character designs exist. The characters were so forgettable that I had no choice but to distinguish them by appearance, but even that was impossible because the characters pretty much look the same, just alter the hairstyle a bit, or not, depends on the character. They even forgot how to draw Hanesaki in episode 12 and made her look like she grew 30 years in the time frame of one game. They tried to have style over substance but couldn't nail both. As for the soundtracks, easily best part of the show, they were chill, intense, or anything that was needed. They didn't stand out much but they made the show a bit more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now come the characters. I mentioned how forgettable they are so I pretty much forgot what I wanna say about them. Hanesaki hates the world for some reason, Nagisa is flat, not her breast though, and she was just... there, possibly to rival Hanesaki. The teacher had Nobuhiko voice him and that alone made him a bit remarkable, he was encouraging I'd say. Other characters had an episode dedicated to them but I can't really recall their names, personality, maybe even their looks, or their motives. They played games constantly and the game were just shortened to add in some irrelevant drama which does not affect the game. Characters keep on playing regardless of their past in their oddly paced matches. But it's notable to say the strategies used in the games were convincing so that's a merit to notice. Anyhow, I kind of lost track on what I was gonna say about them, but losing track is what their personality is best at. They're just bland and present to give you a well animated, oddly paced match featuring characters that look and act the same.\\n\\n\r\nRant of the day is over. You can now go watch this (or not) and ignore my opinion because this is definitely AOTY.",

            "content": "Hanebado is shaping up to be one of the more thoughtful and emotional sports anime. Instead of relying on gimmicks like crazy superpowers and overpowered shonen protagonists, it seeks to tell a more personal story by focusing more on the characters and them dealing with their internal struggles through a sport that they all enjoy.\r\nStory:\r\nThe story setup for this one is about as simple as you would expect for a sports anime. A struggling badminton team is on the verge of closing when a new coach and an ace badminton player show up to join the group. With their powers combined, they begin playing matchesagainst other schools and will probably work towards some grand, national tournament where all of the personal character stories will come to their conclusion. \\n\\n\r\nThe simple nature of the plot and its inherent predictableness are probably Hanebado\u2019s weakest points. It\u2019s not that outlandish for sports anime to be fairly predictable, but it would be nice if this one threw some kind of curveball towards the viewer with regards to its overarching plot. The real strength of this show will be the characters and their personal stories and struggles.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nWith only a few episodes out, I\u2019m already a big fan of the show\u2019s two leading ladies: Ayano Hanesaki and Nagisa Aragaki. Hanasaki is the aforementioned ace of the group who, 6 months prior to the events of the show, destroyed Aragaki in a tournament 21-0. Without spoiling too much, this victory ran hollow to her due to the strained relationship she has with her mother, who happens to be a superstar player herself.\\n\\n\r\nThough Hanasaki can come off as a bit edgy early on as she lays out her distaste for badminton really thick, seeing her come out of her shell and embrace her new team members is an absolute treat. Though she is shy and soft-spoken, there is an overwhelming kindness and sweetness to her character. Seeing the internal struggle between these two different sides of her will certainly be the main driving force for me with this show.\\n\\n\r\nAragaki is the more hotheaded and standoffish foil to Ayano. The show brilliantly sets her up by showing her inability to accept her loss and weaknesses by straight-up torturing her teammates to their breaking points. Though this might seem like a really unlikeable direction for this character, she does mellow out fairly quickly. Personally, I\u2019m really interested in seeing how her inner turmoil will affect the team and her relationship with Hanesaki going further.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters feel mostly like background objects that play badminton. None of them have any particularly unlikeable personalities, but I really hope the show has time to touch upon them at least a little. At the very least, Hanebado is teasing some very outlandish personalities for its antagonists which is definitely something to look forward to.\\n\\n\r\nPresentation:\\n\\n\r\nThe other strength of this show is its art, animation, and sound. The show beautifully captures the feeling of being at an actual match. Everything from the sharp squeaks of the players\u2019 shoes skirting against the court to the earth-shattering sound of a Forehand Smash to the sweat staining the floors as the characters desperately try to catch their breath bring an immersive intenseness to every match. Coupled with the fact that the protagonists aren\u2019t completely overpowered, there has yet to be a single game that left me losing interest.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters themselves have also had no problem staying on model, though this aspect is particularly interesting to me considering studio LIDENFILMS doesn\u2019t have the best track record with keeping their quality intact. Though their recent work \u201cKilling Bites\u201d didn\u2019t really have that problem, works like \u201cKoi to Uso\u201d and \u201cBerserk\u201d show that the studio may have problems if they misuse their budget or become heavily reliant on CG. Considering that they are also working on \u201cPhantom of the Twilight\u201d this season, I hope LIDENFILMS will be able to keep the quality of Hanabado\u2019s art and animation within acceptable standards. \\n",

            "content": "Coincidentally, this anime aired when the hype was on Asian Games 2018 and I was fired up to watch sports! Phantom Thieves may have their own show this season but the one who stole my heart in this season actually not them but this very particular badminton anime. While many people resent how this anime flows (being overly dramatic), I am personally love them just because I could analyze everything in this anime scene by scene or even second by second. Hanebado! proofed that sometimes it is not too bad to change course from how the original material works for the sake of character building.\r\nLetme start with how I could be dragged into this anime. Actually, there are two things that dragged me into this anime. And the first one is that first match between our two main characters, Ayano and Nagisa. This very first scene is beautifully animated with very good camerawork, integrated CGI and 2D animation, SWEATS! and the character tension. This very first match settled the whole series' vibe and set the very first bar to how they will animate the rest of the series. When I thought that they were setting the bar too high, I WAS WRONG. They really kept their animation quality as high as that from the first episode to the end. It is a huge kudos for the animators who have been very passionate from the very beginning to the very end.\\n\\n\r\nThe second thing that made me into this anime is Nagisa Aragaki and her character. While I could say that the writer did a very good job  as they did not shy away to make a bad mother character that is Uchika Shindou when the community is full with good mother characters courtesy of Boku no Hero Academia Season 3, I should gave the kudos because of their exceptional job on writing Nagisa as a character. I always love tomboys as they tend to have insecurity conflict. In Nagisa's case, she is overly tall so everyone around her overestimates her and overlooks her hard work. After she lost from Ayano (who still a middle school student at that time), her insecurity came out afloat. Nagisa wants to be acknowledged by her hard work. I love how they made Nagisa's resolution to beat Ayano at the final match is because she wanted to beat herself from the past. You don't know how much I am rooting for her to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe other best part is... The writer is successfully made Nagisa as Ayano's mirror but with a very different characteristic. If I analyze a bit further, while being very different, Ayano wants to be acknowledged by her hard work just like Nagisa. But the reason is very different as her (very bad) mother left her because she was not good enough. And not just Ayano, because in the end, this anime heavily gravitates around acknowledgement while building their characters. Just like what the last sentence of this anime said \"What you see on the other side of that net is always a reflection of yourself.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we enter the sound and music department. I would say that the soundtrack is very fit to the theme of the show as it has this tension around the music and made matches more heated than anything else. The soundtrack is full of determination just like how sports anime should be. I love the opening and the ending songs, too. They are very catchy but sometimes the opening feels out of character as it is too cheerful for the episode and not fit for the high tension and heated episode.\\n\\n\r\nOh my, did I just overdone this review? Just like I said before, the main reason I love this anime is because I could analyze everything scene by scene or even second by second. I just love an anime that invites me to talk about it or giving a huge room for any discussions because that is a very much proof that the writer did a good job to make us speculate while finishing the whole plot. Kudos for Hanebado! and all its production staffs.",

            "content": "When it comes to Sports anime Hanebado is one of the more realistic ones out there when it comes to the actual play of the game. No over the top nonsense like super powers or bring undersized and overcoming tall obstacles (im looking at you Haikyuu) or going down a Yaoi fanbase (im looking at you Yuri on Ice). Instead Hanebado focuses more on two girls who overcome personal issues to better themselves not only in Badminton but in life as well. I really would have liked to give this Story a 10/10 however the introduction of side characters backstories and side stories set thisback as a whole. I would have focused more on Ayano and Nagisa's issues and worked with that instead of bringing in the team issues.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art and Animation was simply flawless throughout the entire series. I cannot wait for the Bluray to be released because it is only going to be BETTER. The last 2 episodes were some of the most beautiful animated Sports action I have ever seen. Simply astonishing. \\n\\n\r\nAwesome opening and ending with great insert music. The voice actors did an amazing job as well. No complaints at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters again would have been a 10/10 if the focus was more on Nagisa and Ayano. Connie and Kaoruko were two characters I really didnt care about along with most of the Badminton teammates outside of Riko and Sora.\\n\\n\r\nI throughly enjoyed this anime because it was different compared to most Sports anime out there. Most Sports anime the MC only gets better with the power of friendship and trust with their teammates even if they are already talented. Ayano is OP from the start and eventually reaches a breaking point mentally and her character just gets better by the week. Same thing with Nagisa as each episode progresses their development is amazing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is one of the best Sports anime I have seen in a long time. Realistic and the Drama in it was very well done. 10/10 anime.",

            "content": "\u201cthis badminton anime has had like 6 or 7 different characters break down crying in the first episode. badminton must be absolutely miserable\u201d -@shaun_jen\r\nThe protagonist of a sports anime will typically have some talent that makes them eligible to be the protagonist \u2013 Kuroko lacks presence, Hinata jumps high, Sawamura has flexible wrists, and the list goes on. This is an ability that they have, that no one else will be able to develop, no matter how hard they try, and it\u2019s what gives them the edge over their competition. Hanasaki Ayano has every talent there could be when it comes to badminton \u2013 handedness,reflexes, etc \u2013 though it\u2019s never quite that simple.\\n\\n\r\nAyano isn\u2019t just talented; she\u2019s also worked hard to hone her skills through a childhood of practicing against her mother Uchika, a champion at the sport. However, said mother\u2019s love was conditional on whether she was able to beat her peers, which forced Ayano into a mindset of viewing the game only in terms of winning and losing, and destroyed her ability to simply enjoy the sport or have any respect for her opponents. Ayano plays not for a love of the game, but for her mother\u2019s approval, and the only joy she seems to find in it is the sadistic glee of destroying those who dare believe that hard work will get them anywhere.\\n\\n\r\nSo, what about hard work? Luckily, Ayano isn\u2019t really the protagonist of Hanebado \u2013 that honor goes to Ayano\u2019s senior and rival, Aragaki Nagisa. Aragaki is definitely talented (though not on the same level as Ayano), but her true strengths lie in the effort that she puts into every match she plays and her love of the sport. That said, this effort often crosses the line into self-destruction, so her behavior isn\u2019t to be emulated either, even if it is a step above Ayano\u2019s. Still, she embodies the ideals that hard work and perseverance are able to overcome talent, and that winning isn't all that matters, and for that, the show roots for her.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, Hanebado is a messy show. It challenges the quixotic foundation of the sports anime, and while it ultimately affirms it, it only is able to do so by being willfully ignorant of its own flaws. It can be repetitive in its ideas, and often borders on melodrama. But for all of its missteps, Hanebado also gets a lot right. The animation for the badminton matches is stunning, and it nails the catharsis factor that\u2019s essential for any successful sports series. If you're looking for a sports series with more focus of the drama outside of the game, and you're willing to deal with tonal whiplash and other issues, then Hanebado might be the show for you.",

            "content": "No words could better describe this series than a progressive trainwreck of its characters, amidst the overall setting, and we literally just got so trolled over the fact that we don't ever know what this anime wants to be anymore. And that was the result of Hanebado!, a pretty intense yet mind-boggling series that has everyone calling foul over many issues that have since happened.\r\nLet's get the bad things out of the way, then we can end this on a good note. (Spoilers be warned)\r\nFirst off, it is the adaptation from the manga that immediately develops its own material while taking snippets from it. Immediately,with how Episode 1 focuses on the introduction of Ayano Hanesaki, a normal looking high school girl with a hatred from playing badminton, and that was displayed magnificently. However, it is from there that the anime adaptation slowly leashes away from the light-hearted manga adaptation, and drops the ball, heavy and hard, on the original drama that we've come to see throughout all this time.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that brings me to my next (and BIG) pointer: the biased character development.\\n\r\n3 months of production runtime was more than enough to showcase every character's development of how they had persevered throughout timeless trials and tribulations, but somehow, series composer Taku Kishimoto (Joker Game, Erased, Haikyuu!!) had chosen the route that with the light-hearted manga source material, it wasn't good enough, so the heavy character drama was what we got instead, for good and for bad.\\n\\n\r\nTake our MC Ayano Hanesaki for example. She is the stereotypical character of a lunatic, that is not apparent at first, but throughout the series, we definitely can see why she has to act like a sovereign BS of a character that's crapping over everyone else, and that's due to her upbringing. WHICH immediately questions the single-handedly bashed neglected side of a perfection: her own mom Uchika. Every parent wants the best for their own children, but Uchika's actions paving the way for Ayano's devilish side is really pushing the extreme limits of a stereotypical adult teaching his/her own children of what to do and how to follow in their footsteps. \\n\\n\r\nAnother hindrance followed with competitor Kaoruko Serigaya, wanting to compete dirty with the high consequence of getting Ayano sick and limiting her potential of losing the junior finals, adding onto that with Uchika's \"seeking for perfection\" causes her to abandon Ayano and find her next line of prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (which resulted in another stranger, Connie Christensen). All that pent-up frustration is solely there to give the thought that Connie lives up to Uchika's name and Ayano being the back-burner is seriously excruciating enough. With that set in mind, Ayano has to work her way up again and regain her own neglected mom's very high expectations, to prove to her that no matter her growing-up years of staying away from badminton (and brought back by Elena), she still has the in-game going for her and hopefully her mom will recognize her again.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters had lesser screen-time to focus on their weaknesses and problems to eventually get better at their craft. One such side character, Nagisa Aragaki, falls into that pit. She lost to Ayano at the junior finals, and swore that she will never take anyone lightly, which explains her initial amounts of frustration for perfection from others that limits her potential. Only once did she start to understand that with strength comes confidence in playing better, then she is able to enjoy playing badminton (and that's for Episodes 1-3), and that sets the basis for future matches to try and outwit Ayano's prowess and play badminton her way. In the midst of focusing in both Ayano and Nagisa's efforts, the other members (mostly Riko who has been playing alongside Nagisa) of the Badminton club too have each of their shortcomings, but they do work hard (off-screen, that is) to also prove why they play badminton in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, with so much that the anime has shown us, it almost felt like the character drama was very overbearing to the point where people started to drop this series, and honestly it's a very big flaw on the series overall. The (minimalistic) redeeming part is the small snippets that it actually adapts from the manga, but then again, the overarching mainstay of the drama still will force people to turn away with conviction.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing going for the series is the art and animation. As I've mentioned before in my prelim review, the art is good, but the animation's way leaps and bounds better. The production staff at Liden Films really took extreme care to showcase the realism of the characters from the non-grotesque body motions to the 3DCG stop-gap motions of the badminton rackets and shuttlecock responses, so much so that it stands out from the get-go. And throughout both art and animation didn't let me down as it's mainly used for the badminton matches, which makes me wonder that if this aspect is meant to eclipse the over-the-top character drama that we had seen the ugliest of it. Which side wins, it's up to you to decide.\\n\\n\r\nOn the music side, it helps that Kazuhiro Wakabayashi has maintained his flare when it comes to brilliant OSTs and his work here doesn't let us down as always. This is YURiKA's third OP (accounting for Little Witch Academia and Houseki no Kuni) and as nice as it sounds, it is nothing short of methodical and fantastic and was an OP that I couldn't afford to just skip and let loose. Alongside Yuiko Oohara whom has the same music repertoire with YURiKA (performing the same series songs, plus Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san's sweet OP), it was an excellent song through and through and really spoke life into the host of characters. Overall, another great strike for the win.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! as a series, it's very controversial as much as its realism depict and reflect the happenings of such sports in real life. The reasoning for not being able to follow in the parents' footsteps, to one that eventually makes and breaks oneself is brutal AF (but definitely not the way to go), and I thought that it did justify the case studies of such family-based situations, and for what it does, it did a heck of a job (but not everyone's gonna take it well). So unless you care for such forced unnecessary drama, you can throw this series out of the bag. I never thought I would say this, but if drama is your forte like so many cringeworthy drama-based shows act like the way it should be, then this is your sauce. If you ain't any match for drama, then why are you watching this?",

            "content": "(This review is spoilerless.) \r\nThis series is a very bad sport series.\r\nHonestly, based on the ideas and quality productions alone cannot make this series to be an interesting or even watchable. Personally, I like nothing in this series starting from plots, ideas, characters, pacing, tones, dialogues, progressions and developments. This is one of most pandering and corny sport series I have ever seen for a while. It feel like I'm not even watching sport or let alone the series itself. Everything look fan service to me. \r\nPlots that building up to be an obnoxiously over-dramatic sport life where everyone don't play sport as they feellike or love to play it anymore. They only play sport for winning which in my opinion isn't the purpose or goal of sport itself.\\n\\n\r\nIdeas that having weirdly morals about you can being a jerk and having no sportsmanship to everyone but if you are good at sport or you feel some kind of sorry, everyone will forgive and forget what you do even though they have no reason to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters that are mostly confused because they don't know how to separate sport logic form life logic. You don't have to win every time or have to be the best at it. You can be yourself and happy to do the thing you like. If you don't feel like to play sport, just quit it. It's not like badminton is only occupation in the world right ? \\n\\n\r\nThe pacing and tones that keep going back and forth as director doesn't know how to direct other type of tones and pacing rather than drama and sport that only smack their shuttlecock to each others' face with no plan or strategy. (except the very last match between main character in final episodes which some kind worth to watch)\\n\\n\r\nDialogues that totally horrible as everyone always speak aggressively to each other and keep complain about how life so bad in a metaphoric way. \\n\\n\r\nThese are brief examples of the problems why this series is so bad in my opinion. Now let's get into the detail explanations. \\n\\n\r\n1.) I don't like how this series present the ideas of badminton or sport at all. The ideas of badminton and how social life work seem so separate and don\u2019t go along with each others so much. Even though the series want us to think that badminton is a life for characters or the whole world to move along with. But most of the time the logic and gimmicks to link this two ideas together don\u2019t make any senses. Every scenes and plot points look extremely corny and forced. It feels like everything in the entire series always try to reason with each other by using badminton and sport as an important factor in every arguments. When characters and scenes are executed by using these badminton and sport life as main arguments, they look so stupid and so hard to understand what they are thinking. Some people may say that these combinations of both ideas are just some metaphoric and hidden massage of how realism work, but the point is in the end, these just make everything much more complex and over dramatic for unnecessary reason. Just drop the badminton things for a second and make character do and think like a normal person will make this series much more realistic.\\n\\n\r\n2.) The morals in each episode are so moronic and hard to actually believe and work in real life. Again if this series follow the way of trying to be \u201cREALISTIC\u201d then the morals are actually important and it is the matter of fact that these will make the series to have much more visualize images of \u201cwhat get what after done what\u201d things going on along the entire run. Some scenes and plot points are exaggerated and pandering so much. Doing things that are absolutely not gonna happened in real life and then get away with it or characters and plots just forget about it seem so convoluted and doesn\u2019t make any senses. This will be an exception to cut the score or to even considered as a bad point if the series doesn\u2019t try so hard to become \u201cREALISTIC\u201d though (based on how the series tones and plots were presented). This circumstance actually make me believe that characters and plot points don\u2019t have their own morals and stand points and they are changed over the time with no subtlety and development at all.\\n\\n\r\n3.) This series have one of the worst dialogues I have ever heard in my life. This is the most important key that absolutely ruin this series in my opinion. First, characters usually talk nonsense and metaphoric which kind of annoying and irritating and actually extend the running time to become a boring mess that ruin both tone and story progression and development. Second, this series are extremely over dramatic because of dialogues alone as every characters usually talk like they want to punch each other face for all the time. They insulted and roasted each other for absolutely no reason which even make plots and sequences look so much pandering and fan-service which some time even extend the length of dramatic tone to the maximum limit that later destroyed other tone and plot as well. Third, characters usually repeat the same thing they have been speak and think for several time for no reason which even make this series so long and boring.\\n\\n\r\n4.) Scenes and plots arrangements, pacing and even execution in this series aren\u2019t very good at all. In fact most of them look so confused and hard to tell what viewers should actually focus at the very moment. They are too cramped for the starter. In one episode they have over 100 plots going around and none of them have an impact on each others. Also these plots are always appear randomly with no enough development and subtlety. They cut so many tone and story of an important point that viewers kind of care for the most of time and even make the overall episode to be much more chaotic and confused. Additionally, the storytelling and pacing in this series is sometime totally bad in terms of timing, cliffhanging and swapping. They are so many plot points that are telling in those stage which quite annoying and irritating for those viewers who doesn\u2019t want to watch the three kingdom of badminton.\\n\\n\r\n5.) There are so many stereotype of characters that viewers can actually see and predict their plot for a mile away and even stay the same with no developments or changes during the entire run. The hard strong shounen women who doesn't know how to give up and extremely hot-blood. The want to be winner innocent character. The senpai lover. The girl who look kind and nice outside but her life is very sad. Everything you can easily guess.\\n\\n\r\n6.) This series is easily predictable. Nothing significantly going on during the entire run rather than things that you might seen and think since the very beginning of the series about girls who want to play sport (and win) so much which in each episode will have dramas as a layer to it as always and in the end will conclude with we are friend now kind of cliche'. Furthermore, every morals in each plot arcs (yes, the entire 2-3 episodic sequences) are actually the same. This is so boring in both short and long running viewing experiences. Watching this series only in the beginning and the last would actually give you the same result you want as watching the entire series.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that's all my opinion why this series is so bad even though it has very good productions. If the main important characteristic of the series, plot isn't compelling enough or even downright design to be fan service, then I have no reason to watch such failure series.\\n\\n\r\nThe final score is 1/10. 1 score comes from quality animation productions alone.\\n",

            "content": "Hanebado has proven to being one of the more unique, emotionally driven sports anime. What I mean by that is it tackles the genre by having a more serious tone, focusing on the \u2018dark side\u2019 of competitive sports that sports anime don't usually show. It doesn\u2019t have those stupid \u201cspecial moves\u201d or fanservice crap you see in sports anime. \r\nHanebado is basically a sports anime about badminton. Whilst saying that, I think one of the core strengths of the series is it focuses more on the characters, their inner struggles and overcoming their emotional tramua. Badminton is in a sense the platform to have tohave these characters interact and and advance the plot of the story.\\n\\n\r\nPlot: 8\\n\r\nThe foundation of the story revolves around two MCs who are depicted in the classic \u201ctalented prodigy Vs hardwork underdog\u201d tale.\\n\\n\r\nThe first is Ayano Hanesaki, a talented high school girl who was trained by her prodigy of a mother, and has years of built of tramua that are rooted from Ayano wanting to live up to her mother\u2019s expectations who left her. The other is Aragaki, the head strong, hardworking team captain who has earned her stripes through hard work. While she does have her height at her advantage, she has no natural talent. It\u2019s mentioned early on Hanesaki and Aragaki have a history playing each other in middle school. This event gave birth to a new rivalry/relationship between them. Aragaki, fuelled by her loss to Ayano, hardened herself to train harder.\u2028\u2028 These two depressing stories create a beautiful parallel between the girls, where they both ask themselves the question:\\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you play badminton?\u201d\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\r\nThe characters are well written, diverse and memorable. Ayano\u2019s rivals (Aragaki, Connie, Kaoruko) especially get fleshed out really well and get a good amount of character development (albeit Connie\u2019s wasn\u2019t the best executed and her changes come off a bit unrealistic imo). We get insight into their characters, their childhood, what shaped them to be the people they are now and their motivation to playing badminton. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the ones who stand out and I\u2019m most invested into are the main leads, who I think are brilliant characters. I love the fact that Ayano has a split personality and the way the show portrays the dichotomy between her shy, soft spoken self to this absolute merciless, monster on the court, which is entertaining to watch. It\u2019s a unique and refreshing take on a MC that I haven\u2019t seen in a sports anime.   \\n\\n\r\nI know some may be turned off by \u201cDarth Ayano\u201d and think she\u2019s edgy because of her blunt and rude attitude, her lack of sportsmanship or love for the sport she plays. However, I feel some people fail to grasp the depth of Ayano\u2019s psychological tramua and how badly it\u2019s affected her. Also, seeing Ayano slowly breaking out of her shell slowly and coming to accept her team in her character arc is brilliant to watch unfold.  \\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 10\\n\r\nThe visuals are beautiful. Every time I see a close up or zoom in of a badminton shot, I\u2019m in awe of how absolutely stunning the animation is.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nThe opening is probably my favourite out of all the anime I\u2019ve watched this season. The OP is energetic, lively and upbeat. The chorus especially is catchy and fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\r\nI liked Hanebado. It was one of my most anticipated anime I looked forward to watch of Summer 2018. \\n\\n\r\nWhile there\u2019s some flaws, for example the input of excessive drama- while removing some of the comedic aspects and moments of lightheartedness were we see the team bonding in the manga annoyed me. The anime changing the characterisation of some of the characters e.g. Connie and Kaoruko, who were portrayed to being more of bitchy rivals to Ayano in order to further along the regression of her mental state so we see Darth Ayano sooner. Also, the overall direction/route it took in some scenes weren\u2019t executed great and I thought were much better handled in the manga. I still think the show gets a lot of unnecessary flack. \\n\\n\r\nI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not all happy go lucky shit where the team all gets along and everyone has the same mentality reducing their personality to a \u2018herd mentality\u2019 like for instance, in Haikyuu. I don\u2019t mean to throw shade at the show, I just think it\u2019s too idealistic and unrealistic in the way it portrays how everyone puts the team first above themselves in any given situation. That\u2019s why I like the interpersonal drama in Hanebado because it adds realism. Not everyone is going to get along, and their will be some conflict/drama that arises in competitive sports, but we accept each other\u2019s flaws or weaknesses and move on. Here, the characters are treated as people with their own personalities and motivations that drive them to playing badminton, as well as being a team.\\n\\n\r\nI prefer the manga more, but that doesn\u2019t change how much I love the amazing storytelling, visuals, beautifully animated matches, the techniques and information about badminton, and drama potrayed within the anime. Gotta love the drama ;)",

            "content": "I honestly don't know why I bothered finishing this. As a child I grew up with Badminton so to see the first two episodes portraying the sport in such an ugly fashion put me off it for a while before I continued. But here we are and let's have a chat on Hanebado. (Insert joke about how you can't spell \"Hanebado\" without \"bad\" here).\r\nI've watched two sports anime this season based on fanservice-heavy manga. The other one being Harukana Receive. While I can't comment exactly on how faithful each adaptation is, I would've much preferred Harukana's approach to the genre. That is to say ageneric, but decently done sports anime on friendship happiness puppies sunshine and all that nonsense with a heavy dose of fanservice and waku waku shequasars. On paper, Hanebado's approach of forgoing most of the fanservice and light-hearted moments and instead zeroing in on the drama and misery seems right up my alley. After all, Ayano's character is defined essentially by her abandonment by her mother. However, in execution it just doesn't cut it for me.\\n\\n\r\nMy largest complaint about the series is its lack of focus. From the first 2 episodes focused almost exclusively on Nagisa's development to the point of making her seem like the main character (she's not, but she's still the most important secondary character), to the side stories on sausage girl and senpai boy which I frankly don't give much a toss on about, the series feels somewhat schizophrenic when it comes to its plot. While ostensibly about Ayanon, she doesn't make much of an impact up until episode 5. I will say however I did enjoy Ayanon's drive and character study, especially the drama surrounding her and her shit mother, though the resolution to that in the final episode is a complete copout. \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of characters, they are either hate-sinks or mostly forgettable. They change personality so quick you'd swear they were bipolar. Prime examples include Connie and Kaoruko where after taunting Ayano several times they show up a few episodes later wanting to be good friends? And to have Ayanon forget all the shit they've done?? What!? You can't just take a shit on my lawn and say you wanna be friends me while I'm bashing your head in with a badminton racket the next day. Good thing Ayano's one of the few characters with consistent personality. Her anger doesn't dissipate and the comeuppance she serves is cathartic. You can feel her breaking point and her insanity leaking out at any moment. It's brilliant. The horror music too perfectly ramps things up a notch. Making this my second favourite unintentional comedy of the season (the other being Happy Sugar Life). Though speaking of Happy Sugar Life, it's awful how Ayanon's mother came out unscathed and without any karmic retribution or even any lasting hatred from Ayanon. \\n\\n\r\nThe audio design in this is pretty bad too. A lot of the times the BGM can overpower the lines of dialogue spoken by the characters. Especially when the horror strings are playing. Ayano with her softer voice is the prime victim in this. It always feels like her voice lines are played loud enough to be heard with any clarity, even when she\u2019s shouting.\\n\\n\r\nAt times I do wonder if the director actually hates the sport. Badminton is portrayed as a really ugly thing in this, being the driving force behind Ayano's trauma and the source of many conflicts throughout. Matches are animated well enough, and they don't bore me to the extent of how Harukana's did, but honestly the characters behind the net ruin the experience for me. Being the horrible people they are. \\n\\n\r\nOh well. I wonder if Yonex ever regrets sponsoring this.\\n\\n\r\n3/10. Would not Wei-wei.",

            "content": "Hanebado! This anime has come under a lot of praise and criticism since it first released this summer. Some have praised it for its realism while others have criticised it for bad writing and character inconsistencies. For me though, I\u2019m actually really happy with the way this anime went. I got invested in this show because there\u2019s a lot I can relate to. To give us out some serious talk, all us have had some kind of issue growing up especially with our parents. Now granted, most of us didn\u2019t have the kind of issue that Ayano has with her mother, but the anime givesa good example of what happens when you make a bad decision that has a long lasting effect along with showing just how bad life can get. This is the reason why so many people are so frustrated with this show.\\n\\n\r\nAnd I get it. No honestly, I do. I get why people wouldn\u2019t like this show because most of us have never experienced the kind of hardships that Ayano has been through. Most have never even experienced the pain or fear of abandonment. Simply put, the people who hate this show comes from a lack of experience themselves, not because they\u2019re bad people themselves. That\u2019s why I like this show so much. The writers were not afraid to tell this story the way they did instead of playing it safe, even at the risk of being heavily criticized themselves. It\u2019s easy for the younger anime fans to criticize these things because they have yet to experience real hardships themselves. On the other hand though, it\u2019s easy for the adults, the older fans, to forget that they were once teenagers themselves. And since the majority of anime characters are teenagers, we as a whole tend to forget that at that age we are bound to make more mistakes than we would as an adult.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing you need to understand about Hanebado is that this is not a typical moe show with cute girls doing cute things while all sharing the same passion like Harukana Receive or Yuru Camp. And while this anime is about badminton, the sport is not the main focus of the story. In fact, it never has been. This isn\u2019t a sports story with a bunch of drama thrown in, this is a character driven story that is mainly about one character\u2019s tragic journey with badminton being her driving force. The sport itself acts both as a subplot and a driving force for its characters. Every major character you see has their own story to tell. What they went through to get where they are, what hardships they had to face, and ultimately how they feel about each other.\\n\\n\r\nTo give some comparisons, Hanebado shares a lot of parallels to the Rocky movies, specifically the first two, and it\u2019s story is essentially the dark side of the those film. While Rocky Balboa was on quest to prove himself, Ayano is on a quest for revenge. Additionally, many characters in Hanebado represent other characters in the Rocky films, with some obvious differences of course. To truly understand Hanebado and the story it\u2019s trying to tell, we have to look at every character individually. Which is why for this review, instead of doing my usual EASY TO UNDERSTAND kind of thing, I am going to talk about every who has played some role in Ayano\u2019s life. On that note this will not include Nagisa or Nozomi because both of them virtually have nothing to do with Ayano. Hopefully, even if you still don\u2019t like this show after this review, one day you will come to understand and perhaps even appreciate it because as we get older we begin to have a better understanding or not just fictional characters, but the human mind as well.\\n\\n\r\nKAORUKO SERIGAYA - The Arch Nemesis\\n\r\nLet\u2019s start with the one who inadvertently started the whole thing. When we first see Kaoruko she immediately strikes you as a person who is very arrogant, very disrespectful, and perhaps a little crazy. Her history with Ayano is that of a classic arch nemesis. Being one of the earliest of Ayano\u2019s opponents, Kaoruko was unable to beat her until she deliberately got Ayano sick with her cold, sabotaging their match while using the excuse that she wanted to fight on even terms. Because of that, Ayano ended losing, something that would a devastating effect on her. A few years later she shows up at Ayano\u2019s school unannounced and challenges Ayano, beating not through skill but through psychology.\\n\\n\r\nSo in the beginning it\u2019s easy to dislike Kaoruko. She intimidates her opponents by talking down on them, making them feel that they\u2019re no match for her. She even trash talks her own teammates. However, there\u2019s a lot more to Kaoruko than you realize for she is essentially the Apollo Creed of this anime. In the Rocky movies Apollo also liked to brag and trash talked his opponents, but he also had the means to back it up. He didn\u2019t become the heavyweight champion for nothing, he did it by doing the work that was required. Kaoruko is exactly the same way. She may be rude and disrespectful, but she didn\u2019t get where she was by doing nothing. She\u2019s worked harder than any other player on her team. She doesn\u2019t play badminton for popularity points. She plays it because she wants to, and she wants to be the best out there. She\u2019s earned the right to brag and trash talk.\\n\\n\r\nBut of course, her arrogance eventually got the better of her. In her second official match with Ayano, she made the mistake of thinking she was facing the exact same opponent. Well, she soon found out she was wrong and lost because of it. However, she didn\u2019t go down without a fight and this is where I really do admire her. Like Apollo, she\u2019s very knowledgeable about the sport she plays. In addition, she does have a cute side to her which is shown when she develops a schoolgirl crush on Ayano\u2019s badminton coach. However, when it comes to badminton she gets serious. When she realizes she is not facing the same Ayano from before, she changes her strategy. She uses all her knowledge of badminton in a effort to beat her opponent, believing that she can win after falling behind. All the work she\u2019s put in shows, to the point that even her teammates, who she was rude to before, can\u2019t help but cheer her on. But in the end, it\u2019s not enough and she loses, her pride being further damaged by Ayano\u2019s own trash talk.\\n\\n\r\nNow you can say that she had it coming, and she did, but I like to believe that her loss against Ayano finally showed her that she wasn\u2019t invincible, that she was as vulnerable as every other player, and that she finally accepted her human. This may sound crazy but I actually consider Kaoruko to be the best girl of the anime. The reason why I believe that is because in that final scene when she broke down after her loss, it showed me that beneath all that arrogance there is a sweet girl there. The problem is that she lacks the social skills to really express them. So in the end, Kaoruko is not an evil person. Arrogant, yes, but not evil. And she actually respects Ayano because she is the reason she works really hard to perfect her skills. And again, she may have started the whole thing with Ayano, however she is not directly responsible for Ayano\u2019s mother leaving. And speaking of which, let\u2019s now shift our focus to\u2026\\n\\n\r\nUCHIKA HANESAKI - Worst Mother Of The Year\\n\r\nWe have every reason to hate this character, for under no circumstances should a parent ever abandon a child. However, I disagree with everyone who says that she is a terrible person. A terrible mother, definitely, but not a terrible person. The thing you need to understand about Uchika is that she is a badminton fanatic. To her, badminton is her life to the point where it\u2019s her obsession. It consumes her everyday thought. And when you look at her past, it\u2019s understandable. She was a ten time national champion\u2026 who suddenly became pregnant and had a child. Now we don\u2019t know what the exact circumstances were leading to her pregnancy, but even though her life had suddenly changed her obsession with badminton didn\u2019t. And sadly there\u2019s a lot of parents in the real world who are like this.\\n\\n\r\nWhen you\u2019ve had such a successful career in whatever your profession is, settling down and starting a family is the furthest thing in your mind. You\u2019re either ready for it, or you\u2019re not. And that\u2019s the thing with Uchika, she was simply not ready to become a mother yet because her mind was always on badminton even when she was pregnant with Ayano. This carried on through Ayano\u2019s childhood and later Connie\u2019s. In every scene Uchika is in, flashback or otherwise, she is always talking about something related to badminton. It\u2019s never about them. Heck, she doesn\u2019t even see them as her daughters or even as children. She sees them as her proteges. She doesn\u2019t see herself as a mother, she sees herself as a coach. It doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t love them any less, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t know how to be a mother. Her obsession with badminton is her undoing.\\n\\n\r\nHer leaving Ayano initially wasn\u2019t because of Ayano, it was because of herself. When Ayano lost, her badminton mind told her that she had failed as coach. Because of that, she leaves Ayano to relieve her frustration by training her other student Connie but ended staying longer than she planned when Connie started to show potential. Again, her mind is always on badminton. Later on, we discover that the real reason was because she wanted Ayano to develop her skills on her own without having to rely on her. Now of course, this doesn\u2019t excuse her actions but when you look at her character it does make sense and she even acknowledges that she\u2019s been a terrible mother. A terrible person wouldn\u2019t say that. In families who are financially successful, especially the very rich ones, more often than not we see the children of those families grow into spoiled brats, sometimes even violent ones. This is because either the parents are spoiled brats themselves or were so focused of their lives and careers they ended up neglecting their own children. In the case of Ayano and her mother\u2019s successful career, who\u2019s to say Ayano wouldn\u2019t have turn out the same way if she continued to cling to Uchika?\\n\\n\r\nWhen you really think about, Ayano\u2019s strained relationship with her mother is not much different from Indiana Jones and his strained relationship with his father. Both their parents are very much alike and yet they were both trying to teach their children to rely on themselves rather than their parents. Henry Jones ignored his son for the most part partly due to his obsession with the Holy Grail while Uchika took the more extreme method by leaving Ayano behind. Both had the same idea, but Uchika\u2019s method was entirely wrong and she knows it, but again her mind is always on badminton. Her decision has left a permanent scar on Ayano, one that she will have to deal with one day. Luckily for Ayano, she had at her side\u2026\\n\\n\r\nELENA FUJISAWA - The Childhood Friend\\n\r\nAt this point in time Elena was the closest person to Ayano after Uchika\u2019s departure. She had tried to support Ayano the best that she could as a friend though. In a way, she\u2019s essentially Mickey Goldmill, Rocky\u2019s original trainer. Her mistake though was that she didn\u2019t fully understand Ayano\u2019s trauma with her abandonment. You see, a lot of people claim that Elena is entirely at fault for bringing Ayano back into badminton when she didn\u2019t want to when in truth it wasn\u2019t because how was she supposed to know what was going to happen to Ayano? Simple, she couldn\u2019t have and it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t know about Uchika\u2019s other student Connie.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason why she forcibly brought Ayano back into the sport of badminton was she because she felt that Ayano\u2019s reason was very foolish, and I agree with her. Why should you abandon the sport you love so much just because you\u2019re mother left you? Elena is basically trying to tell Ayano that, \u201cHey, there are better ways to play badminton. Forget about your mother. Play for yourself, or better yet, play for a team.\u201d. Elena was simply doing was friends do, helping her friend out by telling Ayano she shouldn\u2019t give up her passion just because her mother. And in the first five episodes, Ayano begins to see a new light in the sport. She begins to enjoy it again and becomes fascinated with the idea of being with a team. Elena had done her job by bringing happiness to Ayano again and all was going well. That is until the sudden and unexpected arrival of\u2026\\n\\n\r\nCONNIE CHRISTENSEN - The Other Protege\\n\r\nNow Connie is the most misunderstood character in this anime. A Danish girl who is rather tall, she was trained by Uchika at an early age due to the overseas trips Uchika often took. People write off this character because of how she initially treats Ayano and for her sudden character shifts. I understand perfectly well why people really dislike this character. However, the reason for the dislike isn\u2019t necessarily because of bad writing, but rather the anime\u2019s poor execution of her character especially when she tries to be nicer to Ayano. For me though, Connie is the character I feel the most sorry for because she is basically the innocent victim in this story. Granted, she pretty much brought on herself but let me try to explain Connie\u2019s character as best I can.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing about Connie is that she\u2019s very competitive when it comes to badminton. Her coach Uchika is also very competitive in badminton, so naturally she assumed Ayano would be the same. Like Kaoruko, she wants to prove that she\u2019s the best in the sport but the big difference is that she has a more personal reason. She wants to prove that she\u2019s the better student of Uchika\u2019s two proteges. In a competitive sport like badminton where you\u2019ve been trained by the same teacher this is a perfectly normal thing to do. Who wouldn\u2019t want to prove who\u2019s the best of the two? The problem was that Connie was overcome by her overeagerness to prove herself. While it\u2019s never shown in the anime it\u2019s heavily implied that Uchika did not want Connie to face Ayano just yet. Whether this was because Ayano would beat her easily or because she wouldn\u2019t take to well with suddenly having a stepsister is uncertain, but given Uchika\u2019s character it was quite likely both.\\n\\n\r\nNow some of you I\u2019m sure are asking about Connie sudden request for Ayano to accept her as her sister instead of her rival when she was so hostile towards her in the beginning. Well, to understand that you have to look at Connie\u2019s own past for it\u2019s very similar to Ayano\u2019s. Through her flashbacks we see that Connie had lived a very lonely life in her childhood. Every scene we see her she is always alone. We\u2019re never shown why exactly that but considering she was living in a very nice house it\u2019s safe to assume that she had parents that virtually ignored her and not because she was an orphan. She developed a passion for badminton but this did little to cure the loneliness in her heart. Then comes Uchika, who not only becomes her coach but takes her in as her daughter. Despite Uchika\u2019s faults, this is one of the kindest things she\u2019s even done even though it would later have a devastating effect on Ayano.\\n\\n\r\nThe reason for Connie\u2019s initial hostility isn\u2019t actually directed Ayano personally, but rather at the idea of being part of a team as shown in their first match. This has nothing to do with any so called rivalry, it\u2019s actually has to with Connie\u2019s insecurity. When you look at her past, it makes a lot of sense. Given the lonely life she\u2019s gone through she\u2019s pretty much taught herself that she doesn\u2019t need to rely on others. However, deep down she wants to be part of Ayano\u2019s family, but now that Ayano is adopting a new family with her team Connie considers this to be a threat. When she realize she that she wasn\u2019t alone through her teammates, she discovered that her entire thinking was wrong and she tried to make up with Ayano. At least, that was the intention. The problem was that the anime didn\u2019t execute very well which is why her sudden change came off as both unrealistic and unbelievable to many. However, by the time she realized this the it was already too late. Her declaration to Ayano about being Uchika\u2019s second daughter ended causing much more damage to their relationship than she realized.\\n\\n\r\nConnie\u2019s mistake though was that she rushed in without thinking. Her even bigger mistake was on how little she knew about Ayano. She only knew what Uchika had told her and had assumed that Ayano would be no different from her. What she didn\u2019t know was the fact that Uchika had abandoned Ayano and that it had left a very deep scar. She didn\u2019t know about Ayano\u2019s mental state until she actually saw it for herself. And when she did, it scared the living hell out her. All of a sudden she found herself right in the middle of ugly family feud, something she wanted no part of. She could have attempted to apologize to Ayano for her reckless behavior, but at that point Ayano had already gone over the edge. Yes, she may have cause it but again this was due to how little she knew about Ayano. Any apology now won\u2019t do her any good. This was now Ayano\u2019s and Uchika\u2019s problem. They have to sort it out themselves. Luckily for Connie, she had her teammates to support her. And now let\u2019s finally talk about\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAYANO HANESAKI - The Near Tragedy\\n\r\nAyano\u2019s story is a very sad one. It is a perfect representation of someone who fell to the dark side. To quote the famous words from Jedi Master Yoda:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cFear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.\u201d\\n\\n\r\nOne thing these characters all have in common is the fear of losing, which is quite common in single player competitive sports. All of us who are very passionate about sports hate the thought of losing. It is a bitter pill to swallow. But for Ayano, it\u2019s a much more personal reason.\\n\\n\r\nAyano\u2019s fear started when she lost to Kaoruko and that loss was greatly magnified when she sees her mother literally walk out of her life. No phone calls, no letters, no communication of any kind, nothing. She believed she lost her mother because her loss to Kaoruko was too much Uchika to bear, not knowing the real reason behind it. Because of this, she was afraid she was never see her mother again. She convinced herself that the only way she can get her mother back was by winning again. Winning every game she played would bring her closer to her mother. Any loss would take her further away, so losing for her was not an option. And that\u2019s exactly what she did, she turned into a badminton monster. Then one evening she sees a badminton magazine with Uchika on the cover, the very first time she\u2019s had any contact with her mother. However, when she opens the magazine she see a picture of her mother with a stranger at her side, kissing her on the cheek along with a quote that she won her championship thanks to Uchika as her coach. It is here that Ayano\u2019s fear turns to anger. To her, it is the ultimate betrayal.\\n\\n\r\nLuckily she was able to put aside her anger by pursuing other sports such as tennis, as we saw in the beginning, only to be dragged back into badminton by Elena for reasons I\u2019ve already stated. Understandably, she was nothing to do with the sport she once loved. Before then she only playing in the hopes she would get her mother. Now that she knows that Uchika has another student, she no longer has a reason to play. At this point, she feels she\u2019s lost everything. Her rematch against Nagisa reminds her of her loss against Kaoruko. Then Kaoruko herself shows up and Ayano tries to quit the badminton club after Kaoruko beats her again, and then later on when she loses against Connie she nearly suffers a mental breakdown. She tries to make excuses for it but then runs away. However, before that game happened she was beginning to see badminton in a new light. She was beginning to fascinated with the idea of playing for a team. Unfortunately, Connie\u2019s untimely arrival would destroy whatever hope Ayano had from saving herself from her anger. When Connie declared that Uchika was her substitute mother and she was going prove her worth over Ayano, this finally pushes Ayano over the edge. Her anger has now turned into hatred. She now wants revenge for all the suffering she\u2019s gone through.\\n\\n\r\nElena is the first to see Ayano\u2019s yandere like eyes and it scares the living hell out of her. The sweet little girl that she knew from childhood was no longer there. It was now replaced by this monster who is out for revenge. At this point, Ayano wants the people who put her through all this suffering to pay for it. She starts with Kaoruko, the one who again inadvertently started it all. As mentioned before, Kaoruko made the mistake of thinking she was facing the same opponent. But at this point, Ayano\u2019s quest for revenge was in full force. While Kaoruko did fight until the very end, she was no match for this new version of Ayano. All the trash talk she had gave Ayano earlier was thrown right back into her face and it really hurt her pride. Ayano\u2019s next target would be Connie, possibly followed by Uchika who she intends to abandon in the end. She wants to prove that she no longer needs her mother. However, she will have to get one last obstacle who is in the form of Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nTo give an comparison, Ayano in the beginning is very much like John Rambo. In the movie First Blood, Rambo was both abandoned and betrayed by his country simply he was a Vietnam War veteran. He was alone and very depressed. He virtually had no reason to go on. Ayano is very much the same. She was abandoned by her mother for no good reason and later on she lost the will to play badminton. Then Rambo finally snaps due to his mistreatment from police and goes on rampage for survival. The same thing happens to Ayano after Connie\u2019s declaration, except this time it\u2019s more personal. Ayano essentially becomes a more extreme version Clubber Lang from Rocky III. Like Clubber, she develops a very cold and arrogant personality. She treats everyone like they\u2019re below her, even her own teammates. She\u2019s no longer interested in teams, she\u2019s only interested in playing the actually good players with the intent of destroying them entirely and then giving payback to both Connie and her mother.\\n\\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION\\n\r\nDespite these great characters and a really powerful storyline, I'm really disappointed with how this anime ended. I had hoped for, and even wanted, a second season. With the way the story was going, I just didn't believe that LINDEN FILMS wouldn't end the way it did. Unfortunately though, that was too much to ask and the ending we got I felt was both underwhelming and it made the story feel incomplete.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I didn't expect Ayano to forgive her mother right away, she really learn anything throughout her experience through the whole series. It pretty ended the way it started. Nothing was really resolved between Ayano, her mother, Connie, and to lesser extent Kaoruko. It was just left the way it was, leaving you feeling really unsatisfied. Worse yet, Ayano is still in her her crazed state. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see Ayano go completely to the dark side, but I would like to see some kind of redemption.\\n\\n\r\nThe best characters, heroic characters that is, are the ones who make a mistake, a very big mistake, and then go on a journey to redeem themselves and to make things right again. For this anime I felt that some major tragedy should have befallen Ayano, one that finally wakes her up from her craze state. I knew her being beaten by Nagisa might have some impact, but not one powerful enough to really get through to her.\\n\\n\r\nI would have liked this better if season one ended on a tragic note and then season two picks up right where it left off with Ayano going on mission to redeem herself while receiving help from a completely unexpected source and ending with her biggest and most important match against Connie. And it the end, all are able to forgive each other and peace is brought back into their small world. That would have been a much more satisfying ending, at least for me.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, Hanebado! is not a bad anime, but a really underwhelming one. The story and characters are great despite some poor executions. However, the ending does not doe the story justice for how it resolves some things but leaves others unresolved. A prime example of wasted potential. This anime deserved a second season, but sadly it's unlikely we'll ever get one.\\n\\n\r\nI'm DirectorK and until next time, stay tuned!",

In reality I feel Badminton is only the device used to put over the actual plot of the story, and that overcoming emotional distress. \\n\\n\r\nNagasaki-The tall voluptuous take no names badminton player, who has earned everything she has through hard work, she has no natural talent, her height is at her advantage, but she never just relies on that alone. She goes hard at practice so much so in the early scenes you can see the negative effects this has over the entire badminton club. \\n\\n\r\nAyano- Daughter of a prodigy, with overbearing natural skill its almost annoying, the kinda of girl who has natural skill, that in comparison to Nagasaki you really want here to lose until...you see the insights of her back story,were she came from her child hood, and of course there is a picture so damning, so hurtful, that when you see it in the show, you stare at it in show the anger you hope Ayano feels begins to surround you...\\n\\n\r\nThese two depressing stories, make a tie in for an emotional conflicting ride that only wants you to see the best for birth girls...\\n\\n\r\nKey note there is some things the Anime left out in the early story about Ayano, Personally for the Anime this heightens the drama a lot and keep a certain mystery shrouded in total darkness, and very anxious. \\n\\n\r\nThe Manga dampens the blow but in my personal opinion \"same story two different tones\" Thus far I love the anime adaption...\\n\\n\r\nI gave this show 10 across the board\\n\r\n Art 10\\n\r\nSound 10\\n\r\nStory 10\\n\r\ncharacter 10\\n\r\nenjoyment 10\\n\r\noverall 10\\n\\n\r\nSometimes you run across a show, you hit play, and you fall into the world, and enjoy the ride. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

(this shouldn't spoil anything for you)\r\nThe art and sound were incredible at least...\r\nNow the story was enjoyable and I would argue the main points were believable for example Ayano's mom leaves her at a young age (guessing between 6-10) and she obviously resents her for it and thinks she left because of her talent. When she starts playing in high school she plays only to win to prove to her mom she doesnt need her (which i think is MORE the reasonable) which i enjoyed because it wasconsistent and it separated her from the crowd of protagonists in sports animes. But of course they needed to have a happy ending so in the last episode she realized how fun badminton is and makes up with her mom when she had shown up three days before the final, and Ayano had refused to talk to her due to the anger she had. That ending felt so forced and unnecessary, she can realize its fun to play badminton without having to do a complete 180 on liking her mother and becoming the stereotypical protagonist?\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest i only wrote this because of how mad i was after watching the 13th episode. I liked the first 8 when she was a ruthless player and only thought about winning but after that it started talking about morals and went to shit. well maybe my rant will make you wanna watch it... though i really don't care.",

The worst thing for me was that it felt like they didn't really know if they wanted the show to be your typical \"funny, upbeat with a few serious moments here and there\" sports anime or something more serious and realistic. At times they want to make the whole thing sound really serious and realistic and then they give one of the main characters an \"eye transformation\" power up or an \"i win because of the power of my heart even though i'm actuallyplaying injured\" moment which throws away all the seriousness they'd built up and overall makes the whole thing feel bs af.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are average at best. By the time the last episode came i really didn't give a banana peel about any of the characters involved in the final match. Both were annoying, bland and quite boring, although \"psycho eyes\" mode girl was interesting for a little bit but they also ruined that with a bunch of cheap drama. Their reasons to \"fight\" were lame or even non existent. Things happen because the plot dictates it, not because the characters have real motivations and feelings to make them happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot is basically non existent. Several things are happening but each character's stories never really come together as a whole. The ending feels rushed and incomplete. They never really explain important plot points like why the hell the main character's mother just decided to leave her like a bag of trash and go live in another country and adopt another girl. Don't ask how the hell is a japanese single woman able to adopt a kid in Denmark? I don't know either.

            "content": "Ah Hanebado, the sport that is really underrated in all honesty is finally being adapted into a show...except that show is disguised as a cheap drama with a competition to see who can draw the best yandere face at LIDENFILMS \r\nThey don't call it HaneBADo for a reason amirite?\r\n*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\nPlot: \r\nSo Hanebado delves into the perspective of 2 central protagonists. Well I say to but really we just have 1 protag while the other is pretty much disregarded for half the story. If I had to give an analogy over how the story went, let's use a burger shall we? Now Aragaki ourhero...ine represents the buns, shown at both the beginning and the end of the story whereas Hanesaki, is like that weird special sauce that once you bite into the burger just leaks everywhere and covers the entire burger and gets your hands all dirty and gives you a bad time. Anywho our story starts off with a match between our central protagonists, in which one is clearly putting all the effort she's got while the other, yep you guessed it...has a yandere face on. Yandere face wins and our other protagonist goes into deep depression and copes using drugs and alcohol, which leads her to develop anger issues. Well everything except the first and last parts are false. Fast forward years later in high school and what a surprise! They're both going to the same school. Eventually our yandere friend (who is perfectly sane at this point) get peer pressured into joining the school's badminton team even though she clearly doesn't want to, and once she meets Anger issues guess what... she gets anger issues!! Now I would be lying if I didn't say that this setup was pretty promising (barring the obvious issues). What we could've gotten is 2 rivals who are opposed against each other, one who is energetic and the other who is more serious, learn to cope with each other for the greater good of the school's team and rely on each other to develop their own skills. Sounds familiar doesn't it?\\n\\n\r\nInstead what we got was 12 eps of utter nonsense ranging from Hanesaki's mother leaving her when she was young (which we'll have fun with that later), to Hanesaki having a non-biological sister (yay yuri shippers) to pointless side character expeditions just so we know that the whole world doesn't revolve around our protagonists and that there are actually other members in the club. Cause y'know, it's a sports anime\\n\\n\r\nSee the main problem with Hanebado is that it tries to fit in a bunch of shounen elements (even though it's a seinen) but it never takes the time to well... actually show them. What we end up getting is a bunch of half-assed executions and all problems getting resolved in a matter of minutes. Athlete is currently in a slump? Yeah just play a few rounds and you're good as new. Can't win a game even when your yandere face is active? Yeah just remember that one time everyone said \"we're a team\" and despite you treating them like absolute shit, they're still behind you. Mother left you for supposedly bad intentions when you were young? Yeah don't worry about it she obviously had good intentions for it, just lose a game and it's all settled\\n\\n\r\nSo how does this wonderful journey end you may ask? Well we do get that typical sports scenario where the last few episodes are all focused on the end-all game of the century where it's round 2 between yandere and anger issues (although she has calmed down at this point so hey, character development amirite). Now usually in shows that do this like Kuroko's Basket, we get these prolonged episodes to build tension and hype into the game, in order for all the elements such as sound, art and characters to come together for the epic ending. In Hanebado's case, what we get is the kind of shaft style art you'd see in ef: slow motion jump cut back and forth, and constant breathing for about a solid minute or 2. Yep that's it. There's no thrilling use of OST, no witty quotes about never giving up, we don't even get to see SPOILER Aragaki smash it or finesse it past Hanesaki. We just get a bunch of uncolored lines, some breathing and then it jumps to the end. Even the crowd were like wtf is going on\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nJudging by the last few sentences you can probably guess where I'm going with sound. It's not really there. Well it is but not where it is needed the most. One of the main purposes of the OST is to set the atmosphere, whether it be tense, joyful or dramatic like we've seen recently with BnHA S3. Part of what makes OST's so outstanding is the ability to recognize certain tracks that play, such as Monogatari's Suteki Meppu, or the infamous hug scene in Clannad AS. Sure there are dramatic tracks in dramatic situations, but there's nothing really that gets me into the mood of the situation. Now you may be complaining \"It's not a shounen so don't expect that kind of stuff\" but even in something like the Chuunibyou movie, the use of the OST provided an excellent set to the situation. Moving on the OP isn't anything too spectacular/funky/outright intriguing. It's not a bad song per se, but the energetic vibes from it really contrast with the show in general\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\\n\r\nNow this is the one field where I do have to give credit for. Not so much the art, since it was basically yandere faces and especially during the final match it was all over the place, but the animation. For badminton, a sport with a lot of rapid movements, I thought the animation was pretty well done, especially since the use of CGI was scarce (if used at all apart from the shuttlecock). Maybe the animation off the matches wasn't amazing, but definitely the actual matches themselves were some eye candy\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: As my old friend Anakin would say, this is where the fun begins\\n\\n\r\nBunch of Side Characters: Literally have no use at all other than to visually show how much Hanesaki/Aragaki are treating them like shit, and to lighten the mood when those 2 can't since they're always mad. There was also a romance subplot going on with some love triangle drama, but that turned out to be rubbish because main girl didn't know if she like the B(adminton) or the D(ick). Spoiler, she chooses the B.\\n\\n\r\nIzumi: Slightly more important side character. She stays by Aragaki's side when she goes batshit crazy and practically causes half the club to leave. Oh yeah, she also's involved in a match or 2 and gets involved with some past beef with big lips and her rapist looking coach\\n\\n\r\nTachibana: New coach that introduced himself by molesting Hanesaki's hands in the beginning. Nice. Literally only there to provide commentary on the game (as every sports anime needs) and to constantly remind Aragaki that her knee is gonna get messed up (but she has plot armor so who cares)\\n\\n\r\nNozomi: Big lips. I say that but they aren't really that big so excuse me. Anywho not much to say other than she was selected because rapist coach though she followed instructions well or something. Pretty much becomes rapist coach's slave until she manages to get saved with the power of Badminton, cause every sports anime needs that slave needing saving right? (Looking at you Major)\\n\\n\r\nRapist coach: By far the most developed character. We see him start off as your generic douche-bag who only cares about winning, but then he suddenly does a 180 and becomes the generic old dude who gives insights on the match. Now that's some serious change! Oh yeah, he also completely analyzed Aragaki and her fitness by staring at her ass for a few seconds\\n\\n\r\nSerigaya: Pink haired ponytail antagonist. Molested Hanesaki when they were young so that she would get sick and therefore lose the game (which led to her mother leaving her). What an asshole. Eventually gets paired up against Hanesaki and gets defeated. Take that dick\\n\\n\r\nErena: Hanesaki's BFF and that girl who peer pressured her into joining. Ngl she's probably my least favourite character. The whole time she acts all confused as to why Hanesaki is so depressed and yandere like when she's literally the reason. And when she gets scolded by Hanesaki she just sits there and sulks (Well I guess what else are you supposed to do)\\n\\n\r\nConnie: Golden haired ponytail antag...actually I don't even know. In the beginning she acts like an antagonist, triggering her period when she realizes that she was at the convenience store with Hanesaki after all. Then she proceeds to rub it in Hanesaki's face that she's her half-sister and all of a sudden she acts all nice and wants to make amends with her? She literally makes no sense and we get an entire episode on her devoting herself to become a family with Hanesaki (like that's gonna work) and then gets dumped on and shat by yanesaki (get it cause yandere Hanesaki? No?) and then is no longer seen ever again. And that doesn't even begin to question the way she got with yane's mom. She literally impressed her with her badminton skills, Uchika tells her that she's her new mom and she just whole heatedly accepts? There are so many things weird about this. Where are her biological parents? Why does she completely ditch said parents and/or guardians to go and live with a complete stranger? Why is she so casual and calm about this even though she's a kid? Why is she at a badminton team if her parent's are nowhere to be found?\\n\\n\r\nUchika: Oh boy here we go. Trying to understand Uchika's mind set is like trying to claim Ousama Game is the best anime of all time. You just don't. Being the all famous pro badminton player that she is, it's normal for her to want to get her daughter into the sport she loves. So, when she loses a game since she was playing while sick, what does Uchika decide to do? That's right, fucking LEAVE HER. Like seriously I don't even know how much weed the author must have smoked to come up with a plot line so random as this. It's about as ridiculous as Snake destroying a tank with solely grenades, but at least that was bad ass, this was just retarded. But wait! At the last minute we're presented with the whole bad mom was good all along, and her reasoning was that... she wanted Hanesaki to get better at badminton? Like seriously that's some ass writing. But because of happy endings and all Hanesaki and Uchika reunite at the end and hold hands and circle jerk over how Connie hasn't been shown for a couple of episodes and everyone lives happily ever after. Speaking of Connie, Uchika literally showed no sign of guilt over leaving Hanesaki, even going as far as casually talking about her and showing photos to a young Connie. I get how Darling in the Franxx was trying to low key promote more births, but if people are gonna give birth to Uchika's then humanities sense is gone.  \\n\\n\r\nAragaki: Arguably the best character in the series, mainly because she wasn't present in half of it. For real, even though she started off being some angsty teen she gradually grew to become more calm and collected in her actions, as if the writers decided halfway through that they forgot to include the quiet type character into the show. Despite constant moaning from coach molester, she soldiers on and eventually wins the whole tournament and goes to nationals. Whoop di dee.\\n\\n\r\nHanesaki: Yay saving the last character for last. If you're ever bored and want to play a drinking game with your friends, drink every time Hanesaki puts on her yandere face. By the end of the show congrats! you'd be in hospital. Seriously the amount of times she puts on her yandere face makes Yuno look like your average harem girl. And the constant mood swings don't help either. Her personality changes so many times even a mathematician would have a hard time finding that angle. As the story progresses, we come to learn more about our protagonist. Like how she got molested, got sick and then got her mother leaving the front door. But don't worry, she wasn't mad that her mother completely abandoned her, she was mad that she thought her mother thought she was shit at badminton. That way at the end, all the pieces were put together for their heartfelt reunion amirite? Oh yeah, she also treats everyone like shit for pretty much her whole time, but as soon as she returns to normal everything's all good and no harm done. If only irl sports teams worked that way.\\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\\n\r\nOverall I wouldn't say HaneBADo is the worst sports anime there is, but it certainly is far from the best. On paper it's good that they took a more dramatic approach to typical sports shows, but if you're gonna do that route, then it kinda makes you look bad when you start adding cliche shounen sports elements to it   \\n\\n",

            "content": "Although I\u2019ve marked this series as \u201cCompleted\u201d, I actually ragequit in the last episode with only a few minutes left to go. I\u2019ve never seen a supposedly character-driven show fail so hard on every plot-related aspect while acing everything else. \r\nThe OP drew me in with its slick, beautiful animation and the charming smile of Ayano Hanesaki. Unfortunately, upon finishing (or near-finishing) this show, the only positive impressions I was left with were indeed the animation and Ayano Hanesaki. \r\nHanebado! seemingly wants to depict the growth of Ayano and her counterpart Nagisa into badminton players who play with a happy, healthy mindset. Yet while itsets that up decently, every step along the way is fumbled. Most damning of all (and it\u2019s hard to pick any one thing here) is the treatment of Ayano. Ayano is depicted as a girl with massive trauma lying underneath her seemingly cute, innocent surface. She\u2019s been abandoned by her mother because of her inability as a child to be a perfect badminton robot and as a result, playing badminton reverts the paltry progress she\u2019s made into having feelings or developing a persona separate from vying for approval from her only caregiver, even if it\u2019s stunted, childish, and a little backwards. It\u2019s actually a nuanced and realistic portrayal of childhood trauma that I deeply relate with. \\n\\n\r\nSomehow, every single character watches her relive her trauma and shift back into a zombie who plays solely to avoid being abandoned and to create some feeble sense of self-worth, with snark and arrogance as her only defense, and NOBODY HELPS WHATSOEVER. As they witness this descent that they themselves brought upon her, her clubmates fail to see that she needs people to care about her and react to her with jealousy and hostility as soon as she really begins falling apart, her coach gives up on projecting his failed Olympic dreams into her when she fails to have any emotional response towards them and dismisses all her hard work as \u201cnatural talent\u201d, her best friend doesn\u2019t realize she needs to take responsibility for pushing Ayano into this until the very end, and worst of all\u2014 her mother. The story idea of \u201cI\u2019m a poor trauma survivor and everybody hates me\u201d isn\u2019t impossible to work with, but everyone here is portrayed with no critical eye, and absolutely nobody has to deeply rethink their worldview. The sideplots with the other club mates whose names I can\u2019t even recall are dumb and boring as a result, and absolutely nobody is likeable. What\u2019s the point when we\u2019ve clearly seen a setup of \u201cAyano\u2019s trigger is badminton and she\u2019s reliving her trauma because of that\u201d and then proceed to have everybody stomp on our protagonist?! Shouldn\u2019t we hate them then?! But, of course, this show doesn\u2019t care about that\u2014 just look at the mother. \\n\\n\r\nThe mother returns to Ayano in the second half of the show. Unsurprisingly Ayano reacts with pure numbness and completely rejects her. The mom doesn\u2019t realize the error of her ways\u2014 AND THE SHOW REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM. Up to the end, her mom holds the same messed up belief that she raised Ayano the right way by abandoning her because she\u2019s better at badminton now (?!?!) and the show STILL attempts to depict her as a sympathetic figure. When Elena weakly calls her out, there\u2019s no follow up. When it\u2019s nearly the end of the show and it\u2019s time for Ayano to magically 180 and decide she loves playing badminton because the club mates who previously hated her also magically 180\u2019d and suddenly don\u2019t hate her for being snarky anymore, Ayano forgives her mom. And that\u2019s when I closed the episode. \\n\\n\r\nThese magical 180s pop up often: sometimes for drama or plot convenience, and sometimes for no reason at all. Whether it\u2019s Connie suddenly coming to Japan and her flip flopping on whether she likes Ayano and what she actually wants with her (wants to be sisters, but is cruel to her? but then sugary sweet? but why?), her club mates randomly changing their opinions on her (sometimes even before she has a breakdown, club mates tell her they hate her... but now they\u2019re friends! Even though she hasn\u2019t talked to them for two episodes.), Nagisa\u2019s Tension Creating Potential Injury, Nagisa\u2019s power level, Ayano\u2019s power level, Nozomi deciding losing is how she wants to play, Nozomi\u2019s coach being okay with that... the character motivations and actions simply don\u2019t make any sense. I\u2019d praise the badminton strategy and technical showings, since it\u2019s a sports anime, but the complete whiffing of the final Big Badminton Final (power levels aside, SWITCHING HANDS BETWEEN HITS?) also makes me strongly question the writers\u2019 ability to write something coherent. Sure, it\u2019s beautiful\u2014 the faces, the unabashed depiction of sweat\u2014 and the breathing sequence is ambitious, but it\u2019s completely soured by the heavy baggage of the plot. \\n\\n\r\nIn summary, just enjoy the opening. Look at Ayano\u2019s cute smile. And for both her sake and your own, don\u2019t watch Hanebado.",

But this anime tackles the genre seriously without all the moe crap and whatsoever.\r\nLike any decent sports anime, the sport itself is just a part of the story and the overall story focusses on the characters and their personal issues. You don't need to expect any \"special moves\" or such. While the MC is overpowered, it still seems to be in range of realistic badminton play.\r\nThe characters are fleshed out well (better than the manga actually), the art is good, the pace of the story isgood, too. At this point in time, I'd rate it as the dark horse of this anime season.",

            "content": "Have you ever felt disheartened after seeing a person with more talent figure out what you have been working on for days in a matter of minutes? She then goes on to receive rewards for her work while you sit on the side and you ask yourself, \"why did I even try\"? This has happened countless times to people at home, school, sports and at work. When we reward people for their talent. The competition feels the gap in skill and loses confidence in their capabilities while the talented individual doesn't feel challenged or a need to work hard to stay at the top. Thethemes in Hanebado! suggests that we should stop rewarding people for their talent and here's why. The purpose of rewarding people is to help them improve themselves and stay motivated. Motivation explains why a person chooses one action over another. A motivated person faces challenging problems head-on and works to find better solutions to the same problem. They tend to be more creative. Motivation leads to success. Without motivation, people lose sight of what they want to accomplish with their life.\\n\\n\r\nSuch is the message that Hanebado! tries to convey with its characters through the story that is adapted from Kousuke Hamada\u2019s manga \u2013 the story of the race between the tortoise and the hare is a great metaphor on this topic. The hare was more talented but he lost motivation to keep on running. The one who won, in the end, was the tortoise who put much more effort than the hare to win. This best explains our main characters, you have the prodigy in Ayano Hanesaki, daughter of the most decorated badminton champion in Japan with all the raw talent in the world. Then we have Nagisa Aragaki, blessed with height but determined to be the hardest work in the room in order to be the best. The story starts off with an event that takes place several months prior to the main story, the event is a match at a national high-level competition for juniors where Ayano and Nagisa square off. It\u2019s a real cinematic that you have to see for yourself, some of the best animation sequences you will ever see in anime. The end result of the match leads both characters to their lowest point, resulting in a lot of frustrations. Now in the present, both characters are in high school and the fates would have them meet again.\\n\\n\r\nNagisa is determined to improve her skills through pure effort but is doing so at the cost of her interpersonal relationships and health. Ayano, on the other hand, is just purely talented but is hesitant to play badminton because she views it as a pointless sport to play. It\u2019s a battle of raw, natural talent versus tirelessly hard work that pits the girls as seemingly inevitable rivals despite their position on the same team. It\u2019s a very easy conflict to invest into, and it\u2019s easy to see that Nagisa and Ayano\u2019s future rivalry will help drive each other\u2019s personal development and uncover the motivations beneath their actions. The two have a troubled past and are both struggling with their relation to the sport, but coming from very different places. You see them face their demons that they fight and struggle against internal and how they confront their fears overcome mental obstacles. Hanebado! fleshes out the main characters through the perspective of side characters, they are used to support the main characters \u2013 Erena for Ayano and Riko for Nagisa. A lot of the focus is on Ayano, the way they handle her split personalities was very messy and cringe at times but all at the same time the show is sort of pitting the viewers against her in favour of Nagisa. You start to get lost in the direction the show is going in.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! depicts women as driven, despairing, and headstrong in the same fashion as many male sports anime protagonists and for the most part, are taken seriously. Furthermore, the characters are physically strong and play at a high level from the get-go. It\u2019s a shame that the character drama \u2013 Ayano in particular \u2013 managed to undo some of the good things the show actually does portray very well, it gets to the point where it\u2019s irritatingly unbearable. A strength is how great the animation is, its so stunningly detailed in capturing the realism of the characters in badminton matches \u2013 from their reactions, body language, attention to detail on the movement of clothing, perspiration and muscles. Both girls fly across the court in a way that makes both their exhaust and energy feel real. The various camera angles along with slow-mo and stop-motion effects used help emphasize the badminton racket, the net and the shuttlecock responses. Lindenfilms really pulled a rabbit out of the hat with their work, its cinematography gold albeit a few times where the visuals and animation saw drops in quality.\\n\\n\r\nIn the sound department, the soundtracks are standard for sports, you could probably pick a few that really help build the atmosphere in the tense and emotional moments. I know when it came to the big matches, especially with Ayano and Nagisa, the tracks used brought the hype to intensify the moment. When you have an epic music playing in the background over top-notch animated sports sequences, it turns into a spectacle. Both OP and ED are nice but nothing special. Voice acting did its job but I only felt connected to Nagisa\u2019s VA in Miyuri Shimabukuro. She knew how to make her voice fit with Nagisa\u2019s appearance and personality, knowing how to sound strong and stern while also showing the feminine side of her tone. The sound effects are just as good, we get to her loud solid hits of a racket against a shuttlecock with all the whoosh and booms along with the sounds of rubber shoes rubbing against the court etc.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! is more of a \u2018what-could-be\u2019 if handled much better. It started off with a lot of promise, there is a lot of emotional stakes on the line, it had all the setups of being a real character-driven story where all the aspects to \u2018talent versus hard work\u2019 concept are deeply explored. But the writing loses its way and the melodrama gets out of control but it has some redeeming qualities that still make it a fine anime. It can be a hit or miss. Its been a long time coming but now a series exists that brings women off the sidelines and onto the same field as their male counterparts in a lot more serious way. Rather than functioning as a group that pops up when the boys need encouragement. In the end, Nagisa ends up being the saving grace of the show. You become invested in her character, you appreciate the sacrifices she has made to achieve her goals and you cheer her on all the way. When the slow build up to the final showdown arrives between Nagisa and Ayano it\u2019s a thrilling spectacle of how hard work can overcome talent.\\n",

            "content": "Sports anime are usually a bit over-the-top and rely on internal conflicts of the protagonist, but here this was taken in a particularly weird and annoying direction. Most major characters in the show, including the protagonist Ayano, act in an erratic, exaggerated manner that makes them simply unlikeable. Ayano's mother especially is an unbelievable piece of **** and while her actions were vaguely explained, none of the drama she causes is really believable or adds anything interesting, she's simply a horrible person dragging others down with her. Everything ends with a great confrontation between two deeply unreasonable individuals without anyone to really root for anda pretty anticlimactic resolution.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, the series is solidly produced - it looks and sounds very good and while I only had a very brief adventure with badminton myself, everything definitely felt right with how the matches were portrayed. If someone enjoys the tension and detailed animation of sports anime, they should be satisfied with this one. Much of it is drama though and I've found basically all of it rather questionable. \\n\\n\r\nWhile the beginning of the season was interesting, for me the show proved ultimately unsatisfying and I recommend it only if you're seriously into its theme or the kind of visual spectacle it offers.",

            "content": "I didn't like this anime which you can obviously guess from the score. But I couldn't resist an urge to write this review to get it out of my system. So basically consider this review as a rant from an angry badminton lover. I have watched quite a few sports anime. So before I start this review let me note few lines for the two anime I like the most. Feel free to skip to the \"Review part\" for actual review.\r\n**********************\r\nFew months ago me watching Haikyuu: Wow even though as usual these guys are focusing on flashy impossible moves like smashes, I am loving thisshow because even with these non-realistic moves to capture the audiences they are significantly focusing on the defense as well as strategic elements of the game. Few episodes in OMG net-blocks, strategy to avoid them, analyzing and covering their holes in their game awesome I am loving this Anime as well as these awesome characters.\\n\r\nSome time after, while starting anime \"Baby steps\" me talking to myself: I don't think any sport anime will try to cover technical, mental and physical aspects of a sport because their main aim is to entertain people who otherwise will not watch the actual sport. So similar to myriad of Tennis anime this will be the usual emotional cliche sport anime which will never come close to Haikyuu. Few episodes in: WTH is going on there is no way people will like this kind of detailed story but I am loving it. After few more episodes: This is too much of sport technicalities even for me to handle. After finishing 306 chapters of manga: Me watching and reading this story was the best decision of my life. I wish there was a similar story about badminton.\\n\r\nMe today browsing through MAL: OMGGGGGG there is an anime about badminton. Awesoooooom. I am fu*king excited.\\n\r\n*********************\\n\r\nReview:\\n\r\nIf you have read above paragraph, you can guess that I started watching this anime with too many expectations. I myself being a (local) badminton player and an enthusiasts who follows international badminton I had set the benchmark too high to cross. But to my utter disappointment this anime came nowhere close to it. After watching the 5th episode I realized I couldn't take this anymore. I must drop this utter disgrace to the sport of badminton.\\n\r\nStory: Average\\n\r\nIt the usual cliche sport story with one hardworking girl who loves badminton and is struggling through a past traumatic loss. When a cliched GOD-GIFTED lefty player joins their team who had suffered since childhood because of oppressive parent. Then you have rivals and other things, the usual stuff you find in other sport anime. Just like any other sport badminton is also a game of skills and strategy. But this anime shows neither of those. Rather whatever is shown is either a stereotype or a complete wrong tactics. It gives zero insights into the game. Story and characters are lackluster as well. Read the spoiler at the bottom to know why I hate this anime.\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad\\n\r\nAll the characters in this anime are average. The interactions and personalities of the characters felt artificial. Aragaki Nagisa, their team captain felt too much out of character when she changed from badminton obsessed relentless captain to an accommodating team player who puts faith in the team. Same can be said about Hanesaki Ayano who is the left-handed prodigy with shy personality. Side characters are also average or below average. I didn't feel any connection or understanding with any of them.\\n\r\nArt: Very Good\\n\r\nFirst episode is extremely well animated. Trust me after watching badminton for so long I was awestruck by the details of the sport the animation covered. The quality of the animation dropped after the second episode but it was by no means bad. I think there was nothing for me to complain.\\n\r\nSound: Average\\n\r\nEven though the sound tracks are good they felt out of place in certain situations. For example in initial episodes during a serious match between Captain Aragaki and new member Ayano the pleasant music ruined the mood.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Very Bad\\n\r\nI literally hate this anime. I usually don't drop anime no matter how bad they are. But may be this being too close to my heart I was unable to stand it to the end. May be some of you will find this enjoyable if you ignore the sport aspects of the show or view it from some other perspective.\\n\\n\r\n*********************\\n\r\nSpoilers:\\n\r\nEpisode 5:\\n\r\nIn the last doubles match between Kitakomachi high-school and other team, the girl from other team decided to play solo against the two girls and goes on to win the match. Are you kidding me. This is total bullshit. Even if assume that the single player is 'that' good all she does to win is to hit strong smashes. Even from an entertainment point of view all we get is how emotional they are during the game and zero strategic thinking from both sides. To add to this utter disgrace the coach gives advice where the two girls will play front-back which is THE WORST thing you can do to defend against an attacking player. For those of you who don't know much about badminton let me put few things in perspective. In badminton if we combine two 'singles' players who have won lets say Olympics and ask them to play again an average 'international' doubles pair. They will lose the match because those two game categories (singles and doubles) are that different. So if an Olympics medalist is playing one on two match with any two local 'serious' players he will lose very badly. And here we get to see two talented players (who I am sure are going to win in future) loosing from a single player without any strategy. Hope you got my point.",

            "content": "I don't always write reviews. But when I do...\r\nWell, let's just say this is yet another disappointing anime to write home about. We've been getting a lot of those lately and my hopes and dreams for the future have been nigh diminished. But enough about my self-pity, let's get a move on and see why exactly this show fails at nearly everything.\r\nStory: 4\r\nA weak part of this anime is the story. I mean, it's an anime about badminton. What more can one want? Here's an idea: how about a realistic depiction of the sport? With actual tournaments arc? And not individual matches here and therein the first half and then one boring tournament that focuses on only 2 of the characters? Quite frankly, there is nothing to even compare this to - story-wise it's a dry dish. No spice, no flavor.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\\n\r\nNothing spectacular but nothing bad either. I found the art to be satisfying and enjoyable. I didn't go \"OMG\" and my jaw certainly didn't drop but it was \"ok\". Minus the unrealistic amounts of sweat comign from the bodies of those teenage girls. I mean, you'd reckon they were playing badminto in a sauna with the amounts of sweat protruding from their pores. \\n\\n\r\nSound: 5 \\n\\n\r\nWas there sound? A forgettable OP, even mroe forgettable ED, almost no thrilling soundtrack during the actual matches. In other words - mediocre.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 2\\n\\n\r\nYet another weak point. Probably the worst thing about this anime was its character cast. We have 2 main protagonists and... that's it. Pretty much 0 development for the rest. (sure, we get some dramatic training sessions with some minor characters that - guess what, go nowhere). On top of that we have contradictions left and right. To finish off, we have absolutely scum characters trying to act all righteous. \\n\r\nA mother that abandons her child and goes abroad to play mommy with some other girl. One could say that Ayano gets NTR'd by some danish chick. That's a new...\\n\r\nWe then have Ayano herself, who goes from being an absolute monster of a badminton player, to being an average schoolgirl that hates badminton, to then being a psychotic badminton player, to being an average school girl again. If I was even a mildly-proficient doctor, I'd lock her up in an institution.\\n\r\nHer counterpart, Nagisa, is your typical \"hard-worker\" that overcomes everything. As if... give me a damn break, people. If this anime wanted to shove this \"hard work beats talent\" crap down our throats, they should have renamed the anime to \"Hard-working sweaty teenagers beat the shit out of a badminton shuttle\". You go try to play a 3-set badminton game with a blown-out knee against a far stronger opponent, and try to score a point. Then come and tell me about all that hard work that paid off.\\n\r\nAnd my least favorite character is that danish NTR chick who goes to Japan to fight Ayano because ?she has some ?beef with her?? I'm really not sure about her motivation. She then basically mentally insults Ayano with that little speach about \"Mom only cares about winning\", ONLY to come a few episodes later and try to be all friendly and family-like with the girl, who's life she single-handedly ruined. Talk about being the lowest of scum...\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyemnt: 2 \\n\\n\r\nThe only way I could have enjoyed this anime less was if they added bad CGI. Which is saying A LOT.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4 \\n\\n\r\nAgain, the rules of mathematic prevent me from giving this anime a lower score. And I would have, believe me. This is one of those rare times, when I actually think MAL's score is being TOO generous. \\n\\n\r\nAs parting words, all I can say is: Watch at your own risk.",

Most reviews are boring so heres my \"bad date\" review of this anime.\r\nI was excited as hell. I learned so much about her and I was hoping to finally meet her in person. I waited until the date we'd air. It was everything and more. But I had no idea she would Sword Art Online me. \r\nEpisode One; No spoilers: Beautiful animation, beautiful women, and I like them a bit tall with chunky arms so this was EVERYTHING after being forced to watchunderage waifu's and best gals. Beautiful opening scene which Japan never does as well as the U.S.. I thought this WAS IT! I didn't need 3 episodes to get into the anime like most shows. Finally an anime that nailed the PACING and CHARACTER INTRODUCTIONS. Usually we are introduced to 100 characters, half of which don't really impact the story but, hey, the ramen animations are awesome right ? HAHAHAHHAHAfukmeahahaha.\\n\\n\r\nEpisode two: I was excited for our date. All her manga exes kept telling me \"wait till you see ___.\" They're so annoying. This, was a great one as well because it pushed away from the usual \"protagonist overcomes ____\" With three protaganists, and no essential main characters it was YET another trope japanese filmworks never seem to be able to do. Which is why shows like Boku No Hero Academia, Justice League, Naruto, One Piece, and Teen Titans are so interesting. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut thats pretty much all it had to offer. The anime died on me, I already downloaded episode seven so ill finish it. But im absolutely dissapointed in the character development and pacing. You CANT just introduce a character and milestone then retract them. Also, the girl's backstory isn't sad. It's completely unrealistic, and they should've spent more time helping me graph and understand her empathetically. She has no personality traits and im six episodes in. \\n\\n\r\n\"Its not enough to just love something.\" A quote that fits this anime perfectly. Like most japanese filmworks they try to stride through with animation, kawhi best gals, and fan service. Im sure the manga is great but this show is bad for ONE reason. It...it doesn't hold my interests. Hopefully the next episodes help the audience understand the characters and dig deeper into \"why.\" Not how...",

            "content": "This was the first show I watched this season and I was stunned. \r\nI'm not a fan of sports anime because it usually leads to competition after competition and it gets repetitive. After the show runs out of ideas, they decided to make characters into superhumans, which isn't what we would want to watch. \r\nBut this show isn't all about sport!\r\nThe show started off on an unexpected footing where it portrayed Aragaki as a tragic heroine. She currently doesn't have a good relationship with the team members and creates an arrogant image of herself. We meet another character, Ayano, who is a prodigy and theperson who is responsible for Aragaki's personality. The first episode builds up to these two characters well and sets the tone of the story. The episode focused more on the characters and drama rather than the main character becoming exposed to the sport and starting to flourish their passion for it. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the art, it doesn't emphasize the attractive features and shots of the character's body parts (Don't let the PV fool you...). I'm glad the show does this because we have seen too many shows that try to entice the audience with the characters. The art is fitting for the story because it doesn't have the over exaggerated character features and puts the focus more on the story. \\n\\n\r\nFor the animation, the preview was gorgeous. Most of those shots are used in the first episode, but more dynamic animations will be present in the upcoming episodes. Sports animes definitely needs eloquent animation to feel the intensity.  \\n\\n\r\nHowever, the third and fourth episodes start to weaken the show. The focus changes from Aragaki to Ayano and new characters that have unrealistic personality comes to the stage. \\n\\n\r\nTo conclude, I can't emphasize enough that this anime feels more like a drama with good animation than a sports anime. The first two episodes are great, however, I wasn't as amused for the third and fourth. But hopefully, this show will stand out strong until the end of the season. \\n\\n\r\n------------------------------\\n\\n\r\nI just finished episode six, and it's halfway through the season. \\n\r\nAs stated previously before, episode 3 and 4, as well as 5, weren't as good. However, episode 6 came back strong and really delved deep into what it means to be a normal high school sport. \\n\\n\r\nThe drama between the characters is done better than most sports anime and the matches are kept realistic. \\n\\n\r\nThe only problem that I might have with this show is Hanesaki, as her character and the characters that revolve around her (opponents and family) really don't interest me as much. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "I used to play badminton a small while ago(and no I was not very good at it). At one stage, I also decided to quit watching anime since there weren't many I enjoyed and I started to play games instead of watch cartoons or TV series. However, my friends saw this anime and recommended and I was bit excited. But the more I watched, the more I was disappointed. Story was terrible, some crazy girl how was addicted to badminton, wasn't very that emotional although the creators tried to be. However, the way they play Badminton is supposedly \"national/professional badminton level\". Other commenters say thatHanebado! is one of the most realistic sports anime at the moment due to \"no special powers\" although you not only stupidly play with some long ass anime hair (which will get in the way) but able to dive smash in front of the net (which is not only practically dangerous and risky but impossible because you will hit the net), a 180 degrees spin to receive (stupid to do unless you're having fun which she is not) but for Ayano to be able to smash like a bullet is impossible. There are many reasons why in reality, she is trash and that this is not realistic. First, you will not get a full power smash when you're playing tennis for badminton, jumping to the sides and doing them god-like smashes. It's possible for the professionals you say? Well not only do they rarely do it in real life but the way they smash in the anime is not realistic. They are playing VOLLEYBALL. When smashing, the power comes from the wrist and a very quick swing of the elbow, a bit like a whip. Jump smashing is not always seen in Badminton but you only jump smash when the shuttlecock is high up enough and you have enough time to both move and jump. Movement in Badminton is very long and quick, taking large steps in order to get to the other corner. However they're doing... tip toe steps??? Ayano also cannot smash that strong if she grips her raquet that tight. In general, people who say how these people don't have super powers literally do not understand anything about what's going on. Kuroko no basket although have special abilities are still realistic with jumping, shooting, passing and movement are still realistic, although Kuroko doesn't really have a superpower, just people can't see him. In Haikyuu, it's not that Hinata can spike eyes closed, it's just stupid but it comes from all the trust he has for the prodigy setter Kageyama. Therefore, Hanebado is just trash and full of bullshit and nonsense.",

            "content": "As a sports anime enthusiast, I was excited to watch this. Badminton may not be the most exciting sport in the world but I was interested to see how it would be handled. However it managed to do something few sports anime have ever done: it bored me to death. And that's saying something considering that I'm easily amused.\r\nStory: The typical tournament arc with bits of training sprinkled throughout is a classic sports anime element. This anime manages to turn it into personal drama plus some training with bits of competition in between. If I'm watching a sports anime I want to watch people playthe sport. Adding in some drama is fine, but not to the point where it becomes the main focus of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAs for when the sport is actually played, it's a bit of a letdown. The characters don't really show any progression in regard to their skills. And whether they win or lose often comes down to willpower rather than ability. Also the matches themselves just aren't very exciting. There are only so many ways you can hit a birdie over a net, so there isn't much variation. Either you hit it or you miss. There are no plays or special moves. It ends up becoming repetitive.\\n\\n\r\nArt: I was pleasantly surprised by the art. While the character designs are nothing special, the animation is consistently good throughout the series. The characters' movements are fluid and pretty realistic. I have no real complaints about it either.\\n\\n\r\nSound: The sound was fine. Not bad but not amazing either. The characters' voices match and although the music is forgettable, it wasn't offensive either.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Ugh. What a lackluster if not questionable cast of characters. The main character is a garden variety Mary Sue who just so happens to be a badminton prodigy. The other main is obsessed with badminton and doesn't take losing very well. They're mediocre at best. The rest of the cast is flat and forgettable except for the Danish exchange student that has beef with one of the mains. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Look, I really like sports anime and it takes a lot for me to genuinely dislike one. This series managed to do it. I was bored after the first few episodes and felt that it wasn't  worth finishing. It isn't the worse anime I've ever watched but it certainly didn't entertain me.\\n\\n\r\nTLDR: If you're an avid sports anime fan, you can give it a shot. Just don't go in expecting much. If you aren't, just skip it.",

            "content": "Hanebado was a show that left a bitter taste in my mouth. Sure, with its stunning animation, it stood out to me as a show I need to watch. Unfortunately, with its lack of direction and poor characters, the show was a little more than underwhelming. I had high hopes for this show. Being a huge sports anime fan and having 2 new sport shows come out last season, it was more than a treat. Unfortunately, both have disappointed me in more ways than one. When I first saw the preview back in April for a new show about girls' badminton, it blew me away.They showed 30 seconds of a match with the most detailed animation. The speed and intensity of the match was just astounding. It reminded me a lot of Haikyuu!!, plus, it was about badminton which is a sport that hasn't been explored in anime I believe. The animation is stunning and very free flowing. The things that stand out to me the most are the watercolor painting style of the ED, the smoke dissolving into different characters in the OP, and the movement in the matches. The insane cuts between characters and the shuttlecock and the court make it more intense. The soundtrack is also very good and plays at all the right times. The opening song is very good too. Other than that, the show definitely falls flat in terms of writing. \\n\\n\r\nHanebado! starts with 2 girls, Nagisa and Ayano, who don't know why they even play badminton because of certain events in middle school. When Ayano gets into high school, she is forced by her peers to join the badminton team. That's basically it. Sports animes don't really have a centralized story like most shows but they focus more on the characters. In Haikyuu, we follow Hinata as he joins the volleyball club with skills that are necessary for volleyball but with no knowledge of the sport. We learn the details about the sport with Hinata. In this show, both Ayano and Nagisa know the sport very well so they decide not to talk specifics about badminton. They don't tell you the rules or even show you strategies, they just assume the audience knows. \\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, most are boring and uninteresting. Now I know that this is only 12 episodes so it's not a lot of time to develop characters. I don't think this is an excuse though. Ping pong the animation has great characters and they space them out well enough so we know about everyone. That show is only 11 episodes too but back to this show. Ayano, who is supposed to be the main character, is a girl who was raised by a badminton pro to become a prodigy. There isn't really a lot of pressure put onto Ayano until she loses a match. Her mother just straight up leaves. This leaves Ayano in sort of a trance like if I don't get better, my mom will never come back.  Uchika, which is the mother, decides that if she keeps helping Ayano, she's gonna play badminton for her and not herself. Ayano begins to hate her mother. The way the whole situation is resolved is just stupid. Ayano says like 2 sentences and then leaves. Can't go into details because spoilers, but if you watch it, you'll see. Uchika also reminds me a little of Ging from Hunter x Hunter. Ging leaves Gon to become a hunter. Gon thinks that it's amazing that he would leave to pursue his dream but that's messed up. Just like Uchika, Ging places importance of Gon becoming a hunter over raising a child. She places badminton over all. When Uchika leaves, she goes to train other kids in foreign countries and one of the kids is Connie. Connie is an orphan who Uchika takes in and raises to become a badminton prodigy. She tells Connie about Ayano and mentions that she played badminton. I feel Uchika provokes Connie to find and verse her, but Connie's main goal is to become a family. This sounds nice, but Connie goes all the way to Japan to verse Ayano and when they meet, she is super rude to Ayano. Why! If you want to just ask about the family situation, just straight up ask. Ayano versus another girl with pink hair named Kaoruko who is also like a cartoon villain. She provokes Ayano into a match and it shows her past very little. They were rivals when they were little, but Kaoruko loses a lot to Ayano. One day, Kaoruko gets sick so to keep it fair, she gets Ayano sick and wins the match. This is also the match where her mother just leaves. Ayano remembers this and starts acting differently from this episode. That whole situation was outrageous and pretty dumb. What else is dumb is the badminton team. They are there for moral support and that's it. They don't stand out, they don't have any unique personalities, and we don't see them play badminton much. The coach is pretty bad too. He finds Ayano and sees the potential in her. He asks if she would join and she says no. She obviously joins later but this is the only time where the coach is interested in Ayano. He picks his favorite which is Nagisa, the other main character basically. They focus on her for the beginning of the show then just push her off to the side for the rest of the show. She is a lot like the coach, so the coach sees that and helps her out. She thinks she isn't talented but through the hard work she puts in, she can succeed. This could've set up for much more but since she's put in a side character role when she's basically a main character, the ending doesn't work. She talks about how much work she's put in throughout the year, but we don't see it, therefore, we don't care. \\n\\n\r\nAgain, this show had lots of potential. If the show focused on both characters with their ideals and talents but erased their knowledge of the sport, I think it could have worked better. I also think that if every match was like the one in the last 2 episodes, it would make matches more intense. I watched it for the animation, but the writing just isn't there. Great shows can come from shows like this but when the story and the characters are bad, the show becomes bad. \\n",

            "content": "Ya know when there is an anime with a sports genre, we think of beginner's luck followed by the reality of losing and a competitor that trash talk at the main character. But not like this where the main character itself is the antagonist herself, and we're talking about Hanasaki Ayano, who from a sweet girl who abandons badminton when she was left by her mom, to a condescending bitch when she finds herself going back to the sport that made her quit in the first place thank in part from her childhood friend, Fujisawa Elena. As the protagonist we see Ayano doing what theusual antagonist does , attitude , winning, smirking and then trash talking. Ok so the story plot has that cliche drama of the main character, being alone, and finding his or her place in the world, but then again, this isn't about badminton , rather it all about the two competitor , Ayano and Nagisa, as they struggle to be the best and at the same time having the obsession of beating the other in order to put the loser in her place. But in the end , it didn't when that way as nothing tragic has happened with nay of them , nagisa only have a not so serious injury, Ayano lose to her by just 1 point , and then the no good mom of Ayano, finds herself being forgiven, I mean, not much of a good ending. But to me, I really find ayano being an antagonist that I like and where her bitchyness is something I can forgive, Nagisa, well, she may have this never give up attitude and work hard thing for her but much of it was her frustration from losing to a middle schooler in a badminton tournament  which we see from the first episode, in fact I would have love to see her lose again to Ayano and at the same time really have a bad injury that she'll never play again kind of thing, but like I've said it ended like everything is ok and everyone will be friends again kinda shit. But enough of that, here are mya ratings:\\n\\n\r\nStory-Good 7: Cu'z it was just the usual cliche sport drama, but then again, having the kind of character like Ayano and Nagisa make up for it somehow.\\n\\n\r\nArt-Poor 3: Cu'z there weren't any intense fanservices around, but I do have a fuss about the  Kitakomachi High School Badminton club attire, which look more like the old haydays of Superman and Batman wearing their underwear outside their suits, except here it looks like they're wearing leotards outside of their rompers that I find it dorky. \\n\\n\r\nSound-Good 7: Cu'z you can feel the sound of being tired or being exhausted as each players duke out with each other in the court. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter-Very Good 8: To me it's very good since Hanasaki Ayano is one main character who is the antagonist that I like.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment- Very Good 8: Since it was something that makes one empathize with the character.\\n\\n\r\nOverall- fair 6: I may have like how the plot of focusing everything on Ayano Vs Nagisa on a rematch, but I kinda hate how it ends as if studio LIDENFILMS and director Ezaki, Shinpei wanted an good ending where everyone move forward for the best, I mean, it just has that cliche ending..........so , don't even think about another season bitch.",

I rated this a 6 because the animation and character's are pretty cool and all, but seriously that ending is so frustrating. So many design choices that make you wonder why did you not chose a less \"mainstream\" road. \r\nANYWAYS, please just watch this anime until mid episode 12 and forget the ending please. \r\nI do sound likea hater, however, I really am not. Just the studio wanting to finish the anime in 13 episodes and rushing it to have a happy ending.\\n\r\nPeace",

            "content": "One of the most important things about a shounen or seinen anime is that it must be able to inspire or at least make the viewer skip a beat. This anime has done nothing to do either of those. Hell, in my opinion, Keijo!!! was far better than Hanebado. The only saving grace, in my opinion, was the animation in the matches which had the smashes swooshing in and the receiving top notch. I really liked the use of CG there and the sweat and anticipation really mimicked the intensity of a real-life match. However, apart from that everything was really bad.\r\nStarting with the story.the characters were not true to their motivations. Instead of having a well-defined goal, we had the story of a mystery novel with the mother being the ultimate bad. I mean come on the mother left because she lost a match. And the attempted comedy threw the anime into the dark trenches of cringes. The protagonist has a sister who comes all the way from Denmark to beat her and then after being all smug becomes very compassionate. At no point in the story, winning a cup or winning for senpai or even the stalest \"power of friendship\" come into the motivation(winning for the team doesn't count). All characters say they madly love badminton but baring a few moments it's rarely seen. Compare that to Haikyuu which had all of your usual tropes, the thrill and rush of playing a sport was definitely felt by the viewer. Hell, I played volleyball for a month after watching it.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the worst part of the show. The angry one becomes the side and quiet one and then becomes the winning one all by realizing that she is tall and heavy. The protagonist starts from being a yandere then becomes a kuudere and keeps switching till she meets her mother who in my opinion is the worst character of all. The remaining charcaters have paper thin personalities and are pretty much disposable. \\n\\n\r\nThe music isnt bad but the way shows such as Naruto, Haikyuu, BHA have used it to raise the tension during the fights, I was very disappointed to not see it happen. Overall, its motivated me not to play badminton anymore and that summarizes my review.\\n",

            "content": "*Disclaimer*\r\nJust personal scratch.\r\nAdvised, possible spoilers.\r\nOpinion & Informal\r\nArt: 6/10\r\nThe art was fine. There were a few cases of \"quality\" but it didn't bother me too much. The anatomy and proportions checked out. The overall style was modern-standard. There were a few nature and panoramic shots that looked pretty good. There were a few impact shots that looked alright which were mostly the \"scary\" or \"crazed\" face of Hanesaki, but that's about it. They looked alright but didn't really leave any impact or give me a sense of the kind of feelings she was having at the time.\r\nAnimation: 8/10\r\nAnimation was very good. I was impressed with thekinds of motions and sequences that were used in this show. I was surprised at the level of animation that went into the actual sports sequences. Full rallies were animated which is a huge plus. Each individual swing, step, and body motion were all included in the animation. While there was some reused animation, specifically in those impact sequences, there was enough variation and new animation mixed in that it deserves a pass. The small details such as sweat and dripping sweat were also nice additions. There weren't as many shortcuts taken; there was a good showcase of full body motion: walking, running, etc that wasn't cut off by selective framing. Frames weren't dropped in the important bits, and generally everything looked nice and fluid. Overall, the impressive impact sequences, the regular well-done sports sequences, nice and fluid standard motions, and nice-looking supporting effects are great parts about this anime. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4/10\\n\r\nI'm not impressed with the characters or character development. Their annoying dynamics and character developments were two reasons that killed my personal enjoyment of this show. Their dynamics were all centered around building unnecessary and honestly really forced tension, awkwardness, and drama in almost all of their interactions. A majority of the interactions between the characters and groups had to have some sort of poorly reasoned confrontation or staring contest. Riko felt like she was only just there to serve as the mediator and voice of reason. The bit of backstory added to her wasn't really developed and felt sort of just like a formality. Riko felt like a typical, \"I'm a long-time friend who always had your back who acts as the voice or reason. However, I'll have a telegraphed outburst at least once in the show to act as the trigger to your final resolution.\" Connie was just a device to act as a temporary antagonist until the final antagonist (the antagonist in this case was an idea which was Hanesaki's raison d'etre: playing for herself, and not for her mom) could be fully fleshed out. In fact, once that idea was sort of in place, Connie was basically tossed aside for a few episodes lol. Hanesaki's mother had weird motivations that didn't feel like they were properly backed up or decently executed. They made sense, but they didn't have enough sequences supporting them. Aragaki had a decent but simple setup. The setup between Aragaki and Hanesaki was the whole, \"Two previous rivals that just so happened to end up on the same team\" which another example of this setup would be Haikyuu. Furthermore, Aragaki had the, \"I've discovered that I have a semi-serious injury which just so happens to arise NOW and conveniently be at a point to where if I decide to play against my rival in the final match, I may permanently end my career.\" This same trope can be seen in Ping Pong the Animation. Aragaki's culmination was fine but predictable. She ended up finding her resolve to fight Hanesaki, winning, and rekindling her love for the sport. Hanesaki's character development was disappointing for a majority of the show. Her personal growth stagnated for almost 4 or 5 episodes which is a shame; she became that \"soulless\" yet motivated character for almost a third of the show. She only really developed in the final few episodes going over her past in greater detail and going over her personal thoughts and resolve. In the end her character development played out somewhat predictably. She fought her rival, mid-battle discovered her true motivations, and reconciled with the people she wronged during the show such as her best-friend during the park at sunset scene. I'm not implying that Aragaki and Hanesaki's character development were bad. I'm happy that they turned out the way they did. What I'm not impressed with is the stagnation that occurred midway through the show because of the need to build on the atmosphere the forced and blatantly over-the-top drama was trying to build. Their personal asides could all have used just a bit more time and execution. I gave this area a 4/10 because of the unsupporting supporting cast, slow development midway through, and generally awkward dynamics that didn't feel real at all. \\n\\n\r\nPlot: 6/10\\n\r\nInteresting but typical plot setup. It's a standard first-year joins some sports club, practices and interacts with club members, goes to a tournament, and finale. The catch is that it's about badminton. Something I read recently that has this exact same setup is Sesuji wo Pin! to: Shikakou Kyougi Dance-bu e Youkoso.\\n\\n\r\nDevelopment: 4/10\\n\r\nMuch of what I want to talk about development I mostly discussed in the character area just because it was appropriate to do so. I do want to re-bring up the slow pacing and needless filler interactions. There were way too many dramatic scenarios between groups in this show. Why are the problems between side characters being developed much more than the main character's? Why are the main character's developments taking a passenger seat and only being developed in maybe the last 2-3 episodes? Not much of Hanesaki's past or motivations are looked into until the latter half of the show which means that she pretty much acts like some brat with no reasons to it during the former half. My biggest gripe about this show is that it doesn't teach the viewer (not an exaggeration) anything at all about the sport. The badminton was just there. No rules, no basics, nothing at all was taught about badminton. Like the character area, I gave this area a 4/10 because I did not like the slow pacing, lack of proper development to the actions and personalities of the characters, and overall execution of their stories. \\n\\n\r\nMusic: 7/10\\n\r\nNo sound design to note. Soundboard was quite nice in which effects such as \"smashes\" and sneaker friction added a lot of flair and life to the matches. Overall, soundboard was very fitting and did very well in creating an exciting sports environment. Bgm was unmemorable and not too catchy in my opinion. Moreover, the bgm didn't \"feel\" like it added to the sequences. OP and ED were neat but also sounded like a \"typical anime opening.\" I don't actually weigh the OP and ED that much; I just bring them up as a side note.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 4/10\\n\r\nI personally did not enjoy this show. It was predictable just based on the initial plot setup and it was painful to watch it develop to its predictable climax. The positive parts of this show are the above average art, the impressive animation, and the fitting soundboard. The negative parts about this show were the character and plot development, the awkward and seemingly ungenuine character dynamics, as well as the forced and over-the-top interactions between the characters.",

Hanebado tells a story of a high schools girl trying to figure out her relationship with her mom and the sport of badminton. One unique element about this show is that the main protagonist acts like the main antagonist against the supporting characters.\r\nThe characters in the show are single minded. It seems each of the characters are trying to sabotage each other or just doing badminton individually in an unhealthy way. It was hard to sympathize for the main character or the supporting characters.\r\nThe sound was pretty good. The soundof the swish was smooth, and the hitting of the shuttlecock was authentic. Plus, the music played well in the atmosphere of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was the best part of the show. The way it goes in detail of how the shuttlecock are hit is breathtaking.\\n",

            "content": "I've often watched shows like Haikyuu! and wondered why it's so focused just on volleyball, and not on developing some of the characters away from the court. After watching Hanebado!, I'm re-thinking that position. The best way that I could describe the story in Hanebado! is that the scenes focused on badminton (the matches, the training/coaching, etc.) are actually quite excellent. And everything that happens away from the court is just an absolute mess. Maybe some writers are just better at telling a simple sports drama and shouldn't try to extend too far beyond that (although, I recently watched Cross Game, which handled the balancequite beautifully).\\n\\n\r\nWithout spoiling too much, Hanebado!'s major plot is driven by Ayano's psychological state, which is in turn driven by her mother's abandonment. Badminton focused heavily in their mother-daughter relationship, and her mother's disappearance from her life causes Ayano some serious mental anguish. I'm no shrink, but she has some really wild mood swings, going from sweet, adorable character to total bitch. It makes her very hard to like, which is a problem in a show like this. Some shows might benefit from anti-heros, but I don't think this one does. On a side note - Ayano's mom seems so cool and loving and caring in every scene she's shown in, and there's just a real disconnect over how she could just up and leave. I kept waiting for an unexplained reason that would make sense, but that doesn't come. Her reason is dumb, and it just doesn't jive with how her character is portrayed at all. \\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side, despite initially being kind of bossy towards her teammates, Nagisa is a much more likeable character. We understand her and her motivations - her passion and drive to better herself in the sport that she loves. And her own mental battles (having lost so thoroughly, despite all the work she's put in) are much more relatable. \\n\\n\r\nIf the story had focused more on the matches and less on making Ayano some sort of mental case, I think it would have made for a much more enjoyable experience. I still enjoyed the badminton scenes quite a bit, so the show gets a pass from me. I'd even watch a second season if they ever made one. But mostly I just feel like this was a missed opportunity, given the obvious production value put into the effort - this is the nicest-looking show I've watched in a while. The animation is amazing, and the character designs are all top notch. They clearly put a lot of effort into the aesthetic of the show, it's just a shame they couldn't salvage a decent story.",

            "content": "This is my first review, and I'm using it on this anime. It's been getting way too much flak in my opinion, when that time would be better used on series that deserve it more, especially in this abyssmal season. Hanebado is not that bad, don't let the bad reviews sway you. All those other reviews only focus on characters, which is not necessarily condusive to a good or bad anime.\r\nI have no issues with the premise, never thought premise was a big deal anyway. Little bit too much drama as everybody and their mother has pointed out, but makes it at the very leastnot boring, so no qualms. I'm watching for the well animated matches anyway, so if it isn't boring me inbetween, it's not huge problem or anything.\\n\\n\r\nArt is really good. Backgrounds aren't great, but are good by this season's standards. With the animation, I like the use of rotoscoping in particular, and the animation outside of that is generally really good, exceptional by this season's standards. If you couldn't tell, I really disliked this season.\\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting was pretty good, no qualms really, music was unremarkable to me honestly. The OP is pretty catchy I guess.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are there to enhance a story, and give you a reason to care about them. Here, you only need to know anything about two characters, Nagisa and Ayano. Ayano, you are supposed to dislike. She does have backstory and all, but the overall intention is to dislike her personality she develops through the Hanebado's duration, especially after her mother returns. Is it a good character arc? No. Is it a character arc? Yes. In the end she's kinda cute and more bearable too. Nagisa is a good character. She's tall, and people misjudge her and think the only reason she's good at badminton is because she's tall. She's actually a very hard worker, and she is also struggling with a knee problem. She has determination and good work ethic. On to the important part, she's a tall, short-haired tomboy with big titties and bigger muscles. Hot.\\n\r\nSide characters are pretty boring. No one gives a shit about Hayama [insert person who gives a shit about Hayama].\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment was the only thing I scored this off of, because literally everything here is boiling down to how much the other elements contributed to enjoyment, or bogged it down. I enjoyed it. The matches were good and fun to watch, the drama wasn't boring at least, and Nagisa is a good girl.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10.\\n\\n",

Sound design and placement is immersive for the badminton environment.\r\nBe wary though, story, character consistency, and focus jumps about frantically just as much as a shuttlecock in an actual game of badminton. The show deviates from the manga yes, but there's lack of a main character spotlight as 2 heroines constantly fight for the spotlight.\r\nBut overall, for 13 episodes while not following the source material, the ending and development arcs are satisfying and doesn't leave as bad of an after taste. The first halfis definitely stronger than the second half however, so be wary before fully committing.",

            "content": "I REALLY wanted to like this series, but I really need to remind myself that stunning visuals cannot carry an entire series and if it was based on just the animation then I would easily give this something like a 9 but it really must be mentioned it's major flaw of it's writing.\r\nThe only real reason that I have put this as an 8 for my own anime list is because whenever I look back over what I have watched, personally if something is higher than a 8 that means it's truly very enjoyable and memorable for whatever reason. It's strange because I could putthis as a 9 as a reminder to myself that this series has amazing, fluid animation combined with what I'd say was great sound design and together could be a pure basis on why to watch it, but after some consideration I feel like a 7 is better suited just because the writing simply counteracts that 9 in such a way that if I were not to consider it then it would simply be a disservice to people who want an honest opinion on if this a good series or not.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\r\nFor starters, throughout the 12 episodes I was repetitively questioning what the main thrive of the story is. With Nagisa, one of the main characters, I can completely understand that she wants to improve because of facing defeat and waking her up to the level she needs to reach, however with Ayano, I have no clue what I'm supposed to be understanding. She has some strange complex about her mother that makes her amazing at the game of badminton yet personally to me makes no sense why the fact that she gets so competitive or out to prove something. She says that the only reason to play badminton is to win and to prove that she can be the best without her mother, yet she gets presented as if she's someone to root for when she arrogantly has no sense of social skills what so ever and doesn't think when she speaks and comes across as a complete asshole, yet we need to feel sorry for her being abandoned as if it's completely reasonable to be the way she is only when playing badminton but somehow two faced when not playing to be a normal girl. Is she a main character or what because I'd much rather she be a stepping stone for Nagisa rather than be someone who is probably Nagisa's main reason for not being better in the first place with her constant dickish criticism. \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound\\n\r\nThe animation is awesome, no doubt about that. No problems with the sound that make me want to mention anything wrong with it, so it must mean it was pretty good as well.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\r\nSo with the story segment of this review I suppose I haven't really stated what the story was besides these two girls trying to become the best for debatable reasons at least in regards to Ayano, which is either because there is just no story or because the characters are written so annoyingly that it just makes the story as a whole of Nagisa becoming a great player less clear.\\n\\n\r\nFor me, the worst thing about this series is the characters. The other so called badminton players apart of this school club are so bloody useless it hurts and I cannot remember any of their names. First of all, you've got Nagisa's friend who is basically there just to root her on because she's terrible at badminton in comparison. Then you have Ayano's friend, who is useless because even though she's been friends with her for years and introduced her to the school badminton club after her long absence from the sport she doesn't take any responsibility for looking after her or being that one trusty person to keep her in line. Then you have all the other bimbos in the club who aren't important at all, because they're either terrible at the sport or most crucially just are there to be on the receiving end of Ayano's dickish personality yet act like they've been friends for ages and are surprised she's been so antagonist to any support or team spirit. Literally everyone watching can see how much of an asshole Ayano is and there is no reason to be friends with her at all, it's like these other characters just have some internal AI to always try to saying friendly things and get it smacked up in their face yet will keep trying to approach them with the same attitude without even addressing the fact she's an asshole. \\n\\n\r\nFor example, Miss Short Girl whos name I cannot remember who's terrible at the sport. Keeps calling Ayano Ayanon or something because of ONE time on a bus where she came up with it on the spot while the team were out on some kind of training camp. Ayano on that trip displayed no real sign of being one of the girls besides occasionally being obliviously cute and apart of one photo she doesn't even embrace. This girl I'm talking about throughout the whole series is like \"Keep it up Ayano, I'm rooting for you.\" and Ayano is like \"Shut up bitch i don't need you, leave me alone\" yet in the next scene with them together in a similar badminton situation she's straight back at it with the \"Keep it up Ayano.\" Sure, she's just being a nice person I guess and isn't the conflicting type but she and others are on the receiving end of this abuse and throughout the whole series hardly anybody punishes her for it or tells her \"Stop being a little cunt and be our friend, we'll help you with your abandonment issues with your mom and teach you to live on your own without weighing on a childhood trauma.\"\\n\\n\r\nIt's so frustrating, because even the team coach is like \"Hmm Ayano is acting pretty weird\" yet doesn't address her or realise the fact that's she unhealthy for herself and the team even when she's downright telling people to basically fuck off. And don't even get me started on her mother. What's the game plan here!? Is she in the right for leaving her daughter or not and why did she actually leave in the first place? All we know is that as Ayano was a child she abandoned her and adopted a new child in a different country. What? WHY? Then she comes back and is like \"Ooh you've gotten pretty good at this badminton sport that I've taught you\" even though she left with no warning or reason and comes back with no reason or warning. Her adopted child doesn't even matter either, just to remind Ayano of her complex that she needs to get better for...providing she's good at badminton in front of her mum to punish her for leaving her? Are we expecting that Ayano goes to the Olympics, wins all her games and as she stands there with her golden medal she's like \"Take that Mum, I did it without you.\" Then what? Is that her story complete? I don't even know. Why not just get a firm beating by her team to realise that they're together and simply play badminton to get good while also having fun like Nagisa.\\n\\n\r\nOverall\\n\r\nI could really rant about Ayano for a decade and why everyone besides Nagisa is stupid. Maybe I've been blind in some aspects and not emphasised points, but I'm writing this as if people reading it have also completed the series and can understand why Nagisa's drive is much more understandable than literally anyone else.\\n\\n\r\nPretty much, I feel like this series could have been much better had they made the mother an actual antagonist who left for selfish desires because her daughter wasn't good enough for her and turned Ayano into a sort of redemption story properly because they try to make this a psychological thing but it's never even addressed and just played off at the end as \"Hey, I'm having fun playing against you Nagisa for you are a worthy, challenging opponent\" but basically meaning that it's alright that I'm a dick to you and also meaning that she's still gonna be a dick to everyone else because they aren't good enough. \\n\\n\r\nThis entire series is carried by it's stellar animation, and is it's saving grace. To be honest, for anyone considering watching this series, it's not absolutely awful in it's writing. I think that it's passable as it's just a necessary context for the characters to be playing badminton and in turn a reason to show the great animation, so I'd still recommend to watch it if you want to watch something about badminton and have your eyes pleased because you'll most likely forget about the story until the end and I'd say it's much easier to enjoy the series as a whole if you just put Ayano and her mother as a constant antagonist and Nagisa as the protagonist to root for as opposed to having them on some kind of even footing.\\n\r\n7/10",

            "content": "Screw Denmark! If you wanted her to go to fricken Denmark SCREW IT!!\r\n(But for real though)\r\nTHIS SHOW IS NOT BAD!\r\nNeed to clarify it because for some reason it has only a 7.2 on MAL and based solely on that most would think it is bad.\r\nHanebado has 2 main characters, both of which are unlikable and boring at the start. \r\nWe see the tall one turn into a complete incentive piece of crap, then into a genuinely likable Caricature. \r\nWe see the short one start a peaceful human being, into an insensitive piece of crap, and back into a likable Character. (notice the difference there).\r\nAyanon issomeone who i believe is actually a person, and the amount of emotionally destabilizing events she'd had to put up with in her life make her actions and mindsets warranted.\\n\\n\r\nNagasaki's personality is non-existant and is just a caricature of someone who works super hard at sports and has a knee handicap. Her character arc in this story is super short to make way for Ayanon (thank goodness). This character arc is just watching Nagasaki being bossy and intolerably rude to everyone... any real teenagers would have called her out on the crap the second time she did it. \\n\\n\r\nSadly though, this aweful character change is not the biggest sin of this show. The biggest sin is how easy they let off Ayonon's mother. (spoilers about ayanon's mom, skip to next paragraph to skip). Ayanon's Mom left Ayanon when she was in middle school to do 2 things... 1. make Ayanon a better badminton player.... 2. to train Connie. These two things do not warrant LEAVING YOUR DAUGHTER IN JAPAN WITH HER GRANDPARENTS WHILE YOU GO TRAIN YOU NEXT SUPERSTAR! This show does not try to justify this,  but it surely doesn't try to bring justice to the child abuse that took place. I believe the quotes from Ayanon's mom were \"I know what I did was unforgivable... but I have no regrets about what I've done, and would do it again.\" The $%&*......? This \"mother\" if want to give her that title at all, abandoned her daughter because she wasn't good enough at a sport, comes back into her life to see if she's gotten better, and when she verifies that she had, the mother has the AUDACITY to say \"come travel with me to Denmark.\" SCREW DENMARK!!! Tis show would be much close to an 8 if the characters treated this woman with HOSTILITY. Especially the childhood friend who had the mother take Ayanon away from her, but then threw Ayanon out when she was no longer needed. Everyone should be furious, but everyone is jsut so calm and collected i just don't get it.\\n\\n\r\nThese two flaws destroy the show's merit from understanding believable character interaction... but there is one thing that makes this show not a 4... and that is the badminton games.\\n\\n\r\nThe Badminton games are a fricken blast to watch. After Nagasaki becomes you general protag and Ayanon's trying to prove her worth to her mom through her badminton play, you just want to root for Ayanon to be happy and for her to snap out of her funk, but you also want to make sure Nagasaki doesn't break her knee... so like you don't know how this show was going to end. The last 2 epidodes are wonderful to watch, and by themselves I'd probably rank close to a 9. \\n\\n\r\nSo to conclude, this show's animation quality makes the games feel super intense and fun, you do care for Ayanon but only because she's been through hell as a child and you want her to have a win for once in her life that has nothing to do with her mom, and it was just a general blast watching it. Nothing special, and I think the goods and bad's even out each other, but i think this show had potential to be an 8 with just a few dialogue changes regarding Nagasaki in the first few episodes and Ayanon's mom at the end.\\n\\n\r\nWould not watch again, unless it was only the last 2 episodes.",

            "content": "Hanebado was by far the most entertaining sporting anime of this season, and for my taste, its up there with Kuroko no Basket. This is because of the inclusion of all the necessity of a typical sporting anime, such as 'Drama', 'Social Conflict', \"Redemption' and 'Intense Sporting Scenes'. \r\nWhat I enjoyed the most is the well-animated badminton games to represent how the athletes were feeling during the game, and showing some realism to how badminton was played. What amazes me is the amount of detail put into the movement of sweat and muscle cramping during the match. Other than that, the character animation was indeedwell drawn to meet my liking. Despite focuses more on the girl's side, the amount of detail into the action was equivalent to what you see in male sporting shows. \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the story itself, it shows a lot of family issues and psychological games. In this case, Ayano suffers from a family problem and using this to her advantage throughout the latter half of the season. As a result of becoming villainous after her match with her childhood nemesis. In this show, family relationship played a huge factor, especially for Ayano's case. As for Nagisa, despite acting selfishly at the early parts of the season, she progressively becomes more mature throughout and was able to move on from her dark past. But as for the rest of the club members, many were to be their last match in high school tried their best to make most of it but all failed to do so. The amount of drama and conflicts were amazingly balanced in this amazing sports show and became my all time favourite.    \\n\\n\r\nRegarding the sounds/music, I didn't quite like the opening despite representing energetic feeling for a sporting anime. But the sound used during matches and confrontation was well adapted to scenes depicting the emotions of the characters & the atmosphere. \\n\\n\r\nI truly recommend to those to check out my reaction video's on Youtube to see how I enjoyed this show and I do a short review after each episode. From there you will see more content than from this review. But hope this review convinces you all to give this fantastic all-girls badminton sporting anime. \\n\\n",

For some reason it made me cry in the second episode it made me realize something, it's also really lively and funny in some lines but can also be sad from time to time\\n\\n\r\nNagisa's pretty worked up though and about that rival feeling with Ayano----\\n\\n\r\nI'll edit this review in further more about the anime, I'll probably watch it with a friend too",

            "content": "Hanebado is a summer 2018 anime produced by Lindenfilms, directed by Shinpei Ezaki, and written by Taku Kishimoto. The story follows Ayano Hanesaki, A high school girl who is very gifted at badminton. Hanebado features a large cast of characters whom all have some sort of quirk and shortcoming to their personality. The anime initially seems to be a coming of age story about overcoming said quirk. Unfortunately, Hanebado slowly turns into a narrative and ethical mess that by the end makes all the events that happened in the middle seem pointless and infuriating. \r\nOne major problem with the anime throughout its runtime is themeanspirited atmosphere. Hanebado insists on pushing animosity, melodrama, and insults in its script without having a meaningful outcome. An example of this is one character being defeated by the MC of the show, the MC of the show insulting and mocking her and then moving on. The character who got insulted own character arc ended on sadness and depression and then just threw her back in the background. Granted this character was stingy to the MC in the past, but the arc this character received did not make her a better person, it did not make the MC more likable, and it didn\u2019t give a viable explanation on why she did these actions.\\n\r\nAnother downfall is the plot device of Ayano\u2019s mother which is so outlandish and disgusting, that it is completely unbelievable and takes the immersion out of the viewer. It is so over the top that it leaves the viewer frustrated with the actions of the MC\u2019s mother not changing and not realizing her mistakes in an actual meaningful way. The mother\u2019s actions were not properly justified and seemed so fucking stupid that it just made me think what the writers were thinking hyping up this plot since the beginning for such a drab explanation. The \u201cdevelopment\u201d that does occur between them on the last episode felt so artificial too. The problems between them were patched up far too quickly instead of properly fleshing out their relationship over a span of episodes. This was solidified with episode 10 and in all honesty, made me feel disgusted. \\n\r\nThis doom and gloom throughout make the show feel depressing and it makes the very slim number of lighter moments feel so out of place that it gives you whiplash. Hanebado is not an ideal sports story in all accounts. It does not show the viewer the benefit of being on a sports team. It does not properly show the sacrifices of being in that sport because it shows the negatives of those sacrifices without showing how the characters grow. The characters either don\u2019t grow at all or are not developed properly and the main plot device of the show is so stupid and achieves nothing to grow the MC and her mother. Combining all of these factors make this anime a poor tale about sports and playing on a team which should be empowering.\\n\r\nOh well, At least it looks good.\\n",

            "content": "This might be one of the few positive reviews for this show. It might be because I used to be play varsity badminton in high school. Or I just enjoy a good satisfying anime. Either way, I really enjoyed this show a lot.\r\nNow the storytelling is not the greatest. People complain a lot because after watching, they didn't learn shit about the game. But you know what, I don't need an episode or two to explain to me how to score a point in this game. It is about a child prodigy, Hanesaki, and the schools team captain, Aragaki. Hanesaki's talent is not god giveneither. She worked hard since she was young against her mother who is most likely the Michael Jordan of badminton with how the show presented her. Aragaki, is the hardworking captain who vows to improve her game after realizing she is miles behind Hanesaki. Yes, it doesn't have a deep plot but for what it is, it works for me. An anime for a sport I used to play competitively. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe visuals is where the show truly shines though. Slick looking animations and surprisingly realistic exchanges. The way the shuttlecock moves when hitting the racket. S. A. K. U. G. A. 10/10\\n\\n\r\nMusic is good too. Especially the ending song. Man I really love playing that on my drums. But aside from that, the sound editing is excellent as well. The sound of the volleys is sweet music to my ears. 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThe characters is where the show lacks tho, according to most of the reviews. But I will say that it is not as shallow as they say. Aragaki is well developed. You cannot help but root for her every damn time. Hanesaki, I hate. But that's not to say I hate her for no reason. She is someone I hate because the show gives you a reason to hate her. Saying more than that will spoil the show though. Erena, Connie, Riko, Kaoruko and Tachibana are decent supporting characters. The rest are forgettable but that's not the show's fault. This is not a team sport. You cannot have a match where all the players are highlighted. Or superpowered fantasy shounen where characters dress as colorful and dumb as they can to make you remember them. They are high school varsity players that wear the same uniform. What more do you ask? 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really enjoyed this show a lot. Plus it has a satisfying end. Which is always a win in my book. It might be my pick for AOTS. If you don't care for badminton, you may not enjoy this show than I did. But if you played badminton, then this might be one for you.",

            "content": "THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS\r\nThis anime started out solid, and maintained its solidity for a good maybe 6 or 7 episodes.\r\nThen, it became bogged down about something that the viewers never had interest in. In the beginning, the anime makes us care about Hanesaki's badminton career; there's a secondary character, Hanesaki's friend, to emphasize this point. What we want to see is Hanesaki grow as a character and badminton player. There are many ways to do this: she can restore her love for badminton, she can slowly overcome Connie and become a positive player, she can regain some of her former sheer skill, but maybe ina more humane way. Instead, the anime gives us none of these. Okay, I guess the anime gives us a little of each in a small way, but what the anime becomes most concerned about is Hanesaki regressing to a state where she's fanatical over her mother, unrealistically insensitive to sportsmanship, and not enjoying badminton at all. The anime seems to be promising that these could be solved, but it really hasn't made an effort to develop Hanesaki's character in 4 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nOkay, I get it, the point of anime is not to just hand the viewers what they want. That's too predictable. And I wouldn't want that either. But I am 10 episodes in and this anime has just made the viewers more and more frustrated.\\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; it's still great, and I'm hoping it turns around in the last 2 episodes. (I'm not getting my hopes up haha.)\\n\\n\r\nBut I'm worried, because even the animation quality has taken a noticeable dip from, say, episode 4 or something.",

            "content": "I feel compelled to write this review as Hanebado! is a mix bag of probably the best of somethings--such as great animation during the badminton scenes, and the worst of everything else.\r\nAs far at the story goes, there isn't much flow between one thing to the next, I mean in one episode we see a character enter the story, yet next mentioned throughout the next episode. This is just one example. But the story goes from some flow, to none at all as the story is trying to be super edgy and depressed while never having a real need to. It never makes a bigenough impact on you to have that edginess or that depression. And things come from random encounters and random scenes that give very little in both body language or dialogue to have you really understand what is going on.\\n\\n\r\nSo Art and Sound go hand in hand here, as they are both equally good when the scene calls for it. The Badminton must have been done by watching real badmintoners as it's very crispy and fluent and when the music is right, it does a great job of what's needed of it, but as I said with the story above, there are unnecessary times when it's building a mood that isn't there and feels out of place at best.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters suffer from the story as well as they are sporadic. The core cast is overall fine, but than we have two out of place badminton players which are there purely it seems to cause harm or hate on the main character. And she is somehow traumatized by it all. I understand how someone can be so engrossed into a sport, but I've seen that done far better in other anime's than this one.\\n\\n\r\nSo really all that is keeping me watching this at this point is the fluent animation of the badminton and the very few hints that the story is good here and there. But it doesn't flow at all. And my enjoyment is at best dull to what could have been a great series to watch.",

            "content": "Overall score 7/10 - might update it later at the end of the series.\r\n1.) Firstly, and most importantly, what's up with the characters here? It seems as though they have some sort of split personality in the anime because they tend to vary between the extremes. Either they're sweet and kind or edgy and bratty. One episode, you'll see your favorite character all happy-go-lucky and in the next episode they're personality takes a complete 180 degree flip-flop. It seems that the creators have some problem striking a balance it between.\r\n2.)Unnecessary drama. Yes, the drama is well founded but it feels like the creators made alist of dramatic situations and instead of picking one, dumped it all in the show; a composition for something dangerous. Essentially, you'll find each and every single episode having something else dropped in it, because of this the anime loses any sense of continuity and consistency and feels rushed because it's basically a one episode drama.\\n\r\n3.) And for some reason, all the competitors are somehow bitchy little girls(overall, minding point 1) that haven't learned the meaning of respect. They'll literally be bubbling and oozing overconfidence and ego which makes the anime bland in a way.\\n\r\n4.) Also Aragaki happens to be the MC as well. but there's barely any screen time \\n\r\nThe USP of the anime is it's visuals as it'll get your heart racing at mach 3 with how intense and fast paced it is. It somehow incurs in you a love for badminton and urges you to watch every episode. The characters happen to be pretty savage at times which is a plus :) Other than that, the rest of the categories are pretty mediocre or slight above average. Nothing to special, nothing to bland, just in the middle(like how the characters personalities should have been.)",

            "content": "I have a hard time deciding if I'd recommend this show just for good character design and some good sports play that's few and far between. Because the story definitely isn't what I'd recommend \r\nI've heard some people say that this show is way too dramatic for a sports anime about Badminton. I'd say that it is more like the show takes its story too serious. Sometimes to the detriment of it's characters. Kuroko no Basket is a sports show that takes itself seriously, but still has a aura of camp to it that makes it enjoyable. This show has no camp to it's edgynessand it just leaves you hating any character that isn't the MC Aragaki. Aragaki is great in this show as she seems completely uninterested or unfazed by the other characters BS. This amazon just wants to play Badminton.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are my biggest problem with the show. Motivations and characteristics seem to change for everyone on an ep. to ep. basis. Even after 12 ep., I still wasn't sure what the characters would be like in the 13th. The secondary MC, is one of the worst at this as the entire way through the show she hates her mom for abandoning her, for losing a match. However, anytime we see the mom throughout the show she seems like a super loving mom and a generally nice person. What the Secondary MC thought was abandoning, was actually a business trip that the mom didn't communicate properly..... seriously.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound are the saving grace of the show. When the director stops focusing on character BS and focuses the camera on the sport, it's super well animated; using some CG and hand drawn techniques. There are numerous times we get long shots of play. One huge prop I'll give this show, is that the final showdown gets all the screen time it needs and it is very enjoyable. The Sound effects are also stellar. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, If you ever wanted to watch a show that's insecure about the sport it's about this might be for you. It's almost like they thought the audience would get bored of crazy well animated sports play for some reason.",

            "content": "One year ago studio Lidenfilms gave us the wonderful Killing Bites and now they've graced me with this epic anime about Badminton (yes you read that right), Hanebado! If we graded anime based on production quality alone this show would seriously be a 10/10 masterpiece. The choreography in the badminton matches is superb, like you feel like you're watching two real athletes compete, because their movements are so lifelike. The animation is just superb as you see the sweat flying off these girls as they compete, you see their muscles straining under the pressure of returning that smash shot. CG is used appropriately to showthe shuttle cock flying around the court at breakneck speed, and all of the sounds effects are perfect. For these reasons I'm giving a 10 to Art and Sound. Sadly this show has one fatal flaw: its protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nI really, REALLY hated the main girl, Ayano, in this show, to the point where she almost made me turn it off a few times. If literally any of the other players in this show had been the protagonist, the show would have been about said girl's dedication, passion, and love for the sport of Badminton. The problem with Ayano is her motivation ISN'T ANY OF THESE THINGS! She just wants to crush her opponents, doesn't care about having fun or making new friends, and just wants mommy to notice her. Sounds like she'd make a good season villain, I'll grant you, but the heroine we're supposed to root for? Never in a million years!!! What's worse is we HAD a good protagonist in episode 1 with Nagisa (short haired tomboy),before the bait and switch and it turns out Ayano is actually the main character by episode 2. We see Nagisa's muscles straining, the sweat collecting on her forehead as she trains. Compared to Ayano, who never has to practice hard because she's a prodigy, who easily crushes her opponents and even mocks them after beating them? What were they thinking making HER the heroine? Ugh. The score for Character was hardest for me to give since I LOVED Nagisa as a character but I HATED Ayano so much more, and she turned out to be the \"heroine\" of this story. Ayano starts out annoying and she only gets worse and worse with every episode, picking fights with people for no reason and rejecting any kindness people show her. So I ended up giving Character a 3.\\n\\n\r\nI gave Story a mediocre 5 because it's just a show about badminton, after all. There's the usual cliche high school drama, but that's not what you're here for. You're here for the epic badminton matches that seriously got me as hyped as a boxing match in Hajime no Ippo! But the games themseves aren't story per se, so I'd throw that back in the Art/Sound category. I still had a lot of fun watching the show, but my Enjoyment score dropped from a 10 to an 8 from episode 1 with Nagisa as the protagonist, to the later episodes with Ayano in the lead role. Overall I wanted to love Hanebado but ended up only liking it. I probably would have given it an 8 but that one character Ayano made the show so hard to watch I had to drop it down to a 6.",

Among the characters, Aragaki saves with such bright everything.",

            "content": "Hanebado is an anime about tennis' decidedly less popular cousin that gets some things very right and other things very wrong.\r\nSTORY\r\nIt's been pointed out elsewhere so I won't belabor the point, but the pacing of Hanebado - the speed at which the story is told- is so fast you'd think it was strapped to the front of a Bullet Train. A lot of the traditional plot points of a sports anime are rapid-fired at you, just to point out one example, by the halfway point of this 13 episode series we already have major characters playing their final high school badminton matches- it's portrayed asthis momentous event but we've had so little time to actually get to know the cast that you can be left feeling \"Wait, what, we're already HERE?\" Now I'm not saying it's wrong for a sports series to have a faster pace than average (one of my chief complaints about the sports genre is its often extremely decompressed storytelling which can leave you having to trudge through volume after volume of manga to reach the next significant plot point) but you can go too far in the other direction.\\n\\n\r\nART\\n\\n\r\nNow I do have to give Hanebado credit here, the series looks GOOD. Perhaps not the *very* best thing I've ever seen, but this is higher-end animation quality. I especially respect the fact that TOHO Animation used a lot of shots with different lighting- changing the lighting of a scene changes the entire color palette of a scene, and you'd be surprised just how many anime opt to simply have all their scenes take place in broad daylight or a brightly lit room. As for the characters, their designs are solidly done, but they don't really break out of established archetypes. The art is also a bit excessively fan-service-y at times; let's just say some girls were 'endowed' with more than just athletic ability and some of their badminton outfits looked pretty outlandish compared to what came up in my Google image search of 'Women's Olympic Badminton'. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nMallorie Rodak voices Shiwahime Yuika. Shiwahime is automatically Best Girl. But I digress... Ahem, anyway... Otherwise sound is fine, but I can't point any one thing that really pushes it above 'decent' and 'solid'.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nThis one is a mixed bag. On one hand, the Bullet Train pace of the story means major characters arcs are often blazed through with little impact, and cast members can end up doing heel-face or face-heel turns on a dime. On the other hand, Hanebado did something I legitimately wasn't expecting with Main Character Hanesaki Ayano: there were times she was straight-up played as the villain. In most sports stories I've seen, when a character is The Jerk that's their whole character- they ARE The Jerk. But without going into excessive spoiler territory, the more we learn about Hanesaki the more we see that while she has positive characteristics and is generally nice and likable under certain circumstances she has this nasty streak to her personality that completely takes over. And this bad part of her isn't glossed over, nor do they rely on the old trick of hiding a character's flaws by pitting her against someone far morally worse, there are times when you'll be left thinking \"OK, this girl needs to lose and get some sense knocked into her.\" It just wasn't something I was expecting from the moe MC who is clearly going to be the character selling the merchandise.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL ENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nHanebado is fun, but it has its flaws, some of them significant. I won't tell you to skip it, but I can't say it deserves to be near the top of your list either. Watch it if you're in the mood.",

The style of animation really shines through especially in the opening for the anime and also the amount of details and players movement in the badminton matches.The animation quality is, in my opinion, the best of the summer 2018 season and even a contender for best animation of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThe character development is also a strong point of this anime. Nagisa was a really good character with a lot of character developments in the first few episodes and the writer also did a great job in developing the side characters as well with most side characters given a small part in every episode or even an entire episode to develop their character without losing focus on the main characters.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, this anime is not without it\u2019s shortcoming. I know that the anime is also called \u201c the badminton play of Ayano Hanesaki\u201d but don\u2019t forget that Nagisa is also a main character in this anime. They put so much focus on Nagisa\u2019s character development to push her to the side to become a supporting character in the middle part of the anime. This is the reason that most people don\u2019t like the plot of this anime but they did rectify this later on in the TOURNAMENT ARC. One more other thing that I wished that the anime could have add more is Connie and Hanesaki interaction after the tournament arc.\\n",

The animation of the characters darting around the court and CGI of the shuttlecock make for a captivating badminton game each and every time. The shots of the birdie barely tipping over the edge of the net, or hitting the corner of the out of bounds before the crowd burst into applause is incredibly tense to watch. \r\nAsgreat as these moments are within the show, without likable characters they wouldn\u2019t have as great of an impact. One of the two main characters stands out here. Her grit, passion, and drive for the sport are all crafted in a relentless manner while also being able to show character growth and self-awareness. The backstory for the other main character is interesting, but if she was better presented or additional planning was put into her design she would have been more enticing to root for. Despite this, these two do provide a wonderful clash of personalities and the supporting cast are all fantastic.\\n\\n\r\nThe greatest thing about Hanebado! that is arrived at from having these good characters and outstanding presentation is the emotional impact that the show has on the viewer throughout the duration of the viewing time.

I got immersed into it for the first 2 episodes because they did a really good job on portraying character and story but after that I don't even know what they're aiming anymore.\r\nUnlike most of the sports anime, the competition scene wasn't really appealing (with the exception of the last episode)so I thought they would've focus more on the story but nope, not really. A lot of things in the story was just bland.

Honestly idk, it's just a come and go for me too anyways. Story was too wrapped up to even find a good conclusion and the competition was just too bland to be attracted for.

            "content": "Well, it's morning 4am and I'm writing my first review for this website. I'm actually interested how it came to this, but I digress and just blame my insomniac craziness. And craziness is actually the term I want to build this review around, as Hanebado gave me a crazy enjoyable experience here. Let's Jam.\r\nHanebado or Longer \"The Badminton of Ayano Hanesaki\" is typical sports anime in which several characters are fighting in intense badminton matches to reach the top of the nationals, which is apparently the most prestiguous spot to have for them. We have Ayano Hanesaki an actually talented protagonist, that trained a lotin sessions when she was younger. Together with her mum, who is the most notorious, well-known prodigy in Japanese Badminton she trains to become better, but one day her mum leaves the home and leaves her alone back in Japan. Ayano thought here she has been abandoned by her mother for not being good enough and thus turns into a literal \"badminton demon\". Her counterpart and rival Aragaki doesn't have it as \"easy\" as Ayano and has to train very hard to become as good. The anime here first introduces us Ayano as the protagonist, as the title also tells you, but it does really clever things here which puts it over the rest. The anime switches between protagonists and creates technically a back and forth between both and their seemingly tragic backstories.\\n\\n\r\nAnd this is also the tone of this anime, since it is a badminton game which is likely one on one or at best doubles, it really gets you at some point, because the games are actually well animated, show a ton of creative shots and angles and are overall just nice to see. I did not think you could make Badminton this appealing honestly. What also creates nice flow is the way the anime uses stuff like speedup shots, spins, slowmotions and more. What is first a soft-paced sports anime quickly turns into Shounen-like battles, as you actually feel when the characters are putting things on the line they turn the court into a battlezone where nothing matters but their own next creative shot and how to serve it back. Here is also where the strong point of Hanebado lies, because it never outright tells you who to root for and this is a course throughout the whole story even till the end. Hell, not even the characters in the game know who to root for so how should we? This is something everyone decides on their own as both characters are somehow depicted as harsh and villainy at times and none of them have actual a motive that would warrant them being so overly dramatic on the field. Hanebado is a Seinen Anime though and rather than a basic sports anime its a sports drama and one that will suck you in and not spit you out until you finished the series. You don't know who will win at the end, because this depicts the unpredictability of the sport. That is great.\\n\\n\r\nSomething I did not like though were the characters, particularily the side characters. I'm bad with names first so I personally just remembered the names of Aragaki and Ayano and that shows how forgettable the side-characters were. Theres the sister of Ayano who is also very good, but thinks that other people just hinder her success and outright refuses to play with them, what a bitch!\\n\r\nNext there are the friends and team-partners of Ayano, who she completely disgustingly refuses and tells them to fuck off figuratively. Really painful to see how villainy the people want Ayano to be. The rest of the cast mostly sits on the bench and acts as a spectator. \\n\\n\r\nThere is a memorable scene with Ayano where she actually is on the lower side of the field and loses and her trainer then blames her for not using good tactics to win. She then turns around and outright refuses his pleadings saying \"It's not my Badminton\". Sadly she throws away just that and says afterwards that her Badminton wasn't too successful and then uses the trainers strategies...and loses even harder. This scene probably just showed that there is no way to win everytime and that heart works better than theory and tactics. Good scene and a nice moral.\\n\\n\r\nAnyways. I would've enjoyed if they toned down the musical support a bit, because it might be somewhat exciting, i just think working with pure silence and sound effects would've had a better effect and atmosphere overall. In the final confrontation they actually use this and they also display a great detail. The anime at this point shows two badminton virtuosos fully at match with each other and fighting until they have no breath anymore. Absolutely thrilling and then the studio decided to cut the voices, soundeffects and panting sounds in a way the whole presentation is split the same as the field they are playing on. That detail amazed me, as it just works so well because in this battle the whole buildup of the anime just comes together well and it coincides with this concept of making you root for both.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all Hanebado is a really thrilling experience already from the third episode forward, Ayano has this monsteresque personality that comes out only when in combat and you just want to see how she fares. There are no super-powers and special shots with fire or sure-fire win strategies. But Ayano doesn't have anything unique like Kurokos presence or Midorimas 3point throws that give her an edge over things. Both just compete at the highest strength with hard work and willpower and thats whats exciting about hanebado.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 8",

            "content": "I'll try and make this first part short and simple, then expand on it after, there will be a list of things I liked/ disliked towards the bottom\r\nShould you watch it? I'd say yes but keep in mind that there are things you probably wont like \r\nShort version? The art and the feeling of the badminton looked great, but the way the story moved and specific characters acted felt so wrong and unnecessary. What happened in the anime was fine but because of discrepancies  and things that were over the top it turned out a lot worse than it needed to be.\r\nNow to expandon it all.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado mainly revolves two girls, one who works very hard to get where she is and another who seems to have been born with immense talent, there are lots of support and side characters that go along with them that each play a great role the make the series feel more fulfilling. The first one, Aragaki the captain of the team struggles with her own problems early own revolving around her skill due to a loss, this lead to a good change. However the main problem that causes this anime to falter in my opinion revolves around the other girl, Ayano. \\n\\n\r\nThis part will contain info/spoilers about her, nothing will be ruined from reading this however... Ayano was brought up with badminton because of her mom being a famous player, she had fun and tried to make her mom proud by being the best player she can be as many children might do, however due to a loss the mother was disappointed and vanished from Ayano's life. One might imagine sadness or weakness and feelings of the sort to brew because of this but it became something terrible instead, Ayano became a hateful character with an extreme edgy vibe constantly going, this could have been fine if toned down and other feeling mixed it but this is not the case. The story moved in a fashion that I felt was normal/good for a sports anime like this but because of Ayano along with a few other problems directly revolving around her. \\n\\n\r\nThings I liked:\\n\\n\r\n>I actually quite enjoyed majority of the cast, some of them might not of been as fleshed out as I would've liked but it's only 1 season\\n\\n\r\n> The art looked really nice and pleasing, the girls were made to look cute/sexy as well but not in an overbearing way that is shoved in your face\\n\\n\r\n>Disregarding the clash between certain characters, I think the direction the story went was good\\n\\n\r\n>During the final two episodes Aragaki got a different art/style to really emphasize the situation, it felt appropriate and looked good \\n\\n\r\nThings I didn't like:\\n\\n\r\n>Ayano was hateful and edgy to a dumb degree, a tone down of this and a mix of other emotions would've felt much better\\n\\n\r\n> A character acted one way and then suddenly changed to the opposite, this would've been fine if there was some show for it at least \\n\\n\r\n> Ayano also got a art/style change but it made her look older and more like her mother, it felt weird \\n\\n\r\n>I think for the purpose of the anime what the mother did was fine but it felt like it was portrayed in a bad way, there was also little follow up for the amount of tension brought up with her \\n",

            "content": "Hanebado! is the other girl-centric focused sports anime and well it might as well be the diametric opposite of Harukana Receive.\r\nHanebado! focuses on Ayano Hanesaki voiced by Hitomi Ohwada who has talent in badminton however doesn't want to be in the badminton club for parental reasoning's, however she with the badminton coach as well as her colleagues she reluctantly starts playing badminton and faces new rivals and gets back into the game.\r\nOk, so where Hanebado will have a mixed view is on our main protagonist Ayano Hanesaki voiced by Hitomi Ohwada, as a negative, Ayano is a unique main protagonist that yes has some parentalissues that drives her to the point of only caring to reach her goals and not caring about her rivals or allies, only her own goals to the point of seeing her as something of an anti-hero, her goals poisoned and corrupted by her own goals and devastating anyone who gets in her way in a rather clalous way possible. But to Ayano's defence, she does have some legitimate reasonings as to her \"callousness\" and that is because of her mommy issues and well Ayano's mother outright abandoned her that caused her to just break and the thing is, Ayano's mother abandoned her and had her own prodigal badminton daughter in the process, which by plot standards becomes a major rival for Ayano. So yes, Ayano has her reasonings and has somewhat a good defence for her personality all things considered.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado!'s cast also does well to mix with Ayano the best being Nagisa Aragaki voiced by Miyuri Shimabukuro, one of the best in her club and works her butt off to be the best badminton player and is the polar opposite to Ayano, everything from their playstyles and beliefs in badminton, along with her we also have LA's favorite character in the anime, Riko Izumi voiced by Yuuna Mimura, a third year and having something of an inferiority complex compared to her younger members but is one of the more supportive characters and someone that cares for the rest of the cast. Other members include Erena Fujisawa voiced by Konomi Kohara, the person who got Ayano back into badminton but doesn't really play badminton and is just a supportive pillar for Ayano and the rest of the club. Of course for a sports anime there are rivals and though there is the initial rivalry of Ayano and Nagisa through their ideals, there are other rivals Ayano goes through, from the irredeemably annoying Kaoruko Serigaya voiced by Asami Shimoda and Connie Christensen voiced by Mariya Ise who not only has a  rivalry through badminton but it goes further when it has to do with Ayano's mother in the process that LA aforementioned. Hanebado! makes some of the rivals Nagisa and Ayano goes through as either blatantly evil for the sake of it in this case of Kaoruko but also sympathetic in this case of Connie and LA is fine with that in some sense but also due to the anime's major focus on Ayano's unrelenting belief on how she plays badminton as well how it affects her family life especially when it involves Ayano's mother is a different thing altogether.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! goes on a different direction for it's clash of playstyles and beliefs on the sports in question, LA is fine with that as it's brilliantly handled between Nagisa and Ayano. Nagisa being dedicated to badminton her whole life and strives to be the best on her own merits, yes she sticks to a playstyles but she opens up and does new tactics to hone her skills with the backing of her friends in the process, she's essentially working her natural talent as a crutch and seeing how far it takes her, on the other spectrum we have the child prodigy Ayano who uses badminton as both a copping mechanism and naturally flaunts her experience, but she had no backing from her friends and family and when she DOES get the attention and help from others yes at first she accepts it and gets her back into badminton, but due to her anger, grudge and rage towards her rivals and especially her mother she discards it just to get back at her mother and her goals through winning as revenge against her mother, playstyle wise, she keeps to one playstyle but due her being a badminton child prodigy she KNOWS of other playstyles and quickly gets use to it thus being the \"experience\" vs. Nagisa's talent, but her playstyle reflects her feelings most of which are anger which in some cases are warranted and because of her self-isolating herself to strive for her goal of winning, she isolated herself completely without any backing from her friends she made along the way even when some of her friends WANTS to help her. This opposition between Nagisa and Ayano finally rings true by the final match and what occurs when these two finally face off with one another.....who wins, who knows as they both have great backing as to why they want to win, just with different beliefs and playstyles weighing them through the match and THAT is where Hanebado! comes into it's best with these clash of ideals that just made Hanebado! so great.\\n\\n\r\nLike, LA didn't like Ayano when she slowing transitioned into her demon side (though crazy badass in some sense) but through the clash and lead up to the final match of Hanebado! with Nagisa, LA finally understood what Hanebado! was going for and made Ayano's inclusion all the more unique and interesting which coupled with the great animation only made the anime even better...on speaking of which...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of animation by LIDENFILMS, well to say it's fluid in it's matches is saying not enough, considering how the actions of each of the matches are soo well done and fluid as hell, the animation done by LIDENFILMS was great, along with it's polished character designs making each of them distinct AND Ayano's demon side makes the anime's animation very well done to say the least. LIDENFILMS put their all in the animation and for a sports anime, LA saw some tinge of LIDENFILMS' marks as LA primarily knows LIDENFILMS for their viscerally action packed fantasy animes, Hanebado! has some stylistic touches that LA could only see LIDENFILMS do and it helped on that front. Nonetheless, LIDENFILMS shines when doing the badminton matches as fluid, quick paced and action-filled which is the obvious main draw to a badminton anime which it did just that...\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of voice acting, for the most part, LA was just \"ok\" with the voice cast, not horrible but not in the spectrum of great either. Though LA didn't like Ayano as a character, LA will give it to Hitomi Ohwada that she still portrayed her well with her calm demeanor, vastly changed into her badminton demon form and how much of a stoic monster her performance is is something to give praise too. Due to some of the rivals Hanebado! has being just outright asshole characters (like Asami Shimoda as Kaoruko and in some sense Connie as Mariya Ise), but nonetheless LA will say they did well as rival characters to contrast to Hitomi Ohwada. Overall, the voice cast is ok with some highs that caught LA's interest.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! was at first, LA didn't understand why Ayano was such an anti-hero and really unlikable but LA understood by the end of it that this was a good thing making an anti-hero of a main protagonist couple that with the clash of beliefs to her main rival Nagisa and many of her rivals reeling the tension of this badminton anime be it through parental issues or badminton itself to make it a great anime no matter how artificial or not, sure the anime has some of the typical sports anime tropes, from the shy girl opening herself up and gaining the courage, some romantic tension to some of the other cast members, jobbing rivals and \"friendship through playing sports\" and of course the main focus of Hanebado! being of Ayano and Nagisa's polar opposite developments to strive for their goals to be the best but with all the bad and good weighed up by the end of it, well LA found Hanebado! both uniquely interesting for an intense sports anime and by both balancing and doing good use to it's more psychological family drama added in that worked well, sure LA didn't like some characters namely Ayano but the bulk of the anime involving Ayano and Nagisa had MASSIVELY great development both badminton and personality wise. Seriously both Nagisa and Ayano's rivalry was the best highlight of this anime and made this anime entirely worth it. The only dividing consensus LA will see how you view Hanebado! is all on Ayano, if you hate her or you love her will have problems later on like how LA did but really it's small potatoes to the larger scale of what Hanebado! offers and ONE character being outside the norm is hardly something to bring the entire anime down which Hanebado! handled quite well, be it intentional or not.\\n\\n\r\nHanebado! is just amazing for a badminton anime, fluidly animated and intense in both it's drama and intense sports and even though LA only watched two sports anime but nonetheless Hanebado! earned LA's respect for what it was trying to achieve and it execute it brilliantly, Hanebado! is surprising enough LA's favourite sports anime of Summer 2018 and fine there isn't much competition (the other being Harukana Recieve) but still...the point still stands and with how LA progressed through the anime, Hanebado might as well also be LA's dark horse of Summer 2018 as well...apt considering Ayano as a character.",

Nagisa is literally about showing that her effort means something. \r\nThen there is a tournament arc and everyone loves tournament arcs right? \r\nThere are some supporting character that get arcs as well but my god they are not that good at all.\r\nAlso it doesn't follow the manga 100%. It changes a lot of things or makes things much more dramatic.\r\nArt: 9/10\r\nProbably the reason you are going to even watch this. The animation is just phenomenal in this show. The badminton sceneslook amazing. Of course like most shows though it does tend to get worse as you get into the later episodes but it still is no where near as bad as Yuri on Ice was.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nGreat opening and ending. The soundtrack does its job and the sound effect have a lot of impact in the badminton scenes.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10\\n\r\nAll the characters are just terrible. Ayano becomes almost annoying as hell in the second half. Nagisa is really unlikable at the beginning, yes I get it is the point so that she gets an character arc where she gets better but in the later half of the show she is just so boring. The supporting cast aren't any better either. Connie is unlikeable Kaoruko is very unlikeable and Uchika is just the worse. \\n\r\nBy the end of the series nothing feels resolved at all with these characters.\\n\r\nI honestly don't understand why they didn't just follow the manga accurately? The characters are much better in the manga and much more likeable.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyable: 7/10\\n\r\nThe first half is very enjoyable and the animation is enough to keep you intersted. The story is just very bad and the characters are bad as well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10\\n\r\nShould've followed the manga\\n",

            "content": "Alright, I am skipping the whole first time writing a review bullshit thing. Let me give it to you as straight as possible. This show is great as long as you are only here for the sport or visual aspects of it. Everything else is actually dogshit.\r\nNow, this review covers spoilers! so look no further than here if you want to try the show. \r\nNow as said above the visuals of HAnebado are amazing. The details are impressive. It is one of the many draws the show has from the get-go.  Now this series starts like Haiykuu!! does. Your main girl Nagisa is theclassic work for it and will get it kind of charter. However, she gets absolutely destroyed by Ayano the op as hell character fo the series. Now after this thrashing they both end up as the same school. Where you start to think \"Oh they will team up and get over the hurtles together to be better or 1 v 1 against each other a lot and be good rivals.\"\\n\r\nDo they?....... For like the first three eps teamwork and that seem like the idea....until is dies quickly at ep 4. After that Ayano does a 180 and this show moves on with Kirito mark 2.79  I am going to stop there for if I go on I will spoil everything. \\n\\n\r\nNow the characters are the main bane of the story. Mainly Ayano's mom or any of Ayano's rivals.  Who I can even begin to speak of how much I hate her. I am sure she shit. Like her char. makes no sense. Like from the plot I have no idea why she had a kid. Like for eps 1-11, I have no idea how or why she would procreate. She is just a shit human being who has no regrets of abandoning her child to make her like badminton for her own sake or some dumb shit like that. Ayano is just a shit version or exact version of kirito. It is like they thought to make an antihero like Hachiman for SNAFU, but took away all the character form him. Mainly all the characters do 180 like every eps for little to no reason. The only good char. is Nagisa but she fucks off at ep 4. \\n\\n\r\nThe writing is god awful. it seems like the animator got all the money while every other department got lackluster people. I feel bad for anyone who had to work o this show. Since it is dogshit.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, this is a case of the MANGA IS BETTER!!! kind of thing. I wouldn't know though since this anime has turned me off entirely form the series. I would personally seek to fail the show if told I could. If you think I am being too harsh or missed the point of the show you watch it and come back and call me wrong with a good backing of facts(from the show no manga facts) and I will not change but lessen my smolder hate a little.",

            "content": "Hanebado a sports based anime with nice visuals and good voice actors as well as awesome character designs, one of the few animes I've binge watched during this season episode 1 had me hooked the same way I got hooked on Welcome To The Ballroom and Haikyuu\r\nMoving on the art is really good I can't praise it enough hahah, like it's really good next to no 3D CGI at all during each match shown so far also the motions and movement during a match the moment a character makes a smash it looks so damn good I could literally rewatch it over and over againand the opening and ending are brilliant so colourful and so beautiful they went all out on the ending song and visuals tho. Another brilliant aspect of this anime is yup the killer eyes lol yes certain characters will get this look in their eyes like they are ready to kill or something which looks awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThis is your typical sports anime nothing out of the ordinary but I will say this watch this anime and you'll feel a bit of Haikyuu every now and then I also felt it was a bit similar to Kejio but yknow with less Ecchi butt actions although this series has its fair share of fan service, there is drama but hey what's a sports series without drama there is a going to be that typical stuff like you aren't alone we are a team or the sport is more fun playing as a team etc.. and the Main Character has her drama with her shitty mother, I feel like this series could have gone for 24 episodes because it has potential so I went and read the manga and found out there are some things that's a bit different some characters are in the manga while they aren't in the anime but it's not all bad tho, I'll continue to read the manga hoping that it will get a season 2 and to see where they take the story and how the characters develop.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this anime and that's what matters whether you enjoyed it or not \\n\\n\\n\r\n                               ...............Spoiler.............\\n\r\nlet me just straight out say that the Main Character has a shitty mother oh my god I hate her mother, I was so happy when the Main Character Ayanao decided yknow what time to drop what ever love I had for this perosn because come on you can't just walk out on your daughter just to make her focus and develop on badminton and her daughter was  like what a little kid at that time so of course t's  going to be a bit affect her at that age I'meeling the mother.\\n\\n",
