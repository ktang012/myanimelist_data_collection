            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Konohana Kitan and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nBased off a well-known manga of the same name Konohana Kitan gives us the opportunity to see what the life and duties of a team of fox girls would be if they decided to operate a traditional hot spring inn in an setting reminiscent of ancient Japan that\u2019s mixed with a fantasy world  The first episode of the series really did an excellent job of introducingme to a world where all sorts of races exist and live alongside each other and left a pretty good impression on me enough that I decided to stick with it and im glad that I did.  \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in a fantasy world that combines the traditional culture of ancient Japan with the fantasy world is a world that is populated by all sorts of races and creatures each of which has their own cultures and mannerisms. Here humans are but one race that exists in harmony with many other races that live in the world. The overall story follows the adventures of Yuzu a young fox girl that until now has been living with her master and guardian on the outskirts of the city and follows her exploits as she joins the staff of the Konohantei a large and popular hot spring inn that serves as the city\u2019s main flagship hotel that has a well-earned reputation of being able to provide its guests with attentive service and solutions for problems that bother them. As Yuzu joins the inn\u2019s staff to work as an attendant she will be joining a number of interesting characters that include the workaholic and serious-minded Satsuki, the elegant and refined Ren, the tomboyish but considerate Natsume, the quiet but helpful Sakura and the relaxed but intelligent head attendant Kiri. Working together with such a colourful cast and at such a relaxing hotel Yuzu would soon learn that providing rooms and helping with the needs of the hotel\u2019s guests is only half of their duties and a true attendant also works to ensure that any problems that they are bothered with are dealt with and ensure that they can enjoy their time here to the fullest.   \\n\\n\r\nYuzu \\n\\n\r\nYuzu voiced by new seiyuu Yuuko Oono is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A fox girl that had until the start of the series had lived her whole life with her master Yuzu is an innocent, eager and polite young girl that\u2019s also positive and cheerful. In the beginning of the series Yuzu was a happy and go lucky girl that while a bit na\u00efve made up for it by being eager to help others in their duties. Though an energetic girl she was also clumsy and in the beginning caused no small amount of trouble for her co-workers but instead of letting that affect her Yuzu did what she proves to be able to do the best which is bounce back. While dismayed at first that her master will be leaving her to work at such a strange place Yuzu as the series goes on comes to understand the reasons behind her master\u2019s decision and comes to love working at the inn. While having no real skills in the beginning Yuzu in an effort to not bother others shows one of her more prominent traits which is that of her diligence as she works hard to both support her fellow attendants and learn how to improve her skills so as not to slow them down. This willingness to learn new skills to help her friends so as to not affect their duties is one of the traits that truly define her. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Yuzu comes to understand the roles of an attendant more it can be seen that Yuzu starts to develop a fondness for working at the inn. This is because it allows her to not just work to improve her skills but also in allowing her to meet many new characters and situations that she can learn from and thus give her a purpose. Though surprised at first that being an attendant also involves listening to the problems that the guests are troubled with as the series goes on it can be seen that Yuzu is a very kind and caring person by nature that cares a great deal about the guests and their circumstances and she will try her utmost to understand the problems that they are burdened with. While respectful towards the guests and knowing that sometimes it can be hard for them to say what troubles them to strangers Yuzu would often go to great lengths to try and understand and figure out the problems which often results in the guests eventually letting up and tell her. While knowing the limits of her knowledge Yuzu nonetheless tries her best to offer her insights into the problems that were expressed and come up with a solution that is often a surprisingly well thought one. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting and well-designed one that had some pretty good development as the series went on. Seeing her develop from the naive, eager and clumsy young fox girl into a kind, caring and considerate young fox girl that was as adept at work as she was at listening to and understanding guest\u2019s problems I felt was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yuuko Oono really did an impressive job at voicing the character of Yuzu. \\n\\n\r\nSakura \\n\\n\r\nSakura voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Brave Witches and Asterisk Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the Konohanatei hot spring inn. A quiet, innocent and carefree member of the attendant staff Sakura despite being the youngest of the inn\u2019s staff is a veteran attendant that has been working at the inn for some time. While polite and helpful towards both guests and fellow attendants it can be seen that Sakura is someone that is slow to trust others and seems wary of outsiders that enter into the close family that is the inn\u2019s staff of attendants. However, as the series progresses it can be seen that Sakura once she has determined that the new member was someone that was trustworthy would gradually open up her personality to them and eagerly try to bond with them. While a quiet girl Sakura has been shown to be very loyal to her fellow attendants and friends and while she doesn\u2019t speak much she will let her actions speak for herself. As it is I felt that the character of Sakura was an interesting character that emphases on the quiet but cautious member of the inn\u2019s attendants, but I felt that she would have been better if she had more voice lines for her seiyuu. Still, I feel that wordless interactions with the others certainly had its moments that were appreciated such as her hostile relationship with Okiku. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki \\n\\n\r\nSatsuki voiced by new seiyuu Sawako Hata is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the Konohanatei hot springs inn. A serious-minded, dutiful and hard-working member of the inn\u2019s attendant staff Satsuki is a veteran member of the attendant staff and well versed in dealing with the types of guests that stay at the inn. While hardworking and dutiful and trusted greatly by the other members of the team in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Satsuki\u2019s, attitude was rather aloof and quiet and seemed to be wary of working as a team with others. Moreover, her serious-minded and workaholic nature also meant that she often clashed with the more laid-back members of the team such as Kiri and Natsume. Despite this Satsuki\u2019s experience of dealing with guests and ability to react to sudden situations is something that is valued greatly by the rest of the team and it can be seen that when she\u2019s directing others to their duties that she imparts a sense of purpose and order to them when doing so. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as we see her interact more with the cast and with Yuzu, in particular, it can be seen that she is burdened with a great deal of responsibility that has the effect of driving her to do her best in her work. In the beginning of the series, Satsuki was someone that treated her work as an attendant with the utmost importance pursuing it relentlessly and never taking any time off for herself even for festivals. As a result of this Satsuki when she had time off was someone that looked somewhat lost when she had nothing to do which I felt was kinda sad considering her age. The main cause of this was her desire to show her sister that took her dream role from her that even in another role she can still do an excellent job. A direct consequence of this desire, however, is the pressure that she imparts on herself as she is afraid of making mistakes and cause troubles to others. As the series goes on and after meeting Yuzu and interacting with her Satsuki\u2019s personality starts to gradually change. While she still remains hardworking and serious it can be seen that she\u2019s also willing to interact more with the rest of the team on a more personal level and no longer keeps a distance from the others. In particular Satsuki gradually learns to rely on the other members of the team and place her trust in them rather than try to do everything on her own. The character of Satsuki I felt was an interesting character and one that was both well designed and saw a great deal of development as the series went on. In particular, I really liked the interaction that Satsuki actually had with Yuzu and the changes that she caused to develop in Satsuki\u2019s personality. All in all, I felt that her seiyuu Sawako Hata really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Satsuki. \\n\\n\r\nRen \\n\\n\r\nRen voiced by new seiyuu Risa Kubota in her first role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the inn. An elegant, kind and understanding person Ren like Satsuki is a veteran member of the attendant\u2019s team. Outwardly Ren is a positive, hardworking and the very image of someone that\u2019s both self-confident in her skills as an attendant as she is in her physical appearance. As a result of this self-confident nature of hers Ren is someone that has great pride in her abilities and skills as a host and in the beginning her attitude can often be seen as arrogant and haughty as she takes everything seriously. However, beneath this surface personality, it can be seen that Ren is actually a very fair person and doesn\u2019t like to be in debt to others or let them take the blame for her mistakes. While kind and positive it can be seen that Ren also has a cynical side to her as well best seen in her first interactions with Yuzu. This side of her however gradually disappears as the series goes on as a result of her deepening friendship with her. A prominent trait of Ren that I find interesting is her ability to switch from one expression to another quite literally a trait that not even Satsuki is able to accomplish. This I feel is an indication of both Ren\u2019s skill as an attendant as well as her personality which is adaptive of different situations. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses and more of Ren\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that Ren is someone whose inner personality somewhat contrasts with her outer personality. Outwardly Ren is someone that takes great pride in her physical appearance and believes that it\u2019s the duty of all girls to look pretty and presentable to others. However, within her inner personality it can be seen that this holds a far greater meaning within her as inwardly Ren believes that if she wasn\u2019t dressed up she wouldn\u2019t be able to display the confident and efficient self that she shows to others meaning that in a way it\u2019s her pride and dressing up nicely that actually makes her the person that she is to others. An interesting aspect of Ren is her close relationship with her fellow attendant and childhood friend Natsume. Although they are co-workers and have been working together enough in that they know each other\u2019s habits as well as weaknesses it can be seen that their relationship goes beyond that of simple friends as Ren seems to be extremely conscious of her performance and mannerisms when in front of her. The interactions between these two I felt though were actually really cute especially when Ren is remarked by Natsume to be cute as Ren is someone that wants to be seen as classy and efficient rather than being cute. Overall, I felt that the character of Ren was a well designed and developed one that while haughty and proud on the outside is also unexpectedly nice and forgiving in the inside a contrast that I felt suits her nicely. For her first performance as a seiyuu, I felt that Risa Kubota really did an excellent job in her portrayal of Ren.  \\n\\n\r\nKiri \\n\\n\r\nKiri voiced by veteran seiyuu Manami Namakura of Aoki Hagane no arpeggio and Unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the inn. A calm, composed and elegant fox girl Kiri serves as the inn\u2019s head attendant and as a result is the commander of the team of attendants that work at the inn. While Kiri can appear to be a rather laid-back person it can be seen however that Kiri is a perceptive and understanding person that as a result of her extensive experience is someone that\u2019s kind and understanding and able to offer a great deal of advice and opinions to her subordinates and guests and as a result is well respected by both. Though the duties of a head attendant are a busy one it can be seen that Kiri is someone that trusts each of the girls massively and is willing to let them try and solve problems that guests may be burdened with but at the same time willing to protect them if things turn out sideways. While Kiri\u2019s assignment of attendants may appear random at times it can be seen that this choice is actually based on her analysis and understanding of each of the skills of her team as well as their personalities and thus allowing her to deal with any flare-ups that happen quite easily. While Kiri\u2019s personality may appear to be teasing at times it can be seen that she\u2019s always ready to help and motivate people if they seem to be stuck at an impasse showing her helpful nature. The character of Kiri I felt was an interesting character in that while she appears to be a laid-back person that lets her subordinates handle the bulk of the work the fact that beneath that image of her is actually someone that is perceptive, kind and understanding of both guests and her subordinates and is actually someone that cares a great deal about her charges and willing to protect them was a nice surprise. Her observations on the guest\u2019s problems as well as her tendency to let her charges think of a way to solve them so as to allow them to learn I thought was admirable and something that all bosses should aspire to be. I felt that her seiyuu Manami Namakura really did an excellent job at voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nNatsume \\n\\n\r\nNatsume voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Suwa of Asterisk Wars and Phantasy Star Online 2 fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the inn. A positive, helpful and mischievous fox girl that like Ren and Satsuki are veteran members of the attendant staff. On the surface, Natsume is a positive and cheerful person that loves to pull jokes on people and help set the mood in situations that turn out to be grim.  However, beneath this side of her it can be seen that Natsume is also someone that is diligent and skilled at her duties and cares a great deal about the welfare of the guests as well as her fellow attendants and would work hard to protect her fellow attendants and friends from harm. While Natsume\u2019s default personality may appear to be a careless one it can be seen that she too has a serious side to her personality as when she becomes serious she can be surprisingly perceptive and understanding of the reasons that people may be down for. In this side, she\u2019s shown to be surprisingly loyal and protective of her friends as well. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, while Natsume is often paired with Ren in their duties as attendants of the inn it can be seen that their relationship is far closer than that of normal friends and co-workers. As the series goes on and their past gets revealed it can be seen that the two were in fact childhood friends that had bonded with each other due to a rather unusual circumstance in Ren\u2019s past. As a result, it can be seen that Natsume views Ren as someone that is very important to her and treasures the relationship that they have between them strongly enough in that she will be there to protect her when she needs it.  This relationship between the two forged over a simple promise to prevent Ren from going into despair I felt was interesting as it allowed us to see the depths of the bond that exists between the two characters. The Character of Natsume I felt was a well designed and developed one whose role in the series while focusing on comic relief and bringing fun to serious situations also served as the glue that bound the cast together. I felt that her seiyuu Ayaka Suwa really did an excellent job at voicing the character of Natsume.  \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the inn and the town areas that the cast visit in the series was very well designed and did an excellent job of combing the scenery of ancient Japan and the new shared culture that exists in this world. The design for each of the races that were featured in the series I felt was also pretty good and varied enough to ensure that each being will be interesting as you see them. The individual character designs for each of the main cast I felt was well designed and matched well with each of their personalities.  The music for the series I felt was one of the strong points of the series as it helped convey the overall mood of not just the series but also of the individual episodes and their stories as well. In particular, I really liked the opening and ending themes that the series made use of as it was not only catchy but also calming and cute as well with the latter being applied best to the ending theme. The voice acting for the series I felt was one of the series main strong points as I felt that each member of the cast was able to do an excellent job in portraying their characters. In particular, I felt that Yuuko Oono, Sawako Hata and Risa Kubota who portrayed the characters of Yuzu, Satsuki and Ren respectively deserve particular praise as I felt that despite being new seiyuu\u2019s they still did a fantastic job in portraying their assigned characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Konohana Kitan was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story that conveyed a lot of interesting life lessons, an interesting and well-developed cast of characters and excellent voice acting and music. The premise for the series itself is a basic one that is often seen in slice of life animes that Konohana Kitan belongs to but this simple premise I felt was what enabled the premise to be one of its greatest strengths of the series. Hot spring inns are one of the staples of the Japanese tourism industry and choosing to form a story around the work of the attendants at the inn as they work to not just manage the inn but also take care of the guests that stay at the inn and make use of the services was an interesting idea. The overall story that makes use of this interesting premise I felt was a strong one as not only did it show the casts development as they worked alongside and bonded with each other but also show how they worked to understand and solve the problems that bother the guests. This theme of not just taking care of the guests physically but also working to solve the problems that are bothering the guests mentally I felt was interesting and resonated well with the premise of attendants taking care of their guests. Each of the problems that were featured as part of the story I felt was well done and thought out that really imparted a number of interesting life lessons both to Yuzu and the cast and to us as the viewers. The fact that these problems incorporated a great deal of themes that were paired with each of the unique circumstances of the guests themselves I felt was an excellent move. \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Konohana Kitan was an anime that I really enjoyed as it had an interesting premise and story that featured plenty of well thought out and developed sub-stories that served to make each of the guests that the cast welcomed a unique existence. Of these the cursed doll Okiku, the spirit of the daughter and the weaver were one of my favourites. The character development for the series as well as the development of the gradual bond of friendship that forms between the cast as they encounter, solve and learn from each of these problems was something I particularly liked as well. As a final score, I would say that Konohana Kitan would deserve a final score of 10/10.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A beautiful village of spirits. A joyful weather. And a mysterious feeling of tranquility. It\u2019s not every day you get to see a group of mythical girls hanging out together and enjoying life. Konohana Kitan is a show that\u2019s simple as it gets \u2013 cute girls doing cute things with a touch of fantasy. This anime is a heartwarming show that knows how to put all the ingredients to craft a charming slice of life. For me, Konohana Kitan is a gem that really shined without complexity.\r\nBringing together a cast of characters into this show feels like the creator needed to inject personality. I mean,lots and lots of personality. The initial first episodes portrays the innocent fox Yuzu as she arrives at Konohanaeti. The first impressions she brings in is questionable as Yuzu really demonstrates what it means to be a klutz. She is clumsy, inexperienced, and doesn\u2019t know her place well. However, Yuzu is a very friendly girl that can get along with everyone and through her personality, she improves and has an innate charm that other characters begin to appreciate. It didn\u2019t take me long to accept Yuzu as a likable character because the way she bonds with others.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, relationship dynamics is an important part of this show and it really knows how to sell those points. Yuzu\u2019s relationship with Satsuki is one of those relationships that really tests herself. In the beginning, their relationship starts rocky because let\u2019s face it, their characters really are almost like foils of each other. Yuzu is friendly and respectful while Satsuki has a much more serious personality. Not to mention, Satsuki is a very hardworking character and doesn\u2019t tolerate mistakes often. One might describe her as a workaholic although it\u2019s clear that she cares about her friends/co-workers. Throughout the show, she begins to warm up to Yuzu and it\u2019s obvious that she cares about her. Yuzu\u2019s personality also has influence on her as Satsuki begins to enjoy the love of working, rather than just work towards her dream.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Satsuki, Yuzu also brings the best out of other characters too through character relationships. Yuzu is able to impress Natsume and the both of them strives to work harder to make Konohanaeti into a better place. She and Sakura also shares a peculiar relationship because of their size although the both of them really begin to respect each other as time goes on. On the other hand, there\u2019s Natsume and Ren, two characters that\u2019s more like a ship-tease pair compared to the other cast. Through their interactions, it\u2019s obvious that Ren harbors a crush on Natsume even though the show doesn\u2019t fully explore it. Although this show isn\u2019t a yuri that capitalizes on female romance, it can easily get fans to fantasize on this pair. That being said, the core characters in this show contains a lot of personality. Whether it\u2019s Yuzu\u2019s friendly attitude, Natsume\u2019s tomboyish tendencies, Satsuki\u2019s rigidness, or Ren\u2019s strive to be perfect, the show can easily get you into the mood just with its colorful characters\\n\\n\r\nDespite the story being simple, it has a mysterious aura that almost feels like a bit of suspense. What exactly is Konohanaeti? Why do some characters come there? What is its true purpose? Where this is even located? Throughout the show, it has a certain mystique that I can\u2019t help but wonder. While almost every episode is an adventurous sitcom, there\u2019s definitely more than meets the eye about the world setting. Plus, we do get hear stories about the past that influences the future from certain characters. There\u2019s also one particular episode that really capitalizes the opportunity for world building. It\u2019s one of those episodes that draws the line between fiction and reality. Additionally, this anime is great at evoking certain emotions. These can bring a smile to the viewers\u2019 face or more poignant moments for emotional storytelling. The comedy is also sold well on most parts through the relationship teasing and even occasional fan service. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Lerche, Konohana Kitan is a colorful show and I mean that as one that transcends its setting than beyond just an inn for characters to visit. The places has a youthful theme and brings in all types of characters including ones with relations to mythology. The animalistic characteristics of the cast is also noticeable such as Yuzu\u2019s ears and Satsuki\u2019s tail. There\u2019s even a doll girl introduced in this anime to add a bit of innocent feel. Fan service exists and it\u2019s often portrayed as a way of character teasing that\u2019s hard to ignore. The theme songs are melancholic with a colorful vibe and decorated with creativity. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I also feel like the character cast does a great job at portraying their characters. I mentioned before that the show has a lot of personalities. To bring that to life, it requires skill of the VA and thankfully, they pull it off in a masterful fashion. Yuzu\u2019s innocence is portrayed convincingly thanks to the talent of newcomer Yuuko Oono. Sawako Hata\u2019 talent is also worth mentioning for bring a character like Satsuki to life. It\u2019s not easy to adapt a character with a serious voice but she pulls it off with flying colors through her words. Kiri, perhaps the most mature character of the cast is also well adapted thanks to the modern talent of Manami Numakura. Throughout the show, every episode also maintains a balanced OST with touches of melancholy. \\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is an underrated show that proves slice of life doesn\u2019t always need to rely on a modern setting. It doesn\u2019t have to involve characters living the school life. Instead, this anime stands out on its own with its credible genres. The way every character is adapted really brings the best out of each other. It has a story that is simple enough to get viewers invested into its idea. I can honestly recommend this show to just about anyone. To put it simply, Konohana Kitan is an enchanting show that\u2019s a love letter to slice of life.\\n",

            "content": "Most moe shows create adorable characters for fans to love, but typically they stop there without taking their stories further. \r\nKonohana Kitan isn\u2019t one of those shows, and it would be woefully underselling it to say that it's just cute. Beyond its adorable cast of fox eared ladies and it\u2019s initial \u201ccute girls run an inn\u201d hook there are deeply human themes woven in.\r\nI don\u2019t usually advocate for moe shows, however, I think Konohana Kitan hasn\u2019t gotten a fair shake from most people based on its aesthetic choice, so I want to get my opinion down to hopefully steer some people to this wonderful show.\r\nStory8/10\\n\r\nAt the start of the show, the clumsy main character Yuzu gets her first job at Konohanatei; a hot spring inn in a village home to a variety of spirits and anthropomorphized animals. Konohanatei gives off a meditative atmosphere drawing in a variety of wise guests who impart life lessons onto the main cast, which includes six of the hot springs employees. Each episode follows the adorable employees through their daily lives working and living at Konohanatei, their personalities bounce off each other making plenty of funny moments that contrast with some really poignant moments that evoke very real-world themes. The first episode shocked me at how the story wasn't just meant to be generic, it has a purpose and so far it has achieved it. \\n\r\nThe story may just be a mode for delivering themes and crafting memorable character moments, but it's a slice of life so the predictability didn't bother me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe six leads are paired together in classic shoujo-ai fashion. In the first four episodes, the story has followed Yuzu, Satsuki, and Ren. The three of them have layered personalities that go beyond how they seem upon a first look, their backstories are interesting and are visible in their characterizations. \\n\r\nThe two leads that have gotten the most development so far are Yuzu and Satsuki. They have a lot of chemistry together which makes the scenes that they're together very enjoyable.  \\n\r\nWhen they're together on screen their simple but opposing personalities clash to make for some funny and endearing moments. That could be said for all of the employees; their personalities are so vividly detailed that when they clash it forces them to reflect on themselves, and those realizations stay with their characters and have been revisited throughout the show. As if they were real people, they face struggles from inner turmoil and resolve issues by gaining wisdom from each other and the knowledgeable guests. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nA subdued and calming opening starts off each episode, but it gradually opens and grows louder, much like the progression of the individual story arcs. The voice actresses do a good job at their parts and that anime cat lady thing, even if it's not outstanding it's still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe character designs are of course adorable and they\u2019re also very expressive, their designs are fairly varied but they\u2019re given life through the characterizations. Environments are simple but appealing to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually one to advocate for moe, but Konohana Kitan surprised me in how realistic its core messages are. Funny scenarios, adorable characters, and poignant themes, Konahana Kitan is the most pleasant surprise I've seen this year. \\n\\n\r\nIn the second episode, the adorable and optimistic Yuzu imparts her simplistic yet poignant thoughts of life onto the strict and serious Satsuki which warms her heart and immediately strikes a visible connection between the two. The connection felt realistic to me because the belief they shared transcended the adorable animal-people world of Konohana Kitan and shot directly into the real one. \\n\r\nThe message is that you should enjoy life whenever you can because if you don't it will pass you by and fill you with regret.\\n\\n\r\nProvisional Score 8.1/10\\n\r\nDon't judge a book by its cover, Konohana Kitan is a good show that's worth watching despite what it's aesthetic may imply upon your first judgment. \\n\r\nThe show's strongest point is how well the characters are written. However, not all of the main cast members haven't been fleshed out. I can see this issue being addressed in the future, as I update this review I'll comment on how it (hopefully) gets better.",

            "content": "Cute girls doing cute things? Mild yuri slice-of-life? It's a bit hard to differentiate yourself when you are competing with hallmarks like GochiUsa, Yuru Yuri, or the latest hits (looking at you Kobayashi's Maid Dragon!) \r\nDon't let KonoKitan's first 3 episodes fool you though. While it starts off slow introducing its main characters, I find its use of Japanese folklore, traditional customs, and legendary figures, to be fitting and clever. Ever heard of the Baku? Or the idea that dolls have souls? It's very interesting to see how KonoKitan weaves these concepts with its cast of characters in a slow-paced manner, while leaving commentaries onthe ephemeral nature of life. Sounds like Natsume's Book of Friends? Yes I can see some of its vibes here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-wise, we are treated to a somewhat-cliche group. The ever-naive Yuzu who occasionally offers advice beyond her years (and subsequently surprise her peers and customers), the rambunctious tomboy Natsume and her fellow interest Ren who acts ladylike, the younger sister walking in her sibling's shadow (Satsuki), and free-spirited Sakura. While this set of characters may seem all too familiar, and their interactions cliched, their antics still tug at your heart. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a slice-of-life series, seeing \"cute girls doing cute things\", while having a Natsume's Book of Friends vibe, this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "Do you like fox girls? Do you like yuri? Do you like heartwarming mythological moments? Then Konohana Kitan is for you! Konohana Kitan excels very well at two things: making appealing yuri scenes between the fox girls and providing heartwarming moments with interesting takes relating to Japanese folklore. And on those two merits, the show is able to succeed. \r\nThe show seems to be divided between two different sections: moments that build up the character\u2019s relationships to each other and moments that are more concerned with telling fantastical stories that attempt to warm up the heart. And while the show is able to succeed ateach part individually when put together there is something a bit lacking. Take the fantastical folklore episodes, while there are many episodes that are not only able to use folklore to tell a compelling and unique story but also manage to be heartwarming and genuinely surprising. Separated from the rest of the work, they stand out as particularly strong episodes that do a good job of making one feel a greater connection with the world around them. It\u2019s amazing what they are able to do with old stories of folklore to talk about the human condition and give hope to those that are watching. There is this sort of feeling of helplessness to what life can throw at one, but also a feeling of triumph of being able to overcome it. Whether it be a dream eating Baku or the story of a mother and her child, the show is able to make unexpected powerful moments out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when half the show is dedicated to this it does have an effect on the rest of the show. Even though they are nice to watch, they are often focused on side characters who don\u2019t have any barring on the main cast. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, especially when they are able to do it quite well, but it does lead to the character\u2019s not getting as much development as they could be.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri moments also show this problem. The moments that show the bonds between the characters are all very touching and are just so adorable and loveable. But at the same time they also often cover the same ground. Furthermore, the amount of interactions between the group is limited because the main characters are often paired to the hip to their partner. While this does make for a nice one on one bond and provides some very satisfying and noteworthy episodes, it lacks the same sense of community that other CGDCT shows are able to richly show. \\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the show tries to have more characters than it can work with. The main characters are pretty nice. They all have distinct and likeable personalities. They have enough depth to them that they are interesting but sadly there isn\u2019t enough depth to them to make them standout characters. Ren, Yuzu, Satsuki, and Natsume fall into this. They all have interesting traits and interact nicely between each other. However, the other cast members of Konohana Kitan suffer from lack of screentime or characterization. While Okiku gets some time to shine, Kiri and Sakura feel like one-note characters. They have some nice small moments but overall they feel more like afterthoughts than anything. \\n\\n\r\nNormally that isn\u2019t a problem but the combined effect of having extra filler characters and having a lot of episodes focused on side characters means the main cast doesn\u2019t get as fleshed out as they could be. Even though each of the episodes the main cast does get does a very good job of showing what drives them and what they\u2019re like it still feels a bit shallow. Like there\u2019s still more that can be dug into. I think part of this is the lack of other character interactions. When most of the character\u2019s screentime is made up of another character they tend to get forced into roles. Yuzu and Satsuki are often going to act the same way around each other. Ditto with Ren and Natsume. While those interactions are nice it ends up leaving a more static view of their characters. People are not just defined by their interactions with one person, but with all sorts of people, and all of the different ways they react to different things. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite nice and beautiful although the animation can be somewhat lackluster at times. It\u2019s clear that there are several tricks they use in order to make them needless animation. And to be fair they work overall. The chibi fox blobs are very cute. That said when it leads to as little animation as there was in episode 5, it can be quite a problem. The art style is very nice though and it\u2019s able to exude it\u2019s aesthetic very well, which is quite nice for what it has going for it. The sound also helps with this, and the mellow and relaxing tracks are able to fit in with the soul-soothing hotel that they work at. The art-style and sound both are adept at enhancing whatever feel the show is trying to go for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Konohana Kitan is a case of a story that is good in episode-sized chunks but when combined together it lacks the consistency to make it the super strong show that it could be. Even still it has really cute adorable yuri moments and really meaningful and emotional moments. And if you\u2019re into that, like I am, I highly suggest it as it\u2019ll have a lot of content that can warm one\u2019s soul and fill one\u2019s heart with sunshine. And if you\u2019re not, I still think this show is strong enough to have things to offer. While I do have my complaints and issues with the development of the show, that doesn\u2019t stop it from being an adorable blast of a show!",

            "content": "The genre of Slice of life has been so riddled with all female casts of cute girls doing cute things that each season seems to have its own version of the trope with a slight difference in its storytelling and/or setting in order to give the show some \u2018unique aspects\u2019.  These aspects are usually easy to distinguish and end up seeming gimmicky cause at the end of the day; it\u2019s still cute girls doing cute things.  But then you have Konohana Kitan, a show about cute kitsune girls doing\u2026not just cute things in their daily lives.\r\nStory:\r\nIn a world between Earth and Heaven therelays a bathhouse called Konohanatei.  In this bathhouse, guests ranging from normal people to high-ranking gods attend this bathhouse for some nice rest and relaxation from the attending staff that care for all that pass through here.  It is here where a young kitsune by the name of Yuzu steps forth in the next step of her life as part of the attendant staff, coming in contact with the various individuals that end up at this place.\\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is in a word, whimsical.  Each episode is structured as its own story based around either a story dedicated to a guest in the bathhouse, or the several attendants of Konohanatei, thus giving the show a nice blend of character and story that builds up the kind of world that\u2019s established in this midway between life and death.  While indeed the show does have some emphasis on \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 as all-female casts in this medium tend to showcase, the show is well aware of the relaxing and calm tone that it establishes and runs with it all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the stories are unique and interesting.  Based primarily around Shintoism concepts, the show really emphasizes the mystical in a very prominent way, as Yuzu\u2019s experiences with the various guests give off a sense of wonder and amazement that I\u2019ve found to be an aspect that\u2019s very refreshing.  In comparison however, the stories based around the main cast I\u2019d say aren\u2019t personally as good, but still hold their own to provide enough depth and attention to the young attendants so that they feel more like characters rather than a cardboard figure that acts as the leeway to let the story we\u2019re talking about happen.  (Looking at you, Isekai Shokudou)\\n\\n\r\nWith even pacing and a huge focus on story and expanding the world on an episode-by-episode basis, Konohana Kitan stands as a heartwarming and relaxing series with a story that entertains more than teaches.  It knows the ground that it stands on, and firmly does so with extra emphasis on trying to be good and unique rather than fall into the trap of \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019.  Yes, that still kind of does happen, but it\u2019s so few and far between that it really doesn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Well made episodic stories\\n\r\n+ Character development\\n\r\n+ Knows what it is and sticks with it\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe various attendants of Konohanatei take up I\u2019d say\u2026half of the existing episodes, with surprisingly enough, our main protagonist having the least with only one episode solely focused on her.\\n\\n\r\nAs the newest attendant of Konohanatei, Yuzu is in short, a klutz.  She\u2019s new to the job and the demands of being an attendant sort of turn her on her head because her naturally airheaded and innocent demeanor lead her to in some cases be more hindrance than helpful.  Nevertheless, the show establishes her as the main person to experience most if not all of the whimsical tales from the bathhouse\u2019s various guests, sort of making up the lack of backstory/development screentime she gets from the series.  Beyond that, her naturally optimistic and child-like wonder helps give off a positive vibe of the show, which really adds to the experience.  On her own, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s all that amazing, but when put into context, she really does enhance the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki on the other hand is the polar opposite, being more strict (and prickly) compared to her assigned partner with dreams and aspirations that reach beyond a life working in the bathhouse.  On a base level, Satsuki is a tsundere, but she does have her shining moments where she softens up from her naturally strict demeanor, becoming a well rounded character especially when factoring in the episodes dedicated to her and the backstory we\u2019re told about how she came to the bathhouse.  Personally, not my favorite character, but she has a lot of qualities that make her a respectable cast member. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Ren and Natsume.  Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of these two mostly because their connection stems from the trope of a girl swooning over the oblivious tomboy who more often than not treats her like a princess through princess carry, extreme worriment, etc etc.  They\u2019re eternally linked in this show, so much so that their episodes are \u2018their\u2019 episodes rather than a Ren or Natsume only episode.  Again, the show establishes quite a bit of depth for them so that they feel more alive, but based on personal bias alone, I just got vaguely annoyed that the show almost always dedicated their screentime together for yuribaiting.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the staff, we have Sakura, who gets no episodes to herself but is amusing and memorable in her own way, fox saber (Kiri) who is basically a really sassy and funny Artoria Pendragon with fox ears attached to her head (seriously though, the way she bundles her hair is EXACTLY LIKE THAT), and Okami, who really should get more screentime cause she\u2019s also pretty funny too.  More or less they\u2019re supplements to the \u2018main cast\u2019, but I wish they got more time to them cause at times they really stole the show.  As for the guests, there\u2019s not much to say about them without delving into spoiler material.  Just know that any given guest can take half an episode to a full episode, each of them leaving a lasting impression because more than anything, their stories on how they came to the bathhouse, what their legend or story is, and what they leave behind, give them significance that add to the overall show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Hilarious and underused side cast\\n\r\n+ Developed main cast\\n\r\n+ Memorable stories\\n\r\n-  Main cast is kinda tropeish\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Lerche, the quality of Konohana Kitan shows us that it\u2019s pretty.  It\u2019s very pretty.  It\u2019s about standard fare in terms of animation quality, but the light and airy color palette combined with a multitude of characters\u2019 stills make the show calming and visually vibrant to look at.  Not only that, but several episodes shift around the color palette and lighting of a specific episode to put emphasis on the story that\u2019s being told at the time, a nice touch that improves the whimsicality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is the show\u2019s comedic style.  Sure you get your standard comedy faces and stuff in order to have exaggerated expressions for comedy\u2019s sake, but the really amusing thing I found was, since the characters are all kitsune, rather than use normal chibis, the show straight up turns them into cat-like blob creatures that shuffle around the screen.  Yes, while it\u2019s much easier (and by extension cheaper) to animate than normal chibis, it\u2019s unique and I have honest to god never seen a \u2018chibi\u2019 this funny before.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Color palette and visual style add to the show\u2019s tone\\n\r\n+ (Personal Bias) Hilarious chibis\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nInitially going in and expecting the soundtrack to be just so moe pop song, both the show\u2019s OP and ED, \u201cKokoro ni Tsubomi\u201d and \"Haru Urara, Kimi to Sakihokoru\" exude a soft and calming beat with only the slightest push of energy in the ED to give it enough oomph to sound like a proper seiyuu song.  Personally I prefer the OP to its ED counterpart, as it more encapsulates the show\u2019s atmosphere and overall tone much better, but both are definitely worthwhile listens if you\u2019re trying to find something calming.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI totally did not just watch this show because I like kitsunes.  I swear on my good name.  While yes that is definitely one reason I was interested in the show to begin with, the other was how the show would actually present itself.  At first glance, I saw it as a bit of gamble, seeing if the \u2018kitsune girls\u2019 was going to be the show\u2019s gimmick and it was just gonna be another round of moe tropes rehashed for the umpteenth time.  And I thankfully relieved.  A couple seasons ago, I reviewed a show called \u2018Urara Meirochou\u2019, which had a somewhat similar premise with a mix of moe and mystical, which ended up being more of the former than the latter.  I\u2019d say that Konohana Kitan is that show done right, as it flips those two in importance and gives us something akin to Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou, which is a welcome sight since I very much am a fan of these lax yet magical shows.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhile not one of my most anticipated watches, Konohana Kitan was certainly a rewarding experience.  I found myself in awe at some of the stories and really would\u2019ve liked to have more, but all good things must come to an end.  Also, fox saber.  That is totally Artoria if you slapped on a pair of fox ears on her.  And she\u2019s super sassy to boot.  She is so funny; why did we not get more of her?  Also the doll.  I find it amusing how we have an established character that spends most of her screentime mounting her trusty dream pig steed.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI feel like some of the dedicated episodes for Satsuki and Ren/Natsume were unneeded.  The characters were pretty established by that point and bolstering more of what we knew was something I felt was unnecessary, especially when the latter two have their entire story dedicated to yuribaiting.  Yuribaiting is fine, but I mean come on, you can do MORE than that.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the likes of the two shows I mentioned before, Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou, then I\u2019d say that Konohana Kitan is not that far from those two.  As I\u2019ve stated many times cause I\u2019m a broken record, the show is whimsical at its core, focusing more on the stories of people and the people themselves than establishing an overarching narrative.  It\u2019s a relaxing and calm watch with only some fanservice (compared to most moe shows), and definitely seemed to have gone under the radar for a majority of the Fall 2017 season.  So if you\u2019re looking for a good show that didn\u2019t get much attention, this certainly fits the bill.",

You can expect light fanservice on this anime, very intended girl x girl relationships and very cute moments, so if you don't have anything against it, this anime will be a pleasant watch for you.\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\r\nThere isn't much story to tell, but the concept goes around an Inn that runs by foxes, if you remember Isekai Shokudou,the concept is quite similar, but instead of serving food and focusing on side characters, this anime focuses on the main lead, their relationships and how they succeed on their work... Of course with a touch of slice of life, we will have heartwarming stories and the background story of each character will be revealed within time. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this show is pretty good looking, the main characters are very beautiful with their \"moe-inducing\" cuteness. I'll also like to say that this anime reminds me of \"Amanchu!\", mostly because Yuzu and her random faces reminds me of Hikari's dumb face (and how her cuteness involves her relationship with Satsuki just as Hikari has a really good chemistry with her diving partner) also the way that the \"dumb looking foxes\" look is funny and pretty much on point for comic relief. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department of this anime is your typical set of anime girl voices... well... cute anime girl voices, it goes well for how each one of them is designed. The background OST is quite good when it comes to scenes that requires a really smooth soundtrack, be it sad, heartwarming or comic relief, it manages to hit me everytime. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, well we have Tsundere, Loli, Dumbass, Possesive, eh... boy looking girl?, the lead and the big wolf chief. Might sound a bit generic, but even if it is, their development is what makes this show what it is: Heartwarming, oh yeah and they can also be funny and cute, so there is variety here, if you want to have diabetes, you came to the right place. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI've gotta say, I didn't expect to like this quite as much as I watched 4 episodes straight. And I'll probably end loving it even more the more I watch it, having a weekly doses of cuteness can't be bad for your heart 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7,4(7)/10: A cute girls doing cute stuff, now with foxes, very heartwarming, and cute foxes and diabetes inducing foxes and cute foxes... did I already state that the foxes are cute?",

            "content": "It's a SoL, it's for people who love Shoujo Ai CGDCT stuff, it's a feel-good show, but what it does, it not ONLY does great justice to it, but rather it propels it towards excellence at its finest, and is indeed one of the best shows of Fall 2017.\r\nStory:\r\nYuzu, a fox girl, and a newcomer towards Konohanatei, learns to adjust from her previous life living in the woods, and immersing around with the Konohanatei crew of fox girls. Being the most innocent, clumsy and able to get lost very easily, her personality brings the charm towards the other characters (which I'll discuss in the Charactersection) and the vastly beautiful world around her as she bonds with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I've gotta say that the premise is set really well, for the story is the layer of the cake towards the icing (which are the characters themselves), and the blending of the both could not be any better, and although the manga source is on hiatus, I'm honestly glad the anime adaptation doesn't withdraw from the fact to build upon the greatness of the manga and making the show look as lush as possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAbsolutely, the strongest point of Konohana Kitan is it's characters and their development and involvement towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nNewcomer Yuzu, voiced by new seiyuu Yuuko Ono (Jun from Tenshi no 3P) is a delight to watch, though my minor gripe is that she's one of the main characters, yet the show plainly forces her in the limelight when she shouldn't have. The innocent, plain looking young fox girl always gets into trouble, though she quickly learns with a heart of gold, and preaches her understanding in a way that doesn't offend the other party in a very peaceful manner.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki mainly acts as Yuzu's caretaker since her arrival on Day 1, but her actions towards Yuzu may be harsh, but in a good way of a Senpai looking out for her junior, treating her both as a fellow attendant, and a friend.\\n\\n\r\nSakura is downright creepy when you take a look at her at first glance, but then as the series progresses you will realize that she is nothing that we know of, until the arrival of the doll and the pig, to which she is aggressive towards them, but not to worry, we know she has a kind heart (from within).\\n\\n\r\nRen is the typical yuri mess, knowing that her love for tomboy Natsume goes through the roof, and at times, like Yuzu, will mess up, in the name of love (or in front of Natsume), but other than that, she still serves diligently as another attendant at Konohanatei.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, being a tomboy, is fearless, and always shields the others when danger, whether minor or major happens and earns the reputation of the capable attendant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters and the VAs supporting them have done a tremendous job at keeping their intensity at being fair and fresh, and props especially to Yuzu's VA for an excellent job well done immersing in the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nVeteran studio Lerche, being capable of their production values, has descended unto us a beautiful and gorgeous show that ties in with the human-spirit interconnection and the folklore settings that blend so well together. You can definitely see it in most places, and the always funny chibi fox feels always never ceases to humor me, that by the end of the episodes it feels like a moment of time has passed, and always left wanting for more. Props to studio Lerche for another adaptation that has done exceptionally with lush colour and details galore.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother strong point for the show is at its slow but nice and immersive OST and BGM. The nice, refreshing tinkles and tingles of the OP and various EDs along with the BGM just elevates the experience of watching this show. Another area to sing praises of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is the equivalent of Winter 2017's Urara Meirochou, but presented better in every way possible. The lush visuals, the nice sounds, what more could you want from a CGDCT and Shoujo Ai series that leaves you wanting for more? Love this series as a whole as it serves the break you might need if you're invested in this show. Watch it if you can, it's great fun!",

            "content": "==============\r\nWORDS OF GRATITUDE\r\n==============\r\nIt's pretty rare for me to love a series this much! This is definitely my Anime of the Year 2017. I love this series so much and I am so glad I decided to pick it up. Thank you the staff behind Konohana Kitan. Thank you Amano Sakuya sensei. Thank you everyone who supported this show. I am really grateful to all of you. It has been a wonderful ride that I won't easily forget in the near future. I hope down in the bottom of my heart for the Blu-Ray sales of this anime to reach the staff's expectations and further moreto exceed it. I also wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. After all those gratitude, let's hop into my review for the MASTERPIECE that goes by the name of \"Konohana Kitan\", a real hidden gem that has yet to be discovered by the anime community. \\n\\n\r\n=====\\n\r\nREVIEW\\n\r\n=====\\n\\n\r\nIt is not often I find a moe anime that entertained me this much. Konohana Kitan tells a tale of our main characters working in a hot spring inn. Yes, tale. It isn't your normal moe working anime such as New Game, or even serious anime like Sakura Quest. Konohana Kitan is presented in an episodic way, in which each episode tells you a short heartwarming tale, sometimes it can be about family and sometime it can be about friendship. \\n\\n\r\nNow one misconception people have with this anime is that it is just a pure Shoujo-Ai/Soft-Yuri anime and I would like to say...yes this is a Shoujo-Ai anime, and it isn't your typical moe Shoujo-Ai out there where fans keeps on shipping two characters together, in this anime the ship actually sails. It's very clear which character will end up with which character after a few episodes in. However, it isn't just the Shoujo-Ai that stands out, it's also how the story in each episode is told. \\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, each episode tells you a short heartwarming tale. The story in each episode is very relatable. Sometimes, they will dedicate an entire episode to focus on telling you more about the characters and further developing their romantic relationship, in which makes you like them even more.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, each character in this anime is cute and fun to watch. Moreover, they are also well developed and likable. Personally, there isn't any character in this series that I hate/dislike, every character to me has their own charm and are well fleshed out. Although at first glance you might think that this is your typical moe character you can see every season, but trust me, they are more than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is soothing and relaxing. The opening sequence is based on how the workers of a hot spring inn start their work. The staff actually did research to make the opening sequence more realistic and relatable. The ending theme is also pretty heartwarming. Background music used in each scene brings out the heartwarming nature of this anime even more. \\n\\n\r\nThe part that surprised me the most is the art and animation, especially the background art. It's outstanding. I never thought I would want to praise the background team this much but they seriously did their job perfectly, Each background is so carefully and seriously drawn until it's hard to find flaws in them. The animation, especially when there is sakura petals flying around, is beautifully animated. Such a gorgeous animation coming from Lerche, just wow!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy watching this anime very much! This is a masterpiece in my opinion. Nothing beats the day I can sit down and enjoy myself watching this series. If you are a fan of moe anime or you just want a comfy heartwarming anime to watch, then do yourself a favor and watch Konohana Kitan. I bet you won't ever be disappointed cause I surely didn't.",

            "content": "This series sure came out of nowhere. \r\nWhen I first saw it on MAL I barely even glanced at it, I thought it was just going to be a generic Cute Girls Doing Cute Things anime, but my god is it heartwarming. \r\nKonohana Kitan is an episodic slice of life story about these fox girls that work at Konohanatei, a hot springs for the gods. It seems to exist between life and death, though it's never fully explained. There's a lot in this series that's not fully explained, but because of its nature I think fully explaining things would ruin it a little. \r\nSince theattendants at Konohanatei consistently serve Japanese kami, a lot of the plot lines involve Japanese legends. It gives off a similar vibe to Spirited Away, though in a more human-like modern anime style. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few backstories that could be fleshed out, like I'm really curious about Yuzu's past, and Ren, Satsuki, and Okiku definitely get more character development than the rest of them, but it's just so good, it made me smile, it was heartwarming, it was sad at times, it was funny, it was cute, watch this series I want it to get a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nIt is worth noting that it aired on the same day as Urahara, so my opinion might have been inflated, though I did wait until the next day to watch the final episode and it's still just as good when not sitting next to the dumpster.",

            "content": "I strongly recommend you to watch \"Konohana Kitan,\" especially those who are interested in \"yuri\" culture but still hesitating to get involved with it.\r\nI know some of you avoid \"yuri\" culture, saying 'I'm not interested in it,' or, 'I don't know well what is yuri.'\r\nTrue, \"yuri\" culture is a one which is not well-recognized also in Japan. It is often misunderstood. Furthermore, even among \"yuri\" culture fans there are some conflicts over the definition of the term \"yuri.\" Some says that \"yuri\" is equal to a term \"girls' love\" or \"lez (shorten form of lesbians).\" On the other hands, others argue a word \"yuri\" focuseson spirituality of girls and therefore sometimes includes friendship while sometimes excludes \"girls' love.\" It is a confusing problem, so I won't talk about it here.\\n\r\nWhat is sure is, although there are some groups in \"yuri\" culture, all of them admit that \"Konohana Kitan\" is a genuine \"yuri\" work.\\n\\n\r\n\"Konohana Kitan\" is about bit-strange lives in a Japanese hotel (actually 'Kitan' stands for 'a strange story,' but in this title a Chinese character of 'ki' is different from that in usual use.) A protagonist, Yuzu, is a new face of nakai (waitress.) She spends a bit odd but calm days there with her colleagues.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of this work is to express growing relationships between a few pairs of couples: Yuzu and Satsuki, Natsume and Ren, and Sakura and Kiri. \\n\r\nThese three couples are all \"yuri,\" that is true, but they are different from each other, and that's why I recommend beginners to watch \"Konohana Kitan\" first, for by doing so you can understand the framework of \"yuri.\"\\n\r\nThe first couple, Yuzu and Satsuki' s relationship is a typical one, I mean, it is popular in \"yuri\" culture. One is an innocent, gentle girl and friendly to anyone, while the other is strict but actually kind. In such cases the strict one has often already noticed actual feelings of oneself towards the innocent one. In this specific case, thanks to Yuzu's effort and personalities, Satsuki, the strict and stubborn one, gradually opens her mind towards Yuzu. \"Konohana Kitan\" precisely describes the change of Satsuki's attitude towards Yuzu throughout  a episode and the series, which is highly reputed among \"yuri\" culture fan, included me.\\n\r\nThe second pair, Natsuki and Ren, is a little easier to grasp, for a girl is obviously in love with the other. A boyish one seems to be childish, not to understand girls' emotions. The girlish one sometimes gets angry to the other, but in the end she again falls in love to the other. This  structure is similar to that of shoujo manga, so you might get to be familiar with this relationship sooner. Of course, this relationship is also \"yuri.\" A bit complicated?\\n\r\nThe last one, Sakura and Kiri, is a so-called 'oneloli' couple, I suppose. Why I cannot declare is that it is a bit far from the mainstream of 'oneloli' today. 'One (not a number!)' is a shorten form of 'oneesan (=an elder sister, an elder woman),' and 'loli' means, you know, 'a girl, especially an elementary school student.' This relationship focuses on <mothership,> a personality of being mother or an elder woman, and on traits of really a young child. It is different from the relationship of real mother and daughter, so please be careful. Kiri is just a mature woman, and Sakura is just a child, which is the epitome of 'oneloli.' This is a difficult couple to understand, but you might gradually get familiar with it.\\n\r\nAs above, each couple has its own features. What is excellent is that \"Konohana Kitan\" has succeeded to describe all the features of each couple. It is not an easy task; rather, a tough challenge. The creator of the original work understand \"yuri\" culture deeply and also anime staff makes effort to reproduce the atmosphere the original has. The very fruit of such works is the anime series of \"Konohana Kitan.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnime staffs have really tried hard to reconstruct the original. Character designs are almost the same to those of the original manga. They also focus on background arts: using CG carefully, they makes backgrounds full with Japanese traditional sense, such as washitsu, a Japanese garden and so on.\\n\r\nJapanese cultures are also found in many parts: \"Konohana Kitan\" pays attention to the change of four seasons, and express it with plots, backgrounds, and detailed BGMs. \"Konohana Kitan\" carefully describes a tiny tiny transition of girls' delicate emotions with sophisticated aura which is created by each element.\\n\r\nTotally, \"Konohana Kitan\" is also a quality-guaranteed anime. This is also a reason why I would like you to see it.\\n\\n\r\nI want to stress that \"yuri\" is not a merely \"girls' love,\" not even friendships between girls. In Japan there are an amount of \"yuri\" manga whose protagonists are matured women (mainly 20~29 years old.)  This fact implies that \"yuri\" is not so strongly connected with ages. I know this fact may confuse you. Such difficulties are causes of avoidance. However, I also feel that it is plenty numbers of sub-categories that have been promoting today's growth of \"yuri\" culture. I hope you comes in contact with \"yuri\" culture by watching \"Konohana Kitan.\" It is only you who know the answer to this question: 'what is a funny point of \"yuri\" cultures?'  It's time for you to search for your own answer.",

Konohanatei is a example of a well made anime and the story is simple abut it comes full circle and feels complete. There are some slower moments but when you are bombarded with so pretty visuals you just can't stop staring at them. There are also a ton of Japanese culture references from traditions to gods and spiritsthat it is amazing and they are woven into the story neatly. Characters are \u00fbber cute and very moe but tone is light that it could appeal to people who might not like moe-animes. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is sugar coated candy with so pretty exterior and with very lighthearted and culturally packed center that it almost eats your teeth away. This is a must for kemono-girl and moe fans. I give it 8,5/10 Rounded to 9/10. \\n\r\nWarming and kind, perfect with cold weather just like hot cocoa.",

            "content": "I went into Konohana Kitan expecting another typical all girl cast sol show in the likes of \"Hinako Note\", \"Gabriel Dropout\", \"Urara Meirochou\",\"Kiniro Moasic\"...etc. But do you see me writing a review for those? No. So why am I writing this?\r\nStory (9): The series is a collection of short stories that happens at Konohana; a high class traditional hotel in a world of Japanese/Eastern mythology. Each episode consists of two stories pertaining to either the main cast or one of the eccentric guest(s). The story takes full advantage of the setting and excels in the \"show not tell\" principle. \r\nArt (9): I went in expectingthis anime to cut corners in animation/art, I was willing to give it some slack thinking they probably had a smaller budget compared to other animes. But wow... I was blown away immediately by just the still shots in the op (beautiful water effects in one particular shot). The background sets are great looking throughout, rain effects are well done, the show is filled with interesting characters, and designs of the main characters are also solid. The creative use of colour is at the next level compared to your average anime.\\n\r\nSound (8): Great intro that sets the mood. The bgm is noticeably good and sound effects are done just as well as any other anime. The VAs all do a decent enough job, no complaints. They switch up the ed quite frequently and it's refreshing. Overall the music isn't exactly too memorable but imo it's above average.\\n\r\nCharacter (8): Character driven shows like this one need to have good characters. Does it have good characters? Yes. Does it have great characters? No. Everyone was likeable and unique but none of them was really outstanding. Most of them have typical character tropes seen plenty of times before. What's making me give an 8 is when they come together, the pairings plays well off of each other and everyone gets a chance in the spotlight. Not to mention the world they live in is filled with amusing mythological beings.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): I personally found this much more enjoyable than the other recent sols previously mentioned. The vast majority of jokes lands or are at least chuckle worthy. The show seamlessly transports you into this world they've established, allowing you to forget about the shitter real one for its duration. I should also mention how this anime excels in both establishing and changing the mood. Don't be surprised by the occasional ride on an emotional rollercoaster. \\n\r\nOverall (8): So why does this deserve a review? Because compared to other sols this one truly stands out. Konohana Kitan isn't primarily driven by the need to make a joke at the end like every other sol. The true driving force here is the desire to tell a story. This fundamental difference  makes Konohana Kitan unique, refreshing and worthy of taking the time to write a review on.",

            "content": "Last season of anime had some really relaxing series Girls Last Tour, Children of the Whales and even Love Live! Sunshine Season 2, to name the few I watched.  All of these shows were created to make a person relax and reflect on life. One anime in particular which did this particularly well for me was Konohana Kitan. \r\nStory \u2013 8/10\r\nIf you were to ask anybody who happened to watch Konohana Kitan to describe the show in a single word; most would say \u2018charming\u2019. Which is completely accurate as the entirety of Konohana Kitan\u2019s plot is written to make you smile at the sweetnesstranspiring on screen, and during some episodes even lead to a few heartfelt tears.  The story of Konohana Kitan revolves around the young kitsune Yuzu who has just started working at a inn called Konohanatei. There people; animals and creatures of supernatural origin gather for some rest and relaxation, which make for some hilarious and at times heartwarming interactions. Every episode revolves around either developing the core group of Yuzu, Satsuki, Natsume, Ren, Sakura, Kiri and Okami or assisting a guest with his/her problem.  Whether it is the later or the former there wasn\u2019t a single episode which I found boring and in some cases \u2013 like the episode with the old lady \u2013 the simple but heart-warming plot lead to me crying for a few minutes on end, because of the relatable experiences these people experienced.  Themes like loss, abandonment, guilt and friendship are explored within the anime and just warm your heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI believe studio Lerche did an excellent job animating Konohana Kitan. From the beautiful landscapes filled with vibrant colours, to the bustling city beneath Konohanatei filled with a large variety of life, the world was beautifully animated like a world out of a dream. Because of the beauty of the world it really helped build an atmosphere which you could simply escape towards, overall helping to build on the setting which the story wanted to portray. If there is an anime out there which could achieve the same effect from watching the anime, it has to be Non Non Biyori, another anime which has mastered the art of creating a world which allows the viewer to simply relax. Another thing which the original creator did to help build on the sweet and relaxing setting are the character designs which are downright adorable and perfectly complements the setting.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack worked really well with the series. Once again the creators managed to incorporate another aspect of the anime to fully take advantage of the atmosphere they wanted the viewers to experience.  The OST is designed to make you feel warm and relaxed, with its gentle melodies which are extremely pleasant to listen to. I love the opening and both endings of the series, because they have such a gentle tone which works to well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nYuzu is the embodiment of cuteness and sweetness. Together with Satsuki she is just on an adorable scale out of this world. But a cute aura isn\u2019t the only thing which makes Yuzu a great character. She is equally part a realistic character and a relatable one. Throughout the run of the anime she grows from a timid child to a Onee-sama like character who everybody adores. Satsuki on the other hand you really happen to feel for as her dreams are shattered a young age, leaving her scarred. It was too cute to behold to see all the couples in the anime unintentionally \u2013 and sometimes intentionally \u2013 with each other. All the couples are done in such a way that they make up for each other\u2019s short comings and perfectly complement each other. Natsume is Ren\u2019s prince and Yuzu Satsuki\u2019s support. All of the guests introduced in the series were all interesting in their own right and it was an absolute joy to learn more about them and the central characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is exactly the type of show which I would want to see more of. More shows that focus on creating a magical world of wonder, filled with characters all colorful and unique in their own right. Watching a simple slice of life about girls living their life and dealing with life\u2019s problems  is something which not should not only be found within the anime industry but all forms of media.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are feeling down and depressed from life or simply playing Nier: Automata; Konohana Kitan is the show for you. It is an anime designed to sooth the soul of those watching it and can be watched by anybody regardless of what genre\u2019s you are into. With a heart-warming story, art style, soundtrack and characters why would you need any other reason to watch this fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

But still turned out pretty good.\r\nLike i still enjoyed the anime overall, it has a satisfying ending, as throughout the anime, it goes through everyone's backstory which very interesting, as some anime only focuses theMC. \\n\r\nOverall good anime, if you prefer something balance and relaxing to watch something similar to Natsume, where there's no drastic ending or end hanger, than you'll like it, especially if you don't mind a bit of Shoujo-Ai (Extremely light ver. of Yuri)",

            "content": "As you walk in to the beautiful wooden building, finally at the end of your journey. Your weary feet aching for a relaxing bath, and a slight hunger is tugging at the back of your conscience. You look ahead and notice a tiny figure walking towards you, the silhouette has two triangle shapes at the top and long flowing hair waving back and forth with her every step.\r\nThe girl is now right next to you, and you can see her clearly. It's one of the attendants of this inn, but also a fox complete with fangs, tail and tiny ears on top of her headcovered with wheat coloured hair. Before you can speak a single word the fox-girl bows politely and exclaims: 'Welcome to Konohanatei!'.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully that beginning paragraph gave you a bit of an idea of what to expect from Konohana Kitan. And if not then maybe I can give you a better idea in the following paragraphs.\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is an anime all about the inn Konohanatei, its attendants and its godly and mythical guests. It could have easily been yet another throwaway slice-of-life show focusing on a group of cute girls, but luckily good direction and artistic sense go a long way to help the show stand out. The slow and laid-back attitude of the anime combined with the at times breathtaking shots and sounds create the perfect atmosphere in which you truly feel like you're a guest at the inn too, enjoying your limited time there while making wonderful memories.\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as you look at the poster of the show you may notice how bright the show is. It's vibrant and colourful, giving you the impression of seeing the world through the ever-upbeat main character Yuzu's eyes. Just like her you will experience everything the world has to offer for the first time. Yuzu, like the viewer, grows up raised by a human and has to learn the ways of the gods and those of the attendants from scratch. It's a journey through which the anime takes great care to lead us.\\n\r\nThere's many character moments between each of the girls and slowly we get to know them and their relationships with each other. One wants to become a priestess, the other has a hopeless romance with her childhood friend, and another is a cursed doll that's never had the joy of being played with. Being that the anime is only twelve episodes and the manga is still ongoing we don't get thorough explorations of everyone, but what we do get is enough to make me attached to these girls. By the end of the anime, I felt, like Yuzu that they were my friends. Konohanatei had turned from the rest stop at the end of my journey, into a second home.\\n\r\nIt's not just the girls that we get to know, the show is mostly centred around having various guests at Konohanatei and having Yuzu and the other girls more or less soothe or alleviate their problems. In fact I'd say that it's the guests that are the absolute highlights of the show and bring the best out in the direction and art.\\n\r\nIn episode five there's a part where Yuzu takes a slow walk through the garden, umbrella in hand for it is raining. The rain clouds darkened the sun and so the entire scenery is black and white except for  the brilliant midnight blue flowers surrounding Yuzu, and Yuzu's umbrella. The sound of the rain is accompanied by the slow plucking of an acoustic guitar and the clattering sounds of someone weaving on a loom.\\n\r\nThe combined beauty of all those elements completely sold me on the anime and now here I am, gushing about it to you, dear reader.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show there's many little moments like this interwoven with the usual comedy befitting a slice-of-life show. Bittersweet moments that give each character a bit of background and personality. From a retired god of battle using his old katana to create a toy for a child to an old lady carefully crafting a yukata for her daughter every moment feels like it has weight, a fleeting moment in a person's life that you get to experience alongside them.\\n\r\nThe comedic moments that come to complement the more melancholic scenes are non-disruptive. They're quite often loud and involve quite a bit of slapstick, but it feels natural. They're not here to make you laugh out loud either; they're here to relieve a little bit of the sadness.\\n\\n\r\nThe third part of the show, closely tied to the comedic side is the rather downplayed, but often brought up romantic element of the show. Almost immediately you'll be able to see couples forming in the show between the girls and the show does provide some adorable and heart-warming moments for the couples, but it never explicitly does anything. Don't expect anything like a kiss, the most you're going to get is a little bit of hand-holding. But is this necessarily a bad thing? I think not. I think it fits with the rest of the show that the romance is not explicit, that all we get are warm gestures of love, but never get to see the fruits of those gestures. In a way, it makes the viewer appreciate these little moments more putting an emphasis on the journey rather than the destination. We already know that both parties love each other, but how they show little bits of their affection during their daily lives that is what we don't know. And the anime is more than happy to show us.\\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is the kind of show that doesn't pull or try to aggressively grab your attention every moment it can. It knows how to take its time and let the viewer be taken in by the scenery, characters or sounds. Like a proper inn attendant it only suggests things to you, and never outright orders you around lest it be rude and improper.\\n\r\nIf you want a laid-back and relaxed anime experience where you can take in all the sights and let yourself be charmed by a world of subtle magic and gods then Konohana Kitan is a great show to watch. Let yourself slip into the world it builds and enjoy your time at Konohanatei.\\n\\n\r\nAs you leave through the same old door you came in you look back one last time at the tall old inn that and at the attendants that have shown you so much hospitality. Everyone is here now seeing to your departure, seven heads with ears on them, seven tails and one little well-dressed doll. You take a deep breath of the crisp autumn air and wave one last goodbye to these wonderful people.\\n\r\nAfter taking a few steps, from behind you you hear the staff's last words to you: 'We hope you enjoyed your time at Konohanatei! Please come again!'\\n\r\nYou walk on, knowing you have still have a long road ahead of you.",

It was a pretty cute anime and sometimes it seems kind of boring and slow, but at the end of the day is nice. the art and animations was very good in a simple manner but nothing to stand out and at times it didn't seem constant. I honestly couldn't like the characters or their voices, they seem weirdto me, which made harder to watch the anime. I personally didn't love it nor hate it the anime and I cannot say I enjoy it to some extent. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch it if you are into moe anime and want to know some tales from Japan, but be aware that it has a slow pace. \\n\\n\r\n\u2510(\uff9f\uff5e\uff9f)\u250c",

He was watching with three other people, all of whom love kemonomimi, and they weren't enjoying the series as much as they could.  I, however, watched the show in spite of it being kemonomimi when I don't like the fetish of anthromorphic characters and watched it just because it's a Slice of Life... but I enjoyed it far more than the other three... Why?\r\nThis show is not character based, it's setting based.  Unlikemost SoLs, this has only a little to do with character interactions and more to do with Japanese mythology.  The characters frequently tend to gods and goddesses, and interact with them, as well as ghosts, apparitions, and other similar types of characters.  This fact has to be interesting to the viewer to truly enjoy this show.  So I highly recommend this show to fans of Touhou.",

As is with these episodic shows there's mild inconsistency, but Konohana Kitan is at worst \"just\" a fluffy show which is easily forgiven when its peaks are extremely high.\r\nFor a cute girls doing cute things, Konohana Kitan has captivating and fairly unique art direction and surprisingly clever writing, although itrelies fairly heavily on knowledge of Japanese folklore and deities, which might go over the head of foreign watchers. Its twists and reveals are intelligent and work very well with a wide and entertaining character cast bouncing off each other in an organic way.

            "content": "Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching Konohana Kitan and while care has been taken to minimise spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned. \r\nBased off a well-known manga of the same name Konohana Kitan gives us the opportunity to see what the life and duties of a team of fox girls would be if they decided to operate a traditional hot spring inn in an setting reminiscent of ancient Japan that\u2019s mixed with a fantasy world  The first episode of the series really did an excellent job of introducingme to a world where all sorts of races exist and live alongside each other and left a pretty good impression on me enough that I decided to stick with it and im glad that I did.  \\n\\n\r\nTaking place in a fantasy world that combines the traditional culture of ancient Japan with the fantasy world is a world that is populated by all sorts of races and creatures each of which has their own cultures and mannerisms. Here humans are but one race that exists in harmony with many other races that live in the world. The overall story follows the adventures of Yuzu a young fox girl that until now has been living with her master and guardian on the outskirts of the city and follows her exploits as she joins the staff of the Konohantei a large and popular hot spring inn that serves as the city\u2019s main flagship hotel that has a well-earned reputation of being able to provide its guests with attentive service and solutions for problems that bother them. As Yuzu joins the inn\u2019s staff to work as an attendant she will be joining a number of interesting characters that include the workaholic and serious-minded Satsuki, the elegant and refined Ren, the tomboyish but considerate Natsume, the quiet but helpful Sakura and the relaxed but intelligent head attendant Kiri. Working together with such a colourful cast and at such a relaxing hotel Yuzu would soon learn that providing rooms and helping with the needs of the hotel\u2019s guests is only half of their duties and a true attendant also works to ensure that any problems that they are bothered with are dealt with and ensure that they can enjoy their time here to the fullest.   \\n\\n\r\nYuzu \\n\\n\r\nYuzu voiced by new seiyuu Yuuko Oono is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A fox girl that had until the start of the series had lived her whole life with her master Yuzu is an innocent, eager and polite young girl that\u2019s also positive and cheerful. In the beginning of the series Yuzu was a happy and go lucky girl that while a bit na\u00efve made up for it by being eager to help others in their duties. Though an energetic girl she was also clumsy and in the beginning caused no small amount of trouble for her co-workers but instead of letting that affect her Yuzu did what she proves to be able to do the best which is bounce back. While dismayed at first that her master will be leaving her to work at such a strange place Yuzu as the series goes on comes to understand the reasons behind her master\u2019s decision and comes to love working at the inn. While having no real skills in the beginning Yuzu in an effort to not bother others shows one of her more prominent traits which is that of her diligence as she works hard to both support her fellow attendants and learn how to improve her skills so as not to slow them down. This willingness to learn new skills to help her friends so as to not affect their duties is one of the traits that truly define her. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as Yuzu comes to understand the roles of an attendant more it can be seen that Yuzu starts to develop a fondness for working at the inn. This is because it allows her to not just work to improve her skills but also in allowing her to meet many new characters and situations that she can learn from and thus give her a purpose. Though surprised at first that being an attendant also involves listening to the problems that the guests are troubled with as the series goes on it can be seen that Yuzu is a very kind and caring person by nature that cares a great deal about the guests and their circumstances and she will try her utmost to understand the problems that they are burdened with. While respectful towards the guests and knowing that sometimes it can be hard for them to say what troubles them to strangers Yuzu would often go to great lengths to try and understand and figure out the problems which often results in the guests eventually letting up and tell her. While knowing the limits of her knowledge Yuzu nonetheless tries her best to offer her insights into the problems that were expressed and come up with a solution that is often a surprisingly well thought one. The character of Yuzu I felt was an interesting and well-designed one that had some pretty good development as the series went on. Seeing her develop from the naive, eager and clumsy young fox girl into a kind, caring and considerate young fox girl that was as adept at work as she was at listening to and understanding guest\u2019s problems I felt was one of the best things about her character. I felt that her seiyuu Yuuko Oono really did an impressive job at voicing the character of Yuzu. \\n\\n\r\nSakura \\n\\n\r\nSakura voiced by veteran seiyuu Ai Kakuma of Brave Witches and Asterisk Wars fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the Konohanatei hot spring inn. A quiet, innocent and carefree member of the attendant staff Sakura despite being the youngest of the inn\u2019s staff is a veteran attendant that has been working at the inn for some time. While polite and helpful towards both guests and fellow attendants it can be seen that Sakura is someone that is slow to trust others and seems wary of outsiders that enter into the close family that is the inn\u2019s staff of attendants. However, as the series progresses it can be seen that Sakura once she has determined that the new member was someone that was trustworthy would gradually open up her personality to them and eagerly try to bond with them. While a quiet girl Sakura has been shown to be very loyal to her fellow attendants and friends and while she doesn\u2019t speak much she will let her actions speak for herself. As it is I felt that the character of Sakura was an interesting character that emphases on the quiet but cautious member of the inn\u2019s attendants, but I felt that she would have been better if she had more voice lines for her seiyuu. Still, I feel that wordless interactions with the others certainly had its moments that were appreciated such as her hostile relationship with Okiku. \\n\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki \\n\\n\r\nSatsuki voiced by new seiyuu Sawako Hata is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the Konohanatei hot springs inn. A serious-minded, dutiful and hard-working member of the inn\u2019s attendant staff Satsuki is a veteran member of the attendant staff and well versed in dealing with the types of guests that stay at the inn. While hardworking and dutiful and trusted greatly by the other members of the team in the beginning of the series it can be seen that Satsuki\u2019s, attitude was rather aloof and quiet and seemed to be wary of working as a team with others. Moreover, her serious-minded and workaholic nature also meant that she often clashed with the more laid-back members of the team such as Kiri and Natsume. Despite this Satsuki\u2019s experience of dealing with guests and ability to react to sudden situations is something that is valued greatly by the rest of the team and it can be seen that when she\u2019s directing others to their duties that she imparts a sense of purpose and order to them when doing so. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series goes on and as we see her interact more with the cast and with Yuzu, in particular, it can be seen that she is burdened with a great deal of responsibility that has the effect of driving her to do her best in her work. In the beginning of the series, Satsuki was someone that treated her work as an attendant with the utmost importance pursuing it relentlessly and never taking any time off for herself even for festivals. As a result of this Satsuki when she had time off was someone that looked somewhat lost when she had nothing to do which I felt was kinda sad considering her age. The main cause of this was her desire to show her sister that took her dream role from her that even in another role she can still do an excellent job. A direct consequence of this desire, however, is the pressure that she imparts on herself as she is afraid of making mistakes and cause troubles to others. As the series goes on and after meeting Yuzu and interacting with her Satsuki\u2019s personality starts to gradually change. While she still remains hardworking and serious it can be seen that she\u2019s also willing to interact more with the rest of the team on a more personal level and no longer keeps a distance from the others. In particular Satsuki gradually learns to rely on the other members of the team and place her trust in them rather than try to do everything on her own. The character of Satsuki I felt was an interesting character and one that was both well designed and saw a great deal of development as the series went on. In particular, I really liked the interaction that Satsuki actually had with Yuzu and the changes that she caused to develop in Satsuki\u2019s personality. All in all, I felt that her seiyuu Sawako Hata really did an excellent job of portraying the character of Satsuki. \\n\\n\r\nRen \\n\\n\r\nRen voiced by new seiyuu Risa Kubota in her first role as a seiyuu is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the inn. An elegant, kind and understanding person Ren like Satsuki is a veteran member of the attendant\u2019s team. Outwardly Ren is a positive, hardworking and the very image of someone that\u2019s both self-confident in her skills as an attendant as she is in her physical appearance. As a result of this self-confident nature of hers Ren is someone that has great pride in her abilities and skills as a host and in the beginning her attitude can often be seen as arrogant and haughty as she takes everything seriously. However, beneath this surface personality, it can be seen that Ren is actually a very fair person and doesn\u2019t like to be in debt to others or let them take the blame for her mistakes. While kind and positive it can be seen that Ren also has a cynical side to her as well best seen in her first interactions with Yuzu. This side of her however gradually disappears as the series goes on as a result of her deepening friendship with her. A prominent trait of Ren that I find interesting is her ability to switch from one expression to another quite literally a trait that not even Satsuki is able to accomplish. This I feel is an indication of both Ren\u2019s skill as an attendant as well as her personality which is adaptive of different situations. \\n\\n\r\nAs the series progresses and more of Ren\u2019s personality is revealed it can be seen that Ren is someone whose inner personality somewhat contrasts with her outer personality. Outwardly Ren is someone that takes great pride in her physical appearance and believes that it\u2019s the duty of all girls to look pretty and presentable to others. However, within her inner personality it can be seen that this holds a far greater meaning within her as inwardly Ren believes that if she wasn\u2019t dressed up she wouldn\u2019t be able to display the confident and efficient self that she shows to others meaning that in a way it\u2019s her pride and dressing up nicely that actually makes her the person that she is to others. An interesting aspect of Ren is her close relationship with her fellow attendant and childhood friend Natsume. Although they are co-workers and have been working together enough in that they know each other\u2019s habits as well as weaknesses it can be seen that their relationship goes beyond that of simple friends as Ren seems to be extremely conscious of her performance and mannerisms when in front of her. The interactions between these two I felt though were actually really cute especially when Ren is remarked by Natsume to be cute as Ren is someone that wants to be seen as classy and efficient rather than being cute. Overall, I felt that the character of Ren was a well designed and developed one that while haughty and proud on the outside is also unexpectedly nice and forgiving in the inside a contrast that I felt suits her nicely. For her first performance as a seiyuu, I felt that Risa Kubota really did an excellent job in her portrayal of Ren.  \\n\\n\r\nKiri \\n\\n\r\nKiri voiced by veteran seiyuu Manami Namakura of Aoki Hagane no arpeggio and Unlimited Fafnir fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the inn. A calm, composed and elegant fox girl Kiri serves as the inn\u2019s head attendant and as a result is the commander of the team of attendants that work at the inn. While Kiri can appear to be a rather laid-back person it can be seen however that Kiri is a perceptive and understanding person that as a result of her extensive experience is someone that\u2019s kind and understanding and able to offer a great deal of advice and opinions to her subordinates and guests and as a result is well respected by both. Though the duties of a head attendant are a busy one it can be seen that Kiri is someone that trusts each of the girls massively and is willing to let them try and solve problems that guests may be burdened with but at the same time willing to protect them if things turn out sideways. While Kiri\u2019s assignment of attendants may appear random at times it can be seen that this choice is actually based on her analysis and understanding of each of the skills of her team as well as their personalities and thus allowing her to deal with any flare-ups that happen quite easily. While Kiri\u2019s personality may appear to be teasing at times it can be seen that she\u2019s always ready to help and motivate people if they seem to be stuck at an impasse showing her helpful nature. The character of Kiri I felt was an interesting character in that while she appears to be a laid-back person that lets her subordinates handle the bulk of the work the fact that beneath that image of her is actually someone that is perceptive, kind and understanding of both guests and her subordinates and is actually someone that cares a great deal about her charges and willing to protect them was a nice surprise. Her observations on the guest\u2019s problems as well as her tendency to let her charges think of a way to solve them so as to allow them to learn I thought was admirable and something that all bosses should aspire to be. I felt that her seiyuu Manami Namakura really did an excellent job at voicing her. \\n\\n\r\nNatsume \\n\\n\r\nNatsume voiced by veteran seiyuu Ayaka Suwa of Asterisk Wars and Phantasy Star Online 2 fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yuzu\u2019s fellow attendants at the inn. A positive, helpful and mischievous fox girl that like Ren and Satsuki are veteran members of the attendant staff. On the surface, Natsume is a positive and cheerful person that loves to pull jokes on people and help set the mood in situations that turn out to be grim.  However, beneath this side of her it can be seen that Natsume is also someone that is diligent and skilled at her duties and cares a great deal about the welfare of the guests as well as her fellow attendants and would work hard to protect her fellow attendants and friends from harm. While Natsume\u2019s default personality may appear to be a careless one it can be seen that she too has a serious side to her personality as when she becomes serious she can be surprisingly perceptive and understanding of the reasons that people may be down for. In this side, she\u2019s shown to be surprisingly loyal and protective of her friends as well. \\n\\n\r\nOn the surface, while Natsume is often paired with Ren in their duties as attendants of the inn it can be seen that their relationship is far closer than that of normal friends and co-workers. As the series goes on and their past gets revealed it can be seen that the two were in fact childhood friends that had bonded with each other due to a rather unusual circumstance in Ren\u2019s past. As a result, it can be seen that Natsume views Ren as someone that is very important to her and treasures the relationship that they have between them strongly enough in that she will be there to protect her when she needs it.  This relationship between the two forged over a simple promise to prevent Ren from going into despair I felt was interesting as it allowed us to see the depths of the bond that exists between the two characters. The Character of Natsume I felt was a well designed and developed one whose role in the series while focusing on comic relief and bringing fun to serious situations also served as the glue that bound the cast together. I felt that her seiyuu Ayaka Suwa really did an excellent job at voicing the character of Natsume.  \\n\\n\r\nAMV \\n\\n\r\nAnimation wise I felt that the inn and the town areas that the cast visit in the series was very well designed and did an excellent job of combing the scenery of ancient Japan and the new shared culture that exists in this world. The design for each of the races that were featured in the series I felt was also pretty good and varied enough to ensure that each being will be interesting as you see them. The individual character designs for each of the main cast I felt was well designed and matched well with each of their personalities.  The music for the series I felt was one of the strong points of the series as it helped convey the overall mood of not just the series but also of the individual episodes and their stories as well. In particular, I really liked the opening and ending themes that the series made use of as it was not only catchy but also calming and cute as well with the latter being applied best to the ending theme. The voice acting for the series I felt was one of the series main strong points as I felt that each member of the cast was able to do an excellent job in portraying their characters. In particular, I felt that Yuuko Oono, Sawako Hata and Risa Kubota who portrayed the characters of Yuzu, Satsuki and Ren respectively deserve particular praise as I felt that despite being new seiyuu\u2019s they still did a fantastic job in portraying their assigned characters. \\n\\n\r\nOverall conclusion \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Konohana Kitan was an anime that I really enjoyed watching and had among its strong points an interesting premise, an excellent story that conveyed a lot of interesting life lessons, an interesting and well-developed cast of characters and excellent voice acting and music. The premise for the series itself is a basic one that is often seen in slice of life animes that Konohana Kitan belongs to but this simple premise I felt was what enabled the premise to be one of its greatest strengths of the series. Hot spring inns are one of the staples of the Japanese tourism industry and choosing to form a story around the work of the attendants at the inn as they work to not just manage the inn but also take care of the guests that stay at the inn and make use of the services was an interesting idea. The overall story that makes use of this interesting premise I felt was a strong one as not only did it show the casts development as they worked alongside and bonded with each other but also show how they worked to understand and solve the problems that bother the guests. This theme of not just taking care of the guests physically but also working to solve the problems that are bothering the guests mentally I felt was interesting and resonated well with the premise of attendants taking care of their guests. Each of the problems that were featured as part of the story I felt was well done and thought out that really imparted a number of interesting life lessons both to Yuzu and the cast and to us as the viewers. The fact that these problems incorporated a great deal of themes that were paired with each of the unique circumstances of the guests themselves I felt was an excellent move. \\n\\n\r\nIn overall Konohana Kitan was an anime that I really enjoyed as it had an interesting premise and story that featured plenty of well thought out and developed sub-stories that served to make each of the guests that the cast welcomed a unique existence. Of these the cursed doll Okiku, the spirit of the daughter and the weaver were one of my favourites. The character development for the series as well as the development of the gradual bond of friendship that forms between the cast as they encounter, solve and learn from each of these problems was something I particularly liked as well. As a final score, I would say that Konohana Kitan would deserve a final score of 10/10.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "A beautiful village of spirits. A joyful weather. And a mysterious feeling of tranquility. It\u2019s not every day you get to see a group of mythical girls hanging out together and enjoying life. Konohana Kitan is a show that\u2019s simple as it gets \u2013 cute girls doing cute things with a touch of fantasy. This anime is a heartwarming show that knows how to put all the ingredients to craft a charming slice of life. For me, Konohana Kitan is a gem that really shined without complexity.\r\nBringing together a cast of characters into this show feels like the creator needed to inject personality. I mean,lots and lots of personality. The initial first episodes portrays the innocent fox Yuzu as she arrives at Konohanaeti. The first impressions she brings in is questionable as Yuzu really demonstrates what it means to be a klutz. She is clumsy, inexperienced, and doesn\u2019t know her place well. However, Yuzu is a very friendly girl that can get along with everyone and through her personality, she improves and has an innate charm that other characters begin to appreciate. It didn\u2019t take me long to accept Yuzu as a likable character because the way she bonds with others.\\n\\n\r\nIndeed, relationship dynamics is an important part of this show and it really knows how to sell those points. Yuzu\u2019s relationship with Satsuki is one of those relationships that really tests herself. In the beginning, their relationship starts rocky because let\u2019s face it, their characters really are almost like foils of each other. Yuzu is friendly and respectful while Satsuki has a much more serious personality. Not to mention, Satsuki is a very hardworking character and doesn\u2019t tolerate mistakes often. One might describe her as a workaholic although it\u2019s clear that she cares about her friends/co-workers. Throughout the show, she begins to warm up to Yuzu and it\u2019s obvious that she cares about her. Yuzu\u2019s personality also has influence on her as Satsuki begins to enjoy the love of working, rather than just work towards her dream.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond Satsuki, Yuzu also brings the best out of other characters too through character relationships. Yuzu is able to impress Natsume and the both of them strives to work harder to make Konohanaeti into a better place. She and Sakura also shares a peculiar relationship because of their size although the both of them really begin to respect each other as time goes on. On the other hand, there\u2019s Natsume and Ren, two characters that\u2019s more like a ship-tease pair compared to the other cast. Through their interactions, it\u2019s obvious that Ren harbors a crush on Natsume even though the show doesn\u2019t fully explore it. Although this show isn\u2019t a yuri that capitalizes on female romance, it can easily get fans to fantasize on this pair. That being said, the core characters in this show contains a lot of personality. Whether it\u2019s Yuzu\u2019s friendly attitude, Natsume\u2019s tomboyish tendencies, Satsuki\u2019s rigidness, or Ren\u2019s strive to be perfect, the show can easily get you into the mood just with its colorful characters\\n\\n\r\nDespite the story being simple, it has a mysterious aura that almost feels like a bit of suspense. What exactly is Konohanaeti? Why do some characters come there? What is its true purpose? Where this is even located? Throughout the show, it has a certain mystique that I can\u2019t help but wonder. While almost every episode is an adventurous sitcom, there\u2019s definitely more than meets the eye about the world setting. Plus, we do get hear stories about the past that influences the future from certain characters. There\u2019s also one particular episode that really capitalizes the opportunity for world building. It\u2019s one of those episodes that draws the line between fiction and reality. Additionally, this anime is great at evoking certain emotions. These can bring a smile to the viewers\u2019 face or more poignant moments for emotional storytelling. The comedy is also sold well on most parts through the relationship teasing and even occasional fan service. \\n\\n\r\nAdapted by studio Lerche, Konohana Kitan is a colorful show and I mean that as one that transcends its setting than beyond just an inn for characters to visit. The places has a youthful theme and brings in all types of characters including ones with relations to mythology. The animalistic characteristics of the cast is also noticeable such as Yuzu\u2019s ears and Satsuki\u2019s tail. There\u2019s even a doll girl introduced in this anime to add a bit of innocent feel. Fan service exists and it\u2019s often portrayed as a way of character teasing that\u2019s hard to ignore. The theme songs are melancholic with a colorful vibe and decorated with creativity. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, I also feel like the character cast does a great job at portraying their characters. I mentioned before that the show has a lot of personalities. To bring that to life, it requires skill of the VA and thankfully, they pull it off in a masterful fashion. Yuzu\u2019s innocence is portrayed convincingly thanks to the talent of newcomer Yuuko Oono. Sawako Hata\u2019 talent is also worth mentioning for bring a character like Satsuki to life. It\u2019s not easy to adapt a character with a serious voice but she pulls it off with flying colors through her words. Kiri, perhaps the most mature character of the cast is also well adapted thanks to the modern talent of Manami Numakura. Throughout the show, every episode also maintains a balanced OST with touches of melancholy. \\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is an underrated show that proves slice of life doesn\u2019t always need to rely on a modern setting. It doesn\u2019t have to involve characters living the school life. Instead, this anime stands out on its own with its credible genres. The way every character is adapted really brings the best out of each other. It has a story that is simple enough to get viewers invested into its idea. I can honestly recommend this show to just about anyone. To put it simply, Konohana Kitan is an enchanting show that\u2019s a love letter to slice of life.\\n",

            "content": "Most moe shows create adorable characters for fans to love, but typically they stop there without taking their stories further. \r\nKonohana Kitan isn\u2019t one of those shows, and it would be woefully underselling it to say that it's just cute. Beyond its adorable cast of fox eared ladies and it\u2019s initial \u201ccute girls run an inn\u201d hook there are deeply human themes woven in.\r\nI don\u2019t usually advocate for moe shows, however, I think Konohana Kitan hasn\u2019t gotten a fair shake from most people based on its aesthetic choice, so I want to get my opinion down to hopefully steer some people to this wonderful show.\r\nStory8/10\\n\r\nAt the start of the show, the clumsy main character Yuzu gets her first job at Konohanatei; a hot spring inn in a village home to a variety of spirits and anthropomorphized animals. Konohanatei gives off a meditative atmosphere drawing in a variety of wise guests who impart life lessons onto the main cast, which includes six of the hot springs employees. Each episode follows the adorable employees through their daily lives working and living at Konohanatei, their personalities bounce off each other making plenty of funny moments that contrast with some really poignant moments that evoke very real-world themes. The first episode shocked me at how the story wasn't just meant to be generic, it has a purpose and so far it has achieved it. \\n\r\nThe story may just be a mode for delivering themes and crafting memorable character moments, but it's a slice of life so the predictability didn't bother me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 8.5/10\\n\r\nThe six leads are paired together in classic shoujo-ai fashion. In the first four episodes, the story has followed Yuzu, Satsuki, and Ren. The three of them have layered personalities that go beyond how they seem upon a first look, their backstories are interesting and are visible in their characterizations. \\n\r\nThe two leads that have gotten the most development so far are Yuzu and Satsuki. They have a lot of chemistry together which makes the scenes that they're together very enjoyable.  \\n\r\nWhen they're together on screen their simple but opposing personalities clash to make for some funny and endearing moments. That could be said for all of the employees; their personalities are so vividly detailed that when they clash it forces them to reflect on themselves, and those realizations stay with their characters and have been revisited throughout the show. As if they were real people, they face struggles from inner turmoil and resolve issues by gaining wisdom from each other and the knowledgeable guests. \\n\\n\r\nSound 7/10\\n\r\nA subdued and calming opening starts off each episode, but it gradually opens and grows louder, much like the progression of the individual story arcs. The voice actresses do a good job at their parts and that anime cat lady thing, even if it's not outstanding it's still pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nThe character designs are of course adorable and they\u2019re also very expressive, their designs are fairly varied but they\u2019re given life through the characterizations. Environments are simple but appealing to the eyes. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nI\u2019m not usually one to advocate for moe, but Konohana Kitan surprised me in how realistic its core messages are. Funny scenarios, adorable characters, and poignant themes, Konahana Kitan is the most pleasant surprise I've seen this year. \\n\\n\r\nIn the second episode, the adorable and optimistic Yuzu imparts her simplistic yet poignant thoughts of life onto the strict and serious Satsuki which warms her heart and immediately strikes a visible connection between the two. The connection felt realistic to me because the belief they shared transcended the adorable animal-people world of Konohana Kitan and shot directly into the real one. \\n\r\nThe message is that you should enjoy life whenever you can because if you don't it will pass you by and fill you with regret.\\n\\n\r\nProvisional Score 8.1/10\\n\r\nDon't judge a book by its cover, Konohana Kitan is a good show that's worth watching despite what it's aesthetic may imply upon your first judgment. \\n\r\nThe show's strongest point is how well the characters are written. However, not all of the main cast members haven't been fleshed out. I can see this issue being addressed in the future, as I update this review I'll comment on how it (hopefully) gets better.",

            "content": "Cute girls doing cute things? Mild yuri slice-of-life? It's a bit hard to differentiate yourself when you are competing with hallmarks like GochiUsa, Yuru Yuri, or the latest hits (looking at you Kobayashi's Maid Dragon!) \r\nDon't let KonoKitan's first 3 episodes fool you though. While it starts off slow introducing its main characters, I find its use of Japanese folklore, traditional customs, and legendary figures, to be fitting and clever. Ever heard of the Baku? Or the idea that dolls have souls? It's very interesting to see how KonoKitan weaves these concepts with its cast of characters in a slow-paced manner, while leaving commentaries onthe ephemeral nature of life. Sounds like Natsume's Book of Friends? Yes I can see some of its vibes here.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters-wise, we are treated to a somewhat-cliche group. The ever-naive Yuzu who occasionally offers advice beyond her years (and subsequently surprise her peers and customers), the rambunctious tomboy Natsume and her fellow interest Ren who acts ladylike, the younger sister walking in her sibling's shadow (Satsuki), and free-spirited Sakura. While this set of characters may seem all too familiar, and their interactions cliched, their antics still tug at your heart. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like a slice-of-life series, seeing \"cute girls doing cute things\", while having a Natsume's Book of Friends vibe, this is the anime for you.",

            "content": "Do you like fox girls? Do you like yuri? Do you like heartwarming mythological moments? Then Konohana Kitan is for you! Konohana Kitan excels very well at two things: making appealing yuri scenes between the fox girls and providing heartwarming moments with interesting takes relating to Japanese folklore. And on those two merits, the show is able to succeed. \r\nThe show seems to be divided between two different sections: moments that build up the character\u2019s relationships to each other and moments that are more concerned with telling fantastical stories that attempt to warm up the heart. And while the show is able to succeed ateach part individually when put together there is something a bit lacking. Take the fantastical folklore episodes, while there are many episodes that are not only able to use folklore to tell a compelling and unique story but also manage to be heartwarming and genuinely surprising. Separated from the rest of the work, they stand out as particularly strong episodes that do a good job of making one feel a greater connection with the world around them. It\u2019s amazing what they are able to do with old stories of folklore to talk about the human condition and give hope to those that are watching. There is this sort of feeling of helplessness to what life can throw at one, but also a feeling of triumph of being able to overcome it. Whether it be a dream eating Baku or the story of a mother and her child, the show is able to make unexpected powerful moments out of nowhere.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, when half the show is dedicated to this it does have an effect on the rest of the show. Even though they are nice to watch, they are often focused on side characters who don\u2019t have any barring on the main cast. Which isn\u2019t necessarily a problem, especially when they are able to do it quite well, but it does lead to the character\u2019s not getting as much development as they could be.\\n\\n\r\nThe yuri moments also show this problem. The moments that show the bonds between the characters are all very touching and are just so adorable and loveable. But at the same time they also often cover the same ground. Furthermore, the amount of interactions between the group is limited because the main characters are often paired to the hip to their partner. While this does make for a nice one on one bond and provides some very satisfying and noteworthy episodes, it lacks the same sense of community that other CGDCT shows are able to richly show. \\n\\n\r\nIt also doesn\u2019t help that the show tries to have more characters than it can work with. The main characters are pretty nice. They all have distinct and likeable personalities. They have enough depth to them that they are interesting but sadly there isn\u2019t enough depth to them to make them standout characters. Ren, Yuzu, Satsuki, and Natsume fall into this. They all have interesting traits and interact nicely between each other. However, the other cast members of Konohana Kitan suffer from lack of screentime or characterization. While Okiku gets some time to shine, Kiri and Sakura feel like one-note characters. They have some nice small moments but overall they feel more like afterthoughts than anything. \\n\\n\r\nNormally that isn\u2019t a problem but the combined effect of having extra filler characters and having a lot of episodes focused on side characters means the main cast doesn\u2019t get as fleshed out as they could be. Even though each of the episodes the main cast does get does a very good job of showing what drives them and what they\u2019re like it still feels a bit shallow. Like there\u2019s still more that can be dug into. I think part of this is the lack of other character interactions. When most of the character\u2019s screentime is made up of another character they tend to get forced into roles. Yuzu and Satsuki are often going to act the same way around each other. Ditto with Ren and Natsume. While those interactions are nice it ends up leaving a more static view of their characters. People are not just defined by their interactions with one person, but with all sorts of people, and all of the different ways they react to different things. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is quite nice and beautiful although the animation can be somewhat lackluster at times. It\u2019s clear that there are several tricks they use in order to make them needless animation. And to be fair they work overall. The chibi fox blobs are very cute. That said when it leads to as little animation as there was in episode 5, it can be quite a problem. The art style is very nice though and it\u2019s able to exude it\u2019s aesthetic very well, which is quite nice for what it has going for it. The sound also helps with this, and the mellow and relaxing tracks are able to fit in with the soul-soothing hotel that they work at. The art-style and sound both are adept at enhancing whatever feel the show is trying to go for. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Konohana Kitan is a case of a story that is good in episode-sized chunks but when combined together it lacks the consistency to make it the super strong show that it could be. Even still it has really cute adorable yuri moments and really meaningful and emotional moments. And if you\u2019re into that, like I am, I highly suggest it as it\u2019ll have a lot of content that can warm one\u2019s soul and fill one\u2019s heart with sunshine. And if you\u2019re not, I still think this show is strong enough to have things to offer. While I do have my complaints and issues with the development of the show, that doesn\u2019t stop it from being an adorable blast of a show!",

            "content": "The genre of Slice of life has been so riddled with all female casts of cute girls doing cute things that each season seems to have its own version of the trope with a slight difference in its storytelling and/or setting in order to give the show some \u2018unique aspects\u2019.  These aspects are usually easy to distinguish and end up seeming gimmicky cause at the end of the day; it\u2019s still cute girls doing cute things.  But then you have Konohana Kitan, a show about cute kitsune girls doing\u2026not just cute things in their daily lives.\r\nStory:\r\nIn a world between Earth and Heaven therelays a bathhouse called Konohanatei.  In this bathhouse, guests ranging from normal people to high-ranking gods attend this bathhouse for some nice rest and relaxation from the attending staff that care for all that pass through here.  It is here where a young kitsune by the name of Yuzu steps forth in the next step of her life as part of the attendant staff, coming in contact with the various individuals that end up at this place.\\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is in a word, whimsical.  Each episode is structured as its own story based around either a story dedicated to a guest in the bathhouse, or the several attendants of Konohanatei, thus giving the show a nice blend of character and story that builds up the kind of world that\u2019s established in this midway between life and death.  While indeed the show does have some emphasis on \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019 as all-female casts in this medium tend to showcase, the show is well aware of the relaxing and calm tone that it establishes and runs with it all the way to the end.\\n\\n\r\nFurthermore, the stories are unique and interesting.  Based primarily around Shintoism concepts, the show really emphasizes the mystical in a very prominent way, as Yuzu\u2019s experiences with the various guests give off a sense of wonder and amazement that I\u2019ve found to be an aspect that\u2019s very refreshing.  In comparison however, the stories based around the main cast I\u2019d say aren\u2019t personally as good, but still hold their own to provide enough depth and attention to the young attendants so that they feel more like characters rather than a cardboard figure that acts as the leeway to let the story we\u2019re talking about happen.  (Looking at you, Isekai Shokudou)\\n\\n\r\nWith even pacing and a huge focus on story and expanding the world on an episode-by-episode basis, Konohana Kitan stands as a heartwarming and relaxing series with a story that entertains more than teaches.  It knows the ground that it stands on, and firmly does so with extra emphasis on trying to be good and unique rather than fall into the trap of \u2018cute girls doing cute things\u2019.  Yes, that still kind of does happen, but it\u2019s so few and far between that it really doesn\u2019t matter.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Well made episodic stories\\n\r\n+ Character development\\n\r\n+ Knows what it is and sticks with it\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nThe various attendants of Konohanatei take up I\u2019d say\u2026half of the existing episodes, with surprisingly enough, our main protagonist having the least with only one episode solely focused on her.\\n\\n\r\nAs the newest attendant of Konohanatei, Yuzu is in short, a klutz.  She\u2019s new to the job and the demands of being an attendant sort of turn her on her head because her naturally airheaded and innocent demeanor lead her to in some cases be more hindrance than helpful.  Nevertheless, the show establishes her as the main person to experience most if not all of the whimsical tales from the bathhouse\u2019s various guests, sort of making up the lack of backstory/development screentime she gets from the series.  Beyond that, her naturally optimistic and child-like wonder helps give off a positive vibe of the show, which really adds to the experience.  On her own, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s all that amazing, but when put into context, she really does enhance the overall experience.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki on the other hand is the polar opposite, being more strict (and prickly) compared to her assigned partner with dreams and aspirations that reach beyond a life working in the bathhouse.  On a base level, Satsuki is a tsundere, but she does have her shining moments where she softens up from her naturally strict demeanor, becoming a well rounded character especially when factoring in the episodes dedicated to her and the backstory we\u2019re told about how she came to the bathhouse.  Personally, not my favorite character, but she has a lot of qualities that make her a respectable cast member. \\n\\n\r\nAnd then there\u2019s Ren and Natsume.  Personally, I\u2019m not a fan of these two mostly because their connection stems from the trope of a girl swooning over the oblivious tomboy who more often than not treats her like a princess through princess carry, extreme worriment, etc etc.  They\u2019re eternally linked in this show, so much so that their episodes are \u2018their\u2019 episodes rather than a Ren or Natsume only episode.  Again, the show establishes quite a bit of depth for them so that they feel more alive, but based on personal bias alone, I just got vaguely annoyed that the show almost always dedicated their screentime together for yuribaiting.  \\n\\n\r\nAs for the rest of the staff, we have Sakura, who gets no episodes to herself but is amusing and memorable in her own way, fox saber (Kiri) who is basically a really sassy and funny Artoria Pendragon with fox ears attached to her head (seriously though, the way she bundles her hair is EXACTLY LIKE THAT), and Okami, who really should get more screentime cause she\u2019s also pretty funny too.  More or less they\u2019re supplements to the \u2018main cast\u2019, but I wish they got more time to them cause at times they really stole the show.  As for the guests, there\u2019s not much to say about them without delving into spoiler material.  Just know that any given guest can take half an episode to a full episode, each of them leaving a lasting impression because more than anything, their stories on how they came to the bathhouse, what their legend or story is, and what they leave behind, give them significance that add to the overall show.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Hilarious and underused side cast\\n\r\n+ Developed main cast\\n\r\n+ Memorable stories\\n\r\n-  Main cast is kinda tropeish\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Lerche, the quality of Konohana Kitan shows us that it\u2019s pretty.  It\u2019s very pretty.  It\u2019s about standard fare in terms of animation quality, but the light and airy color palette combined with a multitude of characters\u2019 stills make the show calming and visually vibrant to look at.  Not only that, but several episodes shift around the color palette and lighting of a specific episode to put emphasis on the story that\u2019s being told at the time, a nice touch that improves the whimsicality of the show.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing is the show\u2019s comedic style.  Sure you get your standard comedy faces and stuff in order to have exaggerated expressions for comedy\u2019s sake, but the really amusing thing I found was, since the characters are all kitsune, rather than use normal chibis, the show straight up turns them into cat-like blob creatures that shuffle around the screen.  Yes, while it\u2019s much easier (and by extension cheaper) to animate than normal chibis, it\u2019s unique and I have honest to god never seen a \u2018chibi\u2019 this funny before.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Color palette and visual style add to the show\u2019s tone\\n\r\n+ (Personal Bias) Hilarious chibis\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nInitially going in and expecting the soundtrack to be just so moe pop song, both the show\u2019s OP and ED, \u201cKokoro ni Tsubomi\u201d and \"Haru Urara, Kimi to Sakihokoru\" exude a soft and calming beat with only the slightest push of energy in the ED to give it enough oomph to sound like a proper seiyuu song.  Personally I prefer the OP to its ED counterpart, as it more encapsulates the show\u2019s atmosphere and overall tone much better, but both are definitely worthwhile listens if you\u2019re trying to find something calming.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI totally did not just watch this show because I like kitsunes.  I swear on my good name.  While yes that is definitely one reason I was interested in the show to begin with, the other was how the show would actually present itself.  At first glance, I saw it as a bit of gamble, seeing if the \u2018kitsune girls\u2019 was going to be the show\u2019s gimmick and it was just gonna be another round of moe tropes rehashed for the umpteenth time.  And I thankfully relieved.  A couple seasons ago, I reviewed a show called \u2018Urara Meirochou\u2019, which had a somewhat similar premise with a mix of moe and mystical, which ended up being more of the former than the latter.  I\u2019d say that Konohana Kitan is that show done right, as it flips those two in importance and gives us something akin to Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou, which is a welcome sight since I very much am a fan of these lax yet magical shows.  \\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nWhile not one of my most anticipated watches, Konohana Kitan was certainly a rewarding experience.  I found myself in awe at some of the stories and really would\u2019ve liked to have more, but all good things must come to an end.  Also, fox saber.  That is totally Artoria if you slapped on a pair of fox ears on her.  And she\u2019s super sassy to boot.  She is so funny; why did we not get more of her?  Also the doll.  I find it amusing how we have an established character that spends most of her screentime mounting her trusty dream pig steed.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat didn\u2019t I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nI feel like some of the dedicated episodes for Satsuki and Ren/Natsume were unneeded.  The characters were pretty established by that point and bolstering more of what we knew was something I felt was unnecessary, especially when the latter two have their entire story dedicated to yuribaiting.  Yuribaiting is fine, but I mean come on, you can do MORE than that.  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the likes of the two shows I mentioned before, Mushishi and Natsume Yuujinchou, then I\u2019d say that Konohana Kitan is not that far from those two.  As I\u2019ve stated many times cause I\u2019m a broken record, the show is whimsical at its core, focusing more on the stories of people and the people themselves than establishing an overarching narrative.  It\u2019s a relaxing and calm watch with only some fanservice (compared to most moe shows), and definitely seemed to have gone under the radar for a majority of the Fall 2017 season.  So if you\u2019re looking for a good show that didn\u2019t get much attention, this certainly fits the bill.",

            "content": "I'm not a big fan of moe series, yet some friends recommended me this one, at first, it caught my interest because of the Shoujo Ai elements it posesses, but so far within 4 episodes, I got to see an anime which is a very heartwarming experience. You can expect light fanservice on this anime, very intended girl x girl relationships and very cute moments, so if you don't have anything against it, this anime will be a pleasant watch for you.\r\nTL;DR: Overall Section\r\nThere isn't much story to tell, but the concept goes around an Inn that runs by foxes, if you remember Isekai Shokudou,the concept is quite similar, but instead of serving food and focusing on side characters, this anime focuses on the main lead, their relationships and how they succeed on their work... Of course with a touch of slice of life, we will have heartwarming stories and the background story of each character will be revealed within time. 6/10\\n\\n\r\nThe animation of this show is pretty good looking, the main characters are very beautiful with their \"moe-inducing\" cuteness. I'll also like to say that this anime reminds me of \"Amanchu!\", mostly because Yuzu and her random faces reminds me of Hikari's dumb face (and how her cuteness involves her relationship with Satsuki just as Hikari has a really good chemistry with her diving partner) also the way that the \"dumb looking foxes\" look is funny and pretty much on point for comic relief. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department of this anime is your typical set of anime girl voices... well... cute anime girl voices, it goes well for how each one of them is designed. The background OST is quite good when it comes to scenes that requires a really smooth soundtrack, be it sad, heartwarming or comic relief, it manages to hit me everytime. 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters, well we have Tsundere, Loli, Dumbass, Possesive, eh... boy looking girl?, the lead and the big wolf chief. Might sound a bit generic, but even if it is, their development is what makes this show what it is: Heartwarming, oh yeah and they can also be funny and cute, so there is variety here, if you want to have diabetes, you came to the right place. 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI've gotta say, I didn't expect to like this quite as much as I watched 4 episodes straight. And I'll probably end loving it even more the more I watch it, having a weekly doses of cuteness can't be bad for your heart 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7,4(7)/10: A cute girls doing cute stuff, now with foxes, very heartwarming, and cute foxes and diabetes inducing foxes and cute foxes... did I already state that the foxes are cute?",

            "content": "It's a SoL, it's for people who love Shoujo Ai CGDCT stuff, it's a feel-good show, but what it does, it not ONLY does great justice to it, but rather it propels it towards excellence at its finest, and is indeed one of the best shows of Fall 2017.\r\nStory:\r\nYuzu, a fox girl, and a newcomer towards Konohanatei, learns to adjust from her previous life living in the woods, and immersing around with the Konohanatei crew of fox girls. Being the most innocent, clumsy and able to get lost very easily, her personality brings the charm towards the other characters (which I'll discuss in the Charactersection) and the vastly beautiful world around her as she bonds with the characters.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I've gotta say that the premise is set really well, for the story is the layer of the cake towards the icing (which are the characters themselves), and the blending of the both could not be any better, and although the manga source is on hiatus, I'm honestly glad the anime adaptation doesn't withdraw from the fact to build upon the greatness of the manga and making the show look as lush as possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAbsolutely, the strongest point of Konohana Kitan is it's characters and their development and involvement towards one another.\\n\\n\r\nNewcomer Yuzu, voiced by new seiyuu Yuuko Ono (Jun from Tenshi no 3P) is a delight to watch, though my minor gripe is that she's one of the main characters, yet the show plainly forces her in the limelight when she shouldn't have. The innocent, plain looking young fox girl always gets into trouble, though she quickly learns with a heart of gold, and preaches her understanding in a way that doesn't offend the other party in a very peaceful manner.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki mainly acts as Yuzu's caretaker since her arrival on Day 1, but her actions towards Yuzu may be harsh, but in a good way of a Senpai looking out for her junior, treating her both as a fellow attendant, and a friend.\\n\\n\r\nSakura is downright creepy when you take a look at her at first glance, but then as the series progresses you will realize that she is nothing that we know of, until the arrival of the doll and the pig, to which she is aggressive towards them, but not to worry, we know she has a kind heart (from within).\\n\\n\r\nRen is the typical yuri mess, knowing that her love for tomboy Natsume goes through the roof, and at times, like Yuzu, will mess up, in the name of love (or in front of Natsume), but other than that, she still serves diligently as another attendant at Konohanatei.\\n\\n\r\nNatsume, being a tomboy, is fearless, and always shields the others when danger, whether minor or major happens and earns the reputation of the capable attendant.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the characters and the VAs supporting them have done a tremendous job at keeping their intensity at being fair and fresh, and props especially to Yuzu's VA for an excellent job well done immersing in the atmosphere.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nVeteran studio Lerche, being capable of their production values, has descended unto us a beautiful and gorgeous show that ties in with the human-spirit interconnection and the folklore settings that blend so well together. You can definitely see it in most places, and the always funny chibi fox feels always never ceases to humor me, that by the end of the episodes it feels like a moment of time has passed, and always left wanting for more. Props to studio Lerche for another adaptation that has done exceptionally with lush colour and details galore.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nAnother strong point for the show is at its slow but nice and immersive OST and BGM. The nice, refreshing tinkles and tingles of the OP and various EDs along with the BGM just elevates the experience of watching this show. Another area to sing praises of this show.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is the equivalent of Winter 2017's Urara Meirochou, but presented better in every way possible. The lush visuals, the nice sounds, what more could you want from a CGDCT and Shoujo Ai series that leaves you wanting for more? Love this series as a whole as it serves the break you might need if you're invested in this show. Watch it if you can, it's great fun!",

            "content": "==============\r\nWORDS OF GRATITUDE\r\n==============\r\nIt's pretty rare for me to love a series this much! This is definitely my Anime of the Year 2017. I love this series so much and I am so glad I decided to pick it up. Thank you the staff behind Konohana Kitan. Thank you Amano Sakuya sensei. Thank you everyone who supported this show. I am really grateful to all of you. It has been a wonderful ride that I won't easily forget in the near future. I hope down in the bottom of my heart for the Blu-Ray sales of this anime to reach the staff's expectations and further moreto exceed it. I also wish you all a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. After all those gratitude, let's hop into my review for the MASTERPIECE that goes by the name of \"Konohana Kitan\", a real hidden gem that has yet to be discovered by the anime community. \\n\\n\r\n=====\\n\r\nREVIEW\\n\r\n=====\\n\\n\r\nIt is not often I find a moe anime that entertained me this much. Konohana Kitan tells a tale of our main characters working in a hot spring inn. Yes, tale. It isn't your normal moe working anime such as New Game, or even serious anime like Sakura Quest. Konohana Kitan is presented in an episodic way, in which each episode tells you a short heartwarming tale, sometimes it can be about family and sometime it can be about friendship. \\n\\n\r\nNow one misconception people have with this anime is that it is just a pure Shoujo-Ai/Soft-Yuri anime and I would like to say...yes this is a Shoujo-Ai anime, and it isn't your typical moe Shoujo-Ai out there where fans keeps on shipping two characters together, in this anime the ship actually sails. It's very clear which character will end up with which character after a few episodes in. However, it isn't just the Shoujo-Ai that stands out, it's also how the story in each episode is told. \\n\\n\r\nAs I stated before, each episode tells you a short heartwarming tale. The story in each episode is very relatable. Sometimes, they will dedicate an entire episode to focus on telling you more about the characters and further developing their romantic relationship, in which makes you like them even more.\\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of the characters, each character in this anime is cute and fun to watch. Moreover, they are also well developed and likable. Personally, there isn't any character in this series that I hate/dislike, every character to me has their own charm and are well fleshed out. Although at first glance you might think that this is your typical moe character you can see every season, but trust me, they are more than that.\\n\\n\r\nThe music in this anime is soothing and relaxing. The opening sequence is based on how the workers of a hot spring inn start their work. The staff actually did research to make the opening sequence more realistic and relatable. The ending theme is also pretty heartwarming. Background music used in each scene brings out the heartwarming nature of this anime even more. \\n\\n\r\nThe part that surprised me the most is the art and animation, especially the background art. It's outstanding. I never thought I would want to praise the background team this much but they seriously did their job perfectly, Each background is so carefully and seriously drawn until it's hard to find flaws in them. The animation, especially when there is sakura petals flying around, is beautifully animated. Such a gorgeous animation coming from Lerche, just wow!\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I enjoy watching this anime very much! This is a masterpiece in my opinion. Nothing beats the day I can sit down and enjoy myself watching this series. If you are a fan of moe anime or you just want a comfy heartwarming anime to watch, then do yourself a favor and watch Konohana Kitan. I bet you won't ever be disappointed cause I surely didn't.",

            "content": "This series sure came out of nowhere. \r\nWhen I first saw it on MAL I barely even glanced at it, I thought it was just going to be a generic Cute Girls Doing Cute Things anime, but my god is it heartwarming. \r\nKonohana Kitan is an episodic slice of life story about these fox girls that work at Konohanatei, a hot springs for the gods. It seems to exist between life and death, though it's never fully explained. There's a lot in this series that's not fully explained, but because of its nature I think fully explaining things would ruin it a little. \r\nSince theattendants at Konohanatei consistently serve Japanese kami, a lot of the plot lines involve Japanese legends. It gives off a similar vibe to Spirited Away, though in a more human-like modern anime style. \\n\\n\r\nThere are a few backstories that could be fleshed out, like I'm really curious about Yuzu's past, and Ren, Satsuki, and Okiku definitely get more character development than the rest of them, but it's just so good, it made me smile, it was heartwarming, it was sad at times, it was funny, it was cute, watch this series I want it to get a season 2. \\n\\n\r\nIt is worth noting that it aired on the same day as Urahara, so my opinion might have been inflated, though I did wait until the next day to watch the final episode and it's still just as good when not sitting next to the dumpster.",

            "content": "I strongly recommend you to watch \"Konohana Kitan,\" especially those who are interested in \"yuri\" culture but still hesitating to get involved with it.\r\nI know some of you avoid \"yuri\" culture, saying 'I'm not interested in it,' or, 'I don't know well what is yuri.'\r\nTrue, \"yuri\" culture is a one which is not well-recognized also in Japan. It is often misunderstood. Furthermore, even among \"yuri\" culture fans there are some conflicts over the definition of the term \"yuri.\" Some says that \"yuri\" is equal to a term \"girls' love\" or \"lez (shorten form of lesbians).\" On the other hands, others argue a word \"yuri\" focuseson spirituality of girls and therefore sometimes includes friendship while sometimes excludes \"girls' love.\" It is a confusing problem, so I won't talk about it here.\\n\r\nWhat is sure is, although there are some groups in \"yuri\" culture, all of them admit that \"Konohana Kitan\" is a genuine \"yuri\" work.\\n\\n\r\n\"Konohana Kitan\" is about bit-strange lives in a Japanese hotel (actually 'Kitan' stands for 'a strange story,' but in this title a Chinese character of 'ki' is different from that in usual use.) A protagonist, Yuzu, is a new face of nakai (waitress.) She spends a bit odd but calm days there with her colleagues.\\n\\n\r\nThe main theme of this work is to express growing relationships between a few pairs of couples: Yuzu and Satsuki, Natsume and Ren, and Sakura and Kiri. \\n\r\nThese three couples are all \"yuri,\" that is true, but they are different from each other, and that's why I recommend beginners to watch \"Konohana Kitan\" first, for by doing so you can understand the framework of \"yuri.\"\\n\r\nThe first couple, Yuzu and Satsuki' s relationship is a typical one, I mean, it is popular in \"yuri\" culture. One is an innocent, gentle girl and friendly to anyone, while the other is strict but actually kind. In such cases the strict one has often already noticed actual feelings of oneself towards the innocent one. In this specific case, thanks to Yuzu's effort and personalities, Satsuki, the strict and stubborn one, gradually opens her mind towards Yuzu. \"Konohana Kitan\" precisely describes the change of Satsuki's attitude towards Yuzu throughout  a episode and the series, which is highly reputed among \"yuri\" culture fan, included me.\\n\r\nThe second pair, Natsuki and Ren, is a little easier to grasp, for a girl is obviously in love with the other. A boyish one seems to be childish, not to understand girls' emotions. The girlish one sometimes gets angry to the other, but in the end she again falls in love to the other. This  structure is similar to that of shoujo manga, so you might get to be familiar with this relationship sooner. Of course, this relationship is also \"yuri.\" A bit complicated?\\n\r\nThe last one, Sakura and Kiri, is a so-called 'oneloli' couple, I suppose. Why I cannot declare is that it is a bit far from the mainstream of 'oneloli' today. 'One (not a number!)' is a shorten form of 'oneesan (=an elder sister, an elder woman),' and 'loli' means, you know, 'a girl, especially an elementary school student.' This relationship focuses on <mothership,> a personality of being mother or an elder woman, and on traits of really a young child. It is different from the relationship of real mother and daughter, so please be careful. Kiri is just a mature woman, and Sakura is just a child, which is the epitome of 'oneloli.' This is a difficult couple to understand, but you might gradually get familiar with it.\\n\r\nAs above, each couple has its own features. What is excellent is that \"Konohana Kitan\" has succeeded to describe all the features of each couple. It is not an easy task; rather, a tough challenge. The creator of the original work understand \"yuri\" culture deeply and also anime staff makes effort to reproduce the atmosphere the original has. The very fruit of such works is the anime series of \"Konohana Kitan.\"\\n\\n\r\nAnime staffs have really tried hard to reconstruct the original. Character designs are almost the same to those of the original manga. They also focus on background arts: using CG carefully, they makes backgrounds full with Japanese traditional sense, such as washitsu, a Japanese garden and so on.\\n\r\nJapanese cultures are also found in many parts: \"Konohana Kitan\" pays attention to the change of four seasons, and express it with plots, backgrounds, and detailed BGMs. \"Konohana Kitan\" carefully describes a tiny tiny transition of girls' delicate emotions with sophisticated aura which is created by each element.\\n\r\nTotally, \"Konohana Kitan\" is also a quality-guaranteed anime. This is also a reason why I would like you to see it.\\n\\n\r\nI want to stress that \"yuri\" is not a merely \"girls' love,\" not even friendships between girls. In Japan there are an amount of \"yuri\" manga whose protagonists are matured women (mainly 20~29 years old.)  This fact implies that \"yuri\" is not so strongly connected with ages. I know this fact may confuse you. Such difficulties are causes of avoidance. However, I also feel that it is plenty numbers of sub-categories that have been promoting today's growth of \"yuri\" culture. I hope you comes in contact with \"yuri\" culture by watching \"Konohana Kitan.\" It is only you who know the answer to this question: 'what is a funny point of \"yuri\" cultures?'  It's time for you to search for your own answer.",

Konohanatei is a example of a well made anime and the story is simple abut it comes full circle and feels complete. There are some slower moments but when you are bombarded with so pretty visuals you just can't stop staring at them. There are also a ton of Japanese culture references from traditions to gods and spiritsthat it is amazing and they are woven into the story neatly. Characters are \u00fbber cute and very moe but tone is light that it could appeal to people who might not like moe-animes. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is sugar coated candy with so pretty exterior and with very lighthearted and culturally packed center that it almost eats your teeth away. This is a must for kemono-girl and moe fans. I give it 8,5/10 Rounded to 9/10. \\n\r\nWarming and kind, perfect with cold weather just like hot cocoa.",

            "content": "I went into Konohana Kitan expecting another typical all girl cast sol show in the likes of \"Hinako Note\", \"Gabriel Dropout\", \"Urara Meirochou\",\"Kiniro Moasic\"...etc. But do you see me writing a review for those? No. So why am I writing this?\r\nStory (9): The series is a collection of short stories that happens at Konohana; a high class traditional hotel in a world of Japanese/Eastern mythology. Each episode consists of two stories pertaining to either the main cast or one of the eccentric guest(s). The story takes full advantage of the setting and excels in the \"show not tell\" principle. \r\nArt (9): I went in expectingthis anime to cut corners in animation/art, I was willing to give it some slack thinking they probably had a smaller budget compared to other animes. But wow... I was blown away immediately by just the still shots in the op (beautiful water effects in one particular shot). The background sets are great looking throughout, rain effects are well done, the show is filled with interesting characters, and designs of the main characters are also solid. The creative use of colour is at the next level compared to your average anime.\\n\r\nSound (8): Great intro that sets the mood. The bgm is noticeably good and sound effects are done just as well as any other anime. The VAs all do a decent enough job, no complaints. They switch up the ed quite frequently and it's refreshing. Overall the music isn't exactly too memorable but imo it's above average.\\n\r\nCharacter (8): Character driven shows like this one need to have good characters. Does it have good characters? Yes. Does it have great characters? No. Everyone was likeable and unique but none of them was really outstanding. Most of them have typical character tropes seen plenty of times before. What's making me give an 8 is when they come together, the pairings plays well off of each other and everyone gets a chance in the spotlight. Not to mention the world they live in is filled with amusing mythological beings.\\n\r\nEnjoyment (8): I personally found this much more enjoyable than the other recent sols previously mentioned. The vast majority of jokes lands or are at least chuckle worthy. The show seamlessly transports you into this world they've established, allowing you to forget about the shitter real one for its duration. I should also mention how this anime excels in both establishing and changing the mood. Don't be surprised by the occasional ride on an emotional rollercoaster. \\n\r\nOverall (8): So why does this deserve a review? Because compared to other sols this one truly stands out. Konohana Kitan isn't primarily driven by the need to make a joke at the end like every other sol. The true driving force here is the desire to tell a story. This fundamental difference  makes Konohana Kitan unique, refreshing and worthy of taking the time to write a review on.",

            "content": "Last season of anime had some really relaxing series Girls Last Tour, Children of the Whales and even Love Live! Sunshine Season 2, to name the few I watched.  All of these shows were created to make a person relax and reflect on life. One anime in particular which did this particularly well for me was Konohana Kitan. \r\nStory \u2013 8/10\r\nIf you were to ask anybody who happened to watch Konohana Kitan to describe the show in a single word; most would say \u2018charming\u2019. Which is completely accurate as the entirety of Konohana Kitan\u2019s plot is written to make you smile at the sweetnesstranspiring on screen, and during some episodes even lead to a few heartfelt tears.  The story of Konohana Kitan revolves around the young kitsune Yuzu who has just started working at a inn called Konohanatei. There people; animals and creatures of supernatural origin gather for some rest and relaxation, which make for some hilarious and at times heartwarming interactions. Every episode revolves around either developing the core group of Yuzu, Satsuki, Natsume, Ren, Sakura, Kiri and Okami or assisting a guest with his/her problem.  Whether it is the later or the former there wasn\u2019t a single episode which I found boring and in some cases \u2013 like the episode with the old lady \u2013 the simple but heart-warming plot lead to me crying for a few minutes on end, because of the relatable experiences these people experienced.  Themes like loss, abandonment, guilt and friendship are explored within the anime and just warm your heart.\\n\\n\r\nArt \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nI believe studio Lerche did an excellent job animating Konohana Kitan. From the beautiful landscapes filled with vibrant colours, to the bustling city beneath Konohanatei filled with a large variety of life, the world was beautifully animated like a world out of a dream. Because of the beauty of the world it really helped build an atmosphere which you could simply escape towards, overall helping to build on the setting which the story wanted to portray. If there is an anime out there which could achieve the same effect from watching the anime, it has to be Non Non Biyori, another anime which has mastered the art of creating a world which allows the viewer to simply relax. Another thing which the original creator did to help build on the sweet and relaxing setting are the character designs which are downright adorable and perfectly complements the setting.\\n\\n\r\nSound \u2013 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall the soundtrack worked really well with the series. Once again the creators managed to incorporate another aspect of the anime to fully take advantage of the atmosphere they wanted the viewers to experience.  The OST is designed to make you feel warm and relaxed, with its gentle melodies which are extremely pleasant to listen to. I love the opening and both endings of the series, because they have such a gentle tone which works to well with the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nYuzu is the embodiment of cuteness and sweetness. Together with Satsuki she is just on an adorable scale out of this world. But a cute aura isn\u2019t the only thing which makes Yuzu a great character. She is equally part a realistic character and a relatable one. Throughout the run of the anime she grows from a timid child to a Onee-sama like character who everybody adores. Satsuki on the other hand you really happen to feel for as her dreams are shattered a young age, leaving her scarred. It was too cute to behold to see all the couples in the anime unintentionally \u2013 and sometimes intentionally \u2013 with each other. All the couples are done in such a way that they make up for each other\u2019s short comings and perfectly complement each other. Natsume is Ren\u2019s prince and Yuzu Satsuki\u2019s support. All of the guests introduced in the series were all interesting in their own right and it was an absolute joy to learn more about them and the central characters.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment \u2013 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis show is exactly the type of show which I would want to see more of. More shows that focus on creating a magical world of wonder, filled with characters all colorful and unique in their own right. Watching a simple slice of life about girls living their life and dealing with life\u2019s problems  is something which not should not only be found within the anime industry but all forms of media.\\n\\n\r\nOverall \u2013 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you are feeling down and depressed from life or simply playing Nier: Automata; Konohana Kitan is the show for you. It is an anime designed to sooth the soul of those watching it and can be watched by anybody regardless of what genre\u2019s you are into. With a heart-warming story, art style, soundtrack and characters why would you need any other reason to watch this fantastic anime.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to read my review!",

But still turned out pretty good.\r\nLike i still enjoyed the anime overall, it has a satisfying ending, as throughout the anime, it goes through everyone's backstory which very interesting, as some anime only focuses theMC. \\n\r\nOverall good anime, if you prefer something balance and relaxing to watch something similar to Natsume, where there's no drastic ending or end hanger, than you'll like it, especially if you don't mind a bit of Shoujo-Ai (Extremely light ver. of Yuri)",

            "content": "As you walk in to the beautiful wooden building, finally at the end of your journey. Your weary feet aching for a relaxing bath, and a slight hunger is tugging at the back of your conscience. You look ahead and notice a tiny figure walking towards you, the silhouette has two triangle shapes at the top and long flowing hair waving back and forth with her every step.\r\nThe girl is now right next to you, and you can see her clearly. It's one of the attendants of this inn, but also a fox complete with fangs, tail and tiny ears on top of her headcovered with wheat coloured hair. Before you can speak a single word the fox-girl bows politely and exclaims: 'Welcome to Konohanatei!'.\\n\\n\r\nHopefully that beginning paragraph gave you a bit of an idea of what to expect from Konohana Kitan. And if not then maybe I can give you a better idea in the following paragraphs.\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is an anime all about the inn Konohanatei, its attendants and its godly and mythical guests. It could have easily been yet another throwaway slice-of-life show focusing on a group of cute girls, but luckily good direction and artistic sense go a long way to help the show stand out. The slow and laid-back attitude of the anime combined with the at times breathtaking shots and sounds create the perfect atmosphere in which you truly feel like you're a guest at the inn too, enjoying your limited time there while making wonderful memories.\\n\\n\r\nAs soon as you look at the poster of the show you may notice how bright the show is. It's vibrant and colourful, giving you the impression of seeing the world through the ever-upbeat main character Yuzu's eyes. Just like her you will experience everything the world has to offer for the first time. Yuzu, like the viewer, grows up raised by a human and has to learn the ways of the gods and those of the attendants from scratch. It's a journey through which the anime takes great care to lead us.\\n\r\nThere's many character moments between each of the girls and slowly we get to know them and their relationships with each other. One wants to become a priestess, the other has a hopeless romance with her childhood friend, and another is a cursed doll that's never had the joy of being played with. Being that the anime is only twelve episodes and the manga is still ongoing we don't get thorough explorations of everyone, but what we do get is enough to make me attached to these girls. By the end of the anime, I felt, like Yuzu that they were my friends. Konohanatei had turned from the rest stop at the end of my journey, into a second home.\\n\r\nIt's not just the girls that we get to know, the show is mostly centred around having various guests at Konohanatei and having Yuzu and the other girls more or less soothe or alleviate their problems. In fact I'd say that it's the guests that are the absolute highlights of the show and bring the best out in the direction and art.\\n\r\nIn episode five there's a part where Yuzu takes a slow walk through the garden, umbrella in hand for it is raining. The rain clouds darkened the sun and so the entire scenery is black and white except for  the brilliant midnight blue flowers surrounding Yuzu, and Yuzu's umbrella. The sound of the rain is accompanied by the slow plucking of an acoustic guitar and the clattering sounds of someone weaving on a loom.\\n\r\nThe combined beauty of all those elements completely sold me on the anime and now here I am, gushing about it to you, dear reader.\\n\\n\r\nThroughout the show there's many little moments like this interwoven with the usual comedy befitting a slice-of-life show. Bittersweet moments that give each character a bit of background and personality. From a retired god of battle using his old katana to create a toy for a child to an old lady carefully crafting a yukata for her daughter every moment feels like it has weight, a fleeting moment in a person's life that you get to experience alongside them.\\n\r\nThe comedic moments that come to complement the more melancholic scenes are non-disruptive. They're quite often loud and involve quite a bit of slapstick, but it feels natural. They're not here to make you laugh out loud either; they're here to relieve a little bit of the sadness.\\n\\n\r\nThe third part of the show, closely tied to the comedic side is the rather downplayed, but often brought up romantic element of the show. Almost immediately you'll be able to see couples forming in the show between the girls and the show does provide some adorable and heart-warming moments for the couples, but it never explicitly does anything. Don't expect anything like a kiss, the most you're going to get is a little bit of hand-holding. But is this necessarily a bad thing? I think not. I think it fits with the rest of the show that the romance is not explicit, that all we get are warm gestures of love, but never get to see the fruits of those gestures. In a way, it makes the viewer appreciate these little moments more putting an emphasis on the journey rather than the destination. We already know that both parties love each other, but how they show little bits of their affection during their daily lives that is what we don't know. And the anime is more than happy to show us.\\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan is the kind of show that doesn't pull or try to aggressively grab your attention every moment it can. It knows how to take its time and let the viewer be taken in by the scenery, characters or sounds. Like a proper inn attendant it only suggests things to you, and never outright orders you around lest it be rude and improper.\\n\r\nIf you want a laid-back and relaxed anime experience where you can take in all the sights and let yourself be charmed by a world of subtle magic and gods then Konohana Kitan is a great show to watch. Let yourself slip into the world it builds and enjoy your time at Konohanatei.\\n\\n\r\nAs you leave through the same old door you came in you look back one last time at the tall old inn that and at the attendants that have shown you so much hospitality. Everyone is here now seeing to your departure, seven heads with ears on them, seven tails and one little well-dressed doll. You take a deep breath of the crisp autumn air and wave one last goodbye to these wonderful people.\\n\r\nAfter taking a few steps, from behind you you hear the staff's last words to you: 'We hope you enjoyed your time at Konohanatei! Please come again!'\\n\r\nYou walk on, knowing you have still have a long road ahead of you.",

I honestly couldn't like the characters or their voices, they seem weirdto me, which made harder to watch the anime. I personally didn't love it nor hate it the anime and I cannot say I enjoy it to some extent. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend you to watch it if you are into moe anime and want to know some tales from Japan, but be aware that it has a slow pace. \\n\\n\r\n\u2510(\uff9f\uff5e\uff9f)\u250c",

He was watching with three other people, all of whom love kemonomimi, and they weren't enjoying the series as much as they could.  I, however, watched the show in spite of it being kemonomimi when I don't like the fetish of anthromorphic characters and watched it just because it's a Slice of Life... but I enjoyed it far more than the other three... Why?\r\nThis show is not character based, it's setting based.  Unlikemost SoLs, this has only a little to do with character interactions and more to do with Japanese mythology.  The characters frequently tend to gods and goddesses, and interact with them, as well as ghosts, apparitions, and other similar types of characters.  This fact has to be interesting to the viewer to truly enjoy this show.  So I highly recommend this show to fans of Touhou.",

The personalities are unique. \r\nI have experienced so much in ashort story. I appreciate each lesson I learned and will try to hold onto it. <3 I highly recommend this anime.",

            "content": "This anime was really quite the journey. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did, given it is the first anime I have watched where it's a female cast of animals. This was something I was meaning to avoid altogether since I believed they always pandered to fan service. And, well, Konohana Kitan still does to some extent, every instance of the girls taking a bath is usually never that risqu\u00e9 in a way where you feel uncomfortable due to how emotionally deep each of these scenes is.\r\nComedy does fill the essence of this anime at times as well, though it'smore lighthearted humor than it is outright hilarious; excluding a few instances in the middle and especially some bits of the last episode. If you are looking for a comedy, however, this anime will fool you into thinking it's just what I said, a lighthearted comedy. But, it will very quickly shift gears as soon as you're comfortable.\\n\\n\r\nThe emotional bond of the fox girls is enough to make you tear up at least once if you have a heart or even multiple times if you are sensitive. All of them seem to fit well with whoever they are paired with. From Yuzu and Satsuki to Ren and Natsume (these two in particular are kind of paired romantically to an extent), you will always look forward to their bonding moments. Well, I pretty much listed the only two important ones, but they do have lots of screen time with one another.\\n\\n\r\nLet us get the character types out of the way. Satsuki and Ren are your typical mature and immature tsundere types, respectively. Natsume is the hotheaded one that always wants to have some fun. And Yuzu is the typical saint character due to how compassionate and caring she is to everyone around her. A character type I thought would've annoyed me well watching, but some of the quotes she said in certain situations would sometimes be unexpectedly more powerful than they needed to be, but they were never off the mark either and I could not help but feel moved.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime gives off the vibe that it is going to move around a lot when you start up, but it quickly becomes a bottle setting faster than you expect. The locale being the Konohanatei Inn. Well, it's also a place known for customers coming to relax, as it has a hot springs. And that is primarily why you see the girls bathe a lot, so the scenes are surprisingly not there for fan service. \\n\\n\r\nOf course, you'd think them being in there already defaults it as such, but then again, wouldn't it be a bit childish if everyone was just soaped up in bubbles the whole time? Just because they are nude doesn't necessarily make it fan service! It would have if they had the perverted girl character that just wants to rub up on everyone and measure sizes, but that was not the case here. Oh, but don't worry, it's not going to show their nipples.\\n\\n\r\nOne of my favorite parts is that every episode has its own unique ending to fit the nature of the episode you just watched. So, even if you only felt a little moved during a watch, the credits may be able to throw you back into the mood. Really, I suggest not skipping them. The opening is always the same, though.\\n\\n\r\nAnd now the negatives. As usual, the tsundere type is annoying in at least one character, this time being Ren. She is really obnoxious and it is quite hard to love her, no matter how cute they make her. And she is just a little too rude to Yuzu, which really gives off the vibe she is forcing her character type. Nobody could ever be rude to a saint unless they were really a heartless person, which is exactly the vibes I get from Ren and the deeper moments she has with the other characters slowly became less meaningful due to how arrogant she is. Satsuki is in the same type, but it's not nearly as bad and you can relate to her personality much more due to her character being coherent.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, some of the supernatural stuff will make you feel lost and may throw off the writing if you are not paying attention, so I highly suggest you do not make this a \"look at the phone\" anime where you are leaving it in the background well you do other things. In particular, I got completely lost in the eighth episode, but I will not say why to avoid spoiling anything. I will say, however, that the way the plot was written was quite beautiful and, amidst my confusion, I could not help but still feel emotional in some parts of the episode.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the genre this anime is geared toward, I'd say even female viewers would be touched by the beauty this anime offers. It does indeed have a lot of bath scenes, but not really in a way where you would see them as inappropriate unless you're just a really perverted individual. And male viewers probably wound up enjoying the story it has to offer as well. Konohana Kitan is an anime worth your time, but I do suggest you watch it slowly if you have a weak heart or your eyes may be as dry as Yuzu's. Or, well, everyone really, as every character cries at least once in the anime.",

Characters have an amazing feel to them. On first glance I thought the series would just surround Yuzu, but instead it included all the characters. The art in this anime was flawless in my opinion. Bright, and beautiful. Some of the episodes might make you tear up because of the story. If you're looking for a nice, wholesome, slice of life anime that isn't centered around school life this might be a good fit. Yuri is hinted at through-out theseries, but never really outright spoken about. Traditional Japanese themes are consistent in the series.",

No problems at all.\r\nSound: Not a huge fan of the opening and ending songs. However I felt the bgm fit this show rather nicely.\r\nCharacters: You can rarely go wrong in a show that's \"Cute girls doing cute things\" I liked how theygirls were more matured then most of the girls in anime you see like this.

However they do through some serious and emotional twists into this anime which were very unexpected and made this anime a lot more enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: I felt like this was similar and different to Urara Meirochou but being a better anime in the end. It was nothing legendary but it was a great anime to watch from start to finish. I would definitely recommend at least checking it out if you're looking for cute fox girls doing cute fox girl things.",

            "content": "Spoiler free review ahead.\r\nTo note: The review will be conducted solely based on the merits of the show. I have not read the manga. As such, the existence of the source material will be ignored.\r\nThe Premise:\r\nKonohana Kitan follows the story of Yuzu and her friends as she begins her journey as an attendant at the wonderful hot springs inn, Konohanatei. It is here that they provide a relaxing stay and wonderful service to gods and other supernatural beings.\r\nThe Story:\r\nActually pretty good. The show takes on the style of having each episode as its own isolated story, and with each passing story we build on therelationships and lessons that Yuzu and her friends learn each day. While there's no particular overarching story line to follow, this can be dismissed since each of these individual instances are rather beautifully done. They do well with mixing different emotions and stories together, sometimes opting for more humorous incidents and other times choosing to chase a more serious and introspective lesson. There are some important plot points in certain stories, however, that hinge on the viewer's understanding of the show's setting, which I didn't find to be clear in the beginning. The first couple of times these things came up, I found myself confused until I pieced together the setting of the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters:\\n\r\nI found almost all of the main cast to be enjoyable. While Yuzu is undoubtedly our main character to follow, we learn quite a lot about her friends Satsuki, Ren, and Natsume. There are some secondary characters we have throughout the show that we don't see nearly enough of, as they're usually entertaining. However, when these characters do appear, they serve a very desired purpose. We see some decent character development to Yuzu as she becomes more comfortable with her position and gains confidence, but I was surprised to see the time given to others like Satsuki and Ren, and even latecomer Okiku had her moments of character development. I do feel that we were left without development or motive for the Head Attendant Kiri and the master of the house, Okami, however.\\n\\n\r\nThe Art:\\n\r\nThe art throughout the show was beautiful. Everything was very colorful, and when they needed it to not be, it wasn't. The show did a really great job of matching the visuals to the emotions that were intended to be conveyed. When art and narrative match up, it really does wonders. Character style was pretty moe, but I don't personally have any problem with that particular style. There were some great background shots, as well as environmental and ambiance effects, too.\\n\\n\r\nThe Sound:\\n\r\nThe sound was pretty good. Voice acting was spot on with the emotions trying to be conveyed, I felt. The soundtrack was nice, as well. The opening song and sequence were nice, though I skipped it most of the time, but I have to say that I can't really remember the ending sequence, nor did I feel compelled to watch and listen to it more than once.\\n\\n\r\nThe Conclusion:\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan delivered a wonderful and heart-warming slice of life option for the season. I'm a sucker for cute, and this show absolutely foot the bill in that regard. The show was one comprehensive product made up of a number of smaller stories and character interactions that were done well. If you're looking for a slice of life show to add some cuteness to your repertoire, Konohana Kitan would definitely be recommended.\\n\\n\r\nIf you've watched and enjoyed Konohana Kitan, let me also provide a recommendation for further viewing pleasure.. If you're a fan of the slice of life or hot springs setting, I would point you towards Hanasaku Iroha. It also follows a character beginning her journey as a hot springs inn attendant, and the relationships she forms as well as the challenges she overcomes during the process.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading. o/",

            "content": "SPOILER FREE\r\nplot (8/10):\r\nkonohabna kitan doesn't have one plot. every ep is usually self contained and while there are ep with plots that are connected to other eps plots it's usually something minor. this show plot is a rollercoaster. there were some really interesting and well written plot but it had a more weak then strong ep imo and even the strong ones didn't do anything that I think was really good and made me more invested in the show (one ep was really remarkable imo but there are more parts with plot that is not particularly interesting than ones that are really interesting). overall, theplot is quite good and fun at times but it's not remarkable.\\n\\n\r\nsound (7/10): \\n\r\nIll start with the voice actors. there were a few voice actors that were quite good and I really enjoyed from their performance. and while most va did a fine job overall I had a few times that I find their performance to be a bit quirky and less then what I would like or except. I personally didn't love yuzu's voice but that's a matter of your preference.\\n\r\nas for the soundtracks I personally founded them to be fine and I think they weren't used to their fullest as there were moments I found the soundtracks to be misused. overall, it was fine.\\n\\n\r\nart (9/10):\\n\r\nI think the art in this series was quite good. it was really steady and had a few moments that were beautiful. I also really liked the chibi moments as they were funny and sit the tone well. I don't think the artstyle always sat the tone of the show but it's usually does and I like it.\\n\\n\r\ncharacters (7/10):\\n\r\nthe characters is a rollercoaster as well. I think that in terms of character development there was too much to some characters and too little to others. I also think some characters had a lot of potential the character development took out of them as it felt wrong and bad for the characters. in the main cast there are more characters I dislike then like but even the characters I dislike are overall fine (most of the time). the side characters are nice overall and I think were done well for the most part.\\n\\n\r\noverall (8/10): \\n\r\nthe show is lovable and nice. it have weak points and is not the best of the season but it was a really nice surprise. I like the show and think it was done quite well overall. if you have some spare time and you look for a heartwarming show with some great characters (sakura forever!) than I recommend you to watch this.",

            "content": "(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nCircles, triangles, and rectangles begone. In Konohana Kitan, rhombuses rule as queen.\r\nA peculiar shape, that. Some people refer to it as a diamond (hence the royalty). Others, with technical knowledge of Euclidean geometry, are quick to point out that squares are special exceptions (to said rule).\r\nNo matter which side jousts first, this anime makes two ideas clear. One, a rhombus for a mouth makes for a darn cute reaction. And two, our lives have many sides and corners to hold dear.\r\nSTORY\r\nIn the ethereal space between the land of the living and the unknown beyond, apeaceful place known as Konohanatei exists. This otherworldly resort promises its guests serene views, relaxing environments, and fox-girl attendants aplenty. From weary \u201ctravelers\u201d to the very gods themselves, either by accident or with intent, these visitors (coincidentally enough) visit this small reprieve in the hopes of achieving some level of spiritual enlightenment.\\n\\n\r\nAs such, Konohana Kitan showcases not a structured plot but rather a series of individualized mini-stories (with maybe the occasional crossover here and there). These asides often live up to the premise insofar as their content often takes on an almost-unexplainable nature. One set of scenes may feature the ladies dealing with an egg that sticks to them a little too closely, and another episode may instead find an attendant shrunken in size.\\n\\n\r\nEither way, these supernatural happenings get at the anime\u2019s numerous moments filled with laughs, cuteness, and a whole lot of wholesomeness. The characters have their specific pairings which lead to nice rapports between them. They fill their actions and reactions with sincerity and embarrassment, giving an adorable edge to much of what they do. And the constant flow of their workplace causes (especially for Yuzu) what can only be described as out-of-body experiences that in turn grant a different perspective to appreciate or simply hint at a thoughtful idea worth noting.\\n\\n\r\nSuch an iyashikei story takes this triplet of aspects and applies them to its afterlife setting by delivering messages about life itself. While Konohana Kitan mostly includes simpler truths such as the value in building relationships and satisfaction of a job well-done, these snapshots of the visitors and their own lives provide a sense of sympathy for the struggles they endure and the growth, however slight, they receive. In turn, these messages leave an impression on the audience as they think about what life has similarly brought for them.\\n\\n\r\nIn this way, the viewer is just as much a guest at this storied establishment as those depicted, reveling in and warming up from the quaint atmosphere curated. Altogether, the show provides next to nothing ingenious or groundbreaking, but it gets the job done. Considering that the show essentially revolves around a job \u2013 and the (ironically written here) interruptions that guide them \u2013 it is tough to ask for much more out of this simplistic yet kindhearted narrative.\\n\\n\r\nART & ANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nTo get at its iyashikei vibes, Konohana Kitan includes many techniques on a visual front to soothe its audience into a lull of rest and relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nKey among these techniques, its main setting builds towards an idyll. Lush greenery, colorful trees, and pleasing sunshine await those who peer at the nearby gardens, evoking a sense of awe and beauty. The chill vibes of the hotel itself, replete with wooden fixtures and simplistic d\u00e9cor, likewise create a space with calmness in mind (and on the eyes).\\n\\n\r\nThe ladies\u2019 designs also contribute. Yes, they have specific looks which distinguish them from each other and their personalities. Natsume is tall and tomboyish. Kiri is mature and reserved. Ren is pretty and adorable. However, their collective details, such as the fox-girl angle and the colorful, refined outfits, not only improve upon the fantastical nature of Konohana Kitan but also get at the desired pleasantries of the visuals.\\n\\n\r\nIt also branches out beyond the respite it so heavily endorses. Imaginative moments and stylistic changes support a plethora of sequences, such as when Yuzu finds herself witnessing the birth of the world through the baby bubbles. Super-simplistic caricatures of everyone when reacting to particular events push the comedic side along, too.\\n\\n\r\nTruth be told, the show refrains from having a ton of movement, or it at least doesn\u2019t have any standout animated segments of note. But, given the rest of the artistic direction in play, the collective visual offering reaches a soothing, impressive state, indeed.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nIn an anime focused almost entirely on the guests and their own mini-stories, it wouldn\u2019t seem as if Yuzu, Satsuki, Ren, Natsume, Sakura, Kiri, and Okiku would manage to matter a whole bunch in comparison. However, Konohana Kitan strikes against this notion where it can, allowing the girls to find some semblance of meaning among the large supporting and side cast members.\\n\\n\r\nAs the star of this show (or at least the pseudo-main protagonist), Yuzu fumbles her way through her work and her duties, but she almost never loses the beaming smile on her face. Her meager backstory involving her caretaker and her drive to avoid being useless setup her humble beginnings as someone who wishes to impact others while learning more about the world around her. Better yet, she finds comfort in the fact that this place and these friends have given her a home and a family she can truly appreciate.\\n\\n\r\nThus, as an employee of this well-respected and well-established inn, Yuzu regularly helps the guests who visit as well as Satsuki and the others. She listens to their problems, and she takes each strange predicament in stride. Her constant positivity meshes well with Konohana Kitan and its mood in general, for her words and thoughts, while not exactly wisdom (since she herself has neither the age nor the experience yet to call it as such), enlighten those who listen with an optimistic outlook.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu not only dishes out this happiness but also receives some in turn. She gains perspective from them just as much as they from her, so she succeeds in growing as a character, too. Not that she has any major developments or a tangible arc to speak of. Far from it. Rather, she simply understands that these moments shape her soul, giving her an even bigger smile on her face to spread her shine that much more.\\n\\n\r\nSatsuki is another interesting character. Many sides of her person surface now and again: fearing the dark, having a stern yet considerate personality, showing lots of determination, smiling despite that sternness. However, the anime pinpoints a conflict with and about her sister that defines her motivations. It gets established early on, gets returned to during the season, and ultimately gets addressed outright. This three-step process gives Satsuki and her conflict the necessary focus they require and therefore leaves this feisty fox on a high note.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast members do not stack up to Yuzu and Satsuki in terms of importance, but they serve their own roles nonetheless. Ren and Natsume share perhaps the most open relationship between any of the implied pairings, and Konohana Kitan at least explores their connection through their mutual awareness and affection of the other. Unfortunately, in the back half of the season, they aren\u2019t around as much, falling on the wayside instead.\\n\\n\r\nAs for Sakura, Kiri, and Okiku, they round out the characters with some comedic relief. Sakura is a young girl whose curiosity and awe elicit joyous reactions. Kiri dodges any and all questions about her older age. And Okiku rides Urinosuke, her gallant (pig-like) steed, as she \u201cspars\u201d with everyone. While these ladies have their own minuscule moments, its their innocence, guidance, and difference (respectively) which provide their distinctive edge among the lot.\\n\\n\r\nThanks to Yuzu, Satsuki, Ren, Natsume, Sakura, Kiri, and Okiku, the guests of Konohanatei have a splendid time during their quick stay. And, thanks to Konohana Kitan at large, these attendants similarly have a solid outing.\\n\\n\r\nMUSIC & SOUND\\n\\n\r\nThe anime finds further success with its audio elements, and it begins with the tracks off its original soundtrack. Several heartfelt tunes of acoustic strings and wind instruments, like when Yuzu exits her dancing daze as she sees a spirit leave, tug at the soul. Tiny piano melodies elevate that slice-of-life life feel as Yuzu and the others go about their daily business. Even the simple shamisen interlude which guides the audience from Part A to Part B within an episode delights as its few heavenly notes strike a serene chord.\\n\\n\r\n\u201cKokoro ni Tsubomi\u201d, the opening track for Konohana Kitan, likewise earns a bit of praise. A soft start gives way to drums and to bass that set the stage for an eventual optimistic flourish. The benign vocals complement the piece, and the airy delivery and light instrumentation in general prep the audience for simplistic yet positive times ahead.\\n\\n\r\nListening to the characters, the voice-acting performances have their place, too. Yuuko Oono as Yuzu brims with kindness in her attitude and manner of speaking, and Risa Kubota as Ren is cute in her arrogant yet embarrassed ways. While almost nobody particularly stands out, Ms. Oono and Ms. Kubota, the former in only her second major role and the latter in her actual first major role, show promise in their future careers by backing this anime project with some nice VA work.\\n\\n\r\nAnd finally, Konohana Kitan composes four main different ending tracks that the audience can embrace: \u201cHaru Urara, Kimi to Sakihokoru\u201d, \u201cNatsusaki Koihanabi\u201d, \u201cAkanezora, Kimi Mau Kouyou no Sanpomichi\u201d, and \u201cYukihana Kirameku Ieji nite\u201d. They correspond to the changing seasons, and their structure and sounds do the same. A refreshing spring\u2019s warmth. A fun-filled summer\u2019s day. A calm autumn\u2019s air. A slow winter\u2019s evening.\\n\\n\r\nThese EDs are not necessarily incredible or memorable. However, hearing the anime go out of its way to switch up these songs multiple times throughout its run must certainly count in some regard. For, if nothing else, they clearly went above the average one-cour show by having more than one to begin with.\\n\\n\r\nThus, with the original soundtrack, voice acting, opening track, and ending tracks doing pretty well overall, the audio decisions follow the presentation of the visuals by benefiting the show and working in its favor.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nThis anime made it its mission to win me over. Yuri undertones. A sweet direction. Fun characters. The cuteness ran deep, and the happiness was palpable, so it was pretty much impossible to dislike this show along the way.\\n\\n\r\nYuzu as a munchkin was super-cute as well, and the show in general almost never strayed far from such a path. Its moe-ness seeped in-between each of the more serious spots it depicted, so the constant switching between thoughtfully sincere and wonderfully adorable brought about a fluffy feeling that I quite liked.\\n\\n\r\nI also got a kick out of the author of the source material popping into frame or even certain scenes now and again. That\u2019s a level of meta not often achieved. And, on a grander scale, the themes of the anime, while perhaps overly saccharine on occasion, had me liking it even more. I\u2019m someone who personally tries to find and see the good in life, and so having each event spin towards such goodness aligned with my own ideals.\\n\\n\r\nAltogether, I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to declare this show a favorite of mine. But I do like what it did and what it set out to accomplish, creating a nice anime both in its execution and in its portrayal.\\n\\n\r\nKonohana Kitan may not be the most impressive cloud up in heaven, but it answers at least a few prayers for those who seek healing salvation. The visuals are pretty, the mini-stories are simple but appreciable, the music hits the right mood, and the characters bring different advantages when they so choose. It\u2019s no diamond per se, but a rhombus is a-okay, too.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Fine, an iyashikei narrative which features supernatural happenings, a wholesome atmosphere, and life messages to take to heart\\n\\n\r\nArt & Animation: Good, beautiful scenery, varied designs, and stylistic choices form strong artistry with calmness in mind even if movement rarely stands out\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Fine, Yuzu becomes the backbone for this tale, Satsuki goes through her own arc of sorts, Ren and Natsume have a clear relationship, and Sakura, Kiri, and Okiku round out the collective with comedic chances\\n\\n\r\nMusic & Sound: Good, heartfelt tracks from the OST, an optimistic OP, some promising VA performances, and seasonal EDs demonstrate the strength of the audio elements\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Good, happiness and goodness abounds\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 6/10",
