            "content": "The award for the most misleading title goes to\u2026! \r\nProbably not A Sister\u2019s All You Need (AKA: Imouto Sae Ireba Ii) but it\u2019s a pretty damn misleading name. \r\nIt\u2019s definitely caused a bit of confusion for people deciding whether to watch it or avoid it like the plague, so before I start the review I feel like it\u2019s necessary to say what this show is and what it isn\u2019t.\r\nThis show isn\u2019t...\r\n-A little sister romance.\r\n-A rip off of Eromanga-sensei.\r\n-Ecchi, but there are few over-the-top lengthy fanservice scenes.\r\n-A kids' show, despite how the characters appear.\r\n-The horrifying events that occur in the first 3 minutes. It gets betterafter that, I swear.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is\u2026\\n\r\n-About the ups and downs of being an artist.\\n\r\n-A character study. Yes, I know how silly that sounds, but this show is about the characters, not the story.\\n\r\n-A (perverted) gag comedy.\\n\r\n-Unfiltered. Characters do and say what they please. Be prepared to laugh and possibly to be offended.\\n\\n\r\nNo time is spared in establishing the perverted tone.  Within the first three minutes of episode one, the main character\u2019s horrifying sister fantasy is shown to the audience in grotesque detail. Later it\u2019s shown that the main character\u2019s editor is reading then spitefully denying his appalling work as he drops the script to the table (not unlike how I initially dropped the show after only that first scene). The start of the show may be a bit alienating to anyone who isn\u2019t prepared for a siscon, but it does a good job of preparing you for the show\u2019s absurdity even if no other scene reaches the heights of the first few minutes. Don\u2019t take this as praise though. The show knows where the line is between too much fanservice is, and it purposefully crosses it to get you to think about how disgusting the whole fantasy is. It\u2019s self-deprecating for sure, but that\u2019s part of the charm.\\n\\n\r\nA sister obsessed light novel writer, his younger stepsister, a perverted novelist, his plain jane friend, and a few more writers and publishers make up the cast. The story is small in scale, but it gives the characters plenty of room to develop. The main character struggles to come up with new material and jokes ensue around him in his distraction. He gets some absurd story ideas turned down by his editor. He spends a lot of time in his apartment with his friends playing games, telling jokes, talking about anime, and this all brings about plenty of funny perverted gag humor. If you can\u2019t gel with perverted humor then I don't think this is the show for you, but give it a chance beyond just judging a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nDespite looking and acting like teenagers, the characters are used to adult life and often show their wisdom in conversations. They can be really perverted at times and seem like sickos but over time they grew on me. Through great moments of the character\u2019s reflecting on themselves you\u2019re able to get into their heads and understand why they are and what motivates them. For the characters to be so well developed it becomes easy to get invested in the ups and downs of their lives as they become adults. We learn about what formed them into the people they are through the many outgoing conversations they have with each other. They\u2019re not perfect friends and their chemistry isn\u2019t totally perfect, but the way they clash adds to their believability. I find myself justifying their actions no matter how deplorable by referring to the minor details that built their foundations as people. \\n\\n\r\nAll of their weird quirks just make them so believable, the weird insistence on sisters that Itsuki has, how Nayuta only writes naked, and Miyako\u2019s jealousy of lives of her interesting friends. We know these characters for more than just their weird quirks. We seek how they interact with one another, not just the main character, we get a sense of what their lives are like outside of Itsuki's apartment. Even the supporting cast of publishers, freelance artists, writers, mangaka, and just normal people all have expressive enough personalities to carry the show for the brief time that they appear to offer some wisdom or humor. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t gauge characters based on how realistic they may seem, I gauge them on believability. Could the characters in Imouto Sae Ireba Ii exist? Probably not, but after seeing what formed them into the people they are I\u2019m a bit more inclined to believe. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 7/10] Practically a slice of life. No ending. \\n\r\n[Character: 8/10] Well written, they offer a lot to think on. Believable.\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10] Lots of sitting, not a ton of animation. Some hilarious imagination scenes.\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] Simple op that gets minor changes from time to time, very chill ed. \\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8/10] Unfiltered comedy, surprisingly emotional drama, drawn-out fanservice scenes.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7.4/10]\\n\r\nNot every joke lands, but enough do to keep it enjoyable. What had me coming back to it week after week was the realistic drama mixed in randomly with the zany comedy that would surprise me when my guard was down. The characters evolved into people I actually liked, not just the stupid pandering archetypes I initially pegged them to be. \\n",

            "content": "This season of anime was one to look forward to, with popular series like Umaru and Gintama gaining new additions to their story. However there were a couple of new additions that have stood out as well (namely Blend S and Mahoutsukai no Yome). That being said Imouto sae ireba is my pick of this season. The reason simply being because its good at its genre. Compared to Blend S forgetting about the settings of their MC (I can only assume it has something to do with wanting the audience to actually like her) and Mahoutsukai no yome merely touching upon dependence rather than love,Imouto Sae Ireba is a story about a group of people finding their direction in life.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nA lot of you who just watched the first episode are probably bloody confused, the first 5 minutes in nothing but ecchi, and cringey ecchi on top of that. But thats where the protagonist fits in, his love is cringey/unconditional due to the experiences he has had in life, however this series focuses as much on the MC as it does everyone else, meaning that towards the end there is only one character who really brings forth these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is episodic and whilst there are buildups that helps with the flow, that being said its not one of those exciting ones, just a warm and fuzzy story which is why I cannot give it a great score despite my liking it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a bit more different from the usual anime,  that is not to say it isn't good, but its something to bear when watching the thing. There isn't much to say aside from that, but I do know some who were slightly put off by this art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOpening was great, thats one thing all the new anime have in common this season. But the actual bgm/ost in this doesn't really stand out. Once again simply because of the type of anime, but for the most part it compliments the story and doesn't feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime stands out for me, with an anime like this the characters are the focus and the story is merely a means to compliment them. You have the passionate MC who as I've mentioned before is slightly eccentric, the reason for this was explored slightly too late for my taste, a mistake a lot of anime make, but even without the reasoning it should be too hard to empathize with. On top of that you have a small assortment of females, each with their own reason for being there and supporting the MCs. That being said there is none of the typical cat fights that go on in so many anime, instead its more of a slow paced romance that eventually falls into place.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between characters is rather dynamic and there are many small changes in the story that put said relationships to the test, which is always good to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally put 9 in my score, but 8.5 is probably slightly more accurate. A good one to watch if you have the time and managed to muddle your way past the first episode but for those who are expecting an ecchi incest anime its probably better to give this one a miss.",

            "content": "Y'know, the realization of writing reviews on this site for four years comes with some vague existentialism of wondering if anyone actually reads the things that I write, or if I've actually improved cause these things are just sort of self-proofread without my outside opinion.  Bah, I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let's just get into this thing.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst off, ignore the first five minutes.  As a writer, Hashima Itsuki is peculiar.  After getting an earful from his editor for the umpteenth time, he goes off on his usual schpeel about the greatness that is the 'imouto', before being promptly told to takehis work seriously and get his shit done on time, like any novelist with a deadline.  And so, that's...basically where our story starts.\\n\\n\r\nBased solely on its cast, Imouto Sae (that's my shorthand this time around) is a slice of life romp seen through the eyes of its literature-based cast as Itsuki and the rest of the main cast do what writers do.  Each episode is focused on the character interactions between the cast, whether it be for research for someone's book or spending time with one another through games that act more as a creative exercise for their brains.  The show's naturally lax nature exudes the slice of life genre, utilizing a brand of conversational humor with the main focus being what the oddities that are its characters and how they are as people as the brunt of its comedic prowess.  On the outside, not much really happens since episode after episode, it's basically the same thing, but slowly, we watch as more minute and complex matter arise.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the show ever so slightly shaves away its naturally fluffy and slice of life feel and touches upon the 'writer's struggle', or at least those relating to LN authors that adds more to the show.  We sort of see the individual problems that each of the authors in the show face, touching upon different personal problems that add a nice subtlety to the overall story as the sunshine and rainbow of everything we see sheds away for that brief, sober moment amidst the characters' happily drunk nature being published authors.  \\n\\n\r\nYet despite that, the one problem I see from the show is that nothing seems to change.  Sure there're events that lead one thing to another, but because the slightly deeper moments of the show fade away once they're over and leave but a shadow of their impact, much of what we get is the status quo which, while amusing, poses a problem when the moments of deeper thought were only just a few minutes ago.  The ending also leaves a lot of loose ends that I'm not particularly fond of.  Kind of like a 'read the manga' ending, but not so assholeish that they stop in the middle of some plotline that you'll never get an answer to. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Provides a nice look into the 'writer's struggle'\\n\r\n+ Never melodramatic despite being a show featuring interpersonal relationships and such\\n\r\n-  Tends to stick too much to the status quo\\n\r\n-  A bit too many loose ends by the end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nA connoisseur of the little sister, Hashima Itsuki is the writer of a magic academy series, or by its other name, 'trash'.  (I jest, I jest.)  Initially seen as nothing but a pervert too prideful in his own work, Itsuki has many moments where his inferiority shows through the cracks, and the cheerful facade that we see through most of the show slowly fades away as he reveals his own insecurities as a writer.  As someone who's also been guilty of saying  \"I'm not good enough\" to myself, I find Itsuki to exemplify much the internal battle inside someone who writes, with just enough of this hidden side of him to give us a proper character.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite that subtle complexity, the true star of the show (at least in my eyes) is Nayuta herself, the popular 18 year old novelist who from episode one has never stopped trying to get into Itsuki's pants without committing a crime in the process.  A natural prodigy at writing, much of her story lies in the events that led her to becomes the girl that we see her as now.  It's less of a writer's struggle, and more of a personal struggle, but all the same is done in a way that adds just enough to her character to give us the viewer some more information.  Aside from that though, Nayuta acts much like a supplementary character to Itsuki, giving him the drive to be the writer he always wanted to be.  Their relationship is cute, and I personally really like the direction they went to explain why things between the two are the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nTo round out the quartet, both Miyako and Haruto act as similar characters with their issues, boasting a personal and professional struggle respectively that again, adds enough to their characters to bolster and solidify their problems as looming parts of their lives, like how normal people are.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from them, the cast is filled with a cast of colorful weirdos that spice up the gaps that the main cast leaves behind.  Everything from an accountant who takes joy in the squirming in others to a mangaka who wears a ribbon of questionable material provides us with a weird yet amusing spectrum that makes the episodes that much more fun.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Rounded main cast\\n\r\n+ Amusing side cast\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Silver Link, the show replicates the original artist Kantoku's style of the slightly muted color palette in conjunction of super shiny, almost reflective hair that's commonplace in the works he draws for.  Art quality is very consistent throughout due to the show's severe lack of need for any taxing animation (since everyone basically just sits around), and stands as a nice relaxing sight without anything bad to note.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as fanservice goes, the show does have several choice moments that are certainly more risque than what the rest of the show is in comparison, but it's super tame, and if it ever gets out of hand, the show goes to use its various colorful slides with text on the front for 'censorship'.  One of the most amusing ways to censor something if you ask me.  (Though I will admit that Nayuta is the cause of most if not all of these so blame her.)  Most of the perverted comedy is done through innuendos and spoken words, so visually, it's not severely apparent.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent quality\\n\r\n+/- Some fanservice, but not much\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nChouchou's \"Ashita no Kimi sae Ireba Ii.\" stands as a song that when combined with the visuals, harkens to the whimsy that authors feel when writing their works, the wonder than a person feels when they put their imagination on paper.  Personally, I feel like many of her other songs are more memorable, but this is no way a bad song and given the placement and usage of this song in the series, certainly has its impact.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, Aria Yuuki's \"Donna Hoshizora yori mo, Donna Omoide yori mo\" is a more somber piece that ends the episode on a calming and closing note that compared to the slightly more energetic whimsy of its OP counterpart, gives us pleasing resolution to the episode rather than some seiyuu song or something that doesn't have much impact  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nice and whimsical tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think my first reaction to watching this show's PV was 'Yes'.  Not for really any particular reason, but it just seemed like the show I was really going to like.  And surprise surprise, it was.  It has the quality of touching on the personal problems and the insecurities and stress of making a good story and making a name for yourself in the publishing world without succumbing to melodrama or any kind of super contrived storyline which is refreshing in a landscape where anything drama-based resorts to melodrama.  It's a show I watched because I was intrigued, but stayed because I genuinely resonated with the characters having had tinges of these problems myself when writing stuff in my own time.  So for that, I appreciate this show and am really glad that this was something on my seasonal list.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't sung enough praises about my enjoyment of this show, then yes, I did like the show.  In particular, I really like Nayuta.  I'm always a fan of girls who know what they want and earnestly strive for that person they love because often times you get tsunderes or some other stupid trope of girls undeserving of the happy ending they get in the end without rhyme or reason.  (Abuse is not love, girls)  But more than that, the relationship both professional and personal between Itsuki and Nayuta stands as one of my absolute favorite things of the show because there is reason why Itsuki doesn't take the plunge and overall gives more depth to the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly irked me, but my only wish is that somehow they continue this.  The loose ends were vaguely irritating and given the setup that we were given in the last few minutes, a sequel is all the more possible from that.  (We do not talk about the first five minutes of the entire show.  That shit is repressed.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I say yes.  Though the show is infamous for the first five minutes of the first episode, if you do get past that gate (and trust me, there is an explanation), you are in for a slice of life adventure that really is more than meets the eye.  It's a lax show focused entirely on its characters and their interactions, taking time every now and then to expand upon its cast to smooth and polish them out a little more for depth.  Plus it's got a nice helping of wackiness that makes things a helluva lot more entertaining than it should.",

            "content": "When this anime started airing, I had high expectations because it had lots of potential and seemingly good characters but sadly all that went downhill mid season and it felt like an annoying chore having to watch the episodes weekly and even if that wasn't enough, it even ended in the most abruptly and weird way possible.\r\nSPOILER ALERT.\r\nAt the beginning of the anime we had the MC who always tries his hardest at writing and yet somehow he doesn't make it big, we also knew that the MC had to deal with people who were much better and more creative than him so he alwaysfelt inferior to them and that as a setting was very good and I thought we were gonna see some good drama from that but nope all that ended after episode 3 or something.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : The anime was extremely random and didn't follow any route or try to create and continue anything that it started.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime then went after 2 routes:\\n\\n\r\nthe first route was the game reviews we see in 4 or 5 episodes out of 12 which ruined a lot of things, it was pretty much filler at this point, some of them were nice but when 1/3 of the anime is game reviews then it isn't really helping it's case, is it? I mean if I wanted to watch game reviews I would open Youtube.\\n\\n\r\nthe second route was the \"Every Male character has to have a Female character to end up with at the end\" route and it is self explanatory when you think about it, while I do hate those shitty cliches that wasn't the reason I hated this one, what I hated about this route is that it was extremely forced, one of the characters turned into a molester and yet the female character acted like nothing happened after that, The MC was suddenly in love with the heroine which is pretty illogical because at that time if he were to love someone it would be Miyako not the heroine, Haruto suddenly fell in love with a Miyako and that was pretty much the only thing that could be acceptable out of all the stuff that happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that even after all that the anime didn't go through with neither the important stuff we wanted to see nor those routes it started, some episodes were genuinely funny and enjoyable so I have to give them that but the premise the anime had at the start vanished and it felt like watching an episodic anime where each episode has nothing to do with the others and that definitely wasn't what the anime was supposed to be like at least not from the start, after all that the anime ended in a bad way,the backstory we should have known about at an earlier stage (IMO) was finally out in the finale and a game review with pretty much the characters ending in a way that shows absolutely 0 character progression and lots of stuff that was supposedly meant to be resolved was left out just like that, even the part with the molester was supposed to be an introduction to the relationship of the little sister with the guy and yet even that didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a disappointment tbh and a complete waste of what could've been a great slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give the anime a generous 5/10.\\n\r\nWouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "100% spoiler-free. I write this review having seen only the anime, and mentioning only what is revealed in the synopsis above.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii:\r\n\"Normie Barrier\"\r\n\"Fanservice-driven\"\r\n\"Trash\"\r\nI think every one of these labels is a great and common excuse for many people to stop or avoid watching this series. I think each is painfully inaccurate. I'll explain why I believe that is true, and why I believe this is possibly the best series I've seen this year so far (clearly it is not yet finished). \r\nAnime, manga, and light novels are experiencing a dearth of material to bring the high school audience into early adulthood. How doessomeone in or graduating college relate to the struggles of high school, which they are quickly forgetting? I wholeheartedly believe that Imouto sae Ireba Ii fills that gap in a meaningful way. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime each represent the difficulties and insecurities of being in your 20's, whether that is through a feeling of inferiority, purposelessness, or pressure to succeed. The art and production aid the expression of these feelings with intimate depictions of each person that feel deliberate and compelling. There is a communal feeling in this series that is born out of a rich tapestry of relationships, allowing us to learn more about the characters without so much of the explicit and forced exposition common in the slice of life genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this series also demands greater scrutiny than a simple rehearsal of tropes. Viewers receive much of the humor from understanding things about the relationships between characters that they never could, and that pays off more with each episode. Music is mixed and reworked to frame scenes and enhance the comedic pacing. Humor is also drawn from some very common themes and concepts within the Imouto genre, especially the \"meta\" approach to storytelling, considering the protagonist is a light novel writer. The self-referential approach to comedy here is not necessarily unique, but Yomi Hirasaka accomplishes it with measured grace that tends to avoid pandering for attention.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on, I want to take a hard look at the aforementioned labels/criticisms of Imouto sae Ireba Ii.\\n\\n\r\n\"Normie Barrier\"\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's favorite talking point seems to be the beginning of this show. I will not waste time explaining why art needs a chance, but I will say that the storytelling proves itself to be demonstrative. Instead of being handed a list of the likes and dislikes of a character, viewers are shown through reactions and fantasies. Showing instead of telling is something far too many anime forget to do, especially for such a visual medium. Things that shock or confuse you can be difficult to ingest, but sometimes that reaction is necessary as a narrative device.\\n\\n\r\n\"Fanservice-driven\"\\n\\n\r\nIf this series were driven by fanservice, it would be immensely different. I find myself laughing more often than not when it occurs, and I believe there are subtle cues that differentiate the depictions of this anime's characters from ecchi anime. I believe that the art does not contain the sort of detail in suggestive scenes that portends fanservice. I also think that the development of the characters justifies most instances of fanservice that occur. Is there fanservice for fanservice's sake? Probably. Is it a driving narrative force at any point in the show? Absolutely not.\\n\\n\r\n\"Trash\"\\n\\n\r\nThis show is in part about people with hobbies or occupations that ostracize them, and that is completely intentional. We cannot hope to understand the development of a siscon author writing novels without getting behind what makes him that. There can be a compelling story that does not focus on a main character with a traditional background or psyche. We do not need to be able to project ourselves on to any of the characters to relate to them, and that is the beauty of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this said, there is a reason that I give this anime a 9 instead of a 10, and that is because I have to admit that there have been one or two short, one-off scenes that display some sexually aggressive behavior that does not have a purpose in the story. I did not think that these moments felt cohesive, and I am tempted to disregard them in my enjoyment, but I cannot ignore their presence in this review. \\n\\n\r\nIn summation: Imouto sae Ireba Ii is a compelling representation of the trials and tribulations that come after realizing you've grown up. This show displays a storytelling prowess that stems from the honesty with which it delves into relationships, and the synchronicity of its art and music. The common criticisms of this show seem unwarranted in the face of its intentionality, but that isn't something that a viewer could hope to fully understand in just one or two episodes. I encourage everyone to form their own opinion of this show, because the carefulness of its writing and production more than deserves that much.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "A lot of people say this is just an Ero-manga sensei rip-off. That's not the case at all.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii is an anime totally different from what Ero-manga sensei was. First, because the main character can be portrayed as an actual writer. Yes, he writes about little sisters, but he does things writers actually do in their life, and not just writers I have done some of those myself. \r\nThe story is one which portrays a man who is driven by his wish to write about his fantasies, but his editor doesn't allow them. There are also some of his friends who are writers.The people he meets with and works with aren't only women. This story revolves around the weird life this writer has to go through after he meets people who are as weird as him. They also explain well how he has helped those people in the past. Therefore, this story doesn't revolve around ecchi and female secondary characters unlike some other stories which take that path.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound it's good. If you haven't heard the opening it's not too strong and more of a soft melody that you might enjoy listening. The ed is a good acoustic guitar+voice and it's relaxing as well. The voice actors play aren't bad so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are different and each lets us know their qualities as well as how their interaction and time spent with the main character has gone. They aren't all over the place and create different moods when they appear. One can say each character gives life to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMany compare this to Ero-manga sensei but it shouldn't be compared at all. They take completely different paths in their stories and character development, and eventhough the main characters are both writers. They differ in so many ways that it's not similar at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a good series that helps relax after watching the dramatic, intense animes of the season. It's light and it also has somethings we can familiarize with that the characters take part in.",

            "content": "First and foremost, people need to stop judging this anime without actually watching it. So many of the reviews I see here are completely inaccurate, and it's pissing me off. Please? Actually watch the anime? Thank you?\r\nNow, getting into the meat of my review; this anime is not your run of the mill generic imouto anime. I actually can't stand that genre, and always drop it. In fact, I have refused to even touch Oreimo. HOWEVER, this has almost no focus on little sisters at all plot wise. The main character himself is obsessed with little sisters, but spoilers, doesn't actually obsess over a realsister. Instead, you watch his interactions with his friends, his struggle to become a successful author, and his journey towards being someone he can be proud of. Each and every character in the anime has a story. They each own a flaw, and their personalities are all memorable. Although there's some stupid crap that pops up every now and then, like the first 5 minutes of the first episode, there's so much more to the anime than meets the eye. I never ever write reviews, and in fact this is my first one. It's not like this is my number 1 favorite anime or anything, (ATLA all the way idc I know it's a cartoon)  (also konosuba <3) but it deserves a higher rating than just 6.79. Seriously??? You're giving this anime a 6.79??? The music isn't like orchestral, but I personally enjoy it a lot. The art is beautiful, with an extra wallpaper-esque picture at the end of each episode (which is a courtesy might I add). The plot is really light-hearted and fun with a dark undertone that is actually expanded upon. The characters are all unique, quirky, flawed, and relatable. As for enjoyment, frankly it is something I look forward to watching each week. People are just band-wagoning over anime like Black Clover, complaining about how crap it is, and then continue to watch it while completely disregarding actually quality anime like this one. This anime shows the struggles of being an author, the struggles of failure, and struggles of being unable to express your true feelings. I can relate to a lot of what goes on in this anime, and it always leaves a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I know this review sounded like a rant, but I don't care. How would you like it if your hard work was disregarded by the majority because they just assumed that it was \"like the rest of the genre\". It's like the racism of entertainment. This anime deserves respect, and it is 100% worth giving a try. Now while in my opinion it's probably more of a 8.5 to 9 out of 10, I'll give it a 10/10 to help balance out the ignorant fools who give it 1s and 2s without actually watching it.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, you might like it more than you think you will :)",

            "content": "Do you like little sisters? Good, because our protagonist Itsuki loves them probably more than you do. I give this anime an overall score of 6, but that does not mean I think it is distasteful. In fact I think that some people will give this anime a 8 or 9, maybe even a 10. This review is a spoiler-free review by the way, but it would not hurt for people who have watched this anime already to read this review too. \r\nStory:\r\nI acknowledge how the story may seem non linear at times, but I assure you that this anime actually has an excellent narrative.The overall plot is Itsuki, an aspiring author, making his way through the light novel industry while passing through hardships. It is a story of friendship and comedy for the most part, but I would pay more attention to the background. This story is actually about a depressed young man who fights against reality, diving into his own form of escapism, probably retreating into his perverted light novels, only to realize how his peers have earned successes that he has yet to earn himself. For instance, one of his friends is a much more talented writer while the other has an anime in the works. Itsuki deals with his issue by not caring about it. As the anime goes on, you will find Itsuki making peace with himself, and I feel that this narrative would be enjoyable for literally anyone who has felt at least a taste of depression. The flaw to this narrative, however, is that it lacks a dark theme since this narrative only lies in the background, but the anime makes it obvious enough for an attentive audience to peace this together. So now that I have pointed out where your attention should be, I think you would find the story to be at least above average. (8)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nGiven the silver link art quality, I thought this anime would be able to use art to its advantage. I was right in some parts as the art is often used to show Itsuki's room clearly and everything outside as a foggy and generic setting. Although it gives the impression that Itsuki himself views the rest of the world as irrelevant, I feel that scenes where some of the girls are naked are more horrific rather than enjoyable. Now that I'm here, I would like to emphasize that the fan service is not good. I'm not a personal fan of fan service, but the anime is willing devote 5 minutes every two episodes to only showing fan service to the reader. (6)\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst category for good reason. So I did not hear anything in the background, I do not know why. Maybe it is to illustrate how Itsuki is living in the real world, but I think it is because the show did not have enough budget. Nevertheless the opening and ending are great, but I think the overall soundtrack could be used to describe the anime's overall mood rather than a deafening silence. (4)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned how this anime is actually a narrative of a depressed young man. That was a lie. This anime is really a narrative about multiple depressed people that hide their flaws from each other. I'm not going to say any spoilers, but I will just say that every episode has a little crack of the character and you will enjoy, or sympathize, with the character when he or she breaks. (8)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPlease take this category with a grain of salt. I thought it was at best fair. I could see how other people would enjoy this anime more than I did because I really liked the episodes when the characters played board games, showing there inner flaws or making a spoof of another popular work, but I thought that the overall silence of the anime was very unfavorable. I suggest that you just pay attention to the character's dialogue because they really are interesting at times, and I also recommend that you treat this anime as a totally different work from the likes of Shirabako or any other anime with a Japanese entertainment industry. (6)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has its ups and downs, but I just have to give it a little more than average. I predict that there will be many who enjoy this and many who don't, but it's really a coin toss. Would you be willing to toss that coin? I would. There is something for anybody in this anime, but if you are more of a edgy type of guy I would say this anime is not for you. (6)",

            "content": "Many people will probably dismiss Imouto sae Ireba Ii. as another Eromanga-Sensei, or straightly drop the show after seeing the first minutes of Episode 1. People can\u2019t blame them since the first episode was a giant normie filter. \r\nNevertheless, you shouldn\u2019t judge it based on just the first impression.\r\nIf you\u2019re someone who\u2019s new to watching anime, or someone who\u2019s not comfortable watching 'unconventional' scenes, then this anime will probably throw you off. There\u2019s a huge amount of sexual comments even in the first episode. The show doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to fan service. It\u2019s a giant normie barrier. \r\nYour normie friend will gocrazy watching this show.\\n\r\nBut if you can overlook these things, there are many things that this anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nLet's skip discussing the plot and focus on two things that makes this anime good.\\n\\n\r\nOn Being Informative:\\n\\n\r\nThese are just small details, but the little explanation they add on some topics was a nice addition. For instance, the hometown tax, a system introduced in Japan in 2008, was briefly mentioned and explained in episode 4 of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou just learned about taxes in an anime that has \u201cImouto\u201d in its name. The anime also gives information about different things like drinks every episode. An example of that is the daiginjo sake featured in Episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nNowadays, it's not common to find an anime that can both inform and entertain the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOn the Characters' Interactions:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the good things about this anime is the characters\u2019 interactions. It\u2019s nothing spectacular but it\u2019s definitely enjoyable. Scenes like Haruto and Itsuki getting teased, Miyako sympathizing with everyone, or when Itsuki struggles to meet the deadlines. We even get a general idea about the life of Light Novel authors in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo..\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Imouto sae Ireba Ii.?\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t something spectacular, but it definitely has many things to offer. It\u2019s a great and enjoyable anime that doesn\u2019t have any complicated plot. Give it a try and watch a few episodes before deciding if you like it or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give it 8/10.\\n",

            "content": "At first, going into this anime, the first impression gave you of it is simple and filled with fanservice. However, it ends only there; it will just be another one of those all so famous Imouto anime you see nowadays. However, that's quite the false alarm, because, for me, I was pleasantly surprised to find out what this anime is actually like. \r\nIt's nothing like what you might think at first glance; it's a lot more and to put it easy, its delightful, quirky romance with a dash of a slice of life added in the mix. I won't deny you will see fanservice nowand then, but then again, a tiny bit of ecchi has never hurt anybody. If it doesn't shove it in your face and it feels like a natural aspect to the anime, I don't see any issues with it.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows a novelist, Itsuki Hashima who is quite obsessed with little sisters and tries to revolve his work around that. His goal is to one day create the ultimate younger sister novel. Despite its weird background for the plot, the anime delves into some realistic themes \u2014 both in his work and outside of life.  The anime is simple and straightforward, but it was a very entertaining watch for me, more than I am willing to admit. I would not mind a sequel because of that. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this kind of anime fits nicely, and it doesn't seem lacking from my understanding. It's cute, and moe, but have this certain mature vibe to it. I don't know how to put it any other way. Adding on, the facial expression and comedic moments hits well, and you don't see yourself yawning over how boring the art style is. It's simple but compliments the anime well and suits it well for this kind of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all colorful and quirky; no one feels flat or dull. They all have something about them that can entertain you. Especially, a certain silver-haired female, Nayuta Kani. Without going too much into spoilers, let's say she is with a doubt one the reasons I liked this anime and want more. Her personality is so refreshing, and it's not something you see that much of anymore. She is to put it in laymen terms, quite the daredevil and unpredictable an overall super fun character to watch on screen, as her shenanigans with Itsuki unfold. \\n\\n\r\nShe is my favorite character among everyone, but you have a good cast in here that feels alive and important. They are not just there to be there. The story might as well be around them, although, there is a set goal for our main character, Itsuki, that's no the only main focus here. It goes into the issue with making a light novel, romance problems which are handled realistically and don't come as forceful: even family issues and more, like the common problem you happen to come upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime from start to finish; I never taught it was tedious or boring. Sure, some arc did feel slightly rushed and certain moments with the game they were playing was kind of weird, I wanted them to focus more on the characters instead of that. This is my only gripe if you take into mind it was only a 13-episodes long first season. If it had more to offer, I would probably ignore it altogether. Also, mainly this is just a tiny gripe, nothing more or less. My overall enjoyment for this anime was barely affected by this one thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe bigger issue is that there is no sequel for this anime, and although, it's not a negative aspect by itself, it does fit in here so, there is that. However, all said and done; I never had any problems that made me want to drop it or yawn as I was watching it. It was a good watch, and I am hoping we get a sequel soon, or I might start the light novel instead. Since, I am very curious where it will go in the future, what more problems will arise and... I do want more Nayuta, so there is that too.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was quite a pleasant surprise, one I am glad I did not skip over and got to experience. It had a surprisingly good cast of characters, and it was kind of it to delve into some realistic theme making it for an exciting and fresh watch if nothing else. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind ecchi and want something slightly different than the other anime which falls in the same category as this one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Scores\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 8.2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10\\n\\n",

Its just fun to watch no more no less.\\n\\n\r\nART [8]\\n\r\nThe art is pretty good. well why I'm scoring 8 because its to much loli wherever I'm turn my head, its not to good for your health.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND [9]\\n\r\nthe opening very nice made, I love it so much. For the backsound itself very well, natural and flowing with the story.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER [8] \\n\r\nThey have good character, they build it very well, they build a very good \\n\r\nin each character's personality, because its the main theme in this series. Every person has itself personality.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT [10]\\n\r\nI love it, and I enjoyed the story so much! So much fun , not confusing, or something make blown your mind.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL [10]\\n\r\neven this anime is very standard plot and so so, but I'm very pleased with it. It fun to watch and refreshing.\\n\\n\r\nI will update my review when the series ended. like i say before if there is any wrong words, or bad grammar, please do not hesitate to tell me, I really appreciate it\\n\\n\r\nthanks for reading.",

The first two minutes are COMPLETELY different from the rest of the show and is only there for comedic effect (something it overdoes actually.)\r\nThis show is definitely brilliant if you give it a chance, that being said it's not for every anime watcher. For a nice comedic and a little bit of a slice of life anime I highly recommend this.\r\nDo note that some of the humour is aimed at an older audience and some humour might be too sexual for youngerviewers",

The first 6 episodes were essentially just memes, dick jokes and character introductions/getting us used to the dynamic of the characters. However, episode 8 brought a fairly interesting turn. I noticed early on, that the Romance in this Anime was kinda lacking. But, episode 8 changed that. After seeing episode 8, I can confirm that there is still hope left, and that this could potentially end pretty well. I won't spoil anything, but ifyou must, you can skip to episode 6 and start there (I say start at episode 6, because episode 6 sets up for episode 7). Aside from that, just go try this Anime out. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The main character actually has a little brother. He looks and sounds female, but he's a dude. So this isn't really an incest/imouto Anime, but rather the main character just likes imoutos.",

Just because people like watching anime, or reading manga or novel they can know how the writer feel. \r\n- Story -\r\nI like the story, it seems to be comedy, romance but somehow it shows appeal of each character. For each character, they have problem that show in certain episode, and it show how each character solved their problem. \r\n- Character -\r\nItsuki, has serious side that show him how he loves little sister. This character show their other side in story. Kani, she fall in love with itsuki because itsuki help solving her problem in past.Miyako, itsuki's friends from college, she has kind character. I like how the character being develope in story, when the problems come to each character and solved it.\\n\r\n- Overall -\\n\r\nI like the story because it has similar genre to Eromanga-sensei, but it has more serious story. Just because the tittle A Sister's All You Need, it shows romance betwen siblings, No the story focus on how the character being good novelist. I hope it has more story that show each character's problem and how they solved it with some fresh comedy between character.",

            "content": "This wasn't orignally something that I've planned to watch in the beginning, having read the other comments beforehand. However one day, as I stumbled across it, I found that this anime is actually better than what most of us redeems it to be.\r\nJust to clarify, I only watched the anime, so this review is written with regards to the current episodes alone (5 ep up to now) without any insights from the original novel.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii, an anime about a novelist and his friends, started off like any other daily-life animes. Compared to the others, one may think that the story is lacking indepth and in plot, having some weird characters and a plain MC. Nevertheless, there are some heartwarming moments inside each episode that kept me on my toes, while the story itself is very relatable, describing the daily life of a novelist and his struggles while depicting his social circle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, all of the characters have a personality of their own. The MC is a sistercon; his brother/sister that's perfect in all senses; different female characters that interact differently according to their personalities with the MC; the competition in life; all of them is helping to shape the MC into what he is, and while many of the characters might seem plain in the beginning, as the story goes on, we are guided into understanding each of the characters, and why they are important in their own aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good, so far I am very enjoying the OP, and funny musics usually accompany funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is our usual art type, nothing fancy, nothing 3D, but this plain art-style fits perfectly with the type of story we are looking at.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR I am enjoying this anime as it takes up a different approche than most of the other daily-life styled animes, the story might be bland, but more details are given by each epsiode. Most of the characters are relatable and fun, the art and sound are fine and overall enjoyable. I encourage everybody to give this a try. :)",

            "content": "A few hundred or so people have dropped this anime the moment they saw the title, most commonly because of the \"Imouto\" which gives off an idea of similarity to Oreimo, but it's not that. Rather, it's not really focused at the \"Little Sister / Imouto\" thing at all, it's just like some kind of extra detail or fuel to the protagonists debuts and works.\r\nAlso for the most part of the Comedy being about the lives of the Novelists. There's often a sex joke (not as much as Shimoneta handles) by Nayu. I'd go as far as to tell you that Nayu x Itsuki allthe way. Honestly, they should just date already.. (I'm going off track now)\\n\\n\r\nOk, first off... the story.\\n\r\nI might've already explained some parts of it.\\n\r\nIt's not focused about \"Imouto\" but rather on the Characters and the Lives of those in the Novel Industry.\\n\r\nOur protagonist is an Imouto-loving Writer but doesn't really rely on that for the story, rather, he's just using it as a motivation and as his primary fuel for his works.\\n\\n\r\nThis is a Comedy Romance type of Anime but without the falling in love with his little sister part.\\n\\n\r\nIt's about his and the other characters growth as Novelists. His motivation to overcome his love interest in terms of Novels in order to soothe his Inferiority Complex and to accomplish greater heights on writing novels (yes, he loves someone other than Imoutos)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough most of the background and fixing about him and his family's misunderstanding is somewhat ignored so that they could continue with the \"Lives of Novelists\" kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso noting that the title came off from one of his favorite works, so don't put this on the same shelf as Oreimo and Eromanga.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nYes, the modern style of backgrounds and the details are complimentary, although we are mostly seeing him in his room, the visuals of the outside when he ever goes out to get ideas are nice, although common in terms of new anime, it still gives off the new modern feel into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nNot much I could say but the Opening and Ending is nice. Also a good set of choice on VA's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nYes, this is where the story is focused and what develops the most, everyone is trying to overcome and achieve goals for the whole anime. Feeling inferior to someone with natural talent. (It happens) in a chain-like manner, and the fact that they are doing their best to so even with the Comedy. A few occasional drama (not as big as youtube drama) are shown and the Romance part of it isn't exaggerated, everything's at their own pace and their own methods, their lives and the turns and loops of it. They get along well regardless of their competitive characteristics.\\n\r\nAlso, I have settled my ships as what they wanted it to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nSimple Comedy and Sex Jokes often portrayed (mostly from one character tho) just makes it fun, it's not offensive for the most part and that the order feels like a day-to-day Slice-of-Life. Also features more about what a life of a Novelist/Writer is. One of the few nicely paced anime I could go on to if the others are way too tense and messed up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give it a 10 at this point, my opinion is you shouldn't judge a whole anime by it's title and covers. For those who haven't watched it yet, I suppose you should let down the \"Ahh, a new Oreimo\" thought about it.",

            "content": "First, if you haven't watched ... skip to 1:42 of the first episode, you will probably thank me.\r\nThe series isn't a Bakuman for Light Novel authors, but it gives you a good approach at the industry and allows you to learn about how things go in their \"normal\" days.\r\nI put this series on hold, some weeks ago, but then against my better judgement gave it another chance and I'm kind of glad that I did, the enjoyment from the first part of the series wasn't much so I put it on hold, but ... \r\nI rewatched ep 4 and went with 5 instantly, the 4thwas funny but it was the same as the other, but ep 5 was super interesting and you can see how the mind of an author works, then ep 6 was even better a really strong episode, I would even say it was the best of the series (Haruto turned to be my favorite character)... and ep 7 happened, it was rising really good my interest and then a full 100% fanservice episode, it made me remember why I put on hold the series, the rest of the episode were interesting too, but they had the same faults, going up and then down between episodes and even in the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nin the specific section:\\n\r\nthe story isn't something out of this world, we have our average harem protagonist \"in college\" (well...), at least that is something more new. He's a novelist (works in light novels, *cough eromanga-sensei *cough) and has a big ass fetish on imoutos (little sisters), but he doesn't have one, instead he has a \"trap\" little bro that really cares for him. He isn't that bland as a protagonist, he has some complex (it's a japanese series so you can easily guess what's going to be), with just one day he can grew hair really fast, it's not a bad one, but I wouldn't call him the best MC of the season. \\n\\n\r\nthe series goes for the slice of life with a tint of gags each chapter that makes you think it's a 4-koma (seitokai yakuindomo), but the series is based on a LN, it has a manga adaption in neither of them have that style, so it tends to feel really flat when overused each chapter and it was used every single episode, it also has a side A and B of stories, that one tends to be a tabletop games and that trust me, are pretty funny most of the time, except ep 7 that went too far though, but most of the time they don't give you much detail in the characters, but I would probably play with friends some of them.\\n\\n\r\nart isn't bad, music isn't bad, OP is fine, ED is great, and they have a little music to announce each chapter that is pretty nice, and appears from time to time each episode (the same as with the gags, it can be easily overused, and probably will -and it was-).\\n\\n\r\ncharacters are pretty much stereotypical, but ochinchin girl is cute and except for the boxers scene, she's charming and she kept her style all season, you can love her or like her (and you can notice the original author fetish *cough nun dress *cough), she doesn't get annoying. already talked about the MC, the best friend got his episode and he used pretty well, since ep 6 I really liked each time he appeared and how he acted was the most realistic one of the bunch, he's pervy too, he can fall in love, he isn't dense, feel envy, sadness, joy and complements pretty well the MC and it's good that he's there so he doesn't have to monologue as other protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nthis series is pretty much binary, you like it or you don't ... I don't know how I found me in the middle and kind of glad I did, but if you can put up with the innecesary fanservice and want to know more about the characters in another LN adaptation of the creator of Haganai, do it, it's on your own risk.",

            "content": "I wanna have sex with my sister.........Right..................in your dreams , Itsuki, so another harem with a mangaka author in the helm has ended which pretty much has a similarity from \"Eromanga sensei\" so, my thoughts on this:\r\nMediocre 5, story:\r\nPretty much the same setting and plot, except what we see here was more like a relationship of  a group of authors as they discuss things relating to their works and things that occur in everyday life, like deadlines, games, taxes, slump and nosing at some else's life. And there is that, main guy who has this fetish of having a sister, or wanting to bein a incestuous relationship with a sister, that he doesn't have......oh he does have one , except that...either he knows that the step sister is just a cross-dressed bokuko or he's just plain stupid. \\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Art: \\n\\n\r\nSo Kani Nuyata has a habit of being a nudist when she is by her lonesome, so we have seen the girls being naked quite a number of times, but don't expect to see some frontal flash nor see any nipples or panties........  \\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, Art:\\n\\n\r\nNo comment, nothing to say and I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1, Character:\\n\\n\r\nSo let's go over them:\\n\\n\r\nHashima Itsuki- At first you might think that he the usual quintessential oblivious guy, who doesn't know about the girls whom were having feeling for him, until he blurts out \"I wanna a sister\" as it turns out,  he's siscon without a sister or has a sister (Step Sister that is) that he doesn't even know that he is a she. Also, he likes Nuyata, but has a lot of fuss about even having a relationship with her. There is Miyako, for some reason who keeps hanging out with him and his gang of authors who obviously likes him but keeps playing the oblivious card with her. So therefore for him alone the score was for him.\\n\\n\r\nNuyuta Kani- I kinda like her free spirit and directness of liking Itsuki, but she kinda strikes me as a she pervert who can have some yuri sex with every female characters around here and still have some energy left to do it with Itsuki. \\n\\n\r\nShirakawa Miyako- Is a fish out of the water around with Itsuki and his gang of authors. In fact she should have just left that loser, Itsuki for ditching college where he would have had a much better future than being an author  where your works are as good as your previous ones. To me , I see her character of being better off without Itsuki and his gang and going on her own with her classmates. So just hanging out with a loser like Itsuki, she's another reason for the low score in my book.\\n\\n\r\nHashima Chihiro- Ok, so she's Itsuki's step sister who is a cross-dressed bokuko, so just how long would a guy take to know that he is a she? And how pathetic he was to not notice and it has to take Nuyuta and Ashley to know that she is a girl, so that another nail to the coffin.\\n\\n\r\nFuwa Haruto- Well, he seem like a guy who is doing well, much better than Itsuki and Nuyuta in fact......Then again , I'm glad he didn't get to be in a relationship with Miyako.\\n\\n\r\nEna Setsuna and Mikuniyama Kaiko- one thing I can say with these two, which one of them is Itsuki's illustrator? Btw Mikuniyama, strikes me as some who could have sex with Nuyuta all day, while Ena, can pass as a sex offender.\\n\\n\r\nOno Ashley- Strikes me as a harem girl who can have sex both with Itsuki and Haruto. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my fave character, Toki Kenjurou, my man can really kick Itsuki's butt.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWell, part of me really want's the possibility that Itsuki would either reveal that he always know that Chihiro is a girl and the he had a serious relationship with Nuyuta, but part of me also , want's to see him fail, good as it it, it is just not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI may like this anime for the character's stupidity , but overall it's still a face palm.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT YOUR BASIC IMOTO ANIME.\r\nPresumably a lot of people were quick to judge this by the presence of the imoto leitmotif and a number of other clich\u00e9 that the show uses as premises. So please remember that, just because you've seen some similar concepts in other anime, IT DOES NOT MEAN that the show is a basic rip-off of ero manga sensei and it just follows a trend that passed its hype-point or whatever. IT'S NOT. This show does an AMAZING job taking over popular themes and motifs, breaking them at times and shifting them towards the developmentof some of the most enjoyable shit I've seen lately.\\n\\n\r\nIts strongest point, in my opinion, is the way it balances the light, humorous, joke-around, pleasant-to-watch atmosphere with short moments of deeper character introspection, revealing tiny puzzle pieces that, when put together, make for a great, meaningful story about what draws people together and what sets them apart as individuals. (I believe Ituski stated something along the lines of \"What one person craves, the other one has and doesn't care much about it.\" This, for example, is one of the more subtle dilemmas that the plot explores. And while we're at it, the ending scenes of episode 8 are a fucking masterpiece.) YET it's still incredibly entertaining, and easy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of well-picked characters - a group of four good friends, with obviously different personalities, certain weird obsessions and their worries about being a lot less mature than they would expect from being 20-ish (very relatable stuff) - gives birth to saucy, super-funny exchanges of lines where very little stuff that can be said is out of line. The voice acting is great. The drawing pairs it just as well. Not a heavy-plot, not a superficial anime either, twisted just at the right amount for its genre.\\n\\n\r\nI can keep this going for a lot more paragraphs, yet the core of my message is just this: please give it a chance, it will surprise you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Contrary to its title, this is NOT an anime about little sisters! It's not really a romance either. It should be appropriately labeled as a slice of life comedy. Now with that out of the way, here's why. Imouto sae Ireba Ii is actually an anime with several narrative goals. It wants to be a coming of age story  directed at college students or viewers who are beginning to enter the \"working-phase\" of their life. It wants to be a comedy that makes fun of \"little sister\" and \"ecchi\" anime tropes. It wants to be informative with regards to the life of a lightnovelist. Finally, it balances these lighter elements against several instances of drama revolving around themes of friendship, romance, and goals. Sound familiar? It should, but you've probable never seen all these concepts played simultaneously. \\n\\n\r\n[STORY = 6]\\n\r\nPractically nonexistent. Don't watch this anime if you're looking for rapid development that builds towards a sharp climax or any conclusion for that matter. Every episode is very contained with a specific message it is trying to convey. As a viewer, you are simply a bystander peeking into the daily life of a light novelist and his friends. I especially enjoyed the little \"board-games\" that the characters played in several episodes. Clearly, the creators were trying convey the imagination behind story telling. At the very least, it was a refreshing and original attempt with some laughs at the absurdity of light novel stories. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS = 7]\\n\r\nExactly what you expect. Itsuki, the protagonist and sis-con. Nayuta, the perverted comedic relief with an obsession for Itsuki, but God only knows why. Naturally, he doesn't reciprocate. Chihiro, the doting and caring little brother who looks like a sister, but sounds like a little boy. Or was it the other way around? Whatever, you know what I mean. Haruto, male-friend/rival to protagonist who is forever the third wheel in any romantic scenario.  Miyako, the sensible attractive female who reacts accordingly to our (the viewer's) thoughts at every outlandish scenario in the anime. Individually, no character is special, but in concert they have good chemistry and give the story a lot of texture. \\n\\n\r\n[ART = 7]\\n\r\nThe average modern standard. There is some fan-service but it's never erotic. It just makes you want to cringe, which is what the show is going for. The anime is making fun of the ecchi genre after all. Don't expect any zoomed-in shots of butts/boobs where you can see shine/sweat. Everything is drawn rather flat, but the surroundings are very colorful and realistic. Appropriate for this genre.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND=7]\\n\r\nNot bad, but forgettable. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT =8]\\n\r\nI had a good time. This anime is a fair example of a work that is greater than the sum of its parts. There is enough variety across the episodes to keep you interested if you like slice of life and comedy. The show does a good job of shifting tonally when you least expect it. One moment, it's all fun and laughs, and then you're given a somewhat dramatized shift in the narrative that has something to do with success or relationships. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL = 7]\\n\r\nDespite the variety this anime offers and the balancing act it is attempting to maintain, the show ultimately fails at juggling these goals and falls over on itself. The anime starts losing focus towards the end and its final episode is so anti-climatic that my final grade rounds the work out towards the lower end of the 7 spectrum. If what this show is about is still unclear, I'd say it's most similar to animes like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Still, it was an enjoyable and light-hearted diversion that's a good watch if you just need a break from heavier shows.",

            "content": "The award for the most misleading title goes to\u2026! \r\nProbably not A Sister\u2019s All You Need (AKA: Imouto Sae Ireba Ii) but it\u2019s a pretty damn misleading name. \r\nIt\u2019s definitely caused a bit of confusion for people deciding whether to watch it or avoid it like the plague, so before I start the review I feel like it\u2019s necessary to say what this show is and what it isn\u2019t.\r\nThis show isn\u2019t...\r\n-A little sister romance.\r\n-A rip off of Eromanga-sensei.\r\n-Ecchi, but there are few over-the-top lengthy fanservice scenes.\r\n-A kids' show, despite how the characters appear.\r\n-The horrifying events that occur in the first 3 minutes. It gets betterafter that, I swear.\\n\\n\r\nThis show is\u2026\\n\r\n-About the ups and downs of being an artist.\\n\r\n-A character study. Yes, I know how silly that sounds, but this show is about the characters, not the story.\\n\r\n-A (perverted) gag comedy.\\n\r\n-Unfiltered. Characters do and say what they please. Be prepared to laugh and possibly to be offended.\\n\\n\r\nNo time is spared in establishing the perverted tone.  Within the first three minutes of episode one, the main character\u2019s horrifying sister fantasy is shown to the audience in grotesque detail. Later it\u2019s shown that the main character\u2019s editor is reading then spitefully denying his appalling work as he drops the script to the table (not unlike how I initially dropped the show after only that first scene). The start of the show may be a bit alienating to anyone who isn\u2019t prepared for a siscon, but it does a good job of preparing you for the show\u2019s absurdity even if no other scene reaches the heights of the first few minutes. Don\u2019t take this as praise though. The show knows where the line is between too much fanservice is, and it purposefully crosses it to get you to think about how disgusting the whole fantasy is. It\u2019s self-deprecating for sure, but that\u2019s part of the charm.\\n\\n\r\nA sister obsessed light novel writer, his younger stepsister, a perverted novelist, his plain jane friend, and a few more writers and publishers make up the cast. The story is small in scale, but it gives the characters plenty of room to develop. The main character struggles to come up with new material and jokes ensue around him in his distraction. He gets some absurd story ideas turned down by his editor. He spends a lot of time in his apartment with his friends playing games, telling jokes, talking about anime, and this all brings about plenty of funny perverted gag humor. If you can\u2019t gel with perverted humor then I don't think this is the show for you, but give it a chance beyond just judging a book by its cover.\\n\\n\r\nDespite looking and acting like teenagers, the characters are used to adult life and often show their wisdom in conversations. They can be really perverted at times and seem like sickos but over time they grew on me. Through great moments of the character\u2019s reflecting on themselves you\u2019re able to get into their heads and understand why they are and what motivates them. For the characters to be so well developed it becomes easy to get invested in the ups and downs of their lives as they become adults. We learn about what formed them into the people they are through the many outgoing conversations they have with each other. They\u2019re not perfect friends and their chemistry isn\u2019t totally perfect, but the way they clash adds to their believability. I find myself justifying their actions no matter how deplorable by referring to the minor details that built their foundations as people. \\n\\n\r\nAll of their weird quirks just make them so believable, the weird insistence on sisters that Itsuki has, how Nayuta only writes naked, and Miyako\u2019s jealousy of lives of her interesting friends. We know these characters for more than just their weird quirks. We seek how they interact with one another, not just the main character, we get a sense of what their lives are like outside of Itsuki's apartment. Even the supporting cast of publishers, freelance artists, writers, mangaka, and just normal people all have expressive enough personalities to carry the show for the brief time that they appear to offer some wisdom or humor. \\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t gauge characters based on how realistic they may seem, I gauge them on believability. Could the characters in Imouto Sae Ireba Ii exist? Probably not, but after seeing what formed them into the people they are I\u2019m a bit more inclined to believe. \\n\\n\r\n[Story: 7/10] Practically a slice of life. No ending. \\n\r\n[Character: 8/10] Well written, they offer a lot to think on. Believable.\\n\r\n[Art: 7/10] Lots of sitting, not a ton of animation. Some hilarious imagination scenes.\\n\r\n[Sound: 7/10] Simple op that gets minor changes from time to time, very chill ed. \\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 8/10] Unfiltered comedy, surprisingly emotional drama, drawn-out fanservice scenes.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Score: 7.4/10]\\n\r\nNot every joke lands, but enough do to keep it enjoyable. What had me coming back to it week after week was the realistic drama mixed in randomly with the zany comedy that would surprise me when my guard was down. The characters evolved into people I actually liked, not just the stupid pandering archetypes I initially pegged them to be. \\n",

            "content": "This season of anime was one to look forward to, with popular series like Umaru and Gintama gaining new additions to their story. However there were a couple of new additions that have stood out as well (namely Blend S and Mahoutsukai no Yome). That being said Imouto sae ireba is my pick of this season. The reason simply being because its good at its genre. Compared to Blend S forgetting about the settings of their MC (I can only assume it has something to do with wanting the audience to actually like her) and Mahoutsukai no yome merely touching upon dependence rather than love,Imouto Sae Ireba is a story about a group of people finding their direction in life.\\n\\n\r\nStory 8/10\\n\r\nA lot of you who just watched the first episode are probably bloody confused, the first 5 minutes in nothing but ecchi, and cringey ecchi on top of that. But thats where the protagonist fits in, his love is cringey/unconditional due to the experiences he has had in life, however this series focuses as much on the MC as it does everyone else, meaning that towards the end there is only one character who really brings forth these scenes.\\n\\n\r\nThe story itself is episodic and whilst there are buildups that helps with the flow, that being said its not one of those exciting ones, just a warm and fuzzy story which is why I cannot give it a great score despite my liking it.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\\n\r\nThe art is a bit more different from the usual anime,  that is not to say it isn't good, but its something to bear when watching the thing. There isn't much to say aside from that, but I do know some who were slightly put off by this art style.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\\n\r\nOpening was great, thats one thing all the new anime have in common this season. But the actual bgm/ost in this doesn't really stand out. Once again simply because of the type of anime, but for the most part it compliments the story and doesn't feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 9/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is where the anime stands out for me, with an anime like this the characters are the focus and the story is merely a means to compliment them. You have the passionate MC who as I've mentioned before is slightly eccentric, the reason for this was explored slightly too late for my taste, a mistake a lot of anime make, but even without the reasoning it should be too hard to empathize with. On top of that you have a small assortment of females, each with their own reason for being there and supporting the MCs. That being said there is none of the typical cat fights that go on in so many anime, instead its more of a slow paced romance that eventually falls into place.\\n\\n\r\nThe relationship between characters is rather dynamic and there are many small changes in the story that put said relationships to the test, which is always good to see.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally put 9 in my score, but 8.5 is probably slightly more accurate. A good one to watch if you have the time and managed to muddle your way past the first episode but for those who are expecting an ecchi incest anime its probably better to give this one a miss.",

            "content": "Y'know, the realization of writing reviews on this site for four years comes with some vague existentialism of wondering if anyone actually reads the things that I write, or if I've actually improved cause these things are just sort of self-proofread without my outside opinion.  Bah, I'm getting ahead of myself.  Let's just get into this thing.\r\nStory:\r\nFirst off, ignore the first five minutes.  As a writer, Hashima Itsuki is peculiar.  After getting an earful from his editor for the umpteenth time, he goes off on his usual schpeel about the greatness that is the 'imouto', before being promptly told to takehis work seriously and get his shit done on time, like any novelist with a deadline.  And so, that's...basically where our story starts.\\n\\n\r\nBased solely on its cast, Imouto Sae (that's my shorthand this time around) is a slice of life romp seen through the eyes of its literature-based cast as Itsuki and the rest of the main cast do what writers do.  Each episode is focused on the character interactions between the cast, whether it be for research for someone's book or spending time with one another through games that act more as a creative exercise for their brains.  The show's naturally lax nature exudes the slice of life genre, utilizing a brand of conversational humor with the main focus being what the oddities that are its characters and how they are as people as the brunt of its comedic prowess.  On the outside, not much really happens since episode after episode, it's basically the same thing, but slowly, we watch as more minute and complex matter arise.\\n\\n\r\nAt times, the show ever so slightly shaves away its naturally fluffy and slice of life feel and touches upon the 'writer's struggle', or at least those relating to LN authors that adds more to the show.  We sort of see the individual problems that each of the authors in the show face, touching upon different personal problems that add a nice subtlety to the overall story as the sunshine and rainbow of everything we see sheds away for that brief, sober moment amidst the characters' happily drunk nature being published authors.  \\n\\n\r\nYet despite that, the one problem I see from the show is that nothing seems to change.  Sure there're events that lead one thing to another, but because the slightly deeper moments of the show fade away once they're over and leave but a shadow of their impact, much of what we get is the status quo which, while amusing, poses a problem when the moments of deeper thought were only just a few minutes ago.  The ending also leaves a lot of loose ends that I'm not particularly fond of.  Kind of like a 'read the manga' ending, but not so assholeish that they stop in the middle of some plotline that you'll never get an answer to. \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Provides a nice look into the 'writer's struggle'\\n\r\n+ Never melodramatic despite being a show featuring interpersonal relationships and such\\n\r\n-  Tends to stick too much to the status quo\\n\r\n-  A bit too many loose ends by the end\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nA connoisseur of the little sister, Hashima Itsuki is the writer of a magic academy series, or by its other name, 'trash'.  (I jest, I jest.)  Initially seen as nothing but a pervert too prideful in his own work, Itsuki has many moments where his inferiority shows through the cracks, and the cheerful facade that we see through most of the show slowly fades away as he reveals his own insecurities as a writer.  As someone who's also been guilty of saying  \"I'm not good enough\" to myself, I find Itsuki to exemplify much the internal battle inside someone who writes, with just enough of this hidden side of him to give us a proper character.  \\n\\n\r\nDespite that subtle complexity, the true star of the show (at least in my eyes) is Nayuta herself, the popular 18 year old novelist who from episode one has never stopped trying to get into Itsuki's pants without committing a crime in the process.  A natural prodigy at writing, much of her story lies in the events that led her to becomes the girl that we see her as now.  It's less of a writer's struggle, and more of a personal struggle, but all the same is done in a way that adds just enough to her character to give us the viewer some more information.  Aside from that though, Nayuta acts much like a supplementary character to Itsuki, giving him the drive to be the writer he always wanted to be.  Their relationship is cute, and I personally really like the direction they went to explain why things between the two are the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nTo round out the quartet, both Miyako and Haruto act as similar characters with their issues, boasting a personal and professional struggle respectively that again, adds enough to their characters to bolster and solidify their problems as looming parts of their lives, like how normal people are.  \\n\\n\r\nAside from them, the cast is filled with a cast of colorful weirdos that spice up the gaps that the main cast leaves behind.  Everything from an accountant who takes joy in the squirming in others to a mangaka who wears a ribbon of questionable material provides us with a weird yet amusing spectrum that makes the episodes that much more fun.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Rounded main cast\\n\r\n+ Amusing side cast\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nProduced by Silver Link, the show replicates the original artist Kantoku's style of the slightly muted color palette in conjunction of super shiny, almost reflective hair that's commonplace in the works he draws for.  Art quality is very consistent throughout due to the show's severe lack of need for any taxing animation (since everyone basically just sits around), and stands as a nice relaxing sight without anything bad to note.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as fanservice goes, the show does have several choice moments that are certainly more risque than what the rest of the show is in comparison, but it's super tame, and if it ever gets out of hand, the show goes to use its various colorful slides with text on the front for 'censorship'.  One of the most amusing ways to censor something if you ask me.  (Though I will admit that Nayuta is the cause of most if not all of these so blame her.)  Most of the perverted comedy is done through innuendos and spoken words, so visually, it's not severely apparent.\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Consistent quality\\n\r\n+/- Some fanservice, but not much\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nChouchou's \"Ashita no Kimi sae Ireba Ii.\" stands as a song that when combined with the visuals, harkens to the whimsy that authors feel when writing their works, the wonder than a person feels when they put their imagination on paper.  Personally, I feel like many of her other songs are more memorable, but this is no way a bad song and given the placement and usage of this song in the series, certainly has its impact.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the flipside, Aria Yuuki's \"Donna Hoshizora yori mo, Donna Omoide yori mo\" is a more somber piece that ends the episode on a calming and closing note that compared to the slightly more energetic whimsy of its OP counterpart, gives us pleasing resolution to the episode rather than some seiyuu song or something that doesn't have much impact  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Nice and whimsical tracks\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think my first reaction to watching this show's PV was 'Yes'.  Not for really any particular reason, but it just seemed like the show I was really going to like.  And surprise surprise, it was.  It has the quality of touching on the personal problems and the insecurities and stress of making a good story and making a name for yourself in the publishing world without succumbing to melodrama or any kind of super contrived storyline which is refreshing in a landscape where anything drama-based resorts to melodrama.  It's a show I watched because I was intrigued, but stayed because I genuinely resonated with the characters having had tinges of these problems myself when writing stuff in my own time.  So for that, I appreciate this show and am really glad that this was something on my seasonal list.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this show?\\n\\n\r\nIf I haven't sung enough praises about my enjoyment of this show, then yes, I did like the show.  In particular, I really like Nayuta.  I'm always a fan of girls who know what they want and earnestly strive for that person they love because often times you get tsunderes or some other stupid trope of girls undeserving of the happy ending they get in the end without rhyme or reason.  (Abuse is not love, girls)  But more than that, the relationship both professional and personal between Itsuki and Nayuta stands as one of my absolute favorite things of the show because there is reason why Itsuki doesn't take the plunge and overall gives more depth to the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this show?\\n\\n\r\nNothing particularly irked me, but my only wish is that somehow they continue this.  The loose ends were vaguely irritating and given the setup that we were given in the last few minutes, a sequel is all the more possible from that.  (We do not talk about the first five minutes of the entire show.  That shit is repressed.)\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this show?\\n\\n\r\nPersonally, I say yes.  Though the show is infamous for the first five minutes of the first episode, if you do get past that gate (and trust me, there is an explanation), you are in for a slice of life adventure that really is more than meets the eye.  It's a lax show focused entirely on its characters and their interactions, taking time every now and then to expand upon its cast to smooth and polish them out a little more for depth.  Plus it's got a nice helping of wackiness that makes things a helluva lot more entertaining than it should.",

            "content": "When this anime started airing, I had high expectations because it had lots of potential and seemingly good characters but sadly all that went downhill mid season and it felt like an annoying chore having to watch the episodes weekly and even if that wasn't enough, it even ended in the most abruptly and weird way possible.\r\nSPOILER ALERT.\r\nAt the beginning of the anime we had the MC who always tries his hardest at writing and yet somehow he doesn't make it big, we also knew that the MC had to deal with people who were much better and more creative than him so he alwaysfelt inferior to them and that as a setting was very good and I thought we were gonna see some good drama from that but nope all that ended after episode 3 or something.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR : The anime was extremely random and didn't follow any route or try to create and continue anything that it started.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime then went after 2 routes:\\n\\n\r\nthe first route was the game reviews we see in 4 or 5 episodes out of 12 which ruined a lot of things, it was pretty much filler at this point, some of them were nice but when 1/3 of the anime is game reviews then it isn't really helping it's case, is it? I mean if I wanted to watch game reviews I would open Youtube.\\n\\n\r\nthe second route was the \"Every Male character has to have a Female character to end up with at the end\" route and it is self explanatory when you think about it, while I do hate those shitty cliches that wasn't the reason I hated this one, what I hated about this route is that it was extremely forced, one of the characters turned into a molester and yet the female character acted like nothing happened after that, The MC was suddenly in love with the heroine which is pretty illogical because at that time if he were to love someone it would be Miyako not the heroine, Haruto suddenly fell in love with a Miyako and that was pretty much the only thing that could be acceptable out of all the stuff that happened.\\n\\n\r\nThe problem is that even after all that the anime didn't go through with neither the important stuff we wanted to see nor those routes it started, some episodes were genuinely funny and enjoyable so I have to give them that but the premise the anime had at the start vanished and it felt like watching an episodic anime where each episode has nothing to do with the others and that definitely wasn't what the anime was supposed to be like at least not from the start, after all that the anime ended in a bad way,the backstory we should have known about at an earlier stage (IMO) was finally out in the finale and a game review with pretty much the characters ending in a way that shows absolutely 0 character progression and lots of stuff that was supposedly meant to be resolved was left out just like that, even the part with the molester was supposed to be an introduction to the relationship of the little sister with the guy and yet even that didn't happen.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime was a disappointment tbh and a complete waste of what could've been a great slice of life.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I would give the anime a generous 5/10.\\n\r\nWouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

            "content": "100% spoiler-free. I write this review having seen only the anime, and mentioning only what is revealed in the synopsis above.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii:\r\n\"Normie Barrier\"\r\n\"Fanservice-driven\"\r\n\"Trash\"\r\nI think every one of these labels is a great and common excuse for many people to stop or avoid watching this series. I think each is painfully inaccurate. I'll explain why I believe that is true, and why I believe this is possibly the best series I've seen this year so far (clearly it is not yet finished). \r\nAnime, manga, and light novels are experiencing a dearth of material to bring the high school audience into early adulthood. How doessomeone in or graduating college relate to the struggles of high school, which they are quickly forgetting? I wholeheartedly believe that Imouto sae Ireba Ii fills that gap in a meaningful way. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters in this anime each represent the difficulties and insecurities of being in your 20's, whether that is through a feeling of inferiority, purposelessness, or pressure to succeed. The art and production aid the expression of these feelings with intimate depictions of each person that feel deliberate and compelling. There is a communal feeling in this series that is born out of a rich tapestry of relationships, allowing us to learn more about the characters without so much of the explicit and forced exposition common in the slice of life genre. \\n\\n\r\nThe comedy in this series also demands greater scrutiny than a simple rehearsal of tropes. Viewers receive much of the humor from understanding things about the relationships between characters that they never could, and that pays off more with each episode. Music is mixed and reworked to frame scenes and enhance the comedic pacing. Humor is also drawn from some very common themes and concepts within the Imouto genre, especially the \"meta\" approach to storytelling, considering the protagonist is a light novel writer. The self-referential approach to comedy here is not necessarily unique, but Yomi Hirasaka accomplishes it with measured grace that tends to avoid pandering for attention.\\n\\n\r\nFrom here on, I want to take a hard look at the aforementioned labels/criticisms of Imouto sae Ireba Ii.\\n\\n\r\n\"Normie Barrier\"\\n\\n\r\nEveryone's favorite talking point seems to be the beginning of this show. I will not waste time explaining why art needs a chance, but I will say that the storytelling proves itself to be demonstrative. Instead of being handed a list of the likes and dislikes of a character, viewers are shown through reactions and fantasies. Showing instead of telling is something far too many anime forget to do, especially for such a visual medium. Things that shock or confuse you can be difficult to ingest, but sometimes that reaction is necessary as a narrative device.\\n\\n\r\n\"Fanservice-driven\"\\n\\n\r\nIf this series were driven by fanservice, it would be immensely different. I find myself laughing more often than not when it occurs, and I believe there are subtle cues that differentiate the depictions of this anime's characters from ecchi anime. I believe that the art does not contain the sort of detail in suggestive scenes that portends fanservice. I also think that the development of the characters justifies most instances of fanservice that occur. Is there fanservice for fanservice's sake? Probably. Is it a driving narrative force at any point in the show? Absolutely not.\\n\\n\r\n\"Trash\"\\n\\n\r\nThis show is in part about people with hobbies or occupations that ostracize them, and that is completely intentional. We cannot hope to understand the development of a siscon author writing novels without getting behind what makes him that. There can be a compelling story that does not focus on a main character with a traditional background or psyche. We do not need to be able to project ourselves on to any of the characters to relate to them, and that is the beauty of this anime. \\n\\n\r\nAll of this said, there is a reason that I give this anime a 9 instead of a 10, and that is because I have to admit that there have been one or two short, one-off scenes that display some sexually aggressive behavior that does not have a purpose in the story. I did not think that these moments felt cohesive, and I am tempted to disregard them in my enjoyment, but I cannot ignore their presence in this review. \\n\\n\r\nIn summation: Imouto sae Ireba Ii is a compelling representation of the trials and tribulations that come after realizing you've grown up. This show displays a storytelling prowess that stems from the honesty with which it delves into relationships, and the synchronicity of its art and music. The common criticisms of this show seem unwarranted in the face of its intentionality, but that isn't something that a viewer could hope to fully understand in just one or two episodes. I encourage everyone to form their own opinion of this show, because the carefulness of its writing and production more than deserves that much.\\n\\n\r\n9/10",

            "content": "A lot of people say this is just an Ero-manga sensei rip-off. That's not the case at all.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii is an anime totally different from what Ero-manga sensei was. First, because the main character can be portrayed as an actual writer. Yes, he writes about little sisters, but he does things writers actually do in their life, and not just writers I have done some of those myself. \r\nThe story is one which portrays a man who is driven by his wish to write about his fantasies, but his editor doesn't allow them. There are also some of his friends who are writers.The people he meets with and works with aren't only women. This story revolves around the weird life this writer has to go through after he meets people who are as weird as him. They also explain well how he has helped those people in the past. Therefore, this story doesn't revolve around ecchi and female secondary characters unlike some other stories which take that path.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the sound it's good. If you haven't heard the opening it's not too strong and more of a soft melody that you might enjoy listening. The ed is a good acoustic guitar+voice and it's relaxing as well. The voice actors play aren't bad so that's a plus.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are different and each lets us know their qualities as well as how their interaction and time spent with the main character has gone. They aren't all over the place and create different moods when they appear. One can say each character gives life to the story.\\n\\n\r\nMany compare this to Ero-manga sensei but it shouldn't be compared at all. They take completely different paths in their stories and character development, and eventhough the main characters are both writers. They differ in so many ways that it's not similar at all.\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is a good series that helps relax after watching the dramatic, intense animes of the season. It's light and it also has somethings we can familiarize with that the characters take part in.",

            "content": "First and foremost, people need to stop judging this anime without actually watching it. So many of the reviews I see here are completely inaccurate, and it's pissing me off. Please? Actually watch the anime? Thank you?\r\nNow, getting into the meat of my review; this anime is not your run of the mill generic imouto anime. I actually can't stand that genre, and always drop it. In fact, I have refused to even touch Oreimo. HOWEVER, this has almost no focus on little sisters at all plot wise. The main character himself is obsessed with little sisters, but spoilers, doesn't actually obsess over a realsister. Instead, you watch his interactions with his friends, his struggle to become a successful author, and his journey towards being someone he can be proud of. Each and every character in the anime has a story. They each own a flaw, and their personalities are all memorable. Although there's some stupid crap that pops up every now and then, like the first 5 minutes of the first episode, there's so much more to the anime than meets the eye. I never ever write reviews, and in fact this is my first one. It's not like this is my number 1 favorite anime or anything, (ATLA all the way idc I know it's a cartoon)  (also konosuba <3) but it deserves a higher rating than just 6.79. Seriously??? You're giving this anime a 6.79??? The music isn't like orchestral, but I personally enjoy it a lot. The art is beautiful, with an extra wallpaper-esque picture at the end of each episode (which is a courtesy might I add). The plot is really light-hearted and fun with a dark undertone that is actually expanded upon. The characters are all unique, quirky, flawed, and relatable. As for enjoyment, frankly it is something I look forward to watching each week. People are just band-wagoning over anime like Black Clover, complaining about how crap it is, and then continue to watch it while completely disregarding actually quality anime like this one. This anime shows the struggles of being an author, the struggles of failure, and struggles of being unable to express your true feelings. I can relate to a lot of what goes on in this anime, and it always leaves a smile on my face.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I know this review sounded like a rant, but I don't care. How would you like it if your hard work was disregarded by the majority because they just assumed that it was \"like the rest of the genre\". It's like the racism of entertainment. This anime deserves respect, and it is 100% worth giving a try. Now while in my opinion it's probably more of a 8.5 to 9 out of 10, I'll give it a 10/10 to help balance out the ignorant fools who give it 1s and 2s without actually watching it.\\n\\n\r\nGive it a try, you might like it more than you think you will :)",

            "content": "Do you like little sisters? Good, because our protagonist Itsuki loves them probably more than you do. I give this anime an overall score of 6, but that does not mean I think it is distasteful. In fact I think that some people will give this anime a 8 or 9, maybe even a 10. This review is a spoiler-free review by the way, but it would not hurt for people who have watched this anime already to read this review too. \r\nStory:\r\nI acknowledge how the story may seem non linear at times, but I assure you that this anime actually has an excellent narrative.The overall plot is Itsuki, an aspiring author, making his way through the light novel industry while passing through hardships. It is a story of friendship and comedy for the most part, but I would pay more attention to the background. This story is actually about a depressed young man who fights against reality, diving into his own form of escapism, probably retreating into his perverted light novels, only to realize how his peers have earned successes that he has yet to earn himself. For instance, one of his friends is a much more talented writer while the other has an anime in the works. Itsuki deals with his issue by not caring about it. As the anime goes on, you will find Itsuki making peace with himself, and I feel that this narrative would be enjoyable for literally anyone who has felt at least a taste of depression. The flaw to this narrative, however, is that it lacks a dark theme since this narrative only lies in the background, but the anime makes it obvious enough for an attentive audience to peace this together. So now that I have pointed out where your attention should be, I think you would find the story to be at least above average. (8)\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nGiven the silver link art quality, I thought this anime would be able to use art to its advantage. I was right in some parts as the art is often used to show Itsuki's room clearly and everything outside as a foggy and generic setting. Although it gives the impression that Itsuki himself views the rest of the world as irrelevant, I feel that scenes where some of the girls are naked are more horrific rather than enjoyable. Now that I'm here, I would like to emphasize that the fan service is not good. I'm not a personal fan of fan service, but the anime is willing devote 5 minutes every two episodes to only showing fan service to the reader. (6)\\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\\n\r\nThis is the worst category for good reason. So I did not hear anything in the background, I do not know why. Maybe it is to illustrate how Itsuki is living in the real world, but I think it is because the show did not have enough budget. Nevertheless the opening and ending are great, but I think the overall soundtrack could be used to describe the anime's overall mood rather than a deafening silence. (4)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nEarlier I mentioned how this anime is actually a narrative of a depressed young man. That was a lie. This anime is really a narrative about multiple depressed people that hide their flaws from each other. I'm not going to say any spoilers, but I will just say that every episode has a little crack of the character and you will enjoy, or sympathize, with the character when he or she breaks. (8)\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nPlease take this category with a grain of salt. I thought it was at best fair. I could see how other people would enjoy this anime more than I did because I really liked the episodes when the characters played board games, showing there inner flaws or making a spoof of another popular work, but I thought that the overall silence of the anime was very unfavorable. I suggest that you just pay attention to the character's dialogue because they really are interesting at times, and I also recommend that you treat this anime as a totally different work from the likes of Shirabako or any other anime with a Japanese entertainment industry. (6)\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has its ups and downs, but I just have to give it a little more than average. I predict that there will be many who enjoy this and many who don't, but it's really a coin toss. Would you be willing to toss that coin? I would. There is something for anybody in this anime, but if you are more of a edgy type of guy I would say this anime is not for you. (6)",

People can\u2019t blame them since the first episode was a giant normie filter. \r\nNevertheless, you shouldn\u2019t judge it based on just the first impression.\r\nIf you\u2019re someone who\u2019s new to watching anime, or someone who\u2019s not comfortable watching 'unconventional' scenes, then this anime will probably throw you off. There\u2019s a huge amount of sexual comments even in the first episode. The show doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to fan service. It\u2019s a giant normie barrier. \r\nYour normie friend will gocrazy watching this show.\\n\r\nBut if you can overlook these things, there are many things that this anime has to offer.\\n\\n\r\nLet's skip discussing the plot and focus on two things that makes this anime good.\\n\\n\r\nOn Being Informative:\\n\\n\r\nThese are just small details, but the little explanation they add on some topics was a nice addition. For instance, the hometown tax, a system introduced in Japan in 2008, was briefly mentioned and explained in episode 4 of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nYou just learned about taxes in an anime that has \u201cImouto\u201d in its name. The anime also gives information about different things like drinks every episode. An example of that is the daiginjo sake featured in Episode 6.\\n\\n\r\nNowadays, it's not common to find an anime that can both inform and entertain the viewers.\\n\\n\r\nOn the Characters' Interactions:\\n\\n\r\nOne of the good things about this anime is the characters\u2019 interactions. It\u2019s nothing spectacular but it\u2019s definitely enjoyable. Scenes like Haruto and Itsuki getting teased, Miyako sympathizing with everyone, or when Itsuki struggles to meet the deadlines. We even get a general idea about the life of Light Novel authors in this anime.\\n\\n\r\nSo..\\n\\n\r\nShould you watch Imouto sae Ireba Ii.?\\n\\n\r\nThe show isn\u2019t something spectacular, but it definitely has many things to offer. It\u2019s a great and enjoyable anime that doesn\u2019t have any complicated plot. Give it a try and watch a few episodes before deciding if you like it or not.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give it 8/10.\\n",

            "content": "At first, going into this anime, the first impression gave you of it is simple and filled with fanservice. However, it ends only there; it will just be another one of those all so famous Imouto anime you see nowadays. However, that's quite the false alarm, because, for me, I was pleasantly surprised to find out what this anime is actually like. \r\nIt's nothing like what you might think at first glance; it's a lot more and to put it easy, its delightful, quirky romance with a dash of a slice of life added in the mix. I won't deny you will see fanservice nowand then, but then again, a tiny bit of ecchi has never hurt anybody. If it doesn't shove it in your face and it feels like a natural aspect to the anime, I don't see any issues with it.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nThe anime follows a novelist, Itsuki Hashima who is quite obsessed with little sisters and tries to revolve his work around that. His goal is to one day create the ultimate younger sister novel. Despite its weird background for the plot, the anime delves into some realistic themes \u2014 both in his work and outside of life.  The anime is simple and straightforward, but it was a very entertaining watch for me, more than I am willing to admit. I would not mind a sequel because of that. \\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art for this kind of anime fits nicely, and it doesn't seem lacking from my understanding. It's cute, and moe, but have this certain mature vibe to it. I don't know how to put it any other way. Adding on, the facial expression and comedic moments hits well, and you don't see yourself yawning over how boring the art style is. It's simple but compliments the anime well and suits it well for this kind of anime.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nCharacters are all colorful and quirky; no one feels flat or dull. They all have something about them that can entertain you. Especially, a certain silver-haired female, Nayuta Kani. Without going too much into spoilers, let's say she is with a doubt one the reasons I liked this anime and want more. Her personality is so refreshing, and it's not something you see that much of anymore. She is to put it in laymen terms, quite the daredevil and unpredictable an overall super fun character to watch on screen, as her shenanigans with Itsuki unfold. \\n\\n\r\nShe is my favorite character among everyone, but you have a good cast in here that feels alive and important. They are not just there to be there. The story might as well be around them, although, there is a set goal for our main character, Itsuki, that's no the only main focus here. It goes into the issue with making a light novel, romance problems which are handled realistically and don't come as forceful: even family issues and more, like the common problem you happen to come upon.\\n\\n\r\nThe Negative\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the anime from start to finish; I never taught it was tedious or boring. Sure, some arc did feel slightly rushed and certain moments with the game they were playing was kind of weird, I wanted them to focus more on the characters instead of that. This is my only gripe if you take into mind it was only a 13-episodes long first season. If it had more to offer, I would probably ignore it altogether. Also, mainly this is just a tiny gripe, nothing more or less. My overall enjoyment for this anime was barely affected by this one thing. \\n\\n\r\nThe bigger issue is that there is no sequel for this anime, and although, it's not a negative aspect by itself, it does fit in here so, there is that. However, all said and done; I never had any problems that made me want to drop it or yawn as I was watching it. It was a good watch, and I am hoping we get a sequel soon, or I might start the light novel instead. Since, I am very curious where it will go in the future, what more problems will arise and... I do want more Nayuta, so there is that too.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\\n\r\nThis anime was quite a pleasant surprise, one I am glad I did not skip over and got to experience. It had a surprisingly good cast of characters, and it was kind of it to delve into some realistic theme making it for an exciting and fresh watch if nothing else. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind ecchi and want something slightly different than the other anime which falls in the same category as this one. \\n\\n\r\nOverall Scores\\n\\n\r\nStory: 8/10\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nArt: 8.2/10\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nOverall: 8.3/10\\n\\n",

The first 6 episodes were essentially just memes, dick jokes and character introductions/getting us used to the dynamic of the characters. However, episode 8 brought a fairly interesting turn. I noticed early on, that the Romance in this Anime was kinda lacking. But, episode 8 changed that. After seeing episode 8, I can confirm that there is still hope left, and that this could potentially end pretty well. I won't spoil anything, but ifyou must, you can skip to episode 6 and start there (I say start at episode 6, because episode 6 sets up for episode 7). Aside from that, just go try this Anime out. \\n\\n\r\nP.S. The main character actually has a little brother. He looks and sounds female, but he's a dude. So this isn't really an incest/imouto Anime, but rather the main character just likes imoutos.",

However one day, as I stumbled across it, I found that this anime is actually better than what most of us redeems it to be.\r\nJust to clarify, I only watched the anime, so this review is written with regards to the current episodes alone (5 ep up to now) without any insights from the original novel.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii, an anime about a novelist and his friends, started off like any other daily-life animes. Compared to the others, one may think that the story is lacking indepth and in plot, having some weird characters and a plain MC. Nevertheless, there are some heartwarming moments inside each episode that kept me on my toes, while the story itself is very relatable, describing the daily life of a novelist and his struggles while depicting his social circle.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter-wise, all of the characters have a personality of their own. The MC is a sistercon; his brother/sister that's perfect in all senses; different female characters that interact differently according to their personalities with the MC; the competition in life; all of them is helping to shape the MC into what he is, and while many of the characters might seem plain in the beginning, as the story goes on, we are guided into understanding each of the characters, and why they are important in their own aspects.\\n\\n\r\nThe music is pretty good, so far I am very enjoying the OP, and funny musics usually accompany funny moments.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is our usual art type, nothing fancy, nothing 3D, but this plain art-style fits perfectly with the type of story we are looking at.\\n\\n\r\nTL;DR I am enjoying this anime as it takes up a different approche than most of the other daily-life styled animes, the story might be bland, but more details are given by each epsiode. Most of the characters are relatable and fun, the art and sound are fine and overall enjoyable. I encourage everybody to give this a try. :)",

His motivation to overcome his love interest in terms of Novels in order to soothe his Inferiority Complex and to accomplish greater heights on writing novels (yes, he loves someone other than Imoutos)\\n\\n\r\nAlthough most of the background and fixing about him and his family's misunderstanding is somewhat ignored so that they could continue with the \"Lives of Novelists\" kind of thing.\\n\\n\r\nAlso noting that the title came off from one of his favorite works, so don't put this on the same shelf as Oreimo and Eromanga.\\n\\n\r\nArt.\\n\r\nYes, the modern style of backgrounds and the details are complimentary, although we are mostly seeing him in his room, the visuals of the outside when he ever goes out to get ideas are nice, although common in terms of new anime, it still gives off the new modern feel into it.\\n\\n\r\nSound.\\n\r\nNot much I could say but the Opening and Ending is nice. Also a good set of choice on VA's.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter.\\n\r\nYes, this is where the story is focused and what develops the most, everyone is trying to overcome and achieve goals for the whole anime. Feeling inferior to someone with natural talent. (It happens) in a chain-like manner, and the fact that they are doing their best to so even with the Comedy. A few occasional drama (not as big as youtube drama) are shown and the Romance part of it isn't exaggerated, everything's at their own pace and their own methods, their lives and the turns and loops of it. They get along well regardless of their competitive characteristics.\\n\r\nAlso, I have settled my ships as what they wanted it to be.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment.\\n\r\nSimple Comedy and Sex Jokes often portrayed (mostly from one character tho) just makes it fun, it's not offensive for the most part and that the order feels like a day-to-day Slice-of-Life. Also features more about what a life of a Novelist/Writer is. One of the few nicely paced anime I could go on to if the others are way too tense and messed up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I'll give it a 10 at this point, my opinion is you shouldn't judge a whole anime by it's title and covers. For those who haven't watched it yet, I suppose you should let down the \"Ahh, a new Oreimo\" thought about it.",

            "content": "First, if you haven't watched ... skip to 1:42 of the first episode, you will probably thank me.\r\nThe series isn't a Bakuman for Light Novel authors, but it gives you a good approach at the industry and allows you to learn about how things go in their \"normal\" days.\r\nI put this series on hold, some weeks ago, but then against my better judgement gave it another chance and I'm kind of glad that I did, the enjoyment from the first part of the series wasn't much so I put it on hold, but ... \r\nI rewatched ep 4 and went with 5 instantly, the 4thwas funny but it was the same as the other, but ep 5 was super interesting and you can see how the mind of an author works, then ep 6 was even better a really strong episode, I would even say it was the best of the series (Haruto turned to be my favorite character)... and ep 7 happened, it was rising really good my interest and then a full 100% fanservice episode, it made me remember why I put on hold the series, the rest of the episode were interesting too, but they had the same faults, going up and then down between episodes and even in the same episode. \\n\\n\r\nin the specific section:\\n\r\nthe story isn't something out of this world, we have our average harem protagonist \"in college\" (well...), at least that is something more new. He's a novelist (works in light novels, *cough eromanga-sensei *cough) and has a big ass fetish on imoutos (little sisters), but he doesn't have one, instead he has a \"trap\" little bro that really cares for him. He isn't that bland as a protagonist, he has some complex (it's a japanese series so you can easily guess what's going to be), with just one day he can grew hair really fast, it's not a bad one, but I wouldn't call him the best MC of the season. \\n\\n\r\nthe series goes for the slice of life with a tint of gags each chapter that makes you think it's a 4-koma (seitokai yakuindomo), but the series is based on a LN, it has a manga adaption in neither of them have that style, so it tends to feel really flat when overused each chapter and it was used every single episode, it also has a side A and B of stories, that one tends to be a tabletop games and that trust me, are pretty funny most of the time, except ep 7 that went too far though, but most of the time they don't give you much detail in the characters, but I would probably play with friends some of them.\\n\\n\r\nart isn't bad, music isn't bad, OP is fine, ED is great, and they have a little music to announce each chapter that is pretty nice, and appears from time to time each episode (the same as with the gags, it can be easily overused, and probably will -and it was-).\\n\\n\r\ncharacters are pretty much stereotypical, but ochinchin girl is cute and except for the boxers scene, she's charming and she kept her style all season, you can love her or like her (and you can notice the original author fetish *cough nun dress *cough), she doesn't get annoying. already talked about the MC, the best friend got his episode and he used pretty well, since ep 6 I really liked each time he appeared and how he acted was the most realistic one of the bunch, he's pervy too, he can fall in love, he isn't dense, feel envy, sadness, joy and complements pretty well the MC and it's good that he's there so he doesn't have to monologue as other protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nthis series is pretty much binary, you like it or you don't ... I don't know how I found me in the middle and kind of glad I did, but if you can put up with the innecesary fanservice and want to know more about the characters in another LN adaptation of the creator of Haganai, do it, it's on your own risk.",

            "content": "I wanna have sex with my sister.........Right..................in your dreams , Itsuki, so another harem with a mangaka author in the helm has ended which pretty much has a similarity from \"Eromanga sensei\" so, my thoughts on this:\r\nMediocre 5, story:\r\nPretty much the same setting and plot, except what we see here was more like a relationship of  a group of authors as they discuss things relating to their works and things that occur in everyday life, like deadlines, games, taxes, slump and nosing at some else's life. And there is that, main guy who has this fetish of having a sister, or wanting to bein a incestuous relationship with a sister, that he doesn't have......oh he does have one , except that...either he knows that the step sister is just a cross-dressed bokuko or he's just plain stupid. \\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Art: \\n\\n\r\nSo Kani Nuyata has a habit of being a nudist when she is by her lonesome, so we have seen the girls being naked quite a number of times, but don't expect to see some frontal flash nor see any nipples or panties........  \\n\\n\r\nDecent 4, Art:\\n\\n\r\nNo comment, nothing to say and I don't care.\\n\\n\r\nPathetic 1, Character:\\n\\n\r\nSo let's go over them:\\n\\n\r\nHashima Itsuki- At first you might think that he the usual quintessential oblivious guy, who doesn't know about the girls whom were having feeling for him, until he blurts out \"I wanna a sister\" as it turns out,  he's siscon without a sister or has a sister (Step Sister that is) that he doesn't even know that he is a she. Also, he likes Nuyata, but has a lot of fuss about even having a relationship with her. There is Miyako, for some reason who keeps hanging out with him and his gang of authors who obviously likes him but keeps playing the oblivious card with her. So therefore for him alone the score was for him.\\n\\n\r\nNuyuta Kani- I kinda like her free spirit and directness of liking Itsuki, but she kinda strikes me as a she pervert who can have some yuri sex with every female characters around here and still have some energy left to do it with Itsuki. \\n\\n\r\nShirakawa Miyako- Is a fish out of the water around with Itsuki and his gang of authors. In fact she should have just left that loser, Itsuki for ditching college where he would have had a much better future than being an author  where your works are as good as your previous ones. To me , I see her character of being better off without Itsuki and his gang and going on her own with her classmates. So just hanging out with a loser like Itsuki, she's another reason for the low score in my book.\\n\\n\r\nHashima Chihiro- Ok, so she's Itsuki's step sister who is a cross-dressed bokuko, so just how long would a guy take to know that he is a she? And how pathetic he was to not notice and it has to take Nuyuta and Ashley to know that she is a girl, so that another nail to the coffin.\\n\\n\r\nFuwa Haruto- Well, he seem like a guy who is doing well, much better than Itsuki and Nuyuta in fact......Then again , I'm glad he didn't get to be in a relationship with Miyako.\\n\\n\r\nEna Setsuna and Mikuniyama Kaiko- one thing I can say with these two, which one of them is Itsuki's illustrator? Btw Mikuniyama, strikes me as some who could have sex with Nuyuta all day, while Ena, can pass as a sex offender.\\n\\n\r\nOno Ashley- Strikes me as a harem girl who can have sex both with Itsuki and Haruto. \\n\\n\r\nAnd my fave character, Toki Kenjurou, my man can really kick Itsuki's butt.\\n\\n\r\nGood 7, Enjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nWell, part of me really want's the possibility that Itsuki would either reveal that he always know that Chihiro is a girl and the he had a serious relationship with Nuyuta, but part of me also , want's to see him fail, good as it it, it is just not good enough.\\n\\n\r\nFair 6, Overall:\\n\\n\r\nI may like this anime for the character's stupidity , but overall it's still a face palm.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nMerry Christmas\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NOT YOUR BASIC IMOTO ANIME.\r\nPresumably a lot of people were quick to judge this by the presence of the imoto leitmotif and a number of other clich\u00e9 that the show uses as premises. So please remember that, just because you've seen some similar concepts in other anime, IT DOES NOT MEAN that the show is a basic rip-off of ero manga sensei and it just follows a trend that passed its hype-point or whatever. IT'S NOT. This show does an AMAZING job taking over popular themes and motifs, breaking them at times and shifting them towards the developmentof some of the most enjoyable shit I've seen lately.\\n\\n\r\nIts strongest point, in my opinion, is the way it balances the light, humorous, joke-around, pleasant-to-watch atmosphere with short moments of deeper character introspection, revealing tiny puzzle pieces that, when put together, make for a great, meaningful story about what draws people together and what sets them apart as individuals. (I believe Ituski stated something along the lines of \"What one person craves, the other one has and doesn't care much about it.\" This, for example, is one of the more subtle dilemmas that the plot explores. And while we're at it, the ending scenes of episode 8 are a fucking masterpiece.) YET it's still incredibly entertaining, and easy to watch.\\n\\n\r\nThe cast of well-picked characters - a group of four good friends, with obviously different personalities, certain weird obsessions and their worries about being a lot less mature than they would expect from being 20-ish (very relatable stuff) - gives birth to saucy, super-funny exchanges of lines where very little stuff that can be said is out of line. The voice acting is great. The drawing pairs it just as well. Not a heavy-plot, not a superficial anime either, twisted just at the right amount for its genre.\\n\\n\r\nI can keep this going for a lot more paragraphs, yet the core of my message is just this: please give it a chance, it will surprise you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Contrary to its title, this is NOT an anime about little sisters! It's not really a romance either. It should be appropriately labeled as a slice of life comedy. Now with that out of the way, here's why. Imouto sae Ireba Ii is actually an anime with several narrative goals. It wants to be a coming of age story  directed at college students or viewers who are beginning to enter the \"working-phase\" of their life. It wants to be a comedy that makes fun of \"little sister\" and \"ecchi\" anime tropes. It wants to be informative with regards to the life of a lightnovelist. Finally, it balances these lighter elements against several instances of drama revolving around themes of friendship, romance, and goals. Sound familiar? It should, but you've probable never seen all these concepts played simultaneously. \\n\\n\r\n[STORY = 6]\\n\r\nPractically nonexistent. Don't watch this anime if you're looking for rapid development that builds towards a sharp climax or any conclusion for that matter. Every episode is very contained with a specific message it is trying to convey. As a viewer, you are simply a bystander peeking into the daily life of a light novelist and his friends. I especially enjoyed the little \"board-games\" that the characters played in several episodes. Clearly, the creators were trying convey the imagination behind story telling. At the very least, it was a refreshing and original attempt with some laughs at the absurdity of light novel stories. \\n\\n\r\n[CHARACTERS = 7]\\n\r\nExactly what you expect. Itsuki, the protagonist and sis-con. Nayuta, the perverted comedic relief with an obsession for Itsuki, but God only knows why. Naturally, he doesn't reciprocate. Chihiro, the doting and caring little brother who looks like a sister, but sounds like a little boy. Or was it the other way around? Whatever, you know what I mean. Haruto, male-friend/rival to protagonist who is forever the third wheel in any romantic scenario.  Miyako, the sensible attractive female who reacts accordingly to our (the viewer's) thoughts at every outlandish scenario in the anime. Individually, no character is special, but in concert they have good chemistry and give the story a lot of texture. \\n\\n\r\n[ART = 7]\\n\r\nThe average modern standard. There is some fan-service but it's never erotic. It just makes you want to cringe, which is what the show is going for. The anime is making fun of the ecchi genre after all. Don't expect any zoomed-in shots of butts/boobs where you can see shine/sweat. Everything is drawn rather flat, but the surroundings are very colorful and realistic. Appropriate for this genre.\\n\\n\r\n[SOUND=7]\\n\r\nNot bad, but forgettable. \\n\\n\r\n[ENJOYMENT =8]\\n\r\nI had a good time. This anime is a fair example of a work that is greater than the sum of its parts. There is enough variety across the episodes to keep you interested if you like slice of life and comedy. The show does a good job of shifting tonally when you least expect it. One moment, it's all fun and laughs, and then you're given a somewhat dramatized shift in the narrative that has something to do with success or relationships. \\n\\n\r\n[OVERALL = 7]\\n\r\nDespite the variety this anime offers and the balancing act it is attempting to maintain, the show ultimately fails at juggling these goals and falls over on itself. The anime starts losing focus towards the end and its final episode is so anti-climatic that my final grade rounds the work out towards the lower end of the 7 spectrum. If what this show is about is still unclear, I'd say it's most similar to animes like Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata and Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. Still, it was an enjoyable and light-hearted diversion that's a good watch if you just need a break from heavier shows.",

            "content": "Even before this series finished, I took another 4 hours of my time re-watching the whole thing from start to ending (episode 11), and while I don't quite like the ending (it was basically a stop-gap episode than a REAL one), this show was and is still a definite surprise for me, having enjoyed the series throughout, but this is a classic case of \"Go read the novel\" to know the ending.\r\nStory & Characters:\r\nDisregarding the FIRST 5 MINUTES of the show (because that's a plot point setting for the whole show), this show talks about the life and struggles of being a light novel author.\r\nOurmain \"protagonist\", 20 year-old Itsuki Hashima, has an undeserved obsession with little sisters through his troubling past, and that has become his main drive to create little sisters as the protagonists in his Little Sister Academy novels. Even as to go as far as for people who make his novels, his instating doesn't falter. \\n\\n\r\nThe naughty perverted girl in the gang, 18 year-old prodigy Nayuta Kani (or KaniKou as Itsuki calls her) is also a novelist, but started off writing novels ever since she was young, after the tragic scene that is the bullying in junior school and Itsuki's novels being her salvation, her main drive is like Itsuki's, to create novels and always have the sexual innuendos against Itsuki due to her love towards Itsuki, and is always bare bones at everything, even having to go stark naked to find creativity in completion. Best girl Kanikou.\\n\\n\r\nHer bud, 20 year-old Miyako Shirakawa is a student who's not in the same profession as Itsuki, Nayu and Haruto, comes across as the pure, untouched kind, but she too has a heart of gold for Nayu when she's down and needs help and to Itsuki when he needs clearance (and she too has a crush on him). The most pure of the gang, she thinks for the welfare of the others and sympathizes with everyone (and congrats for the notion to be an author!).\\n\\n\r\nItsuki's main rival and best friend 20 year old Haruto Fuwa, is also a novel author, having started ahead against Itsuki with his novel, The Spirit Knight to the Distant Sea. Even as further progression into anime form, he experiences a lot of setbacks, and doesn't fail to show it, albeit Itsuki always helping him out, even on his crush towards Miyako. Overall, the rounded character often showing us that proving something that you can call your work doesn't always turn out the way you want it to be. The light-hearted characters, like Miyako, cares for everyone and calls them his own family likeness.\\n\\n\r\nLet's not forget Itsuki's \"brother\" Chihiro (which actually is a SHE) due to his obsession towards little sisters, and brands herself as a HE before Itsuki (otherwise consequences), and a remarkable sibling towards him, even though the family relationship is strained between Itsuki and their dad who has made mistakes that Itsuki wasn't happy with, and despite that she still cares for him like a real sibling would.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, like Two Car, the formula of character development plays a lot because we see the interactions play out between the gang in terms of rest times playing board games, going out together for fun or research, all that good stuff. And I loved every moment out of it, even though it was solemn at times. UNLIKE Two Car, I kinda wished Silver Link made a better progression for its characters since there were A LOT of sponsors funded (end credits) who supported this show, they could have made better usage of its characters.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation:\\n\r\nIt's Silver Link, so what do you expect? Decent art with subpar animation? You WON'T find it here, and honestly this project has been the make-or-break for Silver Link this year, and I firmly believe that this show is their ultimate best work for this year overall, if not a touch overrated. The art style is something different from my encounter with earlier Silver Link 2017 offerings, and is one of divisive agreement. The animation has that subtle upgrade but overall it still looks good in spots. Overall, I'm still honestly surprised at the amount of work done, and the problem with the sponsor part replicates here as better animation can prove us right or wrong.\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nI ABSOLUTELY ADORE THIS SHOW. No seriously, it's THAT good and well-rounded, a perfect 10 job! Both the immense and creative OP by ChouCho and calm, composite ED by Aira Yuuki just sounds like what I have mentioned earlier with the production values for this show. The one area I can best comment on, because the music works wonders with the entry and exit process! The BGM might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for me I feel like heaven listening it with the decent dialogue.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nTrust me when I say that this show is NOT about little sisters (a plot pointer), and is NOT Eromanga-sensei 2.0, and is the Imouto show that's ALL YOU NEED in 2017, it's sad that it's not a record-breaker, but it ends up as one of my absolute favourites of the Fall 2017 anime, and one of (if not) the best I can recommend in a heartbeat for Imouto-based shows.\\n\\n\r\nThis show tugs my heartstrings like no other anime would (well, aside from Ancient Magus' Bride and a few others), but to experience a show that's so-bad-it's-good troupe, get ready to be pleasant by good visuals, a nice soundtrack and good production. Give this show a shot (and REALLY dismiss the 1st 5 mins of the show) if you plan to re-watch this travesty that will make you change your mind about this show overall, because I just sang my praises for this show, and you should too.\\n",

            "content": "Is it good? Not really. Is it bad? Not really.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii is one of those animes that people will probably think it's Eromanga Sensei rip off or whatnot but in-reality it's nothing like that. The anime is more of like a chill laid back slice of life anime that really isn't taken too seriously. It doesn't have a complex story nor the best character development ever but I think it's not as bad as people make it out to be.\r\nStory 6/10:\r\nLike I said, the story isn't complex or anything. There should be a Slice of Life tag for this anime because it's literallyjust that. Romance? Barely any romance in the story. There is bit of romance from time to time but it's doesn't deserve it's own tag since it's not the MAIN focus of the story. The story is simple, it's pretty much about Itsuki Hashima a light novel writer that is trying to make it big in society. He pretty much always hang out with his friends which are also similar in the business. I will talk about the characters later on but that's pretty much it. Every episode is just a new day for Itsuki to hang out with his friends. They either talk about their work or they do fun things together like playing games or drinking and eating. After a few episodes, it shows internal conflict with each character and show their hidden emotions but I felt like they should had expanded on it. If they expanded on it and actually show more conflict with each other the story would had a greater impact on the series. That's just the main flaw of the story, there's not much to it because they didn't expand the conflict of each character emotions which kind of makes it bland and kind of useless.\\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork and the animation isn't bad. I think it's probably one of the best part of the series is the art. The artwork isn't complex and have the most depth but it's pretty vibrant and still consistent enough to make it look nice to the eye. There's not much to say about the art but I feel like it's probably one of the greatest strength for the series.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10:\\n\\n\r\nThis is the second strongest strength for the series. The opening and the ending is really nice to listen to. It's really catch and something that you want to keep listening to. The ost isn't the most pop out thing ever but the opening and the ending songs really did a good job expressing the series as much as possible.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nTo explain the character, I don't really need to break down each character in-order to explain the pros and the cons because due to the fact that each character pretty much suffers from the same flaws. The character are almost bland but they're not bad either. The series tries to give each character with different humor or fetishes but it doesn't really weigh enough to make them unique as a whole. The first few episodes, it's pretty much them having fun and talking about their work but as times go on the series introduces the character with some internal conflict. There is pretty much 2 internal conflict that the character have. The first internal conflict is romance. Simple internal conflict where A loves B but C also loves B where D loves A but A loves B. Pretty much those triangle love type of shit. This is where I said the romance tag shouldn't be in here because the series doesn't EXPRESS much of it to be the main focus of the series at all. It's express for like a few minutes in a few episodes then it's gone. The second internal conflict is Jealousy. Pretty much Haruto is jealous of Itsuki because he can make better stories or whatnot. I felt like if they expanded on this conflict alone, the series would been so much better. Instead, just like the romance, it appears for a few minutes then POOF it just disappears. I wish they can do a better job of expanding the conflict within the characters or it could had been a way better series and deserve a higher grade. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 6/10:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime isn't good but it isn't bad either. This is the type of series is where if you're just bored and looking for a series to watch. There is some funny moments that will make you smile and the goofiness but it's not a series where you should take it seriously at all. It just feels incomplete of a story and wish they could expand more of the conflicts. 6/10",

Like many others, I expected the show to be akin to Ero-Manga Sensei or Oreimo, a love comedy of sorts and whilst Imouto Sae could still be definitely categorized as such, it has a much lesser emphasis on romance. We are privy to the lives and emotions of Itsuki and his friends, including the hardships that they face during their transition to adulthood. It is easy to sympathsize with the tragic pasts of the characters, and rootfor their happiness.\\n\\n\r\nThere are unique aspects to the show- such as the minigames that the characters play, and the neat little animation introductions to them. The show also does not take itself seriously, by having bizarre characters such as best girl Kanikou or the Tax Accountant Ashley Oono and silly music to lighten the mood. The addition of fanservice is always great, and with the exception of episode 1, Imouto Sae doesn't overdo it. \\n\\n\r\nImouto Sae is wrapped up at the end of each episode by the melodic and somber ending theme song starting to play right as we witness one of our favorite characters go through a difficult time. And as we emphasize with these characters, we are taught life lessons that are invaluble not only for these characters, but for our own, complex lives. Ultimately, Imouto Sae is a rollercoaster of emotions that will make you laugh one second and tuck at your heartstrings the next.",

There were quite a few instances that felt mundanely generic as well as some moments that were reallywell crafted. Overall, I felt that the first half or so of the series had fewer uninteresting moments, but it was mostly enjoyable throughout.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the characters, understandably, did not develop a huge amount of depth in such a short series, what we do learn about them turned out to be welcomingly believable and heartfelt.\\n\\n\r\n-Miyako's feelings that she's wasting time at college while her friends are living 'real' adult lives with jobs, creating tangible products of the time they spend, and making a name for themselves\\n\\n\r\n-Haruto's struggle to maintain his friendship with Itsuki despite his feelings of inferiority as an author\\n\\n\r\nThey're human, and realistic. The characters develop into people we can connect and empathize with. \\n\\n\r\nThe moments of self reflection and serious contemplation are, while comparatively brief, insightful. Emotion feels honest, these scenes follow the moments of absurd, and often sexually explicit, humor quite naturally. \\n\r\nWhat I'm saying is it doesn't feel forced. Or fake. They feel fitting and astute.\\n\\n\r\nMoving on from the praise, there were parts in the second half especially where the show felt bland and unfunny. It wasn't for a lack of trying though so I write it off as a consequence of different jokes for different folks.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending wasn't very satisfying, while it's not as if though it was wrapped up in a messy and overstuffed ending, it leaves all but a few issues unresolved. It screams of a second season, but to my knowledge there isn't one planned. Disregard this point if one does come out.\\n\\n\r\n7.5/10 - a creamy, well blended cup of funny and feels that you didn't think that cute barista could pull off at first, and maybe deserving of an 8 should I revisit it.

There's more, really!\"\r\nYeah, like everyone here I agree that the first few quotes of this series are incredibly off-putting, if not at least polarizing.\r\nBUT, after buckling down and watching the first few episodes, I've come to really enjoy the shameless cast because they aren't afraid of who they are. They're dynamic, they feel real, and the relationships are relatable. For those of us who know nothing of the writer's profession, this is also a pretty nice peek into that.\r\nThis is an example of a finely written slice-of-life. There are no action scenes; the humor isn't all ecchi; in fact, most of the humorisn't roll-on-the-floor-funny. BUT (yes, but), you'll keep watching. Why? Because the show is well-put together, the writing can be witty, and the show will very subtly get you invested in the cast. Before you know it, you've finished S1.\\n\\n\r\nTECHNICALITIES: Animation is a solid 8. The music reminds me of Oregairu, so a solid 9. Watched subs first which was good, then dubs which was GREAT because of the voice actors. Ended on a cliffhanger so eagerly looking forward to S2.",

            "content": "*SPOILERS*\r\nThis anime has a very shocking opening to the first episode that almost kept me from watching this show at all. However, something like that has happened with a show in the past. I dropped a show after a very cringy first few minutes, only to give it another try months later. I ended up really enjoying that anime after those first few minutes. So for A Sister's All You Need, I pushed through the first scene and boy am I glad I did. \r\nThis show mostly focuses on being a slice of life comedy about light novel authors and what they go through ona daily basis. It shows the fun of writing, the difficulty of making deadlines, and even the pain of trying something new, such as making your novel into an anime, and it failing misserably. This all helps to keep you interested when some slice of life can get boring and redundant. The humor combined with this fresh take on what it's like to be an author makes for a really enjoyable watch.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a few things that I am left wondering, but that could be fixed with a second season. For one, what made his little sister decide to pretend to be his little brother for the whole anime? She obviously didn't know that his longing for a little sister is what drives his light novels, so why'd she do it in the first place? She shows that on the last scene of her when she's in the bath and tells herself that she needs to tell him the truth soon. Why hasn't Itsuki's new stepmother tried to meet him? If you marry someone who already has a kid, wouldn't you meet them at the very least? I realize that it may be due to his poor relationship with his father and the fact that Itsuki resents him for re-marrying so quickly. But even so shouldn't she want to meet him? I don't remember the anime ever mentioning that she's tried to make contact with him at any point. Please correct me if I'm wrong about that.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I would have liked to see was more development in the relationship between Itsuki and Nayuta. I'm sure they will if there is another season. Him admitting to Haruto that he likes Nayuta and wants to date her was a good step in that direction.\\n\\n\r\nOne more thing to mention is the strong ecchi component in this anime. I personally like it if it's done right and, thankfully, I think it was done right in this anime. It's used almost entirely for comedic effect. If you dislike ecchi then I would not recommend watching this. \\n\\n\r\nOkay, so would I recommend this anime to another person? Yes, I would. Now if said person does not like slice of life anime or ecchi I obviously would not, but otherwise I would definitely recommend it to others. It is a funny slice of life that has an interesting story and cast of characters to keep you engaged for the whole 12 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nMy personal rating is: 9.2 out of 10 stars for how much I enjoyed it.\\n\\n\r\nMy objective rating is an 8.3 out of 10 stars.\\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading! This is my first time doing something like this so let me know what you think. If there's something I could change or improve on I'd love to hear it. Also, let me know what you thought of the anime in the comments, I'd like to know how other's opinions differ from mine.\\n\\n\r\nThanks again!",

            "content": "The title is the most misleading thing I've seen till now.\r\n\"A sister's all you need\" \r\nWhen I first saw the trailer and read the title it sounded to me like :-\r\n\"Well, here is another story of a perverted brother who is *literally* pursuing his poor little sister and probably thinks 'Incest is wincest'. This story will all be about how perverted things a brother 'tries' to do to his sister and she would probably be a tsundere who does nothing more than annoy. There would be no character development probably because most of the episodes are going to be wasted in ecchi and drama.\"\r\nBut myinner otaku screamed telling \"NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER\"\\n\\n\r\nWell why not give it a try.\\n\\n\r\nThe first 5 min burned my eyes and made me regret watching anime, now I was and to believe that is god level perverted anime which was then soon followed by dropping the anime.\\n\\n\r\nOne otaku-ish day I came across the review of the anime after it's completion with its 12 episodes, and I was wondering how it got a rating of above 7.\\n\\n\r\nI decided that even if I want to drop it why not watch like 2 episodes and drop it if it does not give me the feels.\\n\\n\r\nAnd that was the time when my eyes opened....I understood that this anime title was more like a click-bait. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS AND STORY (spoiler-less)\\n\\n\r\nThe story starts off by a perverted scene which is then revealed to a part of a story. A erotic light novel. It will seem more like a 'hentai-ish' anime and that is what is the most misleading about this show.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is about a light novel writer Itsuki Hashima who has some serious 'sister complex' and is literally obsessed with little sisters and that induces him to write about little sisters in his works. (apparently he has fans too)\\n\\n\r\nItsuki attended a college which he later left after 6 months. He met Miyako Shirakawa when he was attending the college. Miyako noticed Itsuki really engrossed in his work and liked that about him.\\n\\n\r\nSPOILERS AHEAD (Go ahead at your won risk)\\n\\n\r\nMiyako approached Itsuki but Itsuki taught that she was just trying to play with him and called her a slut which hurt her feeling and she started to cry\\n\r\nand that is how their friendship started.\\n\\n\r\nThe next character we got is Haruto Fuwa who is Itsuki's friend and is another light novel writer who is more famous than Itsuku, he is having his light novel adapted to anime. He is a hard working and organized author unlike Itsuki.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Nayuta Kani, a prodigious writer whose works are really mesmerizing. She is all 'deredere' for Itsuki and the reason for it is revealed later in the series which is when Nayuta was being bullied in her high school days and she lost all her hope and was suicidal, Itsuki's work gave her hope and from that day she fell for him. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nThe character development in this story is amazing and I never expected such good pace in this kind of 'misleading story'. Enough time is given to introduce a character, give some insights in their personality and their past.\\n\\n\r\nThe best thing about this anime is the symbolism of 'love' portrayed in show. Unlike most of the anime where the MC gets a harem because of his looks or because he is overpowered and godlike (onni-sama). The love portrayed in this show is simple and life like real. One falls in love because of what they are from inside, that is their inner beauty not their looks.\\n\\n\r\nHUGE SPOILERS AHEAD (on your own risk)\\n\r\n{START}\\n\\n\r\nIt is revealed that Nayuta loves Itsuki because he helped her fight though her rough days when she lost all hope and was suicidal due to bulling which she went through in her school. She proposed him in the Annual Author meet (or something) and was rejected because Itsuki wanted to do something as big as Nayuta so that he could proudly stand by her side. Even after being rejected and facing so much humility she did not give up and still continued to show up at his house everyday and help him in every way she could believing that one day he would finally accept her (later he admitted that he loved her which she actually heard).\\n\\n\r\nSecond is Haruto's love for Miyako, Haruto started to fall fro her when she understood his pain when his light novel's anime adaption performed really bad, she cried for him and said she understand how much painful it is when one tries so hard and still fails. That is the point where Haruto fell for her. He asked Itsuki for help and Itsuki readily agreed to help him. He later realized that Miyako loved Itsuki and GAVE UP loving her to keep her happy. He thought it would be too cruel when Miyako got to know that the one she loves actually helped some other guy to pursue her. \\n\\n\r\nThe purity in love is admiring and something which the modern society lacks. It shows what true love really is, only if you truly love her you will let her go and that is what Haruto did, give up his own self desires to see the one he loves happy. That is something really hard to find in today's society.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime also deals with the ups and downs of life, how hard actually this thing called life is. Even if we fell that writing stuff is really easy, how hard the life of an actual author is. \\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped you. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is great and you should watch it. \\n\\n\r\nThank you. :)\\n\\n",

            "content": "Let's beat not around the bush. This is a fan service comedy show and nothing else. There is little to invest emotionally and the characters aren't gonna win awards anytime soon, despite the occasional sprinkling of drama and love-complicated geometric-shape.\r\nHowever...\r\nThat is really not what the show is there for. It's a slice of life comedy that follows the recent trend of such shows that focus on the life of young adults instead of the endless procession of high schoolers. There is some emotional depth here and there, that is kind of refreshing, but over all it's just a fun little romp. The little sister gimmickis really only there to set up some of the jokes and not to feed any weird fetishes. There is no actual siscon in there just a guy with a fetish that only comes up when it is time for us to laugh about it.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I like especially is how the fan service is handled. Far too often such is far to forced, with chraracters constantly barging into room, spilling drinks or slipping and falling on girls which result in the dreaded accidental grope. And while some of that is in evidence here as well, most of it is part of- and enhances the narrative. Digibro called this type of fan service \"diegetic\" and I agree\\n\\n\r\n [spoiler]For example at one point Nayuta asks Miyako to strip so she can fondle her breasts and later her butt. And while it is mostly there to feed a fetish, it also gives us more information about Nayuta: she's not shy about her own body and has no problem fondling other woman for research and sees nothing inherently sexual about it. At the same time we learn, that Miyako is of course embarrassed and shy about the whole thing, but will do something that makes her uncomfortable for her friend.\\n\\n\r\nAnother thing I really enjoy is how the show handles exposition:\\n\\n\r\n [spoiler]Instead of a voice over or another character explaining the protagonist, we get the first minute of episode 1, which a scene from a really weird and over the top siscon story/anime. (btw you can easily skip that and don't miss a thing. It's supposed to be off putting. that is the joke). Through this scene and the funny little conversation between Itsuki and his editor we learn all we need to know about him. He's a siscon, light novel author, but not a predator and apart from his obsession rather well adjusted without the usual trapping of the anime pervert, like the stupid face or the nosebleed. Another excellent example of this is when Nayuta tells Miyako how she was bullied in school. This is handled with some quick flashes of images, that mostly strongly suggest instead of outright tell. So instead of the usual anime trope of the emotional 5 minute talk with still or slo-mo shot of crying faces, we get all we need in under 10 seconds without loosing the emotional impact \\n\\n\r\nIf you squint a bit you can interpret some Harem elements, but only two female characters explicitly profess love for the protagonist, so really have to squint and want to ship some of the others as well.\\n\\n\r\n [spoiler] What really annoyed me to no end was Itsukis reasons for spurning Nayuta\u2019s affections. It's the typical anime guy self centred bullshit that sound profound but is in fact just dickish. And the last episode was the usual anime cop out as well seeing as now there was potential for something real developing between Itsuki and Nayuta. Disappointing but not surprising. The development of the relationships along the usual anime lines had me drop the score by a point sadly. Frankly the whole episode 12 was such a needless toneshift it is best to ignore it, if you enjoyed the rest of the show\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, watch it if you are after an adult slice of life comedy with the occasional (about once per episode) fan service, which wont distract you from laughing.",

I actually enjoy this anime a lot and it was a long time since I enjoy anime like this. \r\nA Sister is All You Need is an anime that has a misleading title but the story is pretty cute and very nice to watch. It has a little bit of everything, romance, comedy action and slice of life. The characters are pretty enjoyable and I like their voice acting and their stories.Sometimes it gets boring during the times they play boardgames but its worth it due to the interaction between each characters. The art is pretty good but sometimes the animations seemed kind of weird or lagging I would say. I had a fun time watching this anime and I enjoy myself a lot during it. \\n\\n\r\nI recommend to watch this anime If you like slice of life, a bit of romance and comedy.

God damn it was bad lol ).\r\nThe show tried to force kanikou down my throat and into my heart and it failed miserably. \r\nThey went for the trope of the girl who's very \"lewd\" and always aggressively coming onto the MC but blushes and shuts down when he \"unintentionally\" comes onto her.I hate those.\\n\r\nShe also says Nyaa all the time for no fucking reason and it's very annoying. You don't get to say Nyaa unless you're a cat girl or you're just saying it in a comedic bit.\\n\r\nAlso why the fuck is this an imouto series if the main heroine is not even an imouto.\\n\\n\r\nThere was no point in the orange hair girl(super boring bitch),the glasses novelist(thinks he's rivals with MC but it's one sided and sad lol), the mangaka(wtf.) and the ass fetish artist(so annoying , I thought it was a girl at first) even existing, they're barely relevant to the \"story\".\\n\\n\r\nThey also went for the \"make reference to other anime to make us seem cool\" trope, Bringing up Kobato from haganai, komachi from oregairu ,OreImo and Eromanga. Just to say that \"Hey there fellow kids! these shows are totally great and we totally love them too, please watch our show we're so relatable xd lol Fidget spinners lmao dab haha \".\\n\\n\r\nThere was only one moment in ep 11 that I found touching but it was concerning KaniTRASH so i didn't really give a shit lol. but other than that they just play board games and hang out all the time, like it's some shitty slice-of-life anime. It's so fucking boring and the \"comedy\" is so bad it's sad.\\n\\n\r\nThe art like most other LN anime was pretty bland and got worse as the episodes went on.\\n\\n\r\nThere was one soundtrack I enjoyed. other than that it wasn't anything special.\\n\\n\r\nI felt like gouging my eyes out while watching this show at least twice per episode.\\n\\n\r\nThen again if you're someone who enjoys trash imouto shows such as OreImo and Eromanga then you should watch it lol.\\n\\n\r\nP.S: *SPOILER*\\n\r\nTo the show's credit, I did laugh once. When glasses' anime adaptation apparently turned out really bad. I was like \"Oh the irony\".",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nEromanga Sensei made the brother/sister complex romance type stuff gain some more popularity, especially when it came to memes, I thought it was awful. So going into this anime I was a little sceptical and was expecting the same kind of treatment, but to my delight it surprised me hugely and is definitely one of the funniest anime's I've experienced in a good while.\r\nStory (9/10)\r\nThe story focuses on Itsuki Hashima, a growing Light Novelist, who has an obsession for little sisters and puts them into his stories.\r\nThat's pretty much the gist of the story, mainly because there isn't much of a story here.Instead it's more of a character driven story, where it relies more on the chemistry between the characters instead of like a big end goal you usually see.\\n\r\nIt still shows what the life of a light novelist is like, much like in Eromanga Sensei. However that is just an example of what it's like starting out as a light novelist, whereas here we see it in much greater detail as Itsuki struggles to keep up with deadlines and trying to make sure his stories are at their finest quality. Itsuki and his friends often travel to places to think up of ideas for their stories and even shows how manga artists operate too. \\n\r\nCompared to Eromanga Sensei, this anime goes into much deeper aspects of the life of Light Novelists and other various stuff linked to it, like anime and manga.\\n\r\nThe meat of the show though, is the characters themselves. I absolutely love the amount of chemistry the characters had and made each episode so much fun to watch. They usually had meetups, parties or played games from time to time and these instances were really great, it was really funny how quickly all of the conversations and games got out of hand making for some spectacular moments of hilariousness.\\n\r\nThere was also a some what deepness to the anime, the interactions between the characters as we got to know them more showed a deeper meaning to their relationships and how much they mean to each other. These moments were nicely spaced inbetween the comedic stuff and gave you a reason to care for the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nIt has been a long while since I have seen a group of characters and enjoy every single one of them, usually there's always one character who seems bland or dislikeable. I could not find that here and I applaud the anime for managing to do this.\\n\\n\r\nItsuki is the male MC and creates light novels that always involve the main character having a little sister. The fact that for once he isn't a 15 year old sex thirsty teen felt refreshing, yeah his fetish for little sisters is pretty damn creepy, but the anime turns it into a big joke that just made me like the character more. Also despite looking like he isn't always in the best mood, he respects and enjoys the company of his friends and has brilliant banter with them. He also puts a lot of passion and determination into his stories which also has to gain some respect as well.\\n\r\nNayuta Kani is the female MC and also a light novelist, she is pretty much the character who steals the show, sure all the other characters are great, but Kani is absolutely hilarious. She has an immense affection for Itsuki since his stories saved her from a deep depression and she hopes to be his girlfriend one day, luckily she doesn't force this in a stupid like most other characters I've seen do this. She also has a really lewd mouth meaning most of her sentences will always end up being something sexual and oh boy can it be pure gold, because no matter what she said it always made me laugh. She also has this funny obsession of having to touch another girls breasts just to help her create an image for her story, which was always funny with Miyako.\\n\r\nHaruto Fuwa is another male character, who is a light novelist. He and Itsuki always have a friendly competition with each other when it comes to the sales and feedback of their light novels, but they respect each other in the area they work in. Fuwa is a pretty cool dude and you tend to feel sorry for him when his work becomes a poorly made anime, he usually gets through the hard times thanks to his friends and sometimes even gains determination from the way Itsuki does his work.\\n\r\nMiyako Shirakawa isn't a light novelist and used to be Itsuki's friend in college before he dropped out, she tends to be the one who doesn't know as much stuff when it comes to the industry her friends work in and wishes she could understand it better with how much they talk about it and love doing what they do. You also tend to feel a little sorry for her innocent nature as she tends to get caught up in pretty funny situations with Kani that end up with her being nude.\\n\r\nChihiro Hashima is Itsuki's step-brother, well in Itsuki's eyes she is since Chihiro is actually his step-sister. She tends to look after Itsuki when the going gets tough and makes him meals and does chores around the room when he doesn't have time to do it. She's a pretty strong and capable character, despite ending up in a few funny situations with Itsuki's friends and associates.\\n\\n\r\nArt (8/10)\\n\\n\r\nEven though the artstyle isn't really amazing, there is still something there. The characters did have a familiar look to Tsurezure Children with the sorta play doh look except it wasn't as strong here, although it made the female characters a lot cuter despite them being 18 and older.\\n\r\nI did like the different locations the characters went to for their story ideas, so the anime wasn't limited to one area and some of the stuff to represent manga and light novel drawings were pretty damn good replications, kinda inceptiony really.\\n\r\nI also liked some of the other stuff like that one episode where they tried to play out a fantasy game, that felt pretty interesting with the designs as well.\\n\\n\r\nSound (7/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is admittedly the weakest section of the anime. The op was alright, but didn't grow on me much by the end.\\n\r\nThe ed however was actually sweet and had a nice soft beat to it that always felt relaxing to hear at the end of an episode, but there was a particular section of the soundtrack for the ed that sounded a little like The Devil is a Part Timer ed.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is also pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nExtras:\\n\\n\r\nEven though there is quite a good amount of ecchi, it is nicely used as a tool for the shows comedic elements and the both of them work incredibly well together, which surprised me. Usually whenever anime's try to combine these two things like most Harems it kinda falls flat and ends up being more cringy than funny, here they are used at specific moments and boy are some of these moments absolutely fantastic, my favourite being the encounter between Chihiro and Ena, where Ena wanted to sketch Chihiro's ass and the way it was done was friggin hilarious.\\n\r\nThere is a romance element here too, this subtlety grows over the course of the show especially between Itsuki and Kani who become two really lovable characters by the end and actually seem like they have a chance of ending up together.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nThis is probably one of the funniest if not the funniest anime I saw from 2017.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (9/10)\\n\\n\r\nOverall this is definitely an anime that thinks you're in for more of the stupid brother/sister complex crap, especially with the opening sequence. Instead it uses that stuff as parody material and uses it to great effect, this definitely feels like an underrated gem.",

However, there are still some secrets that have not been revealed, many.\r\nAnd also there are some scenes that I think are very boring, one example is the board game they play. Almost of the whole part of the anime is dominated by it. However, all of that is replaced by a few minutes romance scenes that can cover it all.\r\nIts Ecchi part too, well I think destroy the moment. I imagine this anime without the Ecchi section, just a romantic comedy. Thatwill make me satisfied.\\n\\n\r\nI think the anime is not finished yet,.

            "content": "This is literally the definition of \"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\". Yes, the first 2 minutes of the anime make it seem like some kind of imouto incest trash show, however, after those two minutes, the show becomes amazing. I see so many people just categorizing this anime as a \"Eromanga Sensei 2.0\" or calling it trash, because of the first two minutes and the title. The title is misleading and the first two minutes have NOTHING to do with the actual show. Okay, now that my ranting is out of the way, let's start the actual review.\r\n Story:\r\nThe story itself is prettygreat. It's a good blend of slice of life and comedy with a couple drama elements here and there that don't seem too out of place. Sure, some episodes may seem pointless and that they are there just for fanservice or filler, every single one of them has some kind of purpose, if you look closely enough. The best way to notice this is to rewatch the anime after you finished it (I watched it first with subs and then went to see how the dub was) and you will realize that. The pacing isn't the best and some details still need to be explained a little bit better, but it's definitely much better than average. And I do believe that this will get a Season 2 based on the ending, so most details that aren't explained in this season, will be explained in the next one.\\n\r\nOverall: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI don't really have much to say about the artstyle. It's pretty good, though some people might not like it. The actual animation quality is pretty good and nothing really seems out of place. The character designs themselves are pretty decent and they stand out. \\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening theme is outstanding, and the ending is pretty good, however, the rest of the OST doesn't really stand out all that much. But if you actually go back and listen to it, you will see that it has some pretty catchy and good songs. While not the greatest OST out there, it's still pretty good.\\n\r\nOverall: 8.5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nThis is without a doubt the best part of the entire Anime. All of the characters are unique in their own way and they aren't just some dumb people that can't make decisions, but have their own flaws, goals, desires, and overall feel like real people. The main character himself has a serious obsession with little sisters, and sure, it does get pretty extreme at some points, but it never feels TOO overboard and suits his personality and character. And his relationship with every other character is pretty great as well. Nayuta, or \"Ochinchin girl\" as some of you might call her, isn't just some thirsty girl, but actually has a reason for being this way, is really cute, and her backstory is very interesting and one of the things I wish were explained in more detail. Miyako is also pretty interesting, and feels the most realistic out of all of them, for several reasons that I cannot mention here because of the risk of spoilers. And then there's Haruto, which the story makes you feel bad for and wish to see succeed. However, things never really seem to go right for him. As I said, if you need a reason to watch this series, this is it. The characters are outstanding and the series will make you care about them pretty quickly. \\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: \\n\r\nThe series itself is extremely enjoyable, really funny, and the drama portions that are thrown in there don't feel too out of place. If you're looking for an anime just for enjoyment, this will most definitely not disappoint you. \\n\r\nOverall: 10/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is my first review, so it might not be perfect, but I had so much frustration built up inside of me because of all the people that just give it a 1 without even watching it and judge the anime because of a couple scenes, I just had to write a review. I could do in so much more detail but that would risk spoilers. Just go watch the series. You will not regret it. Can't wait for a Season 2.",

The characters were great, the comedy was excellent, the pacing was perfect, there are so many good things I could say about this show!\r\nI really liked how the mindset and actions of Itski become so much clearer as the story goes on, he starts off just seeming like an idiotic freak but by the end of the show each of his personality traits can be explained by something from his past. Really good example of character development.\r\nMy only flaw with this entire anime isit's title and it's summary, they do not in any shape or form do it justice. Accompanied with the opening scene in episode 1 they give the impression that the show is something along the lines of \"Oreimo\" or \"Eromanga Sensei\" when this is NOT the case at all.\\n\\n\r\nI've seen some of the illustrations from the light novel so I know some of the story ahead and I would absolutely love to see another season covering those events.\\n\\n\r\nCompletely blew expectations out of the water.

After the first 2 minutes, i thought it was trying to one up the trashy shows we have been getting lately, but when it turned out to be the butt of a joke i knew this show wouldn't be too bad. \r\n     The story was awkward to say the least. It wasn't bad by any means, but weird at some points. Sometimes the show would take itself seriously then *BAM*\r\nJailbait tits (Wait she doesn't count as jailbait, she is 18)\r\nThe second half of this show is reallywhat made me enjoy it. Actual development, actual feelings, and actual stories that you could relate too. This Show's \"story\" boils down to raunchy humor with some surprisingly good moments. It's a comedy through and through, but it can get some emotions out of you. (some of those might just be anger)\\n\r\nStory:8\\n\r\n     Nothing much to say about the art, nothing stood out nor was it ugly. It was meh I guess...\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\n     Same with the sound as above. You could complain about the repetitiveness of the music, but oh well. It sounded fine.\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\n     Early on in this show's season, I couldn't have fathomed me saying this, but the characters are one of the strongest points in the show. Maybe because this show just stands out for the genre it's in, but the character development was kind of good. Like i said previously, the second half of this Show's cycle really made it as good as it is.\\n\r\nCharacter:8\\n\r\n     The show is very enjoyable. There are many episodes, or flashbacks, that you can relate too. You almost feel bad for some characters when you realize that they will never achieve what they want. Fuwa's life kind of falls apart, but he picks himself up. Oh i should probably talk about the humor. That's hit or miss, if you aren't okay with raunchier humor you might not enjoy this show.\\n\r\nEnjoyment:8\\n\r\n     Overall, this show blew my expectations. That isn't as good as i make it sound. My expectations were astronomically low for this, but i picked it up and it wasn't bad. This show should leave you saying \"A season 2 is all you need\"\\n\r\nOverall:7.2\\n\\n\\n",

This anime is mostly a comedy and really nothing else, maybe slice of life/ comedy. So was it funny? At times sure but it wasn't lol funny. Lots of sexual type jokes less slap-stick or punch line type jokes. My problem with this one is that for the most part, story wise, nothing happens. And yet it hints that it will. It almost felt like two people wrote the script where one wanted a story and theother just wanted cheap laughs. This lack of fluidity made me not care about the characters and all in all made it less funny. Now i can forgive any anime if it has good romance, unfortunately if you're here for the romance be prepared to be underwhelmed. And that's all i'll say about that. I recommend this anime to anyone with nothing better to watch or want a quick laugh. I did enjoy it enough to finish it with ease but next week I will have forgotten all about it.",

            "content": "Imouto sae Ireba Ii. A Sister's All You Need...no this seriously isn't ANOTHER imouto incest anime...though it looks it.\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii. is by far for LA, one of the animes for Fall 2017 where much of the outcry for this anime as unwarranted even with it's excessive ecchiness which it displays itself full force. Yeah, LA saw Imouto sae Ireba Ii. as more of a character study of writers more than the ecchiness overload many thought from the first few minutes of this anime...though as LA says that, LA knows Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has it's problems even due to this.\r\nWell the first thingto deal with is the excessive fanservice Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has, the main culprit and instigator from all this is usually Nayuta Kani voiced by Hisako Kanemoto. LA at first was skeptical about her as a character and she usually derails many of the cast's conversations and games, but for LA if anything she spiced things up taking things to the extreme towards an anime that is mostly talking...sure it's fanservice but LA doesn't care, LA hasn't seen this brazen of a character since...Eromanga-sensei...if you catch LA's drift.\\n\\n\r\nNow the character study about writers are shown through the main protagonist Itsuki Hashima being an amateur siscon novelist, Haruto Fuwa voiced by Hiro Shinono, a fledging writer who happens to be friends with Itsuki, the aforementioned Nayuta  and a genius novelist who are actually influenced by Itsuki and has a uhhhh....very clingy liking to Nayuta because of it. Now these writers also surrounds themselves with editors, auditors, friends and illustrators which makes up for the anime being mostly talking. The most interesting and LA's favourite character in Imouto sae Ireba Ii. being Miyako Shrakawa voiced by Ai Kakuma being both Itsuki and Nayuta's friend. There are other characters like Ashley Ono voiced by Manami Numakura (the auditor) and Kaiko Mikuniyama voiced by Akane Fujita (illustrator and a caricature of Sagiri Izumi from Eromanga-sensei) to have her own...unique scenes to their plate however besides the editors in this anime, the rest brings little to the plate besides their one-scene wonders.\\n\\n\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii's most interesting aspects goes to us going into the writers headspace through the main cast (all ranging from different backgrounds) and seeing how they tick or just their way of thinking when it comes to writing in the form of the weird games they play. From Nayuta's blatant fanserviced nature to Itsuki's siscon fetish to Miyako being the minder to most of the cast and trying to get the story back on track. It's a weird notion but it's similar to Eromanga-sensei's belief on writing (Imouto sae Ireba Ii. has some strong connections to Eromanga sensei doesn't it?).\\n\\n\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii's shortcomings however comes in the form of plotlines not following through at times such as Chihiro Hashima (Itsuki's step brother) and again the odd one scene wonder characters like Ashley and Kaiko doesn't get brought up again. This and the most obvious one being of who Itsuki's likes by the end isn't shown in this anime and it's a shame as LA oddly liked the dynamic of Itsuki's pseudo-friendship romances...just not the follow through.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation by Sliver Link is mostly decent, from the good yet not as exotic character designs to the typical backgroundings, the \"game\" animation was greatly done and yes...the fanservice is great for the most part even if it is mostly intentionally censored for obvious reasons. \\n\\n\r\nThe voice acting, well, LA doesn't need to say much but Hisako Kanemoto, Ai Kakuma and Manami Numakura blasted this anime out of the gate. Though LA likes Miyako as a character, this is a role Ai Kakuma is in her niche (a la fanservicey shows), the MVP easily goes to Hisako Kanemoto going full lewd mode and her mannerisms.\\n\\n\r\nThe only other plot point that actually does have a follow through is how Itsuki became obsessed with little sisters in the first place and to contrast Masamune Izumi's beliefs, Itsuki's backstory has some legitimacy to it...but that isn't until the final episode of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nImouto sae Ireba Ii. has it's major problems to the detriments of it's heavy reliance of fanservice, plotlines not going following through and an anime mostly about talking. But for what's it worth...Imouto sae Ireba Ii. though it's risky and \"controversial\" in many ways it has become to be known as...it rewarded you at least. \\n\\n\r\nIt's no great masterpiece...but LA doesn't think Imouto sae Ireba Ii. was intending to anyways.",

Sure, it had unispired characters for a slice of life-like anime, still, it mananged to make me enjoy the whole thing from beggining to end, loving and wanting the best for (almost) all characters (exception is the crazy tax bitch).

            "content": "Imouto sae Ireba Ii (A Sister's All You Need) is an anime which i didn't expect much off. But to my surprise, it is, in my opinion, one of the best anime of this season. And I think that if this anime came out last season for example, it would've probably got way more attention. The synopsis is kinda misleading. It gives off the vibes of a carefree comedy/romance with basically no plot. But in reality, it is none of that. While Comedy is very dominant in this show, it also has some slight romance and drama in it, and a kind of shocking twistswhich you would not expect from this sort of show (This is more apparent in the later episodes). As for the characters, I personally found them very entertaining, with each character having multiple dimensions to their personality rather than a blank canvas. Overall this anime was very enjoyable and one which i would recommend to anyone who enjoys this sort of anime, and especially to those who enjoyed oregairu and want something similar\\n\\n\\n\r\nPS: I found that this anime's writer also wrote Haganai, which I've heard good things about. So i might give it a shot.\\n",

So, before I go into depths of this review, I'll take my sweet time to point something for you people out there\r\n- This is NOT Eromanga-sensei 2.0 or Oreimo 2.0\r\nMeaning, there's no romance between sister and brother. Hell, there's hardly a sister shown at first. It is nonexistent to me.\r\nSo, after putting it there, I'd like to go into depths of the show.\r\nThe MC, Itsuki Hashima is a novelist with a sister complex. Sounds like Eromanga? Yep, you goddamnright. What makes this different is, there's no sister at all. It's just fantasy of the MC. This anime mostly take place in Itsuki's apartment. It's a dialogue, character-based show. One like in Joshiraku or Monogatari series but not that intense. The take on novelist life is realistic and sometimes relatable. The animation is decent. Nothing feels out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe anime rely on the character interaction so, not much of a story happening here. Still, it's good and sometimes sad as well. Looking at the hardship of a novelist and all.\\n\\n\r\nVerdict\\n\r\nThis anime is underrated and overlooked because of the misleading title and premise while in reality it is a good show",

This show is about a little sister fetish light novelist who goes through his life with his friends, some of which who also have a part in the business of writing. Now, this sounds like a couple partially infamous shows, Eromanga Sensei, and Orimo. Imouto sae Ireba Ii is very different from these, first off, these characters are adults, they have adult problems and overarching goals. Its very down to earth like that. Second, although they are both about writers who are siscons, the protagonists are very different. The protagonistof Imouto sae Ireba Ii is cold, distant, and has a pseudo-unrealistic sort of personality from the normal main character. Where is the protagonist of Eromgana Sensei is your basic nice guy character. These characters, I feel are realistic enough to have them relatable, but odd enough for me to enjoy the show, which is the perfect medium. The art and animation aren't anything special unfortunately. Nothing anime ruining, but noticeable. The music is also nothing to look at. The show is character driven for sure. I give this show a 7 out of 10. Id recommend this to someone who likes a nice, mature-ish show that doesn't take itself very seriously. This has been your spoiler free but not really review on Imouto sae Ireba Ii.",

            "content": "Would you think that a show whose first minute shows a guy eating his little sister\u2019s underwear a good show? Of course not right? You would never think of it as a worthwhile show to watch. But having to see the rest of this series, my answer would be as ambiguous as this show can get. You see, this show has a lot of potential. But most of it gets overshadowed by the unnecessary tropes and fan service present in the show. It would have been a perfect drama/romance/slice of life anime if it weren\u2019t for a few problems that this show possesses. To fillyou in with the details, let\u2019s start with the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe story revolves around our protagonist, Itsuki, and his daily life as a light novel author whose books involve incestuous themes of obsession to little sisters. Even though this series was supposed to be more romance oriented, I say that it exceled as a slice of life show. The show did well highlighting the life of a light novel author. From the struggles of writing a material and making it to the deadline up to the conflicts that arise between authors and the anime industry, these were all portrayed very well making it an excellent slice of life anime. Meanwhile, it also did well creating a whole dramatic atmosphere as the characters interact to each other. From the start, the relationship between characters are already well-built and all throughout the series, it shows how such relationships we\u2019re made. It did in a very dramatic way the can surely deal impact on the viewers. The flashbacks that show how each and every single one of the characters met always left me with feeling of both sadness and amusement. This aspect of the show is what I admire the most. It is what kept me from continuing the show despite having some aspects that I can\u2019t deal with that well. I\u2019m talking about of course the tropes and fan service present in the show. To begin with, this series already follows the \u201cimouto\u201d trend that\u2019s been going on for quite a while now. But what really took the cake when it comes to ruining this show was the fan service. From the female anatomy up to the simplest of dialogues, this series is not holding back. Just by looking at the first episode you\u2019ll be greeted by an extremely weird incest fan service that would leave you wanting to drop this show immediately. But what really irritated me the most were the obligatory sex jokes on almost every line of one of the heroine\u2019s dialogue. To me, it felt like these bad aspects of the show were overshadowing the good ones.  These bad aspects were a bit more prominent during the first few episodes of the series. This might cause a lot of views to get turned off and drop the show instantly. Although halfway along the series, all the fan service gradually toned down and it focused more on being light-hearted show. Even the \u201cimouto\u201d romance that I thought this show would have was not present anymore. The last few episodes featured the characters just playing games almost the entire episode like you see in most slice of life anime. The bits of progression were still there and I don\u2019t really have problems with those episodes because they are still entertaining nonetheless.  The ending gave me a vague impression that this show will receive another season. If so, then that would be great and I would gladly watch it. So overall, I can say for that the story did a fair job in as an element of this show. It did its best to be different even though the concept of the story isn\u2019t really something new. Although I say it would have been a lot better if all the unnecessary fan service and stereotypes were not present in the first place. But nonetheless, it\u2019s still quite entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t really go in-depth with the characters because I might end up leaving a few spoilers but to say for sure, the charm of this show comes from the characters. Despite looking quite generic, the characters are actually well written. Their relationship felt so real and heartwarming. Every interaction between them leaves you with a distinct smile. If there\u2019s something worth-while from this show, it would be the characters. \\n\\n\r\nWhen it comes to the art of this series, I can\u2019t really say that I\u2019m a fan of it. The art style is pretty much your run-of-the-mill stuff with more vibrant colors but lesser detail. But there\u2019s the occasional bright and colorful background that was used in the show.  It caught my attention the first time I saw it but then I don\u2019t ever remember seeing it again. The character design made the characters look like teens while in reality, they are adults. Overall, I\u2019d say the art is okay but really nothing impressive.\\n\\n\r\nFor the sound, this show really has some good opening and ending theme on it. Personally, I really liked the ending theme. Hearing it play at the end of every episode felt soothing. The opening also did a great job setting the tone of the show. For the soundtracks that play on the background, those that play during the lighter, more slice of life oriented scenes are the ones the caught my attention. So I\u2019d say that the sound was pretty good.\\n\r\nIn conclusion, I say this show is not that bad. If you look at the story and the characters alone, this is a perfect drama/romance/slice of life anime. Those that are capable of tolerating fan service and stereotypes are probably in for a ride but those who can\u2019t are better off skipping this one. Although it has it fair share of elements that I don\u2019t find amusing, I can\u2019t say that I did not enjoy this show. If ever it will receive another season and I will probably give it a chance.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall score would be 7/10. \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading.\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "An excellent little anime, with amusing sidelines, I'm substantially further along in the series than most of these reviewers so it's hard to explain why my review is so favorable without massive spoilering. The focus of the anime is not little sisters or that Itsuki actually has one oops... screw it the series is almost over. The focus of the story is the development of the relationship between Itsuki and Nayu, she's no joke she will do anything to get Itsuki, and her behind the scenes machinations become front and center around episode 8 or 9. To the point of wresting a manipulated confession froman inebriated Itsuki while she was supposed to be asleep and not hear. Her powers and influence seem almost godlike in their ability to get exactly what she wants maybe channeling Haruhi Suzumiya? At some point apparently Itsuki did something that saved her life what it was has been alluded to but not revealed perhaps episode 12 will bring it to light. The anime is not about romance between siblings the most lascivious thing about the anime is the Yuri teasing between the openly female characters and Nayu's skinship with the other girls. This is not a bad thing it teases but does not satisfy with good \"plot\" or \"fanservice\". That said very much looking forward to the close though i'd love the anime to extend another season as the world and characters are interesting.\\n\\n\r\nMusic is so so kinda like elevator music. Artwork is very good and I watch a lot of anime.  Overall this anime made my 10 for the Fall season right up there with Girls Last Tour, Konohana Kitan, Blend S and Net Juu no Susume. The star of Fall is no doubt Ancient Magus Bride. The anime kept my attention enough that I grabbed each episode as soon as it was subbed.",

            "content": "First of all, this is my first review, so I apologize in advance if it is not very good. However, what I want to say that is you should watch the entire anime before you say make a judgement because it honestly surprised me.\r\nIn my opinion, the summary does not really do this anime justice. It is a barebones explanation of the premise of the anime. Note that I said premise, because it is definitely not an adequate representation of the anime itself. It states that it is \"the daily life of a young siscon novelist, Itsuki Hashima with his perfect little sister Chihiro.\" Theproblem with this is that it portrays the anime as about little sister love, but that is incorrect. It almost has nothing to do with actual little sisters. This anime is about the life of a writer who loves little sisters, but he only writes about them. The anime has almost no focus on the little sister loving the main character.\\n\\n\r\nSome others have said that it is unoriginal and simply recycles the trope of little sisters. However, I would have to disagree with this--the people who posted these reviews likely had not watched that far into the anime. Even some reviews that are somewhat positive show that they have only watched four episodes or so.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not remarkable in any way; it is a typical slice of life show out of high school. The art and sound are nothing special as well, and there is quite a bit of fanservice. But what stands out to me is the characters. At first glance, they seem to be boring, cookie-cutter characters, but after the first few episodes, the characters, particularly the two male writers receive a bit more character development. The part that really sells it for me is how it balances seriousness and comedy. There is usually a few episodes of lightheartedness before being interrupted by a serious section, which helps to give the viewer a rest from the comedy and lighthearted sections. Personally, this was quite refreshing and helped to stop and overwhelming amount of cuteness and comedy.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime actually goes somewhat in depth to the feelings and lives of writers (which seems fitting, since it was originally a light novel series). Most of it revolves around how they are afraid they will not be successful in the light novel and anime world, and how they feel when they do succeed. Additionally, they have a eighteen-year-old genius writer close to them that the main character constantly compares themselves with. This is really what makes me love the characters so much because I can understand how they feel. It really speaks to me.\\n\\n\r\nI feel like I have not properly explained what makes this anime good, so I think that you should watch this anime to see for yourself. Although it starts out somewhat slow, that is how slice-of-life anime generally start out, so I do not think that is really a negative point. So far, I have really enjoyed this anime. I hope that I will still hold the same opinion once it ends because like Arkada from Glass Reflection, I believe the ending to be paramount. Let us hope that they do not mess it up like UQ Holder because they really messed that up.",

            "content": "A Little Sister Is All You Need(Imouto Sae Ireba Ii)was a big surprise for me.The way the series starts out is so infamous of how messed up it was that it turned off a good chunk of people.I expected to go head first into an eromanga sensei-esque trashy incest show because of the title.BUT this show is waaaaaaay different than that.The story more or less is about this light novel author with a weird fetish for younger sisters who makes his stories about little sisters.And this show is just his journey making his way up through the entertainment business with his peers,with lives of theirown cheering him on.Despite how \u201chype\u201d that plot sounds, It is way more tame than it sounds.But, for some reason IT\u2019S SO DAMN ENTERTAINING.Let me explain\u2026\\n\\n\r\nDespite the very casual nature, it is not boring at all because of the colorful characters put in these real life situation.For light novel authors that is.That also made it interesting because it informed me on the light novel industry, which i knew nothing about, it also answered one question that was on  my mind since i started watching anime:why the hell there were so many shitty anime adaptations.There are situations that bring up new perspective and completely changed my mindset about manga and anime adaptations.Surprisingly this show also gets super emotional too and it is done in a very organic way.Not only that but it really got to me, it did really speak to me even though I am not an author and I feel like it will speak to many others who watch.When it comes the slice of life aspect, it does deliver as well.Usually the characters are either going on trips or playing games.They are funny as hell but each have their own story supported by the main one.It still makes me question if being a light novel writer is like this because there are a lot of wacky moments,but in the end, this story is really enjoyable,thoughtful, with characters that make it so wholesome And the ending of the show is just amazingly beautiful and it really raised the bar on my overall thoughts of the show.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation was done by silver link whom I adore.They made Yurikuma Arashi (One of my favorite anime of all time btw) and they made other shows.Silver Link can animate really well,\\n\r\nBut are mostly comfortable being average.Honestly, the animation did not bother me.Yurikuma had a reason to be beautifully animated, this show does not really, but I can still tell that they had a very moderate budget.The character designs are average but appealing, and the background is just a hair above average.\\n\\n\r\nThe opening is one of my favorites ever,it\u2019s just so catchy and sounds so good,the ending song is also great too with a catchy beat and a nice crescendo.I absolutely adore what they do with the visuals of them. If you pay attention, they change parts in the opening depending on the episode. And the ending feels so well fitted into each episode that it feels like less of end sequence and like a montage.And for some reason the soundtrack was good too???\\n\r\nThere were some catchy ass tracks in this show. It is hard to explain, but it was like it was simple but varied at the same time.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOkay the characters in the show includes the main one Itsuki, his author friend Haruto,his other friend/potential love bug Nayuta,his\u2026.other friend Miyako who was the bystander looking in,and his \u201cbrother\u201dChihiro.There are so many dynamics with these characters,main or minor, that it\u2019s like a star.One character is developed by others and vice versa.Despite the qualities about the main character, with his INSANE sister fetish, I still enjoyed him because of his experiences with others.I liked his aggressive nature with his editor despite the fact that it can get illegal at times.I liked how his experiences influenced his story, and i liked how he learned lessons and felt like a true adult,despite his sister fetish, and by the end of the show, i felt like I knew so much about him that by the end he really won me over.The other characters are great too, they all have different uprisings and backstory, and they all change for better or worse.Nayuta was one of those characters who try to pursue the main character,but it wasn\u2019t super annoying and dumb, it was pulled off very well.They took an interesting route with the romance in the show basing off implications and I thought it was for the best since it would offset the true nature of the show.I enjoyed myself watching how these people act so familiar and hilariously around each other. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, if there was one lesson to learn from this show it is to not judge a book by it\u2019s cover.It\u2019s super ironic how when I seek out a bad show, I enjoy it, but when I watch a show people say is good, I don\u2019t like it that much.Despite this being a show you have to be relaxed to watch, it felt like such a wonderful ride from start to finish, full of the thrills, the laughs, and some tears at moments.It also gave me a lot to think about the industry and I cannot recommend it enough.\\n\\n\r\nOverall-9\\n\r\ndon't have sex in the middle of a town, or you'll be arrested.",

It was really a inspired serie.\r\nFirst little story preview. Its all about one boy who want to be a writer in Manga/Anime or something similar. And he is obsessed by little sisters. He got a bunch of friends who are also try to be succesfull as writer/anime maker (or something similar). The story is all about friends, competition and work.\r\nStory 9: Great story and easy to follow. I did enjoy it alot. There was a lot of fun in itand some serieus parts were very touching. \\n\\n\r\nArt 8: Not the greatest art style but still really good. All the animations were nice to.\\n\\n\r\nSound 7: The opening and ending was good enough. The opening music was very calm and chill. Sound effect in this serie were good. Not really anoying.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8: Ok...now the fun part. Yeah all the character were very good. I did like the main character alot. The story of him why he is doing this. And he's past was very sad. The friends of he's were good. The pervert girlfriends was to funny. And the nerdy anime maker. Well he is good in he's job.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9: 3 days of finish it. And the best 3 days to watch this anime. I really cant wait for a sequel?! It really a serie wich everybody can follow easy. Not alot of talky talky. And it reminds me alot of my past with friends (only had no girls in my friends group :P ).\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8: With a 8 its still a great serie. And I didn't expect this outcome. Maby I was a little bit pervy before. But...it was worth watching and I recommend it to my friends and maby you to.",

To call it a romance is a bit of a stretch but that does not stop me from recommending it to other people, Its cute, funny, and has that little bit of cringe that we all like. Its not focused on the drama aspect but there are hints and moments of some, and the anime leaves off for a season 2 if there will beone.\\n\\n\r\nIf it has a season 2 and actually goes into romance more i'd put this at one of my top anime so far in my no life otaku journey of 18 years.\\n\\n\r\nOverall im conflicted to put into 8's but its def a 8/10 so far, subjected to go higher if we ever get more.\\n",

If you\u2019re coming in expecting a stereotypical siscon harem, which personally I am a fan of the genre and will neglect to comment on it as a whole, you will be pleasantly surprised that this series tackles some very mature themes such as the daily life of a light novel author in its intrinsically volatile industry, whatit takes to maintain inspiration despite horrible commentaries, and even what it means to be the protagonist in your own story of your life. \\n\\n\r\nI would also like to see more characters like Itsuki, introspective and daring characters willing to take the first steps into their own futures, rather than waiting for their \"moment\" to shine or chance to reach them. Kind of a tangent, but it's nice to see a character that is willing to progress his own story rather than wait for the story develop around him. It was welcoming to see this anime tackle this kind of problem in the way it does, and the sole reason I rate Character as a 9.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series to everyone that is a fan of slice of life dramas/rom-coms, and would strongly remind you to give the anime a chance past its \u201cNormie Filter\u201d first few minutes of the first episode.",

            "content": "\u2018Never judge a book by its cover\u2019. And after a few episodes, I can commit that \u201cImouto Sae Ireba Ii\u201d is a great example of the quote. I was lost my momentum because of trailer, preview and thought it would be a romance slice of life around a siscon decorated with ecchi and harem. But I\u2019ve learnt my lesson: I shouldn\u2019t be a weather forecast just based on some minutes of the film.\r\nAbout how I could have deviation before and at the beginning, the first scene of ep1 definitely takes in charge. Its genre had been rechecked to make sure \u2018hentai\u2019 didn\u2019t contain, so basically,I just can\u2019t believe what I just saw. Because we have a spoiler disallowance, I can only reveal that it\u2019s on a whole new level of perverted, also disgusting inspired by an incestuous love. That\u2019s how our main character, Itsuki-sensei, make a debut by asserting specific favor in his light novels: Brother x Little Sister romance.\\n\\n\\n\r\nComedy is another genre that I\u2019m confused at. My emotion gets deeper and deeper as the story develops, grown by novelists\u2019 precarious career, nurtured by their mysterious unhappy past and ripe at their relationship. Talk about relationship, not only about sad triangle love, but the interactions with other characters are enough for me to look forward to watching next episodes. By the way, some enjoyable, interesting board games they presented cooperated with happy slice of life has brought comedic atmosphere back to the series.   \\n\\n\\n\r\nOne of the spotlight is the plot of some conversations, what can I say, is extraordinary. I mean the words come naturally as they\u2019re close friends, no beef, but just about pe**s, panties, somethings need to be tagged as R18 generally (just a vague comment as I knew we got R+-Mild Nudity rating). So that, if perverted flirting were illegal, Nayu-chan could be on target of any policeman. Pop up as a naughty girl with a \u201cbeautiful mind\u201d and also a yuri lover, she easily passes all competitors to be on top of fan favorite character. \\n\\n\\n\r\nTo get along with Nayuta, we have Lil-sis addict Itsuki with his buddy Haruto, all of them are talent novelists; and then reverse trap stepsister Chihiro; Itsuki\u2019s friend Miyako\u2026 They\u2019re really an important piece for Imouto Sae Ireba Ii. Character also takes my best grade and high appreciation of reviewers while each has his/her own jewel inside. \\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nGreat anime with just comedy, romance isn\u2019t what I chose to keep following, but the dramatic moods, good fan service art, sound and the life of light novelists attracted me to keep my eyes stick on the screen and enjoy every moments. Additionally, ED song made me feel a bit sad with deep melody on sedentary background. \\n\\n\r\nI can\u2019t wait till the ss2 after the OE.   \\n\\n\r\nEp 9: useful tip right there.\\n",

In his career, he met a group of friends (few of them are perverted) that have passions about novels similar to his own.\r\nI genuinely thought thatthe anime was gonna be one those trash anime where the entire series is filled with ecchi/fanservice scenes and I was correct but it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it was though. Turns out, the story itself is somewhat emotional even with the few ecchi scenes. Giving us an in-depth view of the lives of the people that work in the novel/manga/anime industry, showing the process of how a novel is written and the struggles that novelists have to experience in their lives. \\n\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10\\n\r\nThis style holds a soft spot for me, it\u2019s so lively yet beautiful.

In contrast of the opening, the ending is soft and soothing vibe to it, each beat giving a chilling sensation down my spine and myself a total eargasm of pleasure. \\n\\n\\n\r\nCharacters 6/10\\n\\n\r\nEach episode gives out a bit of information of the characters like pieces of puzzle, informations about their personality, past, experience influencing them into the person they currently are in the anime. In some point of the series, you will have enough pieces and complete the puzzle, revealing the characters.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\\n\r\nAbsoulutely enjoyed the anime to my fullest and don\u2019t have much complaint of it. Though it would be great if there was a sequel, the ending of the anime just left me craving for more of what will happen next.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall 9/10\\n\\n\r\nIf you\u2019re a person that favors the comedy and romance genre then this anime is must watch.\\n",

            "content": "I wrote this review with the intent of reminding myself when I look back on this\r\nanime a few years from now.  \r\n-SPOILERS ALERT-\r\nThis anime has a lot of themes mixed in. \r\nI was sceptical of this anime from the first five minutes, but I'm glad that \r\nI gave this anime more time to unfold. The wait was well worth it, and it\r\nwas something I can be proud to say I watched with glee.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nConcept is simple. A group of friends centering around the protagonist get \r\ntogether often and share moments of their everyday lives. In this case,\r\nthe majority are in the publishing industry, andso we get a semi-deep \\n\r\nexploration and explanation as to how their everyday schedules are like, and\\n\r\nthe troubles involved. More will be elaborated individually in the characters,\\n\r\nas that is the main focus of this type of anime, where emphasis is placed more\\n\r\non the characters themselves, and the plot takes a background role.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing I want to say is that this is not just a rom-com with randomness. I find the\\n\r\nstory to be well paced in terms of it being a 'slice-of-life', in the sense\\n\r\nthat this is not an anime where you will feel the urge to jump to the next \\n\r\nepisode (like shoujo animes, where cliffhangers are presented). There is an air of\\n\r\n'my pace' throughout every episode, where the characters aren't in life\\n\r\nthreatening situations, but more just struggling to live and cope with situations that\\n\r\nnearly every adult will face. I find that fact itself calming for it fits the overall \\n\r\ncomposition of the anime, where the characters themselves do not show their inner \\n\r\nconflicts openly at first glance, but the cracks can be seen in time (much like most \\n\r\nof society).\\n\\n\r\nAnother interesting note is that they commonly get together and play board games.\\n\r\nYou learn a lot of fun things well visually illustrated. It's a nice side-dish to \\n\r\nthe struggles along the anime.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt was refreshing to note that every one of the characters has almost something that is\\n\r\nrelatable to the viewer watching it. As such, the audience is able to sympathize, or\\n\r\nperhaps even empathise with the character when moments arise. Part of making a \\n\r\nmemorable animation i would imagine is linking the characters or situations to an\\n\r\nemotional attachment the viewer has. Many animes have done that better, but nevertheless,\\n\r\nthis anime also does it quite well.\\n\\n\r\nIf you intend to continue reading past this, be warned for semi heavy spoilers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n\"What you want, someone else always has. And usually, it means nothing to the \\n\r\nperson who actually has it\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nFor a conversational based anime to work, I usually find the the following elements\\n\r\nrecurrent: The idea-presenter/money sponsor, the silly billy /teaser, the straight man,\\n\r\nthe innocent one, the one who goes along with anything. \\n\r\nThis is all apparent, yet tastefully done.\\n\\n\r\nThe main protagonist is a siscon, and my words do understatement to his devotion. \\n\r\nAs a light novelist, his works, lifestyle, fantasies, all revolve around that fact.\\n\r\nHis personality can be at first impressions be a typical cranky adult, but as the \\n\r\nstory unfolds, it is revealed why his circumstances are as they are, and how the\\n\r\ngroup got together around him. Lazy, delirious, kind, yet sometimes sarcastic,\\n\r\nsome can label his type as the classic comfortable friend you can cut loose with.\\n\\n\r\nHis best friend is the total opposite. Organized, neat to a fault, and well composed\\n\r\nat all times, their common lines of work allow them to banter with a level of \\n\r\ngenuineness one can only experience after years of friendship. However, despite\\n\r\nhis systamatic approach of viewing his job, lifestyle and mindset giving him a\\n\r\nhigher edge that most in his line of profession, he isn't happy. They are of a \\n\r\nstark contrast to the protagonist, and it is this polarity that attracts him, in \\n\r\nsearch of his own'uniqueness'.\\n\\n\r\nThe college girl is a typical early student who doesn't know where her future might \\n\r\nlead, what her interests are, and what she should be looking towards. She desires\\n\r\nto 'grow up', hoping that with age, comes wisdom and maturity in her sense of \\n\r\ndirection. She is drawn to the protagonist because of his clarity in what he wants.\\n\r\nInnocent, scared of the possibilities, she hopes that sticking close to him will\\n\r\nshed light upon where she should put her efforts in. Along with time, familiarity\\n\r\nleads to deeper feelings. \\n\\n\r\nThe step-brother is the perfect sibling we all know. Adept at cooking, cleaning,\\n\r\npatient enough to wait upon your needs at any moment, and cares for the family,\\n\r\nwhilst still having enough time to visit the protagonist nearly everyday to cook\\n\r\nhis meals, and attend school ontop. Seemingly contented just to spend time with\\n\r\nthe protagonist, he desires more, but as we all know in sibling / old friends\\n\r\nscenarios, his inability to reveal his feelings out of concern for the other party\\n\r\nlimits his choices.\\n\\n\r\nThe last (main) character is the genius upcoming novelist. Bullied and harassed to the\\n\r\npoint of quitting school, she is saved by the protagonist's words in his light novels,\\n\r\none day while reading inside her room. Out of sheer passion, she starts writing her \\n\r\nown novels, meeting him along the way. Convinced that his words were the saving grace\\n\r\nof her life, she devotes her entire feelings to him wholeheartedly. \\n\\n\r\nAny deeper explanation would ruin the point of watching the anime itself imo.\\n\r\nI would say that this anime is rather.. cruel. Each of the characters each has \\n\r\nunexpressed opinions or desires, but are unable to reveal them. It is this \\n\r\nsense of harbouring that makes the characters memorable. \\n\\n\\n\r\nMusic: 8/10\\n\r\nThe OP/ED were both soothing. Choucho always delivers.\\n\r\nBackground music for situations were fitting, but not memorable. I wouldn't say\\n\r\ngeneric either. The point is, there won't be a time you think : \"why is this music here\".\\n\r\nI find the songs presented at key moments very well placed. Occasional shivers.\\n\\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nCute and fuzzy. Not totoro fuzzy, but along the lines of oreimo, where it is easy on\\n\r\nthe eyes, and not excessively moe to the point of umaru/hinako note at times.\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8/10\\n\r\nThe humour feels forced at times, but thankfully it isn't often enough for it\\n\r\nto be a concern. The ratio of good moments far outweigh the cons.\\n\r\nPartial nudity is a correct way to put it. You will see shapes and outlines,\\n\r\nbut not clear views.  \\n\\n\\n\r\nIf you ever feel like you are being swept away by the tide of the world, just sit back\\n\r\nand enjoy this anime. Give it some time to unveil.",

            "content": "Disclaimer: I do not have any problems with fanservice. It's just that the fanservice in this anime is not executed well and detracts from the better parts of the show.\r\nImouto Sae Ireba Ii is an anime that excels in what it shouldn't excel in and fails at what it should succeed in. What a normal person would expect out of an anime like this is minimal storytelling and plenty of raunchy scenes full of little sisters. However, there are no little sisters to be found, and instead the view is given a minimal yet powerful and melancholic overarching story and fanservice scenes that feel overdoneand boring, providing nothing else besides fap material. \\n\\n\r\nStory - The plot in this anime is practically non-existent with there being a basic premise and fun hijinks between college-aged friends. Despite this, individual episodes have the capacity to give off a melancholic yet beautiful vibe. On the other hand, there are fanservice episodes that give no effort whatsover and that beg for the viewer to buy a BD. These two balance out to a 5. \\n\\n\r\nArt - It's pretty good and the girls are cute. \\n\\n\r\nSound - BGM is upbeat and fun, the OP is pretty good, and the voice acting is good. Nothing much else to say. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Like the story, the characters can be generally split between fanservice and melancholic. Miyako and Fuwa particularly pull at the heartstrings at times as they realize that they're missing something that Kanikou and Itsuki have. Kanikou and the manga girl are lackluster, on the other hand. However, unlike the story, the Characters are generally better with even the fanservice characters having decent development. \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment -  Once again, the fanservice/melancholy dichotomy comes into play here. The enjoyment of the show shoots up when the writing really delivers, but is canceled out a week later when a meaningless episode made to make blood rush to the lower body airs. But hey, if you love that kind of stuff and like good character development here and there, enjoyment would be an easy ten. \\n\\n\r\nOverall - As said above, this show is for people who crave fanservice. Its excessive nature at times will deter possible viewers away, especially in the first episode. However, if you are willing to endure this, you are in for a real treat. Tissues may or may not be needed.",

I kinda expect this to be like OreImo and Eromanga-sensei. \r\nI'm writing this from the perspective of someone who expect this to be kinda like OreImo or Eromanga-sensei, about a brother/sister relationship, so keep that in mind. \r\nThe story is about Hashima Itsuki, a young light-novel author who is really obsessed with 'little sister' character in literature and wants a little sister, and his companions, Kani Nayuta, a highschool girl who is also anauthor and really loves him by showing her affection through dirty jokes and such, Shirakawa Miyako, Itsuki's friend from college and the only one in the group who is not an author, and Fuwa Haruto, Itsuki's male best friend/rival, and Mashima Chihiro, Itsuki's perfect, dependable younger sibling. \\n\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nAs someone who expect the story and plot to revolve around a Brother/Sister relationship, i was pretty much disappointed. The story revolves around Itsuki's life as an author, its more of a slice of life about life as an author, and not much else. I find the humour is pretty dry, and the story/plot to be pretty boring.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nIt has a nice art. I'm not an expert in this area, but well, its pretty nice. \\n\\n\r\nSound: ?\\n\r\nNot an expert, or even an amateur on sound quality, so i can really give a good review about the sound. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 8\\n\r\nThe only redeeming quality about this anime, except for Chihiro, is the character. They all have a different set of personality, and everyone seems to have a deeper character than most other anime. They all have a different reasons on why they hang around Itsuki/becoming Itsuki's friends, and each one is pretty deep. They're not just your generic 'friend to MC' character. Everyone has their own story.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nDespite the lack of interesting plot/story, i found myself mildly enjoying this and just kept watching just because the characters are interesting to me. You might like this if you like slice-of-life genre, and doesn't expect more, but if you expect a romcom or slice-of-life about Brother/Sister relationship, then you will find this a bit disappointing since they rarely show Itsuki's interaction with his younger sibling, Chihiro and focusing more on the 'author' part. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, its 6 from me because i kinda expect this anime to be about a Brother/Sister relationship because of the title (A Sister's All You Need), and just disappointed from the lack of interaction between Itsuki and his younger sibling. Even then, it might be enjoyable if you like slice of life.",

Twelve episodes is not a time commitment worth lamenting on the grand scale of things considering my body isn't that old, but unfortunately my soul resides in a jade skeleton that's collecting dust in a tomb decorated extensively with signs that read \"pick one fucking plot thread and stick with it you nervous bungusbreachers.\"\r\nI expected a pure comedy. I know, it was my mistake. The prolific \"comedy\" tag on MAL has led me astray so many times in my short months as a purveyor of digitized Laotian hand weaving techniques and I absolutelyshould have learned my lesson by now. But as they say in the biz, \"once a total idiot, always a total moran.\" Or something like that. Who knows, it's not like enjoying Mongolian cartoons is actually a job for anyone.\\n\\n\r\nAnyway, this series is about a little sister-obsessed light novel writer and his half dozen or so accomplices. \"OMG accomplices in what?\" -u. Glad you asked: in the heinous cardinal sin of pissing me off by lacking confidence to maintain focus as E I T H E R a comedy O R a drama. One episode is about omni-erectional mobility devices (yes, that's spelled correctly, and yes, I get the reference) and a guy with a meter-long sworddick (yes, that's how it's referred to), the next couple episodes are about unrequited love, dead mothers, broken hearts, and an unresolved conclusion. Earlier there were two young guys going to a sauna for ass research (yes) only to find shriveled grannies, but then the next episode was some melodramatic whatever or other. There is Z E R O consistency.\\n\\n\r\nMost hand-drawn Uzbek tuna fishing motion pictures start as comedies and then turn into something else, which is enough for me to drop about half the animes I start. Here there isn't enough episode-to-episode coherence to *have* an arc like that. It's one up, one down, one up, one down all the way through. And it didn't have to be like that. It really absolutely totally could have been a riotous and raunchy comedy show. I'm serious when I say there are legitimately roflworthy moments. ...but then it decides to be a drama and I found my eyelids drooping out of tedium. \\n\\n\r\nSo, worth your time? Even though I came away from it with a bad taste I'd say it probably is. I don't think there are enough productions in any medium that deal with self-genesis, which is a real shame. The characters are all interesting and when it's funny, it's *really* funny--but when it gets serious, it gets *really* serious for no good reason whatsoever. I'll rewatch this in a few months and I plan to skip all the drama episodes...and I know I'll love it. Take that as you will.",

I would enjoy it in a comical way.\r\nBut the actual story is slice-of-life about Novel writers and basically about their daily lives and essentially story is about learning the characters and join along with their lives. I would say for a slice-of-life it has some interesting ideas and premise. But I simply couldn't enjoy it. Oh and round table alcohol consumption was a common theme there as well.\r\nI found most of their dialogues being between boringand obnoxious. The idea of them playing all sorts of memory and basically idea games, was interesting as concept, but felt boring in truth.\\n\\n\r\nI personally found it for the most part boring.

The scenes where authors or character works & imagination were done pretty good.\\n\\n\r\nAs for music, I think it was fine for the most part, but at the same time I didn't really notice any music? In another words had quite weak presence.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Character\\n\r\nMost the the cast were quirky authors with different kinks and fetishes. Even side-characters were semi-entertaining. I feel there was some progression, plus we did learn about characters over time.\\n\\n\r\nBut at the same time, I seriously couldn't get into any of the characters. I just found them either dull or annoying. Oddly enough, most of the characters had some dominating traits I did not enjoy.\\n\\n\r\nBut only one I want to mention here is Kani. As much I like lewd girls, she is the type I dislike. She is dangerously crude, unrefined dirty talking character. She is lucky that the guy she likes is actually respectable and doesn't take the bait nor attack. I cannot explain how exactly I don't like her, but the general \"feel\" she gives off, is simply something I can't enjoy.\\n\\n\r\n\u2726Enjoyment & Overall\\n\r\nI find it very niche Anime that certain type of people or authors can appreciate it better than I do.\\n\\n\r\nBut boring dialogues, unlikable characters and simply me being not able to get into the story nor the characters is good enough reason to drop this Anime.",
