            "content": "While watching episode of Sora no Otoshimono, I thought it was going to be a serious fantasy romance-filled action anime. This was because the way the plot was set, and the way Tomoki has his dreams. I really thought it would've been a perfect setting for that type of anime. \r\nThen, shit happens. The anime goes totally random and it made me LOL; so hard I almost chocked and spilled soda over my laptop. The humor in Sora no Otoshimono is random, but yet it always seems to make me laugh. The ecchi things stuff tomoki does has yet ceased to bore me. \r\nThe charactersare also, setup in such perfect proportions for a comedy anime. A perverted boy with his childhood friend, creepy senpai and class prez. Each character has his/her share of randomness to make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\n(The humor and story of Sora no Otoshimono, I can't help but say, reminds me of Inukami. They way Yoko punishes Keita is so similar to what happens to tomoki.)\\n\\n\r\nSora no otoshimono is a must watch, if you like this kind of comedy anime. Especially if you like fan service comedy, I guarantee you, you'll laugh your ass off.",

            "content": "*Dramatic ending to an overall ecchi humour series*\r\n\u201cThe following story depicts the downfall of my quiet and peaceful life.\u201d \u2013 Tomoki Sakurai\r\nIf someone is telling you this anime has flying pantsu (underwear), what will come to mind? People throwing pantsu at each other? Or if you are a bit more creative, perhaps you may be imagining them using the pantsu to wrap around a volleyball for practice? (I really got that as a response before). But will you believe me if I say the underwear in this show can really fly like a bird (heck, they even fly in a wonderful formation in the sky).Furthermore, what if those pantsu can explode? Yes, they can go KABOOM! How\u2019s that for a change? Assuming you are still hanging around, let me give this one final piece of advice. Stop reading right here if flying and exploding pantsu is not what you want to see because it only gets much more exciting and chances are you won\u2019t like it (ie. you can drop this show from you list).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of us, where should we begin? How about the ordinary lifestyle of the young man, our protagonist of the story, Tomoki Sakurai? All he ever wished from his small town was to live a peaceful and quiet life where he can eat, sleep, and play. He even made a motto for himself, \u201cpeace and quiet is the best\u201d. One night under a cherry tree, a pretty angel came falling down toward our hero and that is how his quiet and peaceful life comes to an end. Who might this girl be? Where did she come from? What kind of past did she have? All these questions will propel the story forward and eventually develop into something much more than what anyone would have initially thought possible from this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly a great deal of character developments, in terms of personal growth, lies with the fallen angel. As the series progresses, she not only begin to show depth as a character, but at the same time get involved in a funny four-way romance. Various characters\u2019 past have also been revealed which explains a lot about their current self, particularly their behavior. This also made them more real and believable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department really deserves special recognition for this show. Not nothing does it have a special, one of a kind, ending per episode, but each ending also features the aftermath of what happened at the end of the episode (think of it as some form of epilogue). As an example, I strongly urge you to look up the second ending (flying pantsu ending). In addition to the various endings, the unique background music (BGM), that does not often repeat itself, also deserves honourable mention. Often times I feel that I was nearly going in tears thanks to these BGM. They make a strong compliment to the already excellent series. \\n\\n\r\nSounds come in many different forms. Music obviously counts as one, but voicing is another, especially in the anime industry. Some voices can make a character seem like a lifeless zombie or can totally repel viewers from watching further. Others can bring life to a character, making them more lively and believable. Fortunately, Sora no Otoshimono has a large group of talented casts that helped make the characters come to life and also aided the comedy aspect of the show. If I were to select one seiyu from the group whom I believe have performed the best, it will have to be Souichirou Hoshi (Kira from Gundam SEED, Keiichi from Nigurashi no Naku Koro ni). His ultra hilarious performance as Tomoki, the protagonist, played a key role in the overall success of the series in my opinion. Though his voice may be hard to get used to at times, his role as Tomoki is certainly refreshing, highly different from most of his previous character voices.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think that there is probably nothing else that is good about this series. You are dead wrong. The ultimate selling point of Sora no Otoshimono lies in the animation. While it does not have the unique animation techniques like those we often seen by SHAFT, this series cannot be taken lightly either. Production quality is top notch. With smooth fluid-like animation, great scene transitions, and consistently level of high quality production by the studio, all made this show an eye candy to watch. Of course this is especially true if you are into ecchi-fan service. But even if you are an action fan, you will not be disappointed as the series totally shines with its animation. You have to see it to believe it. Certainly one of the best quality anime (animation-wise) of the Fall 2009 season.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I am not an extremely big fan of ecchi comedy. But Sora no Otoshimono completely changed my view on this genre. I was really drawn in by the emotional scenes multiple times throughout the series. Similarly, I was also captivated by the very sad, yet powerful, scenes toward the end of the show. It certainly showed us that Sora no Otoshimono is not just about pure ecchi humour, but actually have a strong background story to back it up! I would also like to applaud the production studio, AIC A.S.T.A. for a job well done in adapting the original material from the manga. Lastly if you have read the entire review, do yourself a favour and watch the series now. It is only 13 episodes long, so why not give it a shot?",

            "content": "When you see the phrase \"generic, mindless fanservice, you expect an anime thats just horrible. Fortunately however, Sora No Otoshimono is anything but. Surprisingly well done and developed, Sora No Otoshimono takes you on unforgettable ride.\r\nStory\r\nThe story at first sounds really generic. Small town, childhood friend who happens to live next door and is well endowed, and a mysterious \"angel\" falling from the sky. Yeah, so it is generic BUT throughout the series, the story gains more depth and eventually becomes interesting and enthralling. As a reader of the manga, the plot follows it to the dot and the pacing is also quite similar. Sometimesit does feel slightly rushed but keep in mind they are trying to condense about 5 volumes of manga into 13 episodes. The more you delve into the universe the more interesting it gets.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nOne word :wow\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is flawless. The quality of the animation is simply amazing and this anime isnt even based on action. Animation is smooth and consistent throughout the whole series and camera angles are interesting and dynamic enough to add realism in dialouge. In every scene there is something moving and in most cases it is multiple objects (i.e consistant blinking, arm gestures etc). The bigger scenes that incompass massive explosions and giant crap are also done very nicely. Also, there are always different animations for the credits so there is more new animation packed in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIm not a real expert at sound but there is nothing wrong with the sound in my opinion. Ambience sound are consistant and sound realistic. The voice actors were nicely chosen and all act out their respective characters well. I've heard people say that Tomoko's voice (the protagonist) is annoying but i've had no problem with it. Maybe i'm just tolerant?\\n\r\nSince there is always a different credit theme, it means different songs. WOW. Some of them are just plain silly and some are strangely addictive. Also watch out for ep 10, two great songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice and certainly live up to the generic ecchi anime standards. With this in mind however there really isn't anything ground breaking when it comes to the characters. Still though, like the plot line there is more than enough character development to keep the series interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWho would have thought that an anime with romance, ecchi and comedy as its central genres be so interesting and funny. You'll get plenty of laughs here in this series but i warn you, the humour is more on the corny-ecchi side (golden boy) rather the smart ass side (lucky star). Still though, the humour is great and come in great quantities. The extensive use of chibi characters really make the irony in the \"serious\" scene unbearable.\\n\r\nHowever thats not to say that the plot line is completely neglected with somewhat cheap humour. As a reader of the manga where this series is based on, the plot is actually quite deep and meaningful. Its really the polar opposite of the humour found in this series. Throughout the series both humour and plot development are nicely balanced so that viewers of the anime are satisfied in both ecchi and plotline values.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAn anime that probably has the highest production value of the season (and dare i say the year), a deep plot and truckloads of humour, this anime cannot be missed. Seemingly neglescted due to its appearance as a \"generic\", this anime is anything but. A must watch\\n\\n\r\n[{eggysz - otakuzone.com}]",

            "content": "This is an ecchi and comedy, two of my favorite genres. However, the humor usually falls flat with me, and the ecchi is rather tame by my standards and doesn't have the situational elements that makes ecchi sexy. And there isn't much else to save the show. The story doesn't really matter much. It serves more as a premise for the 2 \"angeloid\" girls rather than a key component of most episodes. In other words, it's mostly episodic.\r\nComedy: The comedy is wild and exaggerated, using gags, slapstick, and parodies. And it's corny. It reminds me a bit of a Looney Toons cartoon. The main malecharacter, Tomoki, is uncontrollably perverted, and the comedy mostly consists of him coming up with plots to see women naked or in panties, and getting beat up in the process. He is shown 90% of the time in chibi form (the small child-like form) with a totally different voice, and almost half of that time he is running around naked. In fact, I almost don't recognize him when he switches back. I just don't find this type of dumb comedy appealing.\\n\\n\r\nEcchi: I'm a fan of ecchi, but I do find mindless ecchi boring. There needs to be some situational element to make the ecchi sexy and appealing, like a romantic build-up, an awkward situation, or some cuteness. Some of the panty shots involving Sohara early on in the series are quite nice as she shakes her butt around cutely while talking. The brief shot of the girls putting on kimonos was nice too. There was some romance there too, where Sohara developed some affection for the hero as he saved her. But then from about the 4th episode on, any of this romantic/cute ecchi ceases to exist. Instead, it's all brute-force mindless, emotionless ecchi as Tomoki barges in on girls to catch a peek. With no situational element, it's about as sexy as looking at a department store swimsuit catalog.\\n\\n\r\nSo with the comedy and ecchi elements being lackluster, and the story being more of background element (and this story being a bit shallow and undeveloped) Sora no Otoshimono fails to deliver. It's watchable as mild entertainment, but I wouldn't regret having not seen it.",

            "content": "Now let's be serious...the reason you are all probably here is because of the giant rack that you saw on Icarus. But aside from all the semi-nudity and ecchi nature of this anime, it is really quite enjoyable. I started off thinking that this would be like any other rom-com anime and it would be mostly fan service. Im not saying there isn't any because they go to the bathhouse, the beach, the water park, and anywhere that you can see lots of boobies.\r\nStory(7/10): The anime doesn't entirely focus on a story driven plot but it doesn't mean it is deprived of a story. Themoments where the anime crosses over to the darker toned scenes are actually pretty entertaining and they really make you change your perception of the angeloids. Apart from the main story, there are many fan service episodes which are also good and always end up making me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): Art is good for the time it was released so there isn't really much to talk about here, but I have to say that I particularly enjoyed the chibi scenes that happened very often with the main character in his perverted situations.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10): Sound Is good and the soundtrack is also very amusing. Also the background music used during the more intense scenes fit and added to the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10): The characters are your usual bunch of anime characters. The perverted main character, the neighbor and childhood friend who is in love with the main character, the angeloid that turns the main character's life upside down, the rich and scary upperclassman, the smart and guiding force man person , and the cute angeloid who slowly falls for the main character. A box full of toys that somehow always get into weird situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10):I very much so enjoyed the anime. It's pretty good. Give it a chance. NO YOU WILL WATCH IT.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10): Overall, it is a good anime that mixes a dark story with light humor and panty shots. If you watch this, I Believe you will truly enjoy it. So give it a chance. You'll probably like it. I know I did.\\n\\n\r\nLIKE\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When you hear the words \"ecchi romance comedy\", what comes to mind?  Silly, pretty graphics that are fanservice oriented, weak plot and character development?  SnO is certainly a very lighthearted show for the most part, and easily enjoyable for those who appreciate comedy in general. This doesn't mean that SnO fundamentally lacks the qualities of a good, interesting, and solid show.\r\nArguably the biggest \"flaw\" of the show is that the story premise is as generic as it gets, with the tried and true concept of the boy who meets a magical girl (or angel in this case) who is able to do amazingthis for him, which we already know from shows like Chobits and Oh My Goddess. The question that must be asked is what is done to remix this old idea? In this case, I'd have to analyze the main character Tomoki. At first glance, he's a rather obnoxious and lazy pervert who merely wishes to live a quiet peaceful life. As events progress, we see more from him, how he's actually quite capable and motivated to help others around him who are in need. Tomoki's development towards becoming more sensitive to the people around him so far makes him, and this show stand out. Meanwhile, the time Tomoki loses from his \"quiet peaceful life\" that is spent caring for the angel Ikaros has contributed to her development in learning about the human world, and developing her emotions for those around her.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned development of the main characters is quite well done, and moving. Even though Tomoki's shenanigans and Ikaros's naivety of the human world and her appealing design opens up many opportunities for the \"ecchi comedy\" part of this anime to take form, the \"romance\" part of this anime is generally done quite seriously, with characters taking time to reflect on events around them, not mention taking time to also explain their background, which really adds depth to the characters themselves and their emotions for one another, particularly concerning Tomoki's friend Sohara and of course the angel Ikaros.\\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying how Ikaros's design is quite appealing, the artwork in this show is extremely well done.  Characters are well-drawn in general, and the use of chibi forms of these characters in comedy moments is done quite appropriately. Animations are also really high quality and diverse, and the choice of music is very catchy and appropriate. The quality of the aesthetics in general is very impressive, and a reason alone for watching this show. What is also quite interesting about this show is how there is always a different theme and scene used for the ending of each episode, so I would recommend not skipping the credits of this show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, SnO is a great show, and probably one of the highest quality productions of Fall 2009. This show is definitely for you if you want something that looks nice, is very funny, and has interesting development. The development of this show is so interesting that I'm concerned that 13 episodes is not enough to do this show justice. If a second season to this show will be announced, I'm definitely looking forward to it.",

In all honesty, it would probably turn off many, and draw in others. It's full of typical Japanese ecchi humor, which isn't bad if you're not a prude, a bit of a harem theme going but not in your face about it, and an overall feel-good story. It borders on sci-fi and fantasy, although that part of the story isn't fully explained. The focus of the series seems to be on the characters' interactions with the main character. There doesn't seem to be muchbackground plot or direction to the story beyond these interactions. One thing I didn't like was that these interactions became a bit repetitive with each subsequent addition of a new character. The series only has 2 seasons, so it didn't get too drawn out like how extremely long series sometimes constantly reuse the same formula.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series if you want some laughs and aren't looking for something serious. You would like it even more, if you are into fan service, or are male. If you hate harem and ecchi themes, then you may want to avoid it. The series seemed to be made just for me, so I am giving it a 9 overall.",

            "content": "'Sora no Otoshimono' was an extremely pleasant and thrilling experience. In the supernatural genre, this anime is in a league of its own. If you're not a fan of ecchi or history though, turn away now. \r\nThe premise of this anime might appear banal at first. A guy named Tomoki Sakurai is your average laid-back pervert, spending his days sitting around and doing nothing in particular in between bouts of looking up girls' skirts. One day an angel comes crashing down on his peaceful village and all hell breaks lose. You'd think this idea wouldn't work and half-way through this series I still couldn't figureout where this anime was trying to go with its plot. It gets a lot better later as the ecchines and general silliness subsides and paves way for a philosophical,  mythological and emotionaly disstressing second half of the series. The transition is slow and nearly unnoticable, even if you went on anime watching marathon and decided to see this series in one sitting. It's absolutely amazing how well this has been pulled off and what's even more amazing is that it makes this series unique, in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole concept of \"angeloids\" will take you by suprise because you will most likely be thinking about normal folklore-based angels with varying magical powers. Nope. I won't spoil this series for you so I'm only going to say that nearly every idea pertaining to angels here has been invented from scratch. At the same time however the main theme of the plot is that of a 'new world' which is closely based on the European age of discovery and colonisation.  Every episode begins with a history lesson and there are tons, and I mean tons of mythological and historical references in here. You'll learn a lot watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may appear shallow at the very begining but that won't be the case as the story progresses. The male lead, Tomoki is a pervert like no other. I can't even compare him to other male anime characters because he sets the bar so high in terms of pervertedness that no other character comes anywhere close to it. If there's an opportunity to do something lewd this guy will jump in to take advatage of it, without hesitation. That said, he cares deeply about his friends and is a central figure around which most of the events unravel. He's pivotal to the well-being of his circle of friends. \\n\\n\r\nIkaros is an angel sent down to assist Tomoki in... well pretty much everything. And Tomoki being a lewd sleaze that he is, takes full advantage of that. Ikaros however plays a much bigger role in this anime helping it to convey the ideas of freedom, discovery and... love. She's also linked to several historical and mythological events. Even her name is based on a mythological person.\\n\\n\r\nNymph is an another angeloid and her role in the series is to show the viewer that serfdom can be sometimes cruel. An important issue to be sure but this character was not given enough time and the series could have done better in terms of her development. Even though she's a tsundere-type character, she is very similar to Ikaros and at times I had the impression that she was nothing more than her different-looking clone.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Tomoki's classmates. An eccentric and totally insane genius (a bit cliche but that didn't bother me) Eishirou Sugata. His academic and anecdotal knowledge is impressive and his goal is to discover the 'new world', the one angeloids are coming from. He acts as a mentor/teacher to the rest of the characters often guiding them in their actions. We then have the buxom Mitsuki Sohara, Tomoki's childhood friend who usually karate chops the hell out of him when he's being perverted - a running gag throughout the series. Her presence is somewhat vital to the plot but I couldn't put my finger on it. Perhaps she just fits in with the rest of the cast and without her this series would not be complete. And then we have the spine-chilling Mikako Satsukitane, Tomoki's class president who has the knack of turning peaceful town-folk into vicious killing machines. I don't know what's going on in her head at any given time, but it's not flowers and birds I can tell you that much.\\n\\n\r\nNow then with the story and characters discussed, let's move on to art and sound. I could simply say that they're both jaw-dropping. And they are but let's elaborate a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is flawless, I couldn't see a single mistake in any of the 13 episodes I've watched. Moreover, the art is precise to the core. Even the smallest features have been drawn with accuracy and precision. I'm talking about movie-grade precision. At times you don't want to believe that you're actually watching a TV series. FUNimation and AIC A.S.T.A have done a great job here.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where my review might get a little biased. I personally love classical, baroque and late medieval music and this anime features plenty of that type of music. However, I could not see this anime working without any other type of music. Phililosophical and mythological themes call for a classical soundtrack so my personal preferences here don't make that much of a difference. That said, this series' soundtrack also features modern anime style pieces of music so I suppose everyone's going to be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Bah, I haven't been this intrugued and thrilled since I watched 'Death Note'. Seriously, the first few episodes might give you the wrong idea but it gets better as the series progresses. You'll not only have fun but you will also be genuinely interested in the story and you'll want to know more at all costs! \\n\\n\r\n'Sora no Otoshimono' is a masterpiece. 10 points.",

            "content": "Sora No Otoshimono (Heaven's Lost Property)\r\nWe can all agree that Anime has change throughout the years.. With sexualizing  all the female character with big breast or all the female characters just fighting for the same guy, without the guy not knowing anything.\r\n-Sora No Otoshimono or Heaven's Lost Property whichever you would like to call it; starts with the Protagonist name Tomaki Sakurai a perverted high school boy that somehow he wants to live a peaceful life. Later finds a Pink haired girl, Angle/Angleoids falling from the sky, maned Ikaros becoming somewhat his servant.\r\nThe show is pretty much based on the life of Tomaki Sakuraiand how he had to deal with his new life, with Ikaros flying around following him. Throughout the show, each episode isn't really connected to each other you'll see random anime change the comedy would make you laugh and you don't really care about other than Tomaki and Ikaros big breast, and more by putting does things aside is really enjoyable, the story-line is kinda weak, and Tomaki pervaded gets kinda annoying after awhile and breast popping all over the place but by following it and waiting until the credit scene of the episodes everything makes sense (kinda) and realize why the reason Ikaros is doing on in the fist place.\\n\\n\r\nLater on the series, more Angles/Angleoids would appear you'll find yourself loving them more then the humans companion that you'll meet in the process.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist/Characters\\n\r\n-Tomoki: Is the obvious Perverted High School boy, that everyone loves and cares, about his friends, and is hard to see him as a serious Hero unlike other anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Ikaros: Is the Angle/Angleoid that Tomaki meets in the first two episodes, she bow to be Tomaki servant. With no real reason and follow Tomaki perverted schemes with no questions, later she finds herself loving Tomaki, without him not notice him, like any other protagonist  but not able to show emotions she has a hard time showing it, nor she smiles. But shows destructive anger if Tomaki is in any kinda danger. You'll find yourself for some weird reason wanting Ikaros to tell Tomoki how she feels. hahaha\\n\\n\r\n-Sohara: Is the next door neighbor and child hood friend, of Tomoki she also the typical girl that loves the protagonist having perverted dreams about him. But instead she keeps it and beats, Tomoki every time he gets any close contact with any other girl, always putting her nose where it doesn't belong.\\n\\n\r\n*There more characters that you would meet, while the series goes on* \\n\\n\r\nReally recommended if you want to have a good laugh you would enjoy watching it, and somehow you would be able to connect with them... Hope this help :)\\n\\n\r\n-Jorvaldez12",

            "content": "The \"Magical Girlfriend\" genre is one that's been around long before anime became mainstream. Shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie being prime examples. However, the series that made Magical Girlfriends a popular theme in anime would be \"Ah! My Goddess\". A charming, feel good show that has become a pretty big influence in the industry. Being a template for other similar titles like Chobits, Please Teacher!, Mahoromatic, Sekirei, and many others. Though with every good attempt at a magical girlfriend anime, there's always those poor attempts that are so horrible, that it makes the others I've mentioned feel bad about themselves. And byfar, the ABSOLUTE, WORST magical girlfriend show to EVER disgrace the genre.......is Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan. But Heaven's Lost Property comes in a close second! And heres why.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (If you can call it that) (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nTomoki Sakurai is this little punk ass who's been having the same dream he's been having ever since he was young. One his friends Sugata believes it to be a new world. However, Tomoki and his circle of friends have their lives change forever with the arrival of Ikaros. An angeloid who feel out of the sky and became Tomoki's master. Sparking a series of really perverted misadventures.\\n\\n\r\nSo as you can tell, this is a very familiar set up that's been done several times before. Examples I've already listed. But is it at least done well? OH HELL NO! Almost every episode is filled with plot holes and continuity errors, and the \"romance\" elements are poorly executed. Not to mention that it's VERY inconsistent with how angeloids work and function. I can honestly blame all of this on the shows usage of fanservice! Look, I don't mind fanservice in an anime as long as it's not overused and it doesn't take up the majority of it. Examples I can think of are \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", \"A Certain Scientific Railgun\", and for a magical girlfriend example, \"Ah! My Goddess\". The problem in this case is that this series focusses WAY to much on the service, and seems to mostly care about giving male watchers erections, that the quality of everything else turns out horribly! And what makes it worse that it can be considered an excuse to give Tomoki perverted reactions to them. Who by the way, has to be the WORST male protagonist I've ever seen. But will get to him later.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a deep, feel good romance anime, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!\\n\\n\r\nThe Dub (6/10)\\n\\n\r\n.....It just baffles me how this awful series would have a very good cast of voice actors for it's dub. I mean, it has the likes of Greg Ayres, Brittney Karbowski, Eric Vale, Jamie Marchi, Alison Vikorin, Mike McFarland, and Trina Nishimura. These people are very good at what they do! Some of which did voices for some of my all time favorite characters......so HOW they saw potential in this series I'll never know. I'm surprised that the women who did the voices for the female characters didn't feel insulted by how this show treats and objectifies women. You could argue that they might be use to it considering they've working on ecchi animes before, but if I was a voice actress, and was offered to work on something like this, I would feel disgusted and decline in a snap! But you know what pisses me off the most, is that there are other animes that are considered masterpieces, or at least fan favorites, they have yet get dubbed for the american market. And yet animes like Heaven's Lost Property get dubs about a year after the first season finishes airing. It REALLY boggles the mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow I talk about what I think is the animes lowest point. And what better way to start, but with the main protagonist of the show, Tomoki. This prick has to be the WORST male protagonist I've ever seen, period! A lot of the time he's just being a no good pervert towards his friends and many of the background girls, and has very little respect for them! Now I just know that fanboys will try defending him by saying he does have his moments where he's nice towards the other characters, but he suffer the same problem as Louise the Zero! Any sense of character development that he'll get will be thrown out the window by the next episode, making that nice moment he had completely insincere. And don't get me started on his treatment to the other main characters. Speaking of which....\\n\\n\r\nIkaros was just.....boring. She's just your typical emotionless girl. Now I don't mind coming across this archetype more than once, as long as there's a good variation of it. Just take a look at Yuki Nagato, or Ennis from Baccano!. They were great emotionless girls. But Ikaros has nothing unique to her character, and just comes across as a downgraded version of Ren from DearS. Plus, this anime does a terrible job at being consistent with the fact that she's an android from heaven, since that fact doesn't stop her from eating food, shedding a tear every now and then, and so forth. Nymth, I'll admit was one of the two likable characters of this show. She did have a tragic backstory and her calling Tomoki an \"insect\" is another plus. Sohara I did pity over her treatment she gets from Tomoki.....until I discovered a disturbing fact about her, that makes her looks like a masochist. Now these main girls are somewhat tolerable, but what makes them unlikable to a certain extent is that they REALLY have no valid reasons to be in love with that asshole. Since he's guilty of the following.\\n\\n\r\n1. Hitting Ikaros and talking down to her whenever she screws up with something.\\n\r\n2. Puts Nymth down for having a flat chest. (Cause yeah, that's REALLY an important feature for a girl to have. *Sarcasm*)\\n\r\n3. Peeps at Sohara changing from next door, as well as stealing her underwear. Not to mention that once he broke into her house during her birthday, ate some cake without asking, and gave her something his grandpa gave him as a birthday present. Yeah, SOME friend you are Tomoki.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two more characters I need to talk about, which are Sugata and Mikako. Now Sugata I'll admit was pretty bearable, since he does have a nice personality and wants to help people. If anything, HE should've been the main protagonist instead. Mikako.......scares the crap out of me. Seriously....something is wrong with her. You just have to see for yourself. But anyways, there are two likable characters, but they aren't enough to save this atrocious cast, lead by that perverted bastard.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe music was.....okay. But that isn't saying much. The opening theme isn't that memorable, and the ending theme.....actually, there's a different one for each episode. This may sound like a nitpick, but I'm use to animes that would have either one or two ending themes, as well as one or two opening themes. I just see no point in giving an episode a completely different ending theme. Because it feels more like an excuse to have even more ecchi fanservice to the running time. As if we had ENOUGH of that already!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Heaven's Lost Property is easily one of the worst animes I've ever seen in my life. As well as a complete insult to the \"Magical Girlfriend\" anime. The storytelling is poorer than Oliver Twist, the main character is a hateful perverted scumbag, and most of the other characters are either forgettable, poorly written, or both. There really is little to like about this awful anime. If you want a GOOD \"Magical Girlfriend\" anime, watch Ah! My Goddess, Chobits, and even Please Teacher! They're more worth your time than this poor attempt at being in their crowd.\\n\\n",

It's kinda of anyone's dream when they were kids.\r\n  And, Well the characters designs are quite OK and viewer-friendly, big eyes (not that all 1-color-highlighted eye or simple neko eyes), Cute and chubby facial shapes and the setting for the character is quite different but to their own charms and good features. And, btw the wings, battle suits are quite pretty as well....Ok, for the VA, yup they have succeeded to make one's character appealing and much lively, (Nice) well, my favourite character is Ikaros(female MC) and she sang OP and some ED of this anime along with Bluedrops ( her voice is sweet - Saori Hayami)\\n\r\n  And, what is great about this anime is the randomness , the creativeness of ecchi pantsu jokes and pranks and collaborating with some serious events and feels.\\n\r\n  Well, not that i boast about myself, I can understand average things quite clearly and this anime really is easy to read, suitable for leisure or as a side-dish combo with other strong-taste anime.\\n\r\n  Well Rome doesn't built in one day, so does this, try to collect small events, hints and stuffs in it then you will feel what it wanna give to you, just a reminder\" don't watch it all for Pantsu and Oppai, watch the Overall, I am sure it worth your time, well i have watched it thrice though....

            "content": "Take note that i've not read the manga or seen the other seasons yet but i'm planning on doing it in the near future and that i'm going all out with my honest opinion here. This is my first review on this site and i really wanted to talk about my disappointment for this anime to someone and what better place than on myanimelist.com\r\nHello everyone! This is your guy, HogisGuy. And i'm here with my first ever written review. I decided to write this review because i've never been this disappointed of an anime ever but boy have i got a lot (And i meanA LOT) of hate for my opinion on this series but i hope that you'll hear me out.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing i wanna talk about is the story... wait! What story?!! Oh yeah! There was something about an angel from some a*****es in heaven. I totally forgot because i was so busy laughing at Tomoki's crazy and hilarious shenanigans (if you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic). Seriously, sometime i forgot that Ikaros really was an angel and thought she was a casual cosplayer or something. It seems like this anime was more busy showing us boring ecchi scenes and those many non-funny scenes with Tomoki and that it probably thought that we would get bored if they didn't show us more ecchi scenes and keep the actual plot at 45 seconds per episode. And even then the story itself wasn't that great but at least a hundred times more interesting than the other garbage they threw at us in the series. Though i will admit that i did laugh at some jokes there were a lot more jokes that just fell flat on it's own face and just died. It also feels like this anime didn't have any idea what audience it wanted to entertain. The comedy crowd? The drama crowd?! The perv crowd?!! I don't know and i have a feeling they didn't either.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animations was really good and even beautiful at times. The designs on the characters was well done and i enjoyed the art style in every single scene (except for the \"HILARIOUS\" nipple-song scene). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters... OH JOY!! I'll start and finish it all with the poor excuse of a protagonist, Tomoki. Let me quote something from the book \"I have no mouth, and i must scream\" to describe what i feel for Tomoki... if i was a machine:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nI HATE Tomoki! He is not funny! He is not deep! He is not interesting! He is nothing! I would love to know who decided for this thing to be the protagonist of the series so i could slam his/her head into the wall and scream \"Why?!!\" into his ear over and over again. Tomoki doesn't contribute with anything to the series. I love how the anime is constantly trying to make me believe that he is important in this anime when the most common problems he runs into is following:\\n\\n\r\n1: How can i sneak into the girls locker room?\\n\r\n2: I can't afford this porno magazine? Well in all my years. I guess i have to work for some cash then.\\n\r\n3: How are we ever going to get those panties back on Sohara. What a pickle!\\n\r\n4: What's that Ikaros? You wanna move the plot forward? Hah! That's funny but seriously though, how can i sneak into the girls locker room?!!\\n\r\n5: Are you sure that transforming me into a girl is gonna get me inside the girls locker room?\\n\\n\r\nYou got a beautiful angel that will do ANYTHING for you! And if any of you people say he doesn't do anything with her because he's deep and emotional and would never take advantage of a woman like that. Yeah i think it's kinda too late to convince me that when i just saw him grope two women. You know what? Sugata is the better protagonist for the series. Yes i know that he too got some weird fantasies, playing around with dolls but here's the thing! He (unlike our villain \"Tomoki\") actually gets some s**t done. He researches the angels and seems to be more understanding and interested about them and want's to know more of their world. What does Tomoki do? ... He writes songs about his nipples. CHARMING! \\n\\n\r\nI want to give this anime a lower score because giving it an overall score of four makes me feel dirty but the thing is that this anime isn't poor. Because when you get to the good parts and especially the last few episodes i was really invested and found it even sad for what poor Nymph had to go through to get Ikaros home. I have nothing against Ecchi animes or mangas, hell i even love them but when you focus on it too much to the point where it gets in the way of the story you have to realize that it's going to wear out fast. I actually love Manyuu Hikencho and High School Of The Dead.\\n\\n\r\n- But HogisGuy!! HOTD has breasts and unnecessary panty shots. And Manyuu Hikencho is just naked breasts through the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSure. HOTD has a lot of pointless ecchi scenes but they are out of the scenes as fast as they are in and yes, they do get boring at times with those panty shots but it never loses track of it's story and even has time for good character build-ups except for Shizuka who is totally pointless to the show and manga so far. Manyuu Hikencho's story revolves around big breasts. You can find it funny, you can find it hot. I see it as a hilarious and to be honest, a good story for it's ludicrous world and that's something this series gets right unlike Sora No Otoshimono.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, i don't hate Sora No Otoshimono. I just don't think it was as good as some people tried to make it out be. Here's to the second season being better but i have my doubts.",

            "content": "There really isn't anything that special about this anime. It's your typical ecchi comedy where all the girls have big boobs and the guys keep getting nose bleeds. However, I'd still recommend watching this anime because it's fairly short so if you wanted to you could knock it out in a few days, it always put a smile on my face when I watched it, and there are some actually dramatic moments in it.\r\nThis anime's best quality is how much personality each character has. Of course, this anime isn't as serious as Full Metal Alchemist so it isn't like every character has this complex reasonfor their actions, but I love how much emotion each character shows and how every character contributes to the show in their own way. For example, Mikako is kind of the shows antagonist and she loves anything involving other people getting hurt like if she sees two people disagreeing her solution is for the two to have a dual to the death and whoever lives is right.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime comedies, there's a hint of romance in this anime, but it's interesting how the romance develops. Tomoki and Ikaros don't really fall in love so much as Tomoki teaches Ikaros what love is. Ikaros is such an innocent character and so oblivious to basic emotions she has a tough time grasping the concept of love so she becomes confused when she feels it. Most of the serious traits in the anime are eclipsed by all the comedic moments, but I can still see how Ikaros changes on the inside as the anime progresses. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest problem with this anime is how there are way too many pervert jokes! Seriously, every episode has to have Tomoki trying to look up a girl's skirt or molesting someone. It gets old after a while and I'm just happy this anime's short because I don't think I could watch even 50 episodes of it before I'd throw in the towel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is a pretty funny comedy to watch even though the jokes do get a little old at the end. There's a pretty descent romantic element to it and, of course, tons of magic. The story is almost non-existent, but the characters are truly this anime's best quality. \\n",

            "content": "If I could describe \"Sora no Otoshimono\" in a way that almost perfectly suits it I'd say \"Sora no Otoshimono\" = Epic Trolling With a Story and Plot. And here's why I believe that:\r\nSTORY: 8\r\n\"Sora no Otoshimono\" doesn't focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how Ikaros became Tomoki's \"Pet Class Angeloid\". But it really doesn't need to as more than likely the sequels will explain that. In a Story perspective it mostly focuses on the daily events of Ikaros adapting to the human ways of life while attempting to understand her master and his perverted ways. As well as trying to understandherself. The whole cast is constantly entangled with hysterical events such as flying panties that can achieve higher speeds than the famous SR-71 Black Bird (which leaves the pilot o_0 WTF?), exploring the new world that is the girls bathroom, a festival turned into a blood bath because of the attractive opportunity of 10,000,000 yen for shooting your neighbor, and understanding what it means to go on a date. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10 \\n\r\nThis was clearly for me one of the best hand drawn and partially CG'd anime's I have ever seen. Sora no Otoshimono stands rightfully and proudly next to Steins;Gate and Nisemonogatari. Kudos to the staff for such wonderful, beautifully hand drawn characters. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nThe opening was actually worth my time to watch as well as the different endings each and every episode had. I mean who else would watch openings and endings other than for the music it has? And as much as I liked Tomoki's song of \"My Tingling Nipples\" I still feel the music was just a tad bit shy of perfection. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\r\nI feel that all of the main characters deserve their own criticism from me separately as they have earned it so here it is.\\n\\n\r\nIkaros: Our somewhat emotionless heroine. It seems that the story leans more toward her than it does to Tomoki. As she attempts to understand what it means to be human and blend into society anonymously (tho fails epically). She unknowingly takes her master's and co's lessons that try to teach her to be more human like far too literally. Often concluding with humorous results. Such as lying. (The lying lesson was NOT given to her by her master and co but by a passerby) As this passerby tells what I presume to be his girlfriend \"lying is human\" Ikaros takes this to the extreme. Shockingly telling a chef his food looks like shit, while also declaring to a mother her baby is hideous. These are one of the many reasons why you might just fall in love with Ikaros. \\n\\n\r\nNymph: She isn't completely introduced until episode 6. A bit of a delay to present the show's tsundere but better late than never. I personally enjoyed the introduction of Nymph. What would you think if you woke up in your household, went to your living room, only to find a complete stranger comfortably making themselves at home in your household? You'd possibly freak the fuck out if you didn't have anyone else with you. But with Nymph having a connection with Ikaros it only made it more mysterious of why she'd even be there. Her characteristics are also very familiar but not despised of. With the traits of a tsundere and attitude of a smart aleck, she also attempts to understand what it is to be human. She is shown often calling Tomoki and anyone else she sees as an idiot a \"bug\". But as the story progresses she opens herself like every other tsundere would. She reminded me of Haruna from Kore wa \"Zombie Desu ka?\". (well Iori Nomizu does voice both Nymph and Haruna lol) Nonetheless, she is a welcomed character to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSohara Mitsuki: Sohara felt more like a side character than a real main character to me. After viewing the first episode and observing her characteristics, I quickly realized that I have found yet another typical childhood friend who fails to convey her feelings properly to the boy she loves. This is such an overused concept in anime that it has started to annoy me. Time and time again I frequently run into anime's that use this same concept. Whether it be \"Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity\" or \"Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi\". In the end the result is the same: Childhood friend either wins the heart of his/her love interest or doesn't. So what was enjoyable about Sohara now that you more or less understand what I am seeing? Nothing much sadly. The best way I can describe her is to say that she is a cup that is half empty. The description given about her reveals no spoilers and nothing new in the anime world. She typically karate chops Tomoki for not giving her the attention she utmost desires. Although he does deserve it with certain actions he takes, she shouldn't be frequently chopping him for every small perverted thing he does. He's a maturing man like he said and needs to tune his manliness. How could he help getting a hard on in the morning? Hasn't she ever heard of something called morning wood? I am fully aware that the developers put her in the story for a love triangle relationship and a comedic effect. But after a while I had grown more attached to Ikaros (and even Nymph) that I figured it probably would have been better to ax her and never introduce her to the story in the first place. It was funny the first few times she knocked Tomoki's lights out. But after a while of the same shit and repeat, it began to make me question if she was worth the time introducing and putting the effort to make her part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki Sakurai: A troll genius. Possibly every wish he has I wish greater. Whether it'd be the power to turn invisible to grope my girlfriends tits, or freeze time to run around streaking in public. It wouldn't matter as long as I have a beautiful Angeloid that obeys my every command and that accompanies me throughout my mischievous deeds. And that is precisely what this lucky little bastard has done and gone through. His motto (which is one that Me Gusta) is to live in peace and quite. But after running into and forever bonded to an Angeloid named Ikaros, that soon changes indefinitely. As he constantly throws himself into 100% lethal situations which he is only to be saved by his gorgeous Angeloid. Although ironically Ikaros is one of the major sources of chaos and disarray, he full knowing this continues to support and help her in her quest to be more human like. His characteristics are that of a perverse old man. His desire to sniff panties and wear them cannot be stopped. His raging hormones strongly portray what it means to be young, dumb, and full of cum. But despite all of this, he still has that soft spot for caring about what matters most. The well being of his friends and his Angeloid. \\n\\n\r\nMikako Satsukitane: The sadistic bitch in the series. Reading the description about her practically notifies you of what is to come when she is brought into the story. While her presence seems that of a bystander she is involved partly in the story. She is seen mostly around Eishirou. Conversing her thoughts on his thoughts of the new world. She and him feel to me more like background characters that fill in the empty space of what could have been.  I do enjoy her haughty smile and deeply provoking comments, but this is one bitch you don't want to fuck with. During Ikaros's silver tongue moment, she specifically stated Mikako was \"nice\". Anyone with half a brain would instantly recognize what she meant by that. \\n\\n\r\nEishirou Sugata: The man who dreams to find the new world. Going as far as to creating his own home-made glider only to make a few \"miscalculations\" and plummet from the skies above to meet the concrete floor. It seemed to me that he was completely obsessed with the idea of there being a new world above us. He portrays himself as a shady character with little to no background. He is the founder of the New Continent Discovery Club and is found in the beginning of each episode presenting to you his pretty assistant and a \"The More You Know\" like dialog. He continuously provides information that should not be know by regular human beings. And it seems he has experience with Angeloids. As he states to Ikaros \"Stop playing dumb, you couldn't possibly be a Pet Class Angeloid.\", as well as having a high-tech computer that monitors Ikaros's state and condition. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nA few times I almost fell off my chair laughing from its humor that it constantly loves to give to its viewers. It does have a lot of ecchi moments involved but I wasn't bothered by it at all. If anything I enjoyed it. I loved the story as well as the characters and the art was simply gorgeous. The sound was near perfection and the story set out for what it was going to do. And that is a humorous and enjoyable time. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\n\"Sora no Otoshimono\" is a Comedy, Ecchi, Sci-Fi, Shounen, Supernatural anime with some romance sprinkled on top for good measure of an amusing time. I most certainly enjoyed putting 312 minutes of my spare time into \"Sora no Otoshimono\". It may not be for everyone as this mainly aims for a comedic effect and an ecchi audience. But it also has some super cereal moments involved for you ManBearPigs. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an anime that aims to make your stomach hurt from laughter. This is one that should not be missed. I most certainly will not forget this anime like I have forgotten others. As this one has earned its right to claim its throne among the last that are to be forgotten. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My first review, give some constructive criticism on improvements!\r\nHmmm... Sora no Otoshimono (or Heaven's Lost Property), is probably THE BEST example I've seen of an Ecchi comedy that manages to successfully transcend the realms of stupidity to produce an excellent anime with a memorable story and amazing characters. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.\r\nOh yeah, you fell from the sky yesterday... right... - Tomoki\r\nThis quote from the first episode, combined with Tomoki's reaction effectively sums up how over-the-top Sora no Otoshimono(SnO) gets and how mind-numbingly insane, the situations that are going to occur in Tomoki's life will be. Tomoki himself states that this story is the depictionof the downfall of his peaceful and quiet life, into flying panties, well endowed angeloids and karate chops that defy every possible law of physics. It's exactly this stupidly over-the-top comedy combined with the excellent art direction and characters that make SnO such a great show to watch. It never takes itself too seriously or tries to present over complicated plot and character developments every five seconds, instead it relies on natural character development and maturity and certain key moments of plot development resulting in both a touching story and great Ecchi and comedy moments thus keeping the viewer entertained and hooked episode upon episode. The humour never gets stale, SnO keeps it interesting and mixes it up just enough so that you, the viewer continue to laugh episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of SnO is beautiful, instantly from the first episode you can see this show has great production values, the characters are well drawn and the environments are varied, and very well coloured. Being an Ecchi comedy the girls and their underwear are incredibly well drawn and the girls themselves designed and detailed to near perfection. The animation is also very fluid and dynamic, and feels very natural to they eye. Boobs bounce well, skirts fly and panties get flashed with graceful movement (is that even possible!??). The characters are often represented in Chibi form, which is very well done and fits in with the shows comedic nature, it continuously reminds the viewer not to take the show too seriously and adds to the overall humour. However where the art and animation really shines in this series is the characters facial expressions and emotions, Icarus one of the angeloids carries a sad, melancholic expression throughout the series, and to put it simply it looks amazing, the studio really succeeded in making believable emotions and this works great with the character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another plus for this anime, the OP is a kind of catchy, melancholic song that really represents the series emotional and serious side, the ED or should I say EDs are where this show feels unique and interesting. Each episode has a unique ending that ties in with the events that took place during that episode, and are accompanied by an epilogue styled animation that shows the aftemath of what occured during that episode. The BGM is also good, it fits well with the comedy and really compliments the emotional scenes when they occur, theres also never a moment in this show where you hear a piece of BGM and feel its overused or too predictable.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the part of this show that makes it shine compared to all the other Ecchi comedies out there, the characters and story. The characters of this show are the main reason why it's so enjoyable they all feel natural and are developed well giving viewers a reason to pay attention to them. Since the cast of recurring characters is small the producers manage to give each character ample enough time to become well developed. One of the characters that stood out for me has to be Sugata, described during the first episode as a highly intelligent, extremely creepy and perverted guy and also introducing each episode, he has the most interesting role in the series. He attempts to discover the so called 'New World' where the angeloids came from thus he continuously observes Icarus and Nymph. He is highly intelligent and perceptive thus picking up on things no one else in the series manages too, his comments and dialogue often give the viewer understanding and insight as well as questions about the angeloids and who they really are.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is another plus point to this anime, it is very well executed and fits in with all the randomness and comedy of the show, in most episodes the story is just an undertone and is shows through the way the characters develop and interact with each other. However during the select key moments of the series when the story takes the driving seat, it executes well and piques the viewers interest making them ask questions and wonder what is going to happen next, it also manages to make very effective use of emotion making the viewer want to be involved in it all the much more. The seriousness picks up most at the end of the show and the viewer really feels and understands the angeliods, giving the story and excellent and dramatic ending.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all SnO is a beautiful and well executed show that shows just how versatile the Ecchi comedy genre can be if done properly.\\n",

            "content": "***SPOILER ALERT!!!***\r\nFrom here on, I'm not paying attention to how much I could spoil, but I may spoil some things on the way; you have been warned. (Now that I've read it though, it looks like I've only spoiled minor things...)\r\nAlright, first off, let me say that this will be my first review and I do not mean to offend anyone with my comments.  I am expressing my opinion and I hope you will respect my opinion as I promise to respect yours, as well. \r\nThis anime was one of the first ones I heard of through the internet, back when I first startedto watch anime, and when I watched it, I had high expectations for it because everyone else seemed to really love it and give it good reviews!  I really, really, want to say that I like it but I just can't... It wasn't something that was torture to watch, but I didn't enjoy it too much, either.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 5/10 here.  Man, what can I say? The first episode, as usual, started off with a decent enough story, in which the female lead, Icarus, makes a \"sudden\" and \"surprising\" entrance and meets the stunned male lead, Tomoki; veeery original.  But any hint of a story is always swallowed up by the filler-esque humor.  For every three episodes, one might progress the story.  But unfortunately, everything turns out to be bland and predictable, right down to the characters' actions, but I'll get to that later. The only time story can be squeezed in is when Tomoki shuts his big damn mouth, which hardly ever happens...>_> An attempt was made, no doubt, for there to be a nice story, but story-wise, this anime just falls flat...I can't say I enjoyed the story until the latter half of the anime, in which a bit more happened.  But the plot is nothing new, special, or surprising, and the story that the humor is based around all feels forced; trapped on an island, the beach episode, new girls go to the school, the festival, and the last episode, in which the male lead gets mini speeches from his friends, and gives the mini-speech about friendship to the heroine and the power of love wins against the baddies!  \\n\\n\r\nThe art gets an 8/10 here.  Its not ground-breaking, but its pretty enough, the animation is fluid, and there are no awkward animation moments to note.  Not much to say here except that I despise the way that the characters, ESPECIALLY Tomoki, are chibi-fied at the drop of a hat. The animation is the part I enjoyed the most, but it wasn't a great reason to watch the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets a 6/10, because although I liked the OP, the OST's weren't anything special.  How should I put it.....I don't think the sound was bad.  It's just something that enhanced the experience and there were no problems; pretty average. I don't like how in the last few episodes, they shoved sound effects into the OP, as if they wanted something different and were too lazy to make a parodied OP or something along the lines of that...As they say, \"Do not fix what is not broken\".  For the ED, I can't really say if I liked the fact that each episode had a different ending song... Some might like it, but I prefer one OP and one ED.  But hey, that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter...Oh boy, where to start?...OK, lets start with Tomoki.  \\n\r\nFor the \"strange dreams\" he had with the angel introduced in the first episode, I was hoping to see more, because that could have really helped the plot, but it was only referred to about once or twice more, and ended up as something to put in his character description to make him \"special\"...Well, let me say, if MAL had a least favorite character list, he would definitely be in it! All he does is scream out obvious things, make disturbing noises, act frustrated, and talk about being human once in a while. After 13 episodes of his ANNOYING voice (all I hear is the sound of a boy with voice changes going \"Huhuhuhuhuhuhu-uuuu-uuu...\") that makes me want to stab soft furry things, his not-cute chibi that substitutes for him 70% of the time, and the little wing covering up his private parts, I want to push him into a volcano and watch him burn slowly. >:D  The worst part is, the girls in his harem love him for the 5% of the time when he makes a serious face and talks about human feelings...the rest of the time, he's being a purposely perverted pubescent pervert.  (Sorry, I couldn't resist XD)  I can't think of any worse shounen leads... my favorite part is when he becomes a girl and has a different damn VOICE.  I find ecchi situations more funny when they're by accident, and the lead isn't agressively trying to peep, but there's no such thing here; no sir!  Tomoki is just  a vicious pervert and I don't see what everyone sees in him...He's  just a peeping Tomoki. *snicker* Seriously, this series is just overusing that joke, and now it's a dead horse.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm on the subject of overused, let me start on the other characters, which are all recycled.  First, Sohara, the clingy, jealous, childhood friend, a harem favorite.  Another harem favorite, the abused and tsundere-ish loli, Nymph.  She wasn't that bad, in fact, she was one of my main reasons for watching Sora no Otoshimono because she's so cute.  Yeah, she wasn't horrible; she and Icarus were the only ones with character development in the anime.  Icarus was fairly decent and I liked the watermelon theme for her for some reason.  It was a nice touch, but still not enough to save the show from Tomoki...>:I In the end, she is one of the better ones, but she is still the \"emotionless girl\" with limited addition to the character's background.  She was predictable all the time; for example, with the episode in which she's in the band, I knew right away that she would sing, if only for the sake of the fans.  Speaking of background, we have Sugata and Mikako, the slapped-on characters used to \"round off\" the cast.  It's like, they're just there...to be there. Yes, each episode starts off with a history lecture from Sugata; some were funny but most were annoying or boring.  He's just that \"epic smart guy with glasses that he pushes up his nose who points out conspiracies\". I have no problem with that, it's just that his character feels out of place in the genre, and would fit in better in Sci-Fi or something that has conspiracies to reveal.  Mikako is just another sadistic \"kind\" girl, but I only laughed at the character a few times, as she also felt out-of-place.  But what made them feel most tacked-on is the fact that they both start out knowing everyone, but it is never explained how any of them met each other. At least in Sohara's case, there was a brief and decent explanation as to how she met Tomoki. \\n\r\nThe characters get a 4/10 and I hope you understand why I selected this score. ^~^\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the comedy. This anime is 90% slapstick humor and virtually all of the humor involves Tomoki being perverted.  \"Tomoki runs around naked after seeing naked girls because he is about to get hurt\"  pretty much sums it up.  I was never a fan of slapstick humor, and it's not that funny when it's the same situation over and over again.  Slapstick humor is best sprinkled on like a seasoning for the events that lead to it; events that are different! Take the anime \"Nichijou\" for example- it is hilarious to watch the characters be wacked by things because it's a result of a funny situation- no one is screaming and they sit with straight faces as they are hurt.  But the execution was not something repeated over and over and OVER.  Each situation was different.  They don't scream around naked making wierd noises and yelling about getting hurt; the people who made that know that that would be boring and what you would expect.  Yes-- Sora no Otoshimono wants you to laugh at how it looks instead of the story...  There was hardly any creativity involved, and a *perverted* 9-year-old could have made the \"funny\" parts in this anime.  When I don't find myself laughing for an entire episode of SNO, I can't argue with my instincts; it's just not that funny...I laugh pretty easily, so don't be pointing fingers.  The comedy gets 4/10 because, basically, it's not very original.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would like to like this anime and give it an 8, 9, or 10 like other people have,  I'm gonna have to say that it fell short on both comedy and plot.  The art and sound were the most enjoyable parts, but not as important, and the biggest disappointment were the characters.  Therefore, I will have to give this anime a 5/10.  But I'm still open-minded enough to watch Season 2 (and 3?) because it would not be difficult to improve upon this anime.  Also, because I never drop and never plan to drop an anime.  I want to like it, but its potential was wasted.  Please respect my opinion, and I apologize if I have offended you.  Thank you for taking your time to read this, and I hope my review of the anime \"Sora no Otoshimono\" helped you! :) \\n",

The story was absolutely stellar, the best I've seen so far. The art is pretty good, the character development is brilliant, and it never failed to make me laugh, even in the most embarrassing moments. Just an all around great anime. If you are planning on watching it, watch the first two seasons, then read the manga til the end, then watch the movies that replace seasons 3 & 4. Otherwise, you miss a lotof content. But by God, the ending was magnificent. I really wish this would continue. I have never wanted to see more of an anime since Highschool DxD",

The series is easily found online or on a DVD (they have it on eBay for those who don't live in Japan) and it is subtitled (not dubbed---an automatic check in my mind).\r\nNow this series is a comedy primarily, but it has some romantic/sci-fi elements. The plot centers mostly around getting a laugh, except for the last few episodes of the season. It certainly doesn't dissapoint.\r\nIf you don't like perverted humor and prefer thingsto be funny because of the language versus situational humor, this probably isn't for you. But those of us with dirty minds and the ability to laugh at an anime that can laugh at itself will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially great are the sequences they play during the credits....always really funny and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not exactly the most original plot/characters but it is pretty funny and is good for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: the theme song is really, really catchy and there are a lot of boobs.",

The anime goes totally random and it made me LOL; so hard I almost chocked and spilled soda over my laptop. The humor in Sora no Otoshimono is random, but yet it always seems to make me laugh. The ecchi things stuff tomoki does has yet ceased to bore me. \r\nThe charactersare also, setup in such perfect proportions for a comedy anime. A perverted boy with his childhood friend, creepy senpai and class prez. Each character has his/her share of randomness to make you laugh.\\n\\n\r\n(The humor and story of Sora no Otoshimono, I can't help but say, reminds me of Inukami. They way Yoko punishes Keita is so similar to what happens to tomoki.)\\n\\n\r\nSora no otoshimono is a must watch, if you like this kind of comedy anime.

            "content": "*Dramatic ending to an overall ecchi humour series*\r\n\u201cThe following story depicts the downfall of my quiet and peaceful life.\u201d \u2013 Tomoki Sakurai\r\nIf someone is telling you this anime has flying pantsu (underwear), what will come to mind? People throwing pantsu at each other? Or if you are a bit more creative, perhaps you may be imagining them using the pantsu to wrap around a volleyball for practice? (I really got that as a response before). But will you believe me if I say the underwear in this show can really fly like a bird (heck, they even fly in a wonderful formation in the sky).Furthermore, what if those pantsu can explode? Yes, they can go KABOOM! How\u2019s that for a change? Assuming you are still hanging around, let me give this one final piece of advice. Stop reading right here if flying and exploding pantsu is not what you want to see because it only gets much more exciting and chances are you won\u2019t like it (ie. you can drop this show from you list).\\n\\n\r\nNow for the rest of us, where should we begin? How about the ordinary lifestyle of the young man, our protagonist of the story, Tomoki Sakurai? All he ever wished from his small town was to live a peaceful and quiet life where he can eat, sleep, and play. He even made a motto for himself, \u201cpeace and quiet is the best\u201d. One night under a cherry tree, a pretty angel came falling down toward our hero and that is how his quiet and peaceful life comes to an end. Who might this girl be? Where did she come from? What kind of past did she have? All these questions will propel the story forward and eventually develop into something much more than what anyone would have initially thought possible from this type of show. \\n\\n\r\nUnsurprisingly a great deal of character developments, in terms of personal growth, lies with the fallen angel. As the series progresses, she not only begin to show depth as a character, but at the same time get involved in a funny four-way romance. Various characters\u2019 past have also been revealed which explains a lot about their current self, particularly their behavior. This also made them more real and believable as a whole.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound department really deserves special recognition for this show. Not nothing does it have a special, one of a kind, ending per episode, but each ending also features the aftermath of what happened at the end of the episode (think of it as some form of epilogue). As an example, I strongly urge you to look up the second ending (flying pantsu ending). In addition to the various endings, the unique background music (BGM), that does not often repeat itself, also deserves honourable mention. Often times I feel that I was nearly going in tears thanks to these BGM. They make a strong compliment to the already excellent series. \\n\\n\r\nSounds come in many different forms. Music obviously counts as one, but voicing is another, especially in the anime industry. Some voices can make a character seem like a lifeless zombie or can totally repel viewers from watching further. Others can bring life to a character, making them more lively and believable. Fortunately, Sora no Otoshimono has a large group of talented casts that helped make the characters come to life and also aided the comedy aspect of the show. If I were to select one seiyu from the group whom I believe have performed the best, it will have to be Souichirou Hoshi (Kira from Gundam SEED, Keiichi from Nigurashi no Naku Koro ni). His ultra hilarious performance as Tomoki, the protagonist, played a key role in the overall success of the series in my opinion. Though his voice may be hard to get used to at times, his role as Tomoki is certainly refreshing, highly different from most of his previous character voices.\\n\\n\r\nYou may think that there is probably nothing else that is good about this series. You are dead wrong. The ultimate selling point of Sora no Otoshimono lies in the animation. While it does not have the unique animation techniques like those we often seen by SHAFT, this series cannot be taken lightly either. Production quality is top notch. With smooth fluid-like animation, great scene transitions, and consistently level of high quality production by the studio, all made this show an eye candy to watch. Of course this is especially true if you are into ecchi-fan service. But even if you are an action fan, you will not be disappointed as the series totally shines with its animation. You have to see it to believe it. Certainly one of the best quality anime (animation-wise) of the Fall 2009 season.\\n\\n\r\nTo be honest, I am not an extremely big fan of ecchi comedy. But Sora no Otoshimono completely changed my view on this genre. I was really drawn in by the emotional scenes multiple times throughout the series. Similarly, I was also captivated by the very sad, yet powerful, scenes toward the end of the show. It certainly showed us that Sora no Otoshimono is not just about pure ecchi humour, but actually have a strong background story to back it up! I would also like to applaud the production studio, AIC A.S.T.A. for a job well done in adapting the original material from the manga. Lastly if you have read the entire review, do yourself a favour and watch the series now. It is only 13 episodes long, so why not give it a shot?",

            "content": "When you see the phrase \"generic, mindless fanservice, you expect an anime thats just horrible. Fortunately however, Sora No Otoshimono is anything but. Surprisingly well done and developed, Sora No Otoshimono takes you on unforgettable ride.\r\nStory\r\nThe story at first sounds really generic. Small town, childhood friend who happens to live next door and is well endowed, and a mysterious \"angel\" falling from the sky. Yeah, so it is generic BUT throughout the series, the story gains more depth and eventually becomes interesting and enthralling. As a reader of the manga, the plot follows it to the dot and the pacing is also quite similar. Sometimesit does feel slightly rushed but keep in mind they are trying to condense about 5 volumes of manga into 13 episodes. The more you delve into the universe the more interesting it gets.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation\\n\r\nOne word :wow\\n\r\nThe animation in this series is flawless. The quality of the animation is simply amazing and this anime isnt even based on action. Animation is smooth and consistent throughout the whole series and camera angles are interesting and dynamic enough to add realism in dialouge. In every scene there is something moving and in most cases it is multiple objects (i.e consistant blinking, arm gestures etc). The bigger scenes that incompass massive explosions and giant crap are also done very nicely. Also, there are always different animations for the credits so there is more new animation packed in every episode.\\n\\n\r\nSound\\n\r\nIm not a real expert at sound but there is nothing wrong with the sound in my opinion. Ambience sound are consistant and sound realistic. The voice actors were nicely chosen and all act out their respective characters well. I've heard people say that Tomoko's voice (the protagonist) is annoying but i've had no problem with it. Maybe i'm just tolerant?\\n\r\nSince there is always a different credit theme, it means different songs. WOW. Some of them are just plain silly and some are strangely addictive. Also watch out for ep 10, two great songs.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter\\n\r\nThe character designs are nice and certainly live up to the generic ecchi anime standards. With this in mind however there really isn't anything ground breaking when it comes to the characters. Still though, like the plot line there is more than enough character development to keep the series interesting.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment\\n\r\nWho would have thought that an anime with romance, ecchi and comedy as its central genres be so interesting and funny. You'll get plenty of laughs here in this series but i warn you, the humour is more on the corny-ecchi side (golden boy) rather the smart ass side (lucky star). Still though, the humour is great and come in great quantities. The extensive use of chibi characters really make the irony in the \"serious\" scene unbearable.\\n\r\nHowever thats not to say that the plot line is completely neglected with somewhat cheap humour. As a reader of the manga where this series is based on, the plot is actually quite deep and meaningful. Its really the polar opposite of the humour found in this series. Throughout the series both humour and plot development are nicely balanced so that viewers of the anime are satisfied in both ecchi and plotline values.\\n\\n\r\nConclusion\\n\r\nAn anime that probably has the highest production value of the season (and dare i say the year), a deep plot and truckloads of humour, this anime cannot be missed. Seemingly neglescted due to its appearance as a \"generic\", this anime is anything but. A must watch\\n\\n\r\n[{eggysz - otakuzone.com}]",

            "content": "This is an ecchi and comedy, two of my favorite genres. However, the humor usually falls flat with me, and the ecchi is rather tame by my standards and doesn't have the situational elements that makes ecchi sexy. And there isn't much else to save the show. The story doesn't really matter much. It serves more as a premise for the 2 \"angeloid\" girls rather than a key component of most episodes. In other words, it's mostly episodic.\r\nComedy: The comedy is wild and exaggerated, using gags, slapstick, and parodies. And it's corny. It reminds me a bit of a Looney Toons cartoon. The main malecharacter, Tomoki, is uncontrollably perverted, and the comedy mostly consists of him coming up with plots to see women naked or in panties, and getting beat up in the process. He is shown 90% of the time in chibi form (the small child-like form) with a totally different voice, and almost half of that time he is running around naked. In fact, I almost don't recognize him when he switches back. I just don't find this type of dumb comedy appealing.\\n\\n\r\nEcchi: I'm a fan of ecchi, but I do find mindless ecchi boring. There needs to be some situational element to make the ecchi sexy and appealing, like a romantic build-up, an awkward situation, or some cuteness. Some of the panty shots involving Sohara early on in the series are quite nice as she shakes her butt around cutely while talking. The brief shot of the girls putting on kimonos was nice too. There was some romance there too, where Sohara developed some affection for the hero as he saved her. But then from about the 4th episode on, any of this romantic/cute ecchi ceases to exist. Instead, it's all brute-force mindless, emotionless ecchi as Tomoki barges in on girls to catch a peek. With no situational element, it's about as sexy as looking at a department store swimsuit catalog.\\n\\n\r\nSo with the comedy and ecchi elements being lackluster, and the story being more of background element (and this story being a bit shallow and undeveloped) Sora no Otoshimono fails to deliver. It's watchable as mild entertainment, but I wouldn't regret having not seen it.",

            "content": "Now let's be serious...the reason you are all probably here is because of the giant rack that you saw on Icarus. But aside from all the semi-nudity and ecchi nature of this anime, it is really quite enjoyable. I started off thinking that this would be like any other rom-com anime and it would be mostly fan service. Im not saying there isn't any because they go to the bathhouse, the beach, the water park, and anywhere that you can see lots of boobies.\r\nStory(7/10): The anime doesn't entirely focus on a story driven plot but it doesn't mean it is deprived of a story. Themoments where the anime crosses over to the darker toned scenes are actually pretty entertaining and they really make you change your perception of the angeloids. Apart from the main story, there are many fan service episodes which are also good and always end up making me laugh.\\n\\n\r\nArt(9/10): Art is good for the time it was released so there isn't really much to talk about here, but I have to say that I particularly enjoyed the chibi scenes that happened very often with the main character in his perverted situations.\\n\\n\r\nSound(10/10): Sound Is good and the soundtrack is also very amusing. Also the background music used during the more intense scenes fit and added to the anime\\n\\n\r\nCharacter(8/10): The characters are your usual bunch of anime characters. The perverted main character, the neighbor and childhood friend who is in love with the main character, the angeloid that turns the main character's life upside down, the rich and scary upperclassman, the smart and guiding force man person , and the cute angeloid who slowly falls for the main character. A box full of toys that somehow always get into weird situations.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment(10/10):I very much so enjoyed the anime. It's pretty good. Give it a chance. NO YOU WILL WATCH IT.\\n\\n\r\nOverall(9/10): Overall, it is a good anime that mixes a dark story with light humor and panty shots. If you watch this, I Believe you will truly enjoy it. So give it a chance. You'll probably like it. I know I did.\\n\\n\r\nLIKE\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "When you hear the words \"ecchi romance comedy\", what comes to mind?  Silly, pretty graphics that are fanservice oriented, weak plot and character development?  SnO is certainly a very lighthearted show for the most part, and easily enjoyable for those who appreciate comedy in general. This doesn't mean that SnO fundamentally lacks the qualities of a good, interesting, and solid show.\r\nArguably the biggest \"flaw\" of the show is that the story premise is as generic as it gets, with the tried and true concept of the boy who meets a magical girl (or angel in this case) who is able to do amazingthis for him, which we already know from shows like Chobits and Oh My Goddess. The question that must be asked is what is done to remix this old idea? In this case, I'd have to analyze the main character Tomoki. At first glance, he's a rather obnoxious and lazy pervert who merely wishes to live a quiet peaceful life. As events progress, we see more from him, how he's actually quite capable and motivated to help others around him who are in need. Tomoki's development towards becoming more sensitive to the people around him so far makes him, and this show stand out. Meanwhile, the time Tomoki loses from his \"quiet peaceful life\" that is spent caring for the angel Ikaros has contributed to her development in learning about the human world, and developing her emotions for those around her.\\n\\n\r\nThe aforementioned development of the main characters is quite well done, and moving. Even though Tomoki's shenanigans and Ikaros's naivety of the human world and her appealing design opens up many opportunities for the \"ecchi comedy\" part of this anime to take form, the \"romance\" part of this anime is generally done quite seriously, with characters taking time to reflect on events around them, not mention taking time to also explain their background, which really adds depth to the characters themselves and their emotions for one another, particularly concerning Tomoki's friend Sohara and of course the angel Ikaros.\\n\\n\r\nAs I was saying how Ikaros's design is quite appealing, the artwork in this show is extremely well done.  Characters are well-drawn in general, and the use of chibi forms of these characters in comedy moments is done quite appropriately. Animations are also really high quality and diverse, and the choice of music is very catchy and appropriate. The quality of the aesthetics in general is very impressive, and a reason alone for watching this show. What is also quite interesting about this show is how there is always a different theme and scene used for the ending of each episode, so I would recommend not skipping the credits of this show.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, SnO is a great show, and probably one of the highest quality productions of Fall 2009. This show is definitely for you if you want something that looks nice, is very funny, and has interesting development. The development of this show is so interesting that I'm concerned that 13 episodes is not enough to do this show justice. If a second season to this show will be announced, I'm definitely looking forward to it.",

            "content": "I was hesitant about starting down this series with it's label of an ecchi tag. However, this series is pretty good. In all honesty, it would probably turn off many, and draw in others. It's full of typical Japanese ecchi humor, which isn't bad if you're not a prude, a bit of a harem theme going but not in your face about it, and an overall feel-good story. It borders on sci-fi and fantasy, although that part of the story isn't fully explained. The focus of the series seems to be on the characters' interactions with the main character. There doesn't seem to be muchbackground plot or direction to the story beyond these interactions. One thing I didn't like was that these interactions became a bit repetitive with each subsequent addition of a new character. The series only has 2 seasons, so it didn't get too drawn out like how extremely long series sometimes constantly reuse the same formula.\\n\\n\r\nI would recommend this series if you want some laughs and aren't looking for something serious. You would like it even more, if you are into fan service, or are male. If you hate harem and ecchi themes, then you may want to avoid it. The series seemed to be made just for me, so I am giving it a 9 overall.",

            "content": "'Sora no Otoshimono' was an extremely pleasant and thrilling experience. In the supernatural genre, this anime is in a league of its own. If you're not a fan of ecchi or history though, turn away now. \r\nThe premise of this anime might appear banal at first. A guy named Tomoki Sakurai is your average laid-back pervert, spending his days sitting around and doing nothing in particular in between bouts of looking up girls' skirts. One day an angel comes crashing down on his peaceful village and all hell breaks lose. You'd think this idea wouldn't work and half-way through this series I still couldn't figureout where this anime was trying to go with its plot. It gets a lot better later as the ecchines and general silliness subsides and paves way for a philosophical,  mythological and emotionaly disstressing second half of the series. The transition is slow and nearly unnoticable, even if you went on anime watching marathon and decided to see this series in one sitting. It's absolutely amazing how well this has been pulled off and what's even more amazing is that it makes this series unique, in a positive way.\\n\\n\r\nThe whole concept of \"angeloids\" will take you by suprise because you will most likely be thinking about normal folklore-based angels with varying magical powers. Nope. I won't spoil this series for you so I'm only going to say that nearly every idea pertaining to angels here has been invented from scratch. At the same time however the main theme of the plot is that of a 'new world' which is closely based on the European age of discovery and colonisation.  Every episode begins with a history lesson and there are tons, and I mean tons of mythological and historical references in here. You'll learn a lot watching this anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters may appear shallow at the very begining but that won't be the case as the story progresses. The male lead, Tomoki is a pervert like no other. I can't even compare him to other male anime characters because he sets the bar so high in terms of pervertedness that no other character comes anywhere close to it. If there's an opportunity to do something lewd this guy will jump in to take advatage of it, without hesitation. That said, he cares deeply about his friends and is a central figure around which most of the events unravel. He's pivotal to the well-being of his circle of friends. \\n\\n\r\nIkaros is an angel sent down to assist Tomoki in... well pretty much everything. And Tomoki being a lewd sleaze that he is, takes full advantage of that. Ikaros however plays a much bigger role in this anime helping it to convey the ideas of freedom, discovery and... love. She's also linked to several historical and mythological events. Even her name is based on a mythological person.\\n\\n\r\nNymph is an another angeloid and her role in the series is to show the viewer that serfdom can be sometimes cruel. An important issue to be sure but this character was not given enough time and the series could have done better in terms of her development. Even though she's a tsundere-type character, she is very similar to Ikaros and at times I had the impression that she was nothing more than her different-looking clone.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have Tomoki's classmates. An eccentric and totally insane genius (a bit cliche but that didn't bother me) Eishirou Sugata. His academic and anecdotal knowledge is impressive and his goal is to discover the 'new world', the one angeloids are coming from. He acts as a mentor/teacher to the rest of the characters often guiding them in their actions. We then have the buxom Mitsuki Sohara, Tomoki's childhood friend who usually karate chops the hell out of him when he's being perverted - a running gag throughout the series. Her presence is somewhat vital to the plot but I couldn't put my finger on it. Perhaps she just fits in with the rest of the cast and without her this series would not be complete. And then we have the spine-chilling Mikako Satsukitane, Tomoki's class president who has the knack of turning peaceful town-folk into vicious killing machines. I don't know what's going on in her head at any given time, but it's not flowers and birds I can tell you that much.\\n\\n\r\nNow then with the story and characters discussed, let's move on to art and sound. I could simply say that they're both jaw-dropping. And they are but let's elaborate a little.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is flawless, I couldn't see a single mistake in any of the 13 episodes I've watched. Moreover, the art is precise to the core. Even the smallest features have been drawn with accuracy and precision. I'm talking about movie-grade precision. At times you don't want to believe that you're actually watching a TV series. FUNimation and AIC A.S.T.A have done a great job here.\\n\\n\r\nNow this is where my review might get a little biased. I personally love classical, baroque and late medieval music and this anime features plenty of that type of music. However, I could not see this anime working without any other type of music. Phililosophical and mythological themes call for a classical soundtrack so my personal preferences here don't make that much of a difference. That said, this series' soundtrack also features modern anime style pieces of music so I suppose everyone's going to be pleased.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment. Bah, I haven't been this intrugued and thrilled since I watched 'Death Note'. Seriously, the first few episodes might give you the wrong idea but it gets better as the series progresses. You'll not only have fun but you will also be genuinely interested in the story and you'll want to know more at all costs! \\n\\n\r\n'Sora no Otoshimono' is a masterpiece. 10 points.",

With sexualizing  all the female character with big breast or all the female characters just fighting for the same guy, without the guy not knowing anything.\r\n-Sora No Otoshimono or Heaven's Lost Property whichever you would like to call it; starts with the Protagonist name Tomaki Sakurai a perverted high school boy that somehow he wants to live a peaceful life. Later finds a Pink haired girl, Angle/Angleoids falling from the sky, maned Ikaros becoming somewhat his servant.\r\nThe show is pretty much based on the life of Tomaki Sakuraiand how he had to deal with his new life, with Ikaros flying around following him. Throughout the show, each episode isn't really connected to each other you'll see random anime change the comedy would make you laugh and you don't really care about other than Tomaki and Ikaros big breast, and more by putting does things aside is really enjoyable, the story-line is kinda weak, and Tomaki pervaded gets kinda annoying after awhile and breast popping all over the place but by following it and waiting until the credit scene of the episodes everything makes sense (kinda) and realize why the reason Ikaros is doing on in the fist place.\\n\\n\r\nLater on the series, more Angles/Angleoids would appear you'll find yourself loving them more then the humans companion that you'll meet in the process.\\n\\n\r\nProtagonist/Characters\\n\r\n-Tomoki: Is the obvious Perverted High School boy, that everyone loves and cares, about his friends, and is hard to see him as a serious Hero unlike other anime.\\n\\n\r\n-Ikaros: Is the Angle/Angleoid that Tomaki meets in the first two episodes, she bow to be Tomaki servant. With no real reason and follow Tomaki perverted schemes with no questions, later she finds herself loving Tomaki, without him not notice him, like any other protagonist  but not able to show emotions she has a hard time showing it, nor she smiles. But shows destructive anger if Tomaki is in any kinda danger. You'll find yourself for some weird reason wanting Ikaros to tell Tomoki how she feels. hahaha\\n\\n\r\n-Sohara: Is the next door neighbor and child hood friend, of Tomoki she also the typical girl that loves the protagonist having perverted dreams about him. But instead she keeps it and beats, Tomoki every time he gets any close contact with any other girl, always putting her nose where it doesn't belong.\\n\\n\r\n*There more characters that you would meet, while the series goes on* \\n\\n\r\nReally recommended if you want to have a good laugh you would enjoy watching it, and somehow you would be able to connect with them...

            "content": "The \"Magical Girlfriend\" genre is one that's been around long before anime became mainstream. Shows like Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie being prime examples. However, the series that made Magical Girlfriends a popular theme in anime would be \"Ah! My Goddess\". A charming, feel good show that has become a pretty big influence in the industry. Being a template for other similar titles like Chobits, Please Teacher!, Mahoromatic, Sekirei, and many others. Though with every good attempt at a magical girlfriend anime, there's always those poor attempts that are so horrible, that it makes the others I've mentioned feel bad about themselves. And byfar, the ABSOLUTE, WORST magical girlfriend show to EVER disgrace the genre.......is Bludgeoning Angel Dokuro-chan. But Heaven's Lost Property comes in a close second! And heres why.\\n\\n\r\nThe Story (If you can call it that) (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nTomoki Sakurai is this little punk ass who's been having the same dream he's been having ever since he was young. One his friends Sugata believes it to be a new world. However, Tomoki and his circle of friends have their lives change forever with the arrival of Ikaros. An angeloid who feel out of the sky and became Tomoki's master. Sparking a series of really perverted misadventures.\\n\\n\r\nSo as you can tell, this is a very familiar set up that's been done several times before. Examples I've already listed. But is it at least done well? OH HELL NO! Almost every episode is filled with plot holes and continuity errors, and the \"romance\" elements are poorly executed. Not to mention that it's VERY inconsistent with how angeloids work and function. I can honestly blame all of this on the shows usage of fanservice! Look, I don't mind fanservice in an anime as long as it's not overused and it doesn't take up the majority of it. Examples I can think of are \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\", \"A Certain Scientific Railgun\", and for a magical girlfriend example, \"Ah! My Goddess\". The problem in this case is that this series focusses WAY to much on the service, and seems to mostly care about giving male watchers erections, that the quality of everything else turns out horribly! And what makes it worse that it can be considered an excuse to give Tomoki perverted reactions to them. Who by the way, has to be the WORST male protagonist I've ever seen. But will get to him later.\\n\\n\r\nSo if you're looking for a deep, feel good romance anime, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU!\\n\\n\r\nThe Dub (6/10)\\n\\n\r\n.....It just baffles me how this awful series would have a very good cast of voice actors for it's dub. I mean, it has the likes of Greg Ayres, Brittney Karbowski, Eric Vale, Jamie Marchi, Alison Vikorin, Mike McFarland, and Trina Nishimura. These people are very good at what they do! Some of which did voices for some of my all time favorite characters......so HOW they saw potential in this series I'll never know. I'm surprised that the women who did the voices for the female characters didn't feel insulted by how this show treats and objectifies women. You could argue that they might be use to it considering they've working on ecchi animes before, but if I was a voice actress, and was offered to work on something like this, I would feel disgusted and decline in a snap! But you know what pisses me off the most, is that there are other animes that are considered masterpieces, or at least fan favorites, they have yet get dubbed for the american market. And yet animes like Heaven's Lost Property get dubs about a year after the first season finishes airing. It REALLY boggles the mind.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nNow I talk about what I think is the animes lowest point. And what better way to start, but with the main protagonist of the show, Tomoki. This prick has to be the WORST male protagonist I've ever seen, period! A lot of the time he's just being a no good pervert towards his friends and many of the background girls, and has very little respect for them! Now I just know that fanboys will try defending him by saying he does have his moments where he's nice towards the other characters, but he suffer the same problem as Louise the Zero! Any sense of character development that he'll get will be thrown out the window by the next episode, making that nice moment he had completely insincere. And don't get me started on his treatment to the other main characters. Speaking of which....\\n\\n\r\nIkaros was just.....boring. She's just your typical emotionless girl. Now I don't mind coming across this archetype more than once, as long as there's a good variation of it. Just take a look at Yuki Nagato, or Ennis from Baccano!. They were great emotionless girls. But Ikaros has nothing unique to her character, and just comes across as a downgraded version of Ren from DearS. Plus, this anime does a terrible job at being consistent with the fact that she's an android from heaven, since that fact doesn't stop her from eating food, shedding a tear every now and then, and so forth. Nymth, I'll admit was one of the two likable characters of this show. She did have a tragic backstory and her calling Tomoki an \"insect\" is another plus. Sohara I did pity over her treatment she gets from Tomoki.....until I discovered a disturbing fact about her, that makes her looks like a masochist. Now these main girls are somewhat tolerable, but what makes them unlikable to a certain extent is that they REALLY have no valid reasons to be in love with that asshole. Since he's guilty of the following.\\n\\n\r\n1. Hitting Ikaros and talking down to her whenever she screws up with something.\\n\r\n2. Puts Nymth down for having a flat chest. (Cause yeah, that's REALLY an important feature for a girl to have. *Sarcasm*)\\n\r\n3. Peeps at Sohara changing from next door, as well as stealing her underwear. Not to mention that once he broke into her house during her birthday, ate some cake without asking, and gave her something his grandpa gave him as a birthday present. Yeah, SOME friend you are Tomoki.\\n\\n\r\nThere are two more characters I need to talk about, which are Sugata and Mikako. Now Sugata I'll admit was pretty bearable, since he does have a nice personality and wants to help people. If anything, HE should've been the main protagonist instead. Mikako.......scares the crap out of me. Seriously....something is wrong with her. You just have to see for yourself. But anyways, there are two likable characters, but they aren't enough to save this atrocious cast, lead by that perverted bastard.\\n\\n\r\nThe Music (5/10)\\n\\n\r\nThe music was.....okay. But that isn't saying much. The opening theme isn't that memorable, and the ending theme.....actually, there's a different one for each episode. This may sound like a nitpick, but I'm use to animes that would have either one or two ending themes, as well as one or two opening themes. I just see no point in giving an episode a completely different ending theme. Because it feels more like an excuse to have even more ecchi fanservice to the running time. As if we had ENOUGH of that already!\\n\\n\r\nOverall (2/10)\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, Heaven's Lost Property is easily one of the worst animes I've ever seen in my life. As well as a complete insult to the \"Magical Girlfriend\" anime. The storytelling is poorer than Oliver Twist, the main character is a hateful perverted scumbag, and most of the other characters are either forgettable, poorly written, or both. There really is little to like about this awful anime. If you want a GOOD \"Magical Girlfriend\" anime, watch Ah! My Goddess, Chobits, and even Please Teacher! They're more worth your time than this poor attempt at being in their crowd.\\n\\n",

It's kinda of anyone's dream when they were kids.\r\n  And, Well the characters designs are quite OK and viewer-friendly, big eyes (not that all 1-color-highlighted eye or simple neko eyes), Cute and chubby facial shapes and the setting for the character is quite different but to their own charms and good features. And, btw the wings, battle suits are quite pretty as well....Ok, for the VA, yup they have succeeded to make one's character appealing and much lively, (Nice) well, my favourite character is Ikaros(female MC) and she sang OP and some ED of this anime along with Bluedrops ( her voice is sweet - Saori Hayami)\\n\r\n  And, what is great about this anime is the randomness , the creativeness of ecchi pantsu jokes and pranks and collaborating with some serious events and feels.\\n\r\n  Well, not that i boast about myself, I can understand average things quite clearly and this anime really is easy to read, suitable for leisure or as a side-dish combo with other strong-taste anime.\\n\r\n  Well Rome doesn't built in one day, so does this, try to collect small events, hints and stuffs in it then you will feel what it wanna give to you, just a reminder\" don't watch it all for Pantsu and Oppai, watch the Overall, I am sure it worth your time, well i have watched it thrice though....

            "content": "Take note that i've not read the manga or seen the other seasons yet but i'm planning on doing it in the near future and that i'm going all out with my honest opinion here. This is my first review on this site and i really wanted to talk about my disappointment for this anime to someone and what better place than on myanimelist.com\r\nHello everyone! This is your guy, HogisGuy. And i'm here with my first ever written review. I decided to write this review because i've never been this disappointed of an anime ever but boy have i got a lot (And i meanA LOT) of hate for my opinion on this series but i hope that you'll hear me out.\\n\\n\r\nThe first thing i wanna talk about is the story... wait! What story?!! Oh yeah! There was something about an angel from some a*****es in heaven. I totally forgot because i was so busy laughing at Tomoki's crazy and hilarious shenanigans (if you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic). Seriously, sometime i forgot that Ikaros really was an angel and thought she was a casual cosplayer or something. It seems like this anime was more busy showing us boring ecchi scenes and those many non-funny scenes with Tomoki and that it probably thought that we would get bored if they didn't show us more ecchi scenes and keep the actual plot at 45 seconds per episode. And even then the story itself wasn't that great but at least a hundred times more interesting than the other garbage they threw at us in the series. Though i will admit that i did laugh at some jokes there were a lot more jokes that just fell flat on it's own face and just died. It also feels like this anime didn't have any idea what audience it wanted to entertain. The comedy crowd? The drama crowd?! The perv crowd?!! I don't know and i have a feeling they didn't either.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and animations was really good and even beautiful at times. The designs on the characters was well done and i enjoyed the art style in every single scene (except for the \"HILARIOUS\" nipple-song scene). \\n\\n\r\nCharacters... OH JOY!! I'll start and finish it all with the poor excuse of a protagonist, Tomoki. Let me quote something from the book \"I have no mouth, and i must scream\" to describe what i feel for Tomoki... if i was a machine:\\n\\n\r\n\u201cHATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE COME TO HATE YOU SINCE I BEGAN TO LIVE. THERE ARE 387.44 MILLION MILES OF PRINTED CIRCUITS IN WAFER THIN LAYERS THAT FILL MY COMPLEX. IF THE WORD HATE WAS ENGRAVED ON EACH NANOANGSTROM OF THOSE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES IT WOULD NOT EQUAL ONE ONE-BILLIONTH OF THE HATE I FEEL AT THIS MICRO-INSTANT FOR YOU. HATE. HATE.\u201d \\n\\n\r\nI HATE Tomoki! He is not funny! He is not deep! He is not interesting! He is nothing! I would love to know who decided for this thing to be the protagonist of the series so i could slam his/her head into the wall and scream \"Why?!!\" into his ear over and over again. Tomoki doesn't contribute with anything to the series. I love how the anime is constantly trying to make me believe that he is important in this anime when the most common problems he runs into is following:\\n\\n\r\n1: How can i sneak into the girls locker room?\\n\r\n2: I can't afford this porno magazine? Well in all my years. I guess i have to work for some cash then.\\n\r\n3: How are we ever going to get those panties back on Sohara. What a pickle!\\n\r\n4: What's that Ikaros? You wanna move the plot forward? Hah! That's funny but seriously though, how can i sneak into the girls locker room?!!\\n\r\n5: Are you sure that transforming me into a girl is gonna get me inside the girls locker room?\\n\\n\r\nYou got a beautiful angel that will do ANYTHING for you! And if any of you people say he doesn't do anything with her because he's deep and emotional and would never take advantage of a woman like that. Yeah i think it's kinda too late to convince me that when i just saw him grope two women. You know what? Sugata is the better protagonist for the series. Yes i know that he too got some weird fantasies, playing around with dolls but here's the thing! He (unlike our villain \"Tomoki\") actually gets some s**t done. He researches the angels and seems to be more understanding and interested about them and want's to know more of their world. What does Tomoki do? ... He writes songs about his nipples. CHARMING! \\n\\n\r\nI want to give this anime a lower score because giving it an overall score of four makes me feel dirty but the thing is that this anime isn't poor. Because when you get to the good parts and especially the last few episodes i was really invested and found it even sad for what poor Nymph had to go through to get Ikaros home. I have nothing against Ecchi animes or mangas, hell i even love them but when you focus on it too much to the point where it gets in the way of the story you have to realize that it's going to wear out fast. I actually love Manyuu Hikencho and High School Of The Dead.\\n\\n\r\n- But HogisGuy!! HOTD has breasts and unnecessary panty shots. And Manyuu Hikencho is just naked breasts through the whole series.\\n\\n\r\nSure. HOTD has a lot of pointless ecchi scenes but they are out of the scenes as fast as they are in and yes, they do get boring at times with those panty shots but it never loses track of it's story and even has time for good character build-ups except for Shizuka who is totally pointless to the show and manga so far. Manyuu Hikencho's story revolves around big breasts. You can find it funny, you can find it hot. I see it as a hilarious and to be honest, a good story for it's ludicrous world and that's something this series gets right unlike Sora No Otoshimono.\\n\\n\r\nNow then, i don't hate Sora No Otoshimono. I just don't think it was as good as some people tried to make it out be. Here's to the second season being better but i have my doubts.",

            "content": "There really isn't anything that special about this anime. It's your typical ecchi comedy where all the girls have big boobs and the guys keep getting nose bleeds. However, I'd still recommend watching this anime because it's fairly short so if you wanted to you could knock it out in a few days, it always put a smile on my face when I watched it, and there are some actually dramatic moments in it.\r\nThis anime's best quality is how much personality each character has. Of course, this anime isn't as serious as Full Metal Alchemist so it isn't like every character has this complex reasonfor their actions, but I love how much emotion each character shows and how every character contributes to the show in their own way. For example, Mikako is kind of the shows antagonist and she loves anything involving other people getting hurt like if she sees two people disagreeing her solution is for the two to have a dual to the death and whoever lives is right.\\n\\n\r\nLike many anime comedies, there's a hint of romance in this anime, but it's interesting how the romance develops. Tomoki and Ikaros don't really fall in love so much as Tomoki teaches Ikaros what love is. Ikaros is such an innocent character and so oblivious to basic emotions she has a tough time grasping the concept of love so she becomes confused when she feels it. Most of the serious traits in the anime are eclipsed by all the comedic moments, but I can still see how Ikaros changes on the inside as the anime progresses. \\n\\n\r\nNow, the biggest problem with this anime is how there are way too many pervert jokes! Seriously, every episode has to have Tomoki trying to look up a girl's skirt or molesting someone. It gets old after a while and I'm just happy this anime's short because I don't think I could watch even 50 episodes of it before I'd throw in the towel. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: This is a pretty funny comedy to watch even though the jokes do get a little old at the end. There's a pretty descent romantic element to it and, of course, tons of magic. The story is almost non-existent, but the characters are truly this anime's best quality. \\n",

            "content": "If I could describe \"Sora no Otoshimono\" in a way that almost perfectly suits it I'd say \"Sora no Otoshimono\" = Epic Trolling With a Story and Plot. And here's why I believe that:\r\nSTORY: 8\r\n\"Sora no Otoshimono\" doesn't focus on the who, what, when, where, why, and how Ikaros became Tomoki's \"Pet Class Angeloid\". But it really doesn't need to as more than likely the sequels will explain that. In a Story perspective it mostly focuses on the daily events of Ikaros adapting to the human ways of life while attempting to understand her master and his perverted ways. As well as trying to understandherself. The whole cast is constantly entangled with hysterical events such as flying panties that can achieve higher speeds than the famous SR-71 Black Bird (which leaves the pilot o_0 WTF?), exploring the new world that is the girls bathroom, a festival turned into a blood bath because of the attractive opportunity of 10,000,000 yen for shooting your neighbor, and understanding what it means to go on a date. \\n\\n\r\nART: 10 \\n\r\nThis was clearly for me one of the best hand drawn and partially CG'd anime's I have ever seen. Sora no Otoshimono stands rightfully and proudly next to Steins;Gate and Nisemonogatari. Kudos to the staff for such wonderful, beautifully hand drawn characters. \\n\\n\r\nSOUND: 9\\n\r\nThe opening was actually worth my time to watch as well as the different endings each and every episode had. I mean who else would watch openings and endings other than for the music it has? And as much as I liked Tomoki's song of \"My Tingling Nipples\" I still feel the music was just a tad bit shy of perfection. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: 8\\n\r\nI feel that all of the main characters deserve their own criticism from me separately as they have earned it so here it is.\\n\\n\r\nIkaros: Our somewhat emotionless heroine. It seems that the story leans more toward her than it does to Tomoki. As she attempts to understand what it means to be human and blend into society anonymously (tho fails epically). She unknowingly takes her master's and co's lessons that try to teach her to be more human like far too literally. Often concluding with humorous results. Such as lying. (The lying lesson was NOT given to her by her master and co but by a passerby) As this passerby tells what I presume to be his girlfriend \"lying is human\" Ikaros takes this to the extreme. Shockingly telling a chef his food looks like shit, while also declaring to a mother her baby is hideous. These are one of the many reasons why you might just fall in love with Ikaros. \\n\\n\r\nNymph: She isn't completely introduced until episode 6. A bit of a delay to present the show's tsundere but better late than never. I personally enjoyed the introduction of Nymph. What would you think if you woke up in your household, went to your living room, only to find a complete stranger comfortably making themselves at home in your household? You'd possibly freak the fuck out if you didn't have anyone else with you. But with Nymph having a connection with Ikaros it only made it more mysterious of why she'd even be there. Her characteristics are also very familiar but not despised of. With the traits of a tsundere and attitude of a smart aleck, she also attempts to understand what it is to be human. She is shown often calling Tomoki and anyone else she sees as an idiot a \"bug\". But as the story progresses she opens herself like every other tsundere would. She reminded me of Haruna from Kore wa \"Zombie Desu ka?\". (well Iori Nomizu does voice both Nymph and Haruna lol) Nonetheless, she is a welcomed character to the series.\\n\\n\r\nSohara Mitsuki: Sohara felt more like a side character than a real main character to me. After viewing the first episode and observing her characteristics, I quickly realized that I have found yet another typical childhood friend who fails to convey her feelings properly to the boy she loves. This is such an overused concept in anime that it has started to annoy me. Time and time again I frequently run into anime's that use this same concept. Whether it be \"Tayutama: Kiss on my Deity\" or \"Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi\". In the end the result is the same: Childhood friend either wins the heart of his/her love interest or doesn't. So what was enjoyable about Sohara now that you more or less understand what I am seeing? Nothing much sadly. The best way I can describe her is to say that she is a cup that is half empty. The description given about her reveals no spoilers and nothing new in the anime world. She typically karate chops Tomoki for not giving her the attention she utmost desires. Although he does deserve it with certain actions he takes, she shouldn't be frequently chopping him for every small perverted thing he does. He's a maturing man like he said and needs to tune his manliness. How could he help getting a hard on in the morning? Hasn't she ever heard of something called morning wood? I am fully aware that the developers put her in the story for a love triangle relationship and a comedic effect. But after a while I had grown more attached to Ikaros (and even Nymph) that I figured it probably would have been better to ax her and never introduce her to the story in the first place. It was funny the first few times she knocked Tomoki's lights out. But after a while of the same shit and repeat, it began to make me question if she was worth the time introducing and putting the effort to make her part of the show.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki Sakurai: A troll genius. Possibly every wish he has I wish greater. Whether it'd be the power to turn invisible to grope my girlfriends tits, or freeze time to run around streaking in public. It wouldn't matter as long as I have a beautiful Angeloid that obeys my every command and that accompanies me throughout my mischievous deeds. And that is precisely what this lucky little bastard has done and gone through. His motto (which is one that Me Gusta) is to live in peace and quite. But after running into and forever bonded to an Angeloid named Ikaros, that soon changes indefinitely. As he constantly throws himself into 100% lethal situations which he is only to be saved by his gorgeous Angeloid. Although ironically Ikaros is one of the major sources of chaos and disarray, he full knowing this continues to support and help her in her quest to be more human like. His characteristics are that of a perverse old man. His desire to sniff panties and wear them cannot be stopped. His raging hormones strongly portray what it means to be young, dumb, and full of cum. But despite all of this, he still has that soft spot for caring about what matters most. The well being of his friends and his Angeloid. \\n\\n\r\nMikako Satsukitane: The sadistic bitch in the series. Reading the description about her practically notifies you of what is to come when she is brought into the story. While her presence seems that of a bystander she is involved partly in the story. She is seen mostly around Eishirou. Conversing her thoughts on his thoughts of the new world. She and him feel to me more like background characters that fill in the empty space of what could have been.  I do enjoy her haughty smile and deeply provoking comments, but this is one bitch you don't want to fuck with. During Ikaros's silver tongue moment, she specifically stated Mikako was \"nice\". Anyone with half a brain would instantly recognize what she meant by that. \\n\\n\r\nEishirou Sugata: The man who dreams to find the new world. Going as far as to creating his own home-made glider only to make a few \"miscalculations\" and plummet from the skies above to meet the concrete floor. It seemed to me that he was completely obsessed with the idea of there being a new world above us. He portrays himself as a shady character with little to no background. He is the founder of the New Continent Discovery Club and is found in the beginning of each episode presenting to you his pretty assistant and a \"The More You Know\" like dialog. He continuously provides information that should not be know by regular human beings. And it seems he has experience with Angeloids. As he states to Ikaros \"Stop playing dumb, you couldn't possibly be a Pet Class Angeloid.\", as well as having a high-tech computer that monitors Ikaros's state and condition. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT: 9\\n\r\nA few times I almost fell off my chair laughing from its humor that it constantly loves to give to its viewers. It does have a lot of ecchi moments involved but I wasn't bothered by it at all. If anything I enjoyed it. I loved the story as well as the characters and the art was simply gorgeous. The sound was near perfection and the story set out for what it was going to do. And that is a humorous and enjoyable time. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: 9\\n\r\n\"Sora no Otoshimono\" is a Comedy, Ecchi, Sci-Fi, Shounen, Supernatural anime with some romance sprinkled on top for good measure of an amusing time. I most certainly enjoyed putting 312 minutes of my spare time into \"Sora no Otoshimono\". It may not be for everyone as this mainly aims for a comedic effect and an ecchi audience. But it also has some super cereal moments involved for you ManBearPigs. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for an anime that aims to make your stomach hurt from laughter. This is one that should not be missed. I most certainly will not forget this anime like I have forgotten others. As this one has earned its right to claim its throne among the last that are to be forgotten. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "My first review, give some constructive criticism on improvements!\r\nHmmm... Sora no Otoshimono (or Heaven's Lost Property), is probably THE BEST example I've seen of an Ecchi comedy that manages to successfully transcend the realms of stupidity to produce an excellent anime with a memorable story and amazing characters. A thoroughly enjoyable experience.\r\nOh yeah, you fell from the sky yesterday... right... - Tomoki\r\nThis quote from the first episode, combined with Tomoki's reaction effectively sums up how over-the-top Sora no Otoshimono(SnO) gets and how mind-numbingly insane, the situations that are going to occur in Tomoki's life will be. Tomoki himself states that this story is the depictionof the downfall of his peaceful and quiet life, into flying panties, well endowed angeloids and karate chops that defy every possible law of physics. It's exactly this stupidly over-the-top comedy combined with the excellent art direction and characters that make SnO such a great show to watch. It never takes itself too seriously or tries to present over complicated plot and character developments every five seconds, instead it relies on natural character development and maturity and certain key moments of plot development resulting in both a touching story and great Ecchi and comedy moments thus keeping the viewer entertained and hooked episode upon episode. The humour never gets stale, SnO keeps it interesting and mixes it up just enough so that you, the viewer continue to laugh episode after episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe art of SnO is beautiful, instantly from the first episode you can see this show has great production values, the characters are well drawn and the environments are varied, and very well coloured. Being an Ecchi comedy the girls and their underwear are incredibly well drawn and the girls themselves designed and detailed to near perfection. The animation is also very fluid and dynamic, and feels very natural to they eye. Boobs bounce well, skirts fly and panties get flashed with graceful movement (is that even possible!??). The characters are often represented in Chibi form, which is very well done and fits in with the shows comedic nature, it continuously reminds the viewer not to take the show too seriously and adds to the overall humour. However where the art and animation really shines in this series is the characters facial expressions and emotions, Icarus one of the angeloids carries a sad, melancholic expression throughout the series, and to put it simply it looks amazing, the studio really succeeded in making believable emotions and this works great with the character development.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound is another plus for this anime, the OP is a kind of catchy, melancholic song that really represents the series emotional and serious side, the ED or should I say EDs are where this show feels unique and interesting. Each episode has a unique ending that ties in with the events that took place during that episode, and are accompanied by an epilogue styled animation that shows the aftemath of what occured during that episode. The BGM is also good, it fits well with the comedy and really compliments the emotional scenes when they occur, theres also never a moment in this show where you hear a piece of BGM and feel its overused or too predictable.\\n\\n\r\nNow comes the part of this show that makes it shine compared to all the other Ecchi comedies out there, the characters and story. The characters of this show are the main reason why it's so enjoyable they all feel natural and are developed well giving viewers a reason to pay attention to them. Since the cast of recurring characters is small the producers manage to give each character ample enough time to become well developed. One of the characters that stood out for me has to be Sugata, described during the first episode as a highly intelligent, extremely creepy and perverted guy and also introducing each episode, he has the most interesting role in the series. He attempts to discover the so called 'New World' where the angeloids came from thus he continuously observes Icarus and Nymph. He is highly intelligent and perceptive thus picking up on things no one else in the series manages too, his comments and dialogue often give the viewer understanding and insight as well as questions about the angeloids and who they really are.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is another plus point to this anime, it is very well executed and fits in with all the randomness and comedy of the show, in most episodes the story is just an undertone and is shows through the way the characters develop and interact with each other. However during the select key moments of the series when the story takes the driving seat, it executes well and piques the viewers interest making them ask questions and wonder what is going to happen next, it also manages to make very effective use of emotion making the viewer want to be involved in it all the much more. The seriousness picks up most at the end of the show and the viewer really feels and understands the angeliods, giving the story and excellent and dramatic ending.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all SnO is a beautiful and well executed show that shows just how versatile the Ecchi comedy genre can be if done properly.\\n",

            "content": "***SPOILER ALERT!!!***\r\nFrom here on, I'm not paying attention to how much I could spoil, but I may spoil some things on the way; you have been warned. (Now that I've read it though, it looks like I've only spoiled minor things...)\r\nAlright, first off, let me say that this will be my first review and I do not mean to offend anyone with my comments.  I am expressing my opinion and I hope you will respect my opinion as I promise to respect yours, as well. \r\nThis anime was one of the first ones I heard of through the internet, back when I first startedto watch anime, and when I watched it, I had high expectations for it because everyone else seemed to really love it and give it good reviews!  I really, really, want to say that I like it but I just can't... It wasn't something that was torture to watch, but I didn't enjoy it too much, either.\\n\\n\r\nI gave the story a 5/10 here.  Man, what can I say? The first episode, as usual, started off with a decent enough story, in which the female lead, Icarus, makes a \"sudden\" and \"surprising\" entrance and meets the stunned male lead, Tomoki; veeery original.  But any hint of a story is always swallowed up by the filler-esque humor.  For every three episodes, one might progress the story.  But unfortunately, everything turns out to be bland and predictable, right down to the characters' actions, but I'll get to that later. The only time story can be squeezed in is when Tomoki shuts his big damn mouth, which hardly ever happens...>_> An attempt was made, no doubt, for there to be a nice story, but story-wise, this anime just falls flat...I can't say I enjoyed the story until the latter half of the anime, in which a bit more happened.  But the plot is nothing new, special, or surprising, and the story that the humor is based around all feels forced; trapped on an island, the beach episode, new girls go to the school, the festival, and the last episode, in which the male lead gets mini speeches from his friends, and gives the mini-speech about friendship to the heroine and the power of love wins against the baddies!  \\n\\n\r\nThe art gets an 8/10 here.  Its not ground-breaking, but its pretty enough, the animation is fluid, and there are no awkward animation moments to note.  Not much to say here except that I despise the way that the characters, ESPECIALLY Tomoki, are chibi-fied at the drop of a hat. The animation is the part I enjoyed the most, but it wasn't a great reason to watch the anime.  \\n\\n\r\nThe sound gets a 6/10, because although I liked the OP, the OST's weren't anything special.  How should I put it.....I don't think the sound was bad.  It's just something that enhanced the experience and there were no problems; pretty average. I don't like how in the last few episodes, they shoved sound effects into the OP, as if they wanted something different and were too lazy to make a parodied OP or something along the lines of that...As they say, \"Do not fix what is not broken\".  For the ED, I can't really say if I liked the fact that each episode had a different ending song... Some might like it, but I prefer one OP and one ED.  But hey, that's just me.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter...Oh boy, where to start?...OK, lets start with Tomoki.  \\n\r\nFor the \"strange dreams\" he had with the angel introduced in the first episode, I was hoping to see more, because that could have really helped the plot, but it was only referred to about once or twice more, and ended up as something to put in his character description to make him \"special\"...Well, let me say, if MAL had a least favorite character list, he would definitely be in it! All he does is scream out obvious things, make disturbing noises, act frustrated, and talk about being human once in a while. After 13 episodes of his ANNOYING voice (all I hear is the sound of a boy with voice changes going \"Huhuhuhuhuhuhu-uuuu-uuu...\") that makes me want to stab soft furry things, his not-cute chibi that substitutes for him 70% of the time, and the little wing covering up his private parts, I want to push him into a volcano and watch him burn slowly. >:D  The worst part is, the girls in his harem love him for the 5% of the time when he makes a serious face and talks about human feelings...the rest of the time, he's being a purposely perverted pubescent pervert.  (Sorry, I couldn't resist XD)  I can't think of any worse shounen leads... my favorite part is when he becomes a girl and has a different damn VOICE.  I find ecchi situations more funny when they're by accident, and the lead isn't agressively trying to peep, but there's no such thing here; no sir!  Tomoki is just  a vicious pervert and I don't see what everyone sees in him...He's  just a peeping Tomoki. *snicker* Seriously, this series is just overusing that joke, and now it's a dead horse.  \\n\\n\r\nWhile I'm on the subject of overused, let me start on the other characters, which are all recycled.  First, Sohara, the clingy, jealous, childhood friend, a harem favorite.  Another harem favorite, the abused and tsundere-ish loli, Nymph.  She wasn't that bad, in fact, she was one of my main reasons for watching Sora no Otoshimono because she's so cute.  Yeah, she wasn't horrible; she and Icarus were the only ones with character development in the anime.  Icarus was fairly decent and I liked the watermelon theme for her for some reason.  It was a nice touch, but still not enough to save the show from Tomoki...>:I In the end, she is one of the better ones, but she is still the \"emotionless girl\" with limited addition to the character's background.  She was predictable all the time; for example, with the episode in which she's in the band, I knew right away that she would sing, if only for the sake of the fans.  Speaking of background, we have Sugata and Mikako, the slapped-on characters used to \"round off\" the cast.  It's like, they're just there...to be there. Yes, each episode starts off with a history lecture from Sugata; some were funny but most were annoying or boring.  He's just that \"epic smart guy with glasses that he pushes up his nose who points out conspiracies\". I have no problem with that, it's just that his character feels out of place in the genre, and would fit in better in Sci-Fi or something that has conspiracies to reveal.  Mikako is just another sadistic \"kind\" girl, but I only laughed at the character a few times, as she also felt out-of-place.  But what made them feel most tacked-on is the fact that they both start out knowing everyone, but it is never explained how any of them met each other. At least in Sohara's case, there was a brief and decent explanation as to how she met Tomoki. \\n\r\nThe characters get a 4/10 and I hope you understand why I selected this score. ^~^\\n\\n\r\nLast but not least, the comedy. This anime is 90% slapstick humor and virtually all of the humor involves Tomoki being perverted.  \"Tomoki runs around naked after seeing naked girls because he is about to get hurt\"  pretty much sums it up.  I was never a fan of slapstick humor, and it's not that funny when it's the same situation over and over again.  Slapstick humor is best sprinkled on like a seasoning for the events that lead to it; events that are different! Take the anime \"Nichijou\" for example- it is hilarious to watch the characters be wacked by things because it's a result of a funny situation- no one is screaming and they sit with straight faces as they are hurt.  But the execution was not something repeated over and over and OVER.  Each situation was different.  They don't scream around naked making wierd noises and yelling about getting hurt; the people who made that know that that would be boring and what you would expect.  Yes-- Sora no Otoshimono wants you to laugh at how it looks instead of the story...  There was hardly any creativity involved, and a *perverted* 9-year-old could have made the \"funny\" parts in this anime.  When I don't find myself laughing for an entire episode of SNO, I can't argue with my instincts; it's just not that funny...I laugh pretty easily, so don't be pointing fingers.  The comedy gets 4/10 because, basically, it's not very original.\\n\\n\r\nAs much as I would like to like this anime and give it an 8, 9, or 10 like other people have,  I'm gonna have to say that it fell short on both comedy and plot.  The art and sound were the most enjoyable parts, but not as important, and the biggest disappointment were the characters.  Therefore, I will have to give this anime a 5/10.  But I'm still open-minded enough to watch Season 2 (and 3?) because it would not be difficult to improve upon this anime.  Also, because I never drop and never plan to drop an anime.  I want to like it, but its potential was wasted.  Please respect my opinion, and I apologize if I have offended you.  Thank you for taking your time to read this, and I hope my review of the anime \"Sora no Otoshimono\" helped you! :) \\n",

The series is easily found online or on a DVD (they have it on eBay for those who don't live in Japan) and it is subtitled (not dubbed---an automatic check in my mind).\r\nNow this series is a comedy primarily, but it has some romantic/sci-fi elements. The plot centers mostly around getting a laugh, except for the last few episodes of the season. It certainly doesn't dissapoint.\r\nIf you don't like perverted humor and prefer thingsto be funny because of the language versus situational humor, this probably isn't for you. But those of us with dirty minds and the ability to laugh at an anime that can laugh at itself will enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nEspecially great are the sequences they play during the credits....always really funny and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, not exactly the most original plot/characters but it is pretty funny and is good for what it is.\\n\\n\r\nFair warning: the theme song is really, really catchy and there are a lot of boobs.",

            "content": "I continue to violently hate the ecchi genre, yet violently love it at the same time. And it\u2019s in no way because it\u2019s always going to give you something new and exciting to watch. The ecchi harem genre especially, for me at least, is always the kind of place I go when I have no idea what to watch next and want something semi-decent that I know I\u2019ll like in some regard. The anime in this genre are so dependably generic and so\u2026well, they\u2019re just always the same. And while the degree of comedy changes from one anime to the next, the plot devices, thecharacters, the settings; they all seem to be the exact same thing every time. Of course, this is a problem that I point out consistently when reviewing anime of this genre, but at the same time there is something good about it. I guess ecchi harem comedies are good to fall back on when you want something dependable to watch.\\n\\n\r\nI mean, read the following plot synopsis, switch out some attributes of the characters, and you have just about every anime of this genre.\\n\\n\r\nHeaven\u2019s Lost Property (or Sora no Otoshimono, though Heaven\u2019s Lost Property is easier to remember) is the story of Tomoki, an average pervert who lives alone because his parents are out on vacation or some such bullshit, and dreams of angels for some reason. When sitting under the stars the sky starts to fall and he winds up saving this scantily clad \u201cangeloid\u201d named Ikaros. She winds up becoming subservient to him and follows him around, helping him achieve his perverted means. So, with his new found angel to provide him with the means, Tomoki ends up doing all kind of terrible things to his childhood friend, and the girl who loves him, Sohara. But the girl continues to love him for whatever reason. There\u2019s the implication of a love triangle, though there is absolutely nothing romantic between any of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki goes to high school where he is friends with a weird guy named Eishiro who is attempting to find the New World, and he\u2019s also friends with the class president, daughter of a Yakuza boss. Of course, hilarity ensues. As the story progresses, we meet another angeloid named Nymph who has come to take back Ikaros, who is apparently a terrible weapon. Nymph slowly grows to like Ikaros and Tomoki, though, and from there, I\u2019ll leave the rest of the plot up to you to discover.\\n\\n\r\nSounds pretty typical, right? Normal guy (this time a perv rather than a tsundere) meets a strange, otherworldly girl with a checkered past. Winds up in a love triangle with weird girl and childhood friend. Yes, we\u2019ve seen it before.\\n\\n\r\nAnd it doesn\u2019t stop at the plot. Heaven\u2019s Lost Property resorts to the familiar settings we\u2019ve seen in a hundred other romcom\u2019s/ecchi\u2019s/harem\u2019s. The beach, the pool, the hot spring, the school festival, the regular festival. But unlike many shows like Heaven\u2019s Lost Property, these episodes are typically\u2026funny. Surprisingly, the very, very perverted main character is hilarious. Usually I can do without jokes that depend on panties and boobs for a cheap laugh but the migrating panties was so ridiculous, it was hilarious. Tomoki is always getting into idiotic situations that never fail to illicit a laugh from me. Heaven\u2019s Lost Property is unashamedly dirty, constantly depicting Tomoki naked, face planting in girls crotches, and balancing things on his dick.  In any other anime, these things would be unfunny, but Heaven\u2019s Lost Property manages to make it hilarious and entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nThat\u2019s not to say that the show is without its faults. I cannot commend it for following genre conventions, nor can I really commend its attempt to focus on a lackluster serious plot. As with most anime of this type, HLP has a serious plot that runs through the entire series but is only severely focused on at the end. This serious plot is mildly interesting, though nothing is explained to a point where you would care about it beside, perhaps, for one character.\\n\\n\r\nThat character is Nymph. And while I won\u2019t say she\u2019s a fantastic character, she was pretty damn likeable. She has been abused by her master in heaven and is, well, lost. She can\u2019t enjoy anything because of how horrible her master is to her, but finds some comfort and love in Tomoki\u2019s household. She is at first after Ikaros, but the two quickly grow a sisterly bond and any want of being with her current master is dashed. Out of all of the characters, she was my favorite by far. She had much more to her emotions and she was all around a good character.\\n\\n\r\nMeanwhile Ikaros is just\u2026there. She\u2019s nothing special and as she grows and develops she only grows to mention things we can see coming from a mile away. She wants to hold Tomoki\u2019s hand. She\u2019s scared of admitting that she\u2019s a weapon. It\u2019s all very predictable.\\n\\n\r\nTomoki, our star, is, as stated, brutally hilarious at times. His attempts at seeing panties and getting close to girl\u2019s crotches are constantly funny. A good character? Not so much. But a funny one.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there is Sohara and the others, but you\u2019ve met them before in countless anime. So I won\u2019t worry about going into any detail. Suffice it to say, they play their roles but are uninteresting otherwise.\\n\\n\r\nQuite simply, HLP is one of the better harem/ecchi/comedy series I have seen. It\u2019s surprisingly funny, entertaining, and a teeny bit sad at points.\\n\\n\r\nIs it worth your time? Maybe. If you enjoy this genre, then this is one of the best I\u2019ve seen. If not, then I can\u2019t see why you would even consider it.\\n\\n\r\nWith great comedy, a new ED every episode, and Nymph, HLP stands out as one of the best, if not the best, ecchi/harem/romcom I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s up there with Baka and Test at least.",

As we all know the ecchi genre has a lot of fanservice and it can become the focus of some animes,but WOW I was blown away by Heaven's Lost Property. To start off we have the characters, The main character Tomoki is a huge pervert who just wants a quiet life. Ikaros the \"angeloid\" who struggles with being human was just adorable. Tsugata the \"genius\" of the cast who has a strange obsession with flying. Sohara tomoki' childhood friend who constantly punishes him for his pervy ways. Finally Mikako asarcastic rich girl. The story focuses on the misadventures of the characters and later focuses on dealing with trying to make Ikaros human. This led to a lot of comedic situations, which were always something different. The only real recurring joke of the series was Sohara's deadly karate chop, and even then that was kept at a level where it was still funny when it came down to the scene. The music of this anime was extremely catchy, the opening theme especially. The animation was superb, it used a creative mix of bright and dark shades which complimented each other very well. The character designs were all very unique especially Ikaros in her original outfit. Lastly the voice acting in the English dub is outstanding(for the most part). All together Heaven's lost property is a very good example of the potential of the ecchi genre, if you like ecchi animes don't miss this anime, you'll regret it",

            "content": "Sora no otoshimono, or Heaven's lost property is a somewhat unique harem show.  Because of the interesting and serious storyline, I find myself really...disturbed.  I will explain.\r\nCharacters: The characters are pretty...well...platonic.  While for the most part they don't change, it doesn't hinder the plot in any way.  However, only the main female who's arc is named after really only changes character-wise in the series.  \r\nStory: While for the most part, this anime does have serious side to it, and has a very gripping overarching plot.  However, I forgot to mention the pure amount of fanservice there is.  Sorano Otoshimono has to be one of the biggest fanservice animes out there, next to HOTD.  They devote entire episodes to fanservice, and can really turn a viewer away.  \\n\\n\r\nSound and art: The art is adequate and pleasing to the eye.  They especially put great detail on the wings in the series and make the characters more...well, angel-like.  There is also the comical chibi aspect which becomes very prominent in fanservice episodes, telling the viewer what to come.  (This is a warning if you plan to watch this.) For sound, the general sound in the anime itself isn't very note-worthy.  The opening however is very upbeat and can guarantee at least a little bit of finger tapping along with the beat.  \\n\\n\r\nPersonal enjoyment: While blocking out every single fanservice episode that existed in this anime. (I count at least half of it.) Sora no Otoshimono has a good plot in my opinion.  The mysteries, the questions.  It's all very intriguing and personally, I can't wait to watch more of this...probably while blocking out what horrible mental images I have been shown.",

            "content": "Please note: This review is for the FIRST SEASON of Heaven's Lost Property (Sora no Otoshimono) only. Season two and the two movies are not taken into account during this review.\r\nStory: 5/10 - This is one of those anime where the boobs are bigger than the plot. The story to season one is simple: A robotic angel (Angeloid) who has the power to grant any wish named Icarus falls out of dark flying vortex that has been orbiting Earth for 13 months, and her only desire is to serve an oridinary perverted teenage boy who witnessed the crash. The boy (Tomoki), has been having strangevivid dreams throughout his life where he sees a beautiful angel reach out for him before flying away, and he is dead set on determining why he is having these strange dreams. Also, another Angeloid named Nymph randomly appears shortly after. So with the powers of two Angeloids, Tomoki, his short-tempered friend (Sohara), the sociopath student president Mikako, and the knowledgeable nerd with the passion of flying (Eishirou), face the most harshest of challenges (like why Sohara's panties keep magically flying into space).\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8/10 - This was my most painful score to give during this review. Why? Because the animation can be fucking mindblowing... when it wants to be. However, a lot of times the series spends time \"beating a dead horse\" with old chibi jokes. I personally find this really disappointing since the animation can easily top 98% of any other Shounen out there... but it chooses not to.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8/10 - My biggest irritation with the sound category was the fact that Funimation decided to give Greg Aryes the role as the main role in the dub. I honestly have nothing against Greg Aryes, but when he is put into a main role, it leaves the viewers pulling their hair out listening to that typical voice. He makes a great \"comic relief sidekick\" voice, but nothing else.  Besides that, the background music is pretty good and the intro is kick-ass to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6/10 - With the exception of Nymph, all the other characters feel so two dimensional in this anime. Icarus literally has the emotions of a robot, Tomoki is you're typical pervert that you see in every Ecchi anime, Sohara is also a fairly 2-D character with not much going for her, as she continues to stay in an abusive friendship with Tomoki (despite the hilarity that comes from the friendship).\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10/10 - This is by far, the shows strongest point. The storyline and characters may leave a lot to be desired, but it sure as hell interesting to watch. This anime was so funny that it had me on the floor as my lungs forcibly ejected any oxygen from my body. The shear enjoyment of watching Tomoki's perversion backfire is always a marvel to behold, and when that's not happening, the show usually entertains with an awesome Angeloid on Angeloid battle scene.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, there is one reason why I'd suggest Heaven's Lost Property to anyone, and that's the shear entertainment value that's radiating from the show. If you are not a fan of cheesy-plot ecchi, however, this may not be the anime for you. Overall: 7/10",

Eventually I ran out of things on Netflix and decided to just watch it. To my surprise, I found what is easily one of the funniest anime ever.\r\nThe show's slapstick humor seems to hit it out of the park every time. The characters match perfectly for hilarious situations. Scenes like when Ikaros goes on her first shopping errand really make you laugh your as* off. That paired with great voicing, soundtrack, graphics, and a decent story overall, Sorano Otoshimono has reserved a special spot on my top 10 list and I definitely recommend  giving it a watch if you haven't already.",

Of it's genre, it stands out from the crowd in that the jokes are actually funny and the ecchi isn't over the top, yet it still falls prey to flat characters and a storyline which lacks a bit.\r\nEcchi is like the topping on a hot dog, it's not the main attraction but it certainly adds flavor. While some series sacrifice all else for ecchi, Sora no Otoshimono moderates itself (just a little bit). It's not a (huge) distraction, which is good. \r\nThe characters are pretty flat. Thecharacter that develops the most is Icarus (Ikaros), who struggles with trying to become more human like for her master. That doesn't get very far, nor does it really seem to be a driving point in the story. \\n\\n\r\nThe story, it actually includes drama. There were a few parts where I knew what was going to happen solely because I read the manga, yet I still was shocked to see it happen. It kicks it from comedy to drama in a few seconds, but unfortunately only when it comes to one character. Still, plenty of \"oh snap!\" moments.\\n\\n\r\nEach episode has it's own ending theme, and episode eleven has a different main vocalist for the opening. The end themes are sometimes parodies of other end themes, but not always. The twelfth and thirteenth endings are actually quite beautifully done in my opinion. \\n\r\nHowever there's a spot in which Icarus sings. I was looking forward to hearing it after reading the manga, but the actual song is disappointing. \\n\\n\r\nThe art of this series is based off of the art of the manga, and while they did some parts worse than the manga overall I'd actually say that they illustrated the characters better, Icarus especially. I didn't really notice how well designed she was until I watched the anime. On the other hand, three unnamed characters seemed a bit underwhelming.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed the series myself, but it is quite episodic. You could cut out a lot of episodes, but then again you could also take the pictures out of a children's storybook.\\n\r\nThis series is not meant for heavy storyline fans.",

            "content": "Sora no Otoshimono came off as a bit weird to me at first....This is my first echi anime so I thought it wasn't going to have substance or a good story. I was wrong.\r\nAfter I finished the show, the first season rather, I was overall very happy with the show and i'm excited to watch the next season. Like I said the show really surprised me, it had a good story that didn't feel rushed or slow so I was always entertained. There was a good amount of action to mix in with the character drama and general story. It was very lighthearted and comicalwith serious and emotional moments sprinkled in here and there. Basically it was very entertaining, I honestly never found myself bored with the show at all. However if echi is something that bothers you, this show isn't for you because there is quite alot of it. Personally though it didn't bother me the slightest...I found it funny how they used the echi for the most part in a comidic way. If you like echi this is the perfect show for you. Heaven's lost Property didn't leave me on a high note or anything but I really enjoyed it nonetheless.\\n\\n\r\nStory(8) The story in the show was executed very well. Like I said the show never had pacing issues so it never really felt rushed or went by slow. Most of the story is centered around Tomoki's (the main character) antics and what he does with his group of friends. Tomoki stumbles upon Icarus, an angeloid who acts as his servent. This is what makes the story interesting because she can practically grant his every wish and she lives to serve him. Tomoki however is a high school pervert who does anything he can to peep a girl nude even his friends, this is what makes the story interesting and very funny as well. The relationships between the characters work very well with the story and they act as one of the things that make the story really good. The story isn't anything incredible but it is very unique and entertaining all the same. While all the lighthearted activities are going on there is an over shadowing dark side to the story which helps keep the plot fresh. The last episode in particular really picked up in the action aspect and it was was very satisfying. As i said before the show is a comedy so there's alot of funny moments that will keep you enetertained all the way through.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation(9) I'm watching this in 2014 now, for something back in 2009 the animation is very impressive. All the colors are bright and vibrant but not overdone. The character designs are unique but not out of place at the same time. The two angeloid characters had very unique armor designes and they had a cool backstory to them. The action scenes rare as they come were animated perfectly. They were nice to look at and not over exaggerated. All the characters moved very fluently and smoothly so generally it just looked good. The show turns the characters into chibi's very often as well to overexaggerate comedy moments and just add a light hearted funny tone to the story. I do feel they overused the chibi thing a bit but nevertheless it kept the show unique and it worked good for the whole feel of the story. The wide eyed designs of the characters looked nice and the CGI effects looked good as well amd weren't out of place.\\n\\n\r\nSound(7) This goes without saying, the noises were crisp and clean and sounded good. Funimation outdid itself with the voice casting once again. I thought all the voices were cast perfectly and none came off as annoying to me. The opening track was very very good as well, it fit the show's light hearted tone perfectly and it was a beautiful song. The ending was very good as well and during the endings the show would play a music video type of thing to keep it different. The music didn't amaze me though, The music kind of faded in the background to me and i found myself paying attention to the characters and what they were doing. The music wasn't bad or out of place it's just not very memorable. However this is a small complaint at the end of the day it's not a big deal.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters (8) At first the characters didn't seem like much to me, they did grow on me alot though. Tomoki binds the story together with his perverted actions and brought alot of comedy. I could relate to him a bit too because I myself am a highschool student who likes peace and quiet. Icarus is very robotic so part of the story deals with her trying to be more human. This also comes off as a very funny element in the story and she can also be badass at times too. The other side characters work very well too. The show keeps its circle small and aside from Tomoki and Icarus there are 4 other characters. The show focus's the most on Tomoki, yes, but the side characters all get alot of screentime and are developed very well. One of the shows best qualities is the relationships between all the characters. Like any other show the characters have drama and of course this is very interesting without feeling clich\u00e8. As I said the supporting cast were all interesting unique characters with good funny personalities. They themselves are not incredibly compelling, but they are developed well and have good chemistry. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show alot. It didn't leave me on a high note and wasn't amazing but I was satisfied completely. The story was executed smoothly and had a good mix of drama romance and action. The show was very funny and lighthearted while having a unique feel to it. The characters had really good chemistry and I liked all of them. The animation was spot on and the voice acting was very well done as well. The echi didn't bother me and i found it to be funny most of the time, so if you're on the ropes about weather or not its gonna bother you it probably wont. It's not overdone to the point where the story loses quality it basically fits in perfectally. If echi is not your thing at all then I don't know what to say, it's all preference. Fans of comedy and drama will like this as well.\\n\\n\r\nI apologize for the long review :p but please give this a thumbs up if you agreed! (:\\n",

            "content": "Sora no Otoshimono has to be one of best made series for ecchi genera and much more. This series has good battle scenes, ton of parodies and some best though out joke about ecchi in general, good music, great character that have many level to them (why this series has some of my most favorite character in all anime), and a story, where creator will tease you with plot point and only give out so much information. In other worlds top notch story writing. That will make want more. Why there been two season and one movie only tiny bit over all story has beenrevealed. It's only fault lie in either people will find it can be too much or for me, it was that story has good pace but it little a bit of mess. \\n\\n\r\nTo say their one story to Sora no Otoshimono is lie. First all this is big mac combo. You have the normal ecchi comedy over done school boy pervert story with point fan serves episode. It is also comedy that parody ecchi humor. Instead this being ecchi comedy. Then we have the hidden social commendatory of slavery, weapon mass destruction, and dystopia. Then god/angel theme with a world bender to fantasy adventure plot line. Which is most of keep in the dark. \\n\\n\r\nThe character development is not really there for some cast but for those don't develop their persona are pretty well made and set in their role. But for main angel cast it's there. Over all character are well design. The main character is pretty manic, complex, and is a mess. You know what I mean once you get know him. He kind reflect story itself and how messy it is. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is real good and this where you will see main parody part of series. Almost every episode come with it own ending and that ending will reflect plot for that episode. The ending visual and song will be parody of what episode plot was parodying. There is range but most of parody are of anime, so you may not need know much about japan. (oh note: I review from sub point of view, I don't like dubs.)\\n\\n\r\nArt and animation is good. This series actual has over all potent joke for ecchi. The creator those not hold back nor hold your hand. Comedy and ecchi are reflection of each other in this series. I think creator trying make point with these to element about ecchi genera. I could be wrong this is pure conjecture on my part but that going on what I watched.\\n\\n\r\n I highly recommend this series. If see you my list, you know I watch a lot over years. I feel like i got enough under my belt to know what good. You at least try the 1st season. Warning as I said before, when it come to ecchi part, the creator here does not holding back. If you can't handle ecchi, then don't watch this series. But it's not only fan serves. It's has real fun fantasy adventure plot under it. I will say movie not as good but fault came from fact that I feel like they did not know how make movie or the original was made for other format first, like ova. The movie has story good like series but half movie was recap and part of it could this been more episodes.\\n\\n\r\n(Here another edit for grammar 08/17/2016)",

The plot is just mindbogglingly amazing, the characters are insanely funny, the artwork is superb, and the soundtracks are well chosen. Yes, Sora no Ototshimono is an ecchi which some viewers find despicable, but something about this anime, It just brings something to the table that other ecchi animes don't deliver.\r\nIf you got some spare time, go watch this anime. It made me laugh really hard and it will probably make you laugh as well (Butmake sure you have a lot of time because this anime is 3 seasons long.)",

I first watched this anime some time ago, I quickly loved it!\r\nSora no Otoshimono has the ability to keep people interested while maintaining the genre that people enjoyed. I don't see that often. It keeps its roots while still developing every character bit by bit.  The story can sometimes seem ridiculous and the characters don't always act fair but without that it wouldn't give you such a great immersion.\r\nAlthough I'd haveto say Sora no Otoshimono won't be for everyone. Far from it at that. But I would never say don't try it. You can quickly begin to love and care for the characters. And there antics can bring a smile on the worst of days.\\n\\n\r\nIts unique story warms hearts and I have a space for this anime in my heart. And thats why I give this a 9.

I taught the ecchi was a bit too focussed on male desires. And the romance was weird since its an on and off relationship, prerry much at one moment they like each other then they hate each other after a minute again etc. And there was a lack of the sci-fi promised genre, it'sbasicly in 2/3 episodes which i think is quite stupid but they did well on making the sci-fi the base and start working towards the romance/comedy parts. I would say this isn't bad but not really that cool i guess. \\n\r\nArt and Sound are Short. why? because you should check out atleast a bit to understand and it's diffucult to explain.\\n\\n\r\nStory:\\n\r\nThe story isn't unique at all and i have seen the same basic story over and over again but this one is the best of all those i ve seen. Because this accualy has a story and more parts of the story will come later on in the anime. Also small things like history of the exploring age will be taught to you. And the best thing of all. This anime isn't focussed on echhi but humor. which is most of the times not the case. There is use of fanservise but not as much as other ecchi anime's.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nNothing to complain simple style good enough great character arts but less work on the detailled work. \\n\\n\r\nSound: \\n\r\nhears fine nothing special good enough and pretty much nothing to say about it.\\n\\n\r\nCharaters:\\n\r\nGreat work Close to it's perfection. Good feelings expression and great work on the things the character likes. for example a girl likes bird. when she sees any bird she accauly reacts to it. and doesn't only interfere in a single episode but in the whole anime. Characters keep their habbits and reactions and have their personal feelings on the actions. Pretty good i would say.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nThis is the anime that has given me the most fun ever. Why? because this anime is random. Really random. From a festival to a gunfight. it's these random things that make me laugh and keep smiling. With fun jokes. and some extra romance. they did excelent. on the enjoyment.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\nA fun not to serious and random anime with good story and character design basic art & sounds. Recommended to Comedy lovers and Sci-fi lovers since that's where the story is based on. Romance lovers can come too since there is romance. Not for people who want serious things like Deathnote. \\n\\n\r\n8/10 because of the great work An ecchi anime did \\n\\n\r\nThanks for reading, any suggestions? send me a message. \\n",

That's when his childhood friend, Mitsuki Sohara, finds help from Sugata Eishirou, a senpai at his school, believes the dream must be of the new continent flying on the sky. Later that night, while waiting under the cherry trees for Sugata and his childhood friend, an angel called Ikaros comesflying down and his peaceful life changes from then on.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime is very similar to the Dears serie because of the fact that the main characters are maids and are made to please their masters' orders but even so the art and the fanservice are very good.\\n\\n\r\nIf I had to say something negative is that the faces of the characters are not well defined. Compared to other animes could be improved a bit more. I think it's the only thing I can complain because, for me, the story is original and the dialogue is not so bad.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are also good like Mikako that is a bit sadist and enjoy bothering Tomoki and Sohara. Another important character is Nymph, is a loli, selfish girl and has a tsundere nature. She's suppose to be completing a mission from her master in the sky but she will discover more things that she don't know as generosity.\\n\\n\r\nI wish all like this Anime as I did because it was the firs ecchi Anime I saw.",

            "content": "Ok. I had my suspicions when I started this show. I mean I've seen those animes where someone falls from the sky and serves the person she loves, I'm referring to Ah! My Goddess, but this is by far one of my favorite shows in the history of anime. From the very beginning of the show, I was all like, oh, Tomoki is just an average teenager who likes peace and quiet. Completely normal. NOPE. Couldn't be more wrong. He's the biggest pervert I've ever seen, and it shows throughout the season. So I'm wondering just how the heck a guy like him could befriendand bewitch an Angel like Ikaros to serve and love him. All I'm thinking is that he's one of the luckiest guys in the history of situations like these.\\n\\n\r\nStory wise, it's really good. It has one giant plot in the show, a good one at that, and a bunch of mini-stories in every episode, like in one of the episodes, Tomoki has to escape his house completely covered in panties. Funny, but the reason he has to escape is because they have a spell on them that causes them to literally explode if he so much as looks at them. So there are stories like that, and the final few episodes kind of revolves around the main plot.\\n\\n\r\nArtwork was awesome. The setting that the characters live in was really beautiful, small town with a giant cherry tree sitting in a giant field surrounded by forests and mountains, a perfect place to go and relax. Tomoki's character art kind of took me off guard because for at least half of the show, he's in a chibified state, mostly when those awkward moments in echii's come around, or when he's acting like a pervert. Girls on the other hand, all of them were drop dead gorgeous. Ikaros is my personal favorite. She's beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nI liked the sound effects in the show whenever there were action scenes, and the bouncing sounds whenever those \"That's what makes this an echii\" scenes come around. I liked all of the voice actors, there wasn't one character that I hated. Greg Ayres was perfect for his role as Tomoki, Brittney Karbowski (A personal favorite voice actress) had Ikaros' personality down to an art, all of the actors and actresses fit their characters perfectly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters, as I may have described a few to you before, are all funny as heck. Tomoki's perverted personality is what got me laughing over 3/4ths of the time alone, Ikaros had that lovable and sweet vibe coming from her the entire time, Nymph was a brat at first and I found her annoying, but as she kind of came into the show more and more I learned to love her, and Sohara and her Karate Chops have a place in my heart forever.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed this show entirely. It was probably the funniest thing I've seen since I watched Chobits. TV-MA might be over exaggerating a little bit, maybe a high TV-14 at maximum, but this was completely fine to watch, even with my 9th grade friend. That's just a little heads up for those who are looking and debating whether they should watch it or not due to the rating. This anime is completely awesome to watch, and those who wont watch it will most likely regret it if they don't give it a chance. It's probably the best thing I've watched this year next to Clannad and A Bridge to the Starry Skies.\\n\\n\r\nI hope this review helped.",

            "content": "This review goes for both Sora no Otoshimono and it's second season Forte. Sora no Otoshimono is one of the funniest series that I have  ever seen. This series is funny, can get serious at moments, has a terrific cast of characters.\r\nStory: I'll say this, Sora's ANIME has no real plot. Aside from the season finales and a few things that go on in between, there is no real story line. When I watched Sora I accidentally watched it's second season first having no prior knowledge of the first. I wasn't too lost and all the really important things that I needed to knowwere in flashbacks. If you really want plot you should read the manga. It's like the anime but with a bit more things to the plot. (Also the ending of Forte doesn't exactly go with the manga, everything else does as far as I can remember.)\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: I loved loved loved the characters in Sora. The Main Character is a pervert who really makes no attempt to hide it, but also has a heart of gold. The Angeloids are a very fun bunch. All of them are funny in their own way and have 1 thing in common, they're clueless.In fact all the girls in the Sora series was very well done, all of them were funny and enjoyable, from the cunning School President, to the Clueless Angeloid, to the Childhood Friend who keeps him in line, they always keep me laughing.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Overall the Sora no Otoshimono series was very good and one of my favorite animes. This anime was funny and well done, it has it's dark moments but always keeps you laughing and the lovable characters are just a joy. If you're looking for an anime series that will keep you laughing and you don't mind a little ecchi, or an anime that is just a good ecchi, or just a good ecchi anime in general, watch Sora no Otoshimono. (If you truly want more read the manga.)",

Good looking girls, A guy whos parents are never there, and for some reason he is living with all these girls usually arent 3-5 by the end of the series. The story though takes a different approach then usual by making the guy of the show a really huge perv. Usually the guy is all shy and feels weird when girls make sexual advances on them, but this guy iis obessed with girls boobs and porno magazines even having an episode in the second season where one of the characters burn his porno magazines and he criedhis eyes out.\\n\\n\r\nStory 7:\\n\\n\r\nThis show has the usual supernatural story that leads girls to end up living in his house because they can not go back to where they came from. I was never really shocked from the twists they where pretty much predictable. It is possible though too get into this story a bit because of the fact that these girls are cybernetic angels kinda an interesting topic.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9: \\n\\n\r\nThe art in this show was defiently very ecchi, yet it was drawn out very good alot of the time i was draw to this show because of how they designed the characters it might seem shallow but at times the story can be great, but if the design in the show is not great I usually do not feel like watching it.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9: \\n\\n\r\nThe soundtracks where actually pretty interesting in this show like the opening song, and the song that ikaros one of the angels sung \"falling down\" was also a favorite of mine\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 8:\\n\\n\r\nCharacters in this show where the usual guy who cant get any, tsundere, apathetic girl, bubbly chick, and the evil girl who looks nice on the outside. Some of the characters peaked my interest though cause the tsundere girl would often break character being a sweet girl, while the apathetic girl would finally start showing emotion after a long time, so on.\\n\\n\r\nMy enjoyment was an 8 because yes there was generic topics in this show, but hey watching boobies bouncing around which guy would not enjoy that  with a decent backstory of course :)",

            "content": "So, this is the second time that I have reviewed this show going back after I have dropped it before. What do flying underpants, a wish granting angel android, and a perverted boy have in common? This stupid show. It just feels like a pervert\u2019s joyride. An angel named Ikaros comes down from heaven and ends up with a perverted little boy named Tomoki. I believe he got this bad because of his grandfather. His grandfather would tell him a lot of perverted words of wisdom. \r\nThere are so many times this show goes overboard just for the fact that of fun. For example, pantiesflying into window ends up with him making whole garlands of panties, goes to a robot that was made out of panties\u2026\u2026 can you see where this goes? It just escalates from there. There is so much Ecchi in this show that you feel like drowning in it. A school life with a lot more ecchi then I would of liked in a show. And this is why I had dropped this show before.\\n\\n\r\nSure in each episode, Eishoro ends up talking about something historic or scientific that is supposed to pertain to the show but it doesn\u2019t. It feels like they are just trying to push more meaning into the story that doesn\u2019t have one. This has Magical Girlfriend written all over it. Even the name of Ikaros\u2019 program is a \u2018Pet class\u2019 and wears a chain and collar. Think of her as an Android and then think of Chobits\u2026 it\u2019s pretty much the same with characters popping up all over. Chi and Ikaros have very much the same sort of problems though if I explained it; it would be a spoiler for the most part. \\n\\n\r\nThe show would probably be very good if there wasn\u2019t all the ecchi stuff. It has a deep meaning behind it and I guess that might be the part of the show I missed in my first watch because it only really shows its true face in episode 7. Much like Elfen Lied, we have a darker side of the anime two. So I guess it\u2019s a mixture of Chobits and Elfen Lied with perverted wish granting powers. The bad thing about this is that it comes up so late in the show that it not only is it a big spoiler, it also ends up making the show look like a school life Ecchi up till then. Even after, it still looks like a school life Ecchi but at least it has more deep emotional reasoning behind me watching the rest of it.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is rather nice, actually rather beautiful. It is very clean and crisp, too bad it\u2019s also very ecchi (Sorry all those wanting to see the whole thing, nothing really naked though). The characters are\u2026 colorful at least. I see it like a perverted version of Comic Party in look and feel.  Instead of Comics, the Tomoki is crazy about panties and breasts. \\n\\n\r\nHaving said this, there are some good points. The characters actually seem a little human when they show the romantic parts and when the characters are not being fully perverted. The voices are pretty good and each one really fits the characters no matter what crazy emotion they do. The music is beautiful and without all the perverted things though the beginning song does get old when marathoning it. \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I did end up cutting the show short when I first dropped it. Would I ever watch it again? The answer to that is that I would probably have to hate myself to sit threw the torture that is the first few episodes to get to the good stuff but I might\u2026 ug\u2026. Now there is the OVA and Forte that I might have to do\u2026\\n",

            "content": "This show is awesome...seriously. This is mindless fanservice at its utmost finest. The jokes never get old, its just too damn funny.I mean, go try to find another anime where panties fly like birds...that's really original lol.\r\nAs in most ecchi animes, the story isn't really the strongest point, but it doesn't really need to be. The narrative successfully links the events together while also leading the viewer towards more hilarious fanservice! I suppose many of the episodes are filler-like, but towards the end the show takes a more serious and dramatic turn.\r\nThe art is wonderful, really. I guess that's to be expected of modern animethough, considering all the computer technology nowadays. Still, the colors are very crisp and clear and much attention to detail is paid. Of course, plenty of attention is paid on sex appeal, breasts, buts, etc. Is that bad? Hell no! Also, Tomoki is often drawn in a chibi version when he shows his perverted side. This adds to the comedy aspect by showing how lowly he's become, especially when he's being scolded. =D \\n\\n\r\nOn to the sound. Usually, i never listen to OPs and EDs, especially EDs. I just dont have the time for that. However, i did listen to the OP once and i think it fits the show pretty well. I don't usually notice a good BGM, just because they're so well integrated into the scene. Same goes for this anime. Voice acting is also very good. Emotions of the characters are expressed very well.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in Sora no Otoshimono are both unique and stereotypical. Let's start with Tomoki, our protagonist. This guy is nothing like I've ever seen in anime, ever. He's a no holds barred, all-out, crazy, horny, pervert. And he's perfectly fine with everyone knowing that. Very very refreshing to see such a unique and fun fun protagonist. Of course, there's also the sterotypical huge-breasted best friend who always beats up Tomoki for his perversion. And guess what? She just happens to be in love with him. Kind of a generic character, but hey, she serves a much more important purpose, being the victim of many perverted acts. The angelroids are interesting int heir own way too, but getting into detail would involve spoilers. There's also Eitarou, a guy obsessed with finding the \"new world\", and there's Mikako, a sadistic, coniving, student council president.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, this is a VERY VERY fun show to watch. The fanservice is executed with so much skill and precision, that it's simply breathtaking.The comedy always seems to find the perfect moment to get the most out of the viewer's reaction. This anime is definitely memorable!",

The characters and art style of this anime is top notch and will make everyone laugh\r\nProbably the most disappointing aspect of Sora no Otoshimono is the story. There really isn't a main story. This anime is basically a big filler but a very funny filler. The last couple of episodes try to contribute to the main storyline but it is a bit rush and most people won't like that. \r\nAIC is known for developing some of the best animations in the world and they don't disappoint here.Everything is crystal clear and Ikaros looks stunning and funny every time she steps on to the screen.  \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of ikaros, she's one of the many awesome characters that are in this anime. Tomoki Sakurai is another one and he is beyond funny. I think the only reason this anime made me laugh was because of him. He has some of the best lines I've ever heard in any anime. They are epic. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is really enjoyable. Anyone who is looking to watch a really funny comedy should definitely try this anime out. And anyone who is looking for some epic characters that will leave you wanting more needs to watch this anime.",

Well, I can not say the best as I've not seen all but one of the best at least. The story is fun and it takes a hold of you and doesn't let go. It has it all twists, perv humor, romance, character development, epic battles / action, sad moments that will make you cry and wanna punch stuff etc. The art is superb. It really is beautiful! At least for my taste! The music is amazing - arigat\u014d mr Motoyoshi Iwasakiand every other who had a part in making the amazing music. Oh, and I love Saori's voice, she truly was the perfect Ikaros! This anime has so many amazing characters I can't even name them all! Feels like I'm overdoing this review, but I can't really express how much I enjoyed this anime! BUT, there is one major downside which is why I am not giving this one overall rating of 10.\\n\\n\r\nAnime is superb, but after forte... especially Final my master could have been done much much better. Check out my review of the 2. movie. But really. Angeloid of clockwork + 3. season. That would have been the dream come true, but we got 1 great movie and one 50 minute summary which even left out the beautiful ending which we saw in the manga! I mean, what the heck! I really feel like the creators rushed it and I would have truly enjoyed the 1. movie + 3. season of this amazing series. But besides all that, watch it and read it. You must. You will fall in love with this amazing piece which is Sora no Otoshimono. Aishitemasu, mai masut\u00e2.",

Sora no Otoshimono is an echhi anime, but one of the few echhianime that has a good story accompanied with nice character development. The comedy is also awesome.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character, Tomoki, a normal high school teenager who also happens to be a pervert, sees a girl in his dreams who tells him about how she is trapped in the sky and asks him to save her. His senpai Eishiro Sugata, an intelligent bespectacled boy who is a member of the New World Discovery Club, is searching for a new world in the skies and finds out about a black void in the sky which is travelling along the earth. He finds out that the black void is going to be somewhere close to where they live. When Tomoki along with his childhood friend, Sohara Mitsuki, a busty girl who has a crush on him (clich\u00e9d as hell though), visit Sugata about Tomoki's dreams, he asks them to come to the site where the new world is going to be.  Somehow, the main character is the only one who can make it. He sees the void and out of it comes a busty girl with wings along with a lot of debris. He tries to save her but is saved by her instead.\\n\r\nThis girl is an angeloid called Icarus. She tells Tomoki about how he is her master and how she can grant any wish of his. The story follows the daily of life of Icarus and Tomoki along with Tomoki's friends. Somewhere later in the story a new angeloid is sent to earth and it is revealed that Icarus is actually a very important part of the new world because of which the new angeloid is sent to retrieve her. \\n\\n\r\nThe story is great, the comedy generally revolves around Tomoki's perverted desires. The art is nice. The anime is a pretty enjoyable anime and one which you can just watch without applying much of your brain. However, if you care a lot about logic, hate plot holes and stuff it might not be your cup of tea. Case in point, the time when Tomoki's house is destroyed but instead of asking Icarus, one who can even bend reality and make a whole day that Tomoki lived nothing but a dream and basically grant anything he wants like making ten billion yen appear out of thin air, to rebuild it, he  goes to live in the student council president's house.",

Hmmmm everyone else probably said everything about this anime already but the music is amazing, so are the character's voices because it matches them, and the characters are cool. Art is great . Well this story has it all, it has a good story which i find is pretty interesting with the synapse, angels, and if we're actuallyreal. It has a deeper plot aside from all the good comedy. The romance is cute also! But that gets better in the manga since the seasons didn't reach that far yet even though it does have some in the anime.",

Im going to review this in away without revealing ANYTHING from the story.\r\nSora No Otoshimono is the worst and the best anime I have seen.Story wise it seems pretty awesome and the twists are fantastic. The action is pretty good and it goes together with the story quite well. Then for about 85% of the anime its just Tomoki being a prev...and it take the story out of the anime..like for example there are some episodes that are not need that dont advance the plot ...like flying panties....and walking porno mags...also every girlbesides Nymph, has HUGE boobs...Thats not really needed. I could see maybe one or two grils with huge breasts. 3/10 episodes dont advance the plot and 7/10 episodes do, but its mixed in with hentai stuff thats not really needed. While the 3 episodes that do explain the plot are done perfectly and the romance in them are very well done....This is anime that might be worth watching for some, and down right horrible for other's. I enjoy it because of Nymph. She is my fave character and she kept me watch the hole first season\\n\\n",

Yes, there is a LOT of fanservice and it does go overboard with that, but that adds to the humor. And with the main premise being about the biggest pervert of all time getting, essentially, a Fairly Odd-Parent to do whatever he wants, you kind of expect these kinds of wacky and hilarious situations. But then the darker parts, with the people in the New World being the worst people in existence, really get to me- it makes for a reallygood contrast between the comedy and the seriousness.

            "content": "Seeing as I've been on the hunt for the past month or so for shows similar to Chobits, I've run into a lot of romantic ecchi humor shows. Most have been enjoyable, some have even been pretty memorable. While I can't say I enjoyed Sora no Otoshimono (Heaven's Lost Property, or HLP as I'll be referring to it from here on out) as much as CLAMPs take on sci-fi romantic comedy, it is certainly one of, if not the most memorable I've seen since.\r\nThe story seems generic enough, and for what it's worth, it really is. An overly horny high school guy happens across abeautiful but strange non-human female who devotes her entire existence to him from that point forward. And after seeing Ikaros, our resident strange non-human, my fears weren't exactly eased. A slave creature called an \"Angeloid\", she looks like a blend of Chobits Chii and DearS Ren.\\n\\n\r\nBut the show had one thing going for it right off the bat. The art is shockingly well done. I'll admit that I'm brand new to watching anime, Chobits was indeed the show that finally got me hooked, but in this short time I've noticed that these ecchi-centric series tend to have rather generic artwork. Not the case in HLP. Honestly, I'd say it's extremely close to the quality you're looking at in Clannad, which to date, has the best art in any romance anime I've seen thus far.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then came the humor. Once again, the ecchi genre tends to get a bad rap; I can understand that for the most part. There's a very difficult balancing act shows of the genre need to pull off. They need to have just the right amount of ecchi,  humor, and romance, and so far the only one that I've seen that pulled that off flawlessly is Chobits. And then there's HLP.\\n\\n\r\nHLP basically looked at that and said \"forget that crap\". And somehow, it worked out brilliantly. There are panty flashes, porn mags, and boob gropes all over the place, but it's the shows acknowledgement of this that makes it work. Almost every ecchi show I've seen has a panty buying episode. HLP? HLP has a flying panty episode. Yes. Flying panties, as in they literally jettison off of girls bodies, and flap away like birds (the scene that plays during the credits of that episode is officially the funniest thing I've ever seen). The \"male dresses up as a female\" episode? HLP steps it up by actually turning Tomoki into a girl.\\n\\n\r\nBut humor is only one part of show, and fortunately it has (once again) surprisingly well done character development, and most of it comes from Ikaros and a second Angeloid, Nymph. Really, you start to learn...well..everything about Ikaros once Nymph enters the picture. Til then the show introduces you to the generally generic human supporting characters. But with Nymph comes some of the most emotional scenes in the series, including one that is truly gut wrenchingly sad.\\n\\n\r\nAs far as the action scenes go, they're also pretty well done. It's here that Ikaros' very mechanical voice and nature shine. One of my main issues with her as a main character is that she never really evolves beyond her \"AI\" stage, even after the blocks that were supposedly keeping her that way are removed from her. But once those epic battles start, she starts to look and sound really cool. The best comparison I can make is KOS MOS from the Xenosaga game series, who I honestly feel was an inspiration for the angeloids in general.\\n\\n\r\nWhere the show does lack in is romance. It's here, and Ikaros does start to realize feelings for Tomoki, but unfortunately he never really reciprocates them. As usual, a couple of the other supporting girls in the show start to get feelings for him too, but they're met with the same neutrality. That said, the HLP movie actually shows us that Tomoki has the capacity and desire to actually fall in love, so hopefully we'll get a bit more of a romance in the upcoming third season.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I couldn't stop watching this show. Almost every episode it did something that surprised me, be that a flock of majestic flying panties, a particularly intense battle scene, or one of the emotional Nymph scenes. That, complimented with excellent art and a top-notch english dub easily put HLP into my top 10 of the genre. And if you're looking for a more light hearted, comedy focused romance, this'll likely turn into one of your favorites.",

            "content": "Review #7: Heaven's Lost Property\r\nStory 8/10 -- This rating might scratch a few peoples heads, but I can guarantee you that it's a valid score. The Angeloids are higher beings from another world, and theres actually a lot of subtle Sci-fi, mystery, and intrigue in this series. This is one of the few stories ive seen in the harem genre that  contains emphatic pain, not only towards the angels but to the humans as well. The beginning of this series was great foreshadowing, with the nature of ecchi deluding viewers from the actual story surrounding this world. Truthfully, danger awaits are protagonists, but itsalways played off by bountiful distractions, leaving a hidden intrigue for viewers who enjoy future problems in the story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 7/10 -- This show had pretty good color effects for 2009. It was bright, the backgrounds were nice, the comedy artwork was on point, and I didn't have to many complaints about visuals for this season. I would say that the show overused ecchi a bit, and I actually enjoyed Tomoki being his normal size rather then his ball form.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10 -- I loved the uses of multiple different songs in this series for the ED. The OP was a great soundtrack to listen to as well. The dialogue was pretty good, although i thought Nymph could have used more. There was a lot of comedic fun in this series, and that made the dialogue enjoyable as well.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10 -- The character development is pretty decent, but its better towards the ending. Ikaros changes more towards the end, which really makes Nymph the main Angeloid with depth in this season. I enjoyed the human relationship between Mikako and Eishirou, and they were pretty good supporting/main characters. Sohara was the weakest main character, which is common among childhood friend tropes. Her role was awkward and pretty cliche, but the human characters make up for the shortcoming. Tomoki did well for a harem protagonist. His perverse scenes were amusing, but I also liked his way of thinking towards others, and he slowly realizies theres more to life then quiet isolation.   \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 7/10 -- It's an ecchi harem anime. It's marketed towards young adults. However I enjoy the surprisingly good story this series offers, with angels dropping down from heaven, and heavens role truly being questioned multiple times over. What makes my enjoyment score drop for this series is how crazy the ecchi becomes. You have a storyline that can be well received, you have plenty of girls that have the popularity. This series did not need to focus on ecchi for majority of an episode to be enjoyable. The characters had good development, the girls were liked, and we already knew ecchi scenes would be coming, it's that type of anime. But again, that's no reason to take away from a good story, and it lowers my enjoyment. A better balance of plot and ecchi would have made this season better.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 7/10 -- The Story and sound were very good, with the dialogue being entertaining, and the music was top notch for 2009. Heavens lost property did a great job pushing things further and further, outside of the MC's comfort zone, and it ruined a quiet life anime with some mild action scenes that develop into important matters in season 2. The weakness of the first season is the overuse of ecchi to take away from the storyline and character personality. I found though that looking past that, while also looking deeper into the plot, gives a positive impression of this anime series, and season 2 nor the movies were disappointing to watch either. It's a solid 7.5 out of 10, a good example of what anime needs and doesn't need to be good or very good.  \\n\\n\r\n~Castawayz",

Well, one boy's wish is granted... sort of, in the form of a girl who fell from the sky! Now referring to him as her master, he uses his new servant to help him accomplish all the perverted escapades most teenage boys can only dream of getting away with, while trying to cling to the hope of regaining his beloved peace and quiet. \r\nArt (10/10) - Art comes in many forms. That's especially true in anime. Some are good, and some are... not as good. Inthis case, I felt the animation was atheistically pleasing to look at. Something else that I enjoyed was the little-transition between scenes. It was a nice, fluid change from the usual pan-up found in most other anime.\\n\\n\r\nSound (10/10) - I found the first few words of the Intro caught my ear. It truly spoke about the strangeness of one's own beating heart, and what causes it to do so. As each episode ends, one would expect it to cut to the credits with a nice song. This anime does, but also provides imagery of the highlights of the episode. You can really feel the emotions of the characters.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (10/10) - You have your typical high school pervert, childhood best friend, eccentric genius, somewhat sadistic Class President, and two mysterious girls with wings. Quite the cast.\\n\r\nThe main character drive, for me, was watching Ikaros try to adapt and become more human for her master while watching Nymph struggle with her identity and what she really wants in life.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (10/10) - One of the funniest moments of this anime is when Tomoki is being his usual pervy-self, and then has to pay for it, usually from the curtesy of his best friend. Some of the situations the cast is in is usually outlandish, but that's how things generally are in a Harem/Ecchi anime.\\n\\n\r\nOverall (10/10) - This show has been sitting on my Plan to Watch list for a while, and I'm so glad that I finally got around to watching it. Within the first episode or two, I knew this was going to be a favorite. I was sad, yet excited when this came to an end. But now, I can go and watch what happens next, and I'm sure I'll enjoy it just as much. \\n\\n",

The art style was decent, and the characters were sorta copy paste. But, I would be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying this show. Honestly, Where else have you seen an anime where the protagonist is in chibi mode half of the time? Flying Panties that explode on visual or physical contact? the overwhelming amount of perversion? That was the selling point here. Enjoyment. The music was really good, hypnotic, with the right mix of various musical elements. And aunique ED that represents every episode almost like a summary. If you want heavily involved heart-racing story and deep, psychological, and  provoking themes and ideas look else where. If you looking for a laugh, a fun time, and a some what generic plot you've come to the right place.",

They created a world which is a living masterpiece what you never want to stop.\\n\r\nAlso you will probably notice that one of the plot writers might be a drog addict... :D that would explain several episodes.\\n\r\nSo if you haven't start to watch the anime you have 2times 13 episodes ahead of you and one \"movie\" which was good but the I thought I will get 90min new story and not just 30min... so it was a bit confusing.\\n\r\n...........\\n\r\nAnd guess what happened now...\\n\r\nEvery fan was hoping for a season 3, but they decided to create one more movie and close the storyline.\\n\\n\r\nI really hope that the \"Eternal My Master -\" is just a teaser for the finaly movie and it was not the movie itself...\\n\r\nImagine that you build up a world with FULL of ideas and possibilities but someone picks out parts like a surgeon, those parts what the fans wanted to see. They add or explain something about/to it....aaand its over!\\n\\n\r\nIf I ever get the chance to send a message to the person who is responsible for this, the following link is a good summary of what I think now...\\n\\n\r\nhttp://weknowmemes.com/2013/11/fuck-you-gifs-the-ultimate-list/\\n\\n\r\nSo I try to pretend that this never happened and start to rewatch from the beginning. :)",

I have never been into the hard core fan service anime's, and from looking at the front picture with two angles, big boobs, and chains around their necks it was hard to look at this as anything else before i started. Although I had these preconceptions about this show, i was surprised that it felt much different from a normal Ecchi anime. \r\nEven though I stated that this felt different than a normal Ecchi, it still is an Ecchi.  But if anything, the most perverted episodes are the first few because of a strange obsessionwith panties. It never felt the same as a \"Kampher\", which has a bigger focus on the sexual activities of the characters. The Ecchi part of this anime is used in humorous ways that you tend not to see as often. They were funny and strange, but yet not too obtuse that it felt it could hold to a story. \\n\\n\r\nThough the show I got attached to the characters and their quirks. I could relate with the main character in many ways and it made it that much easier to enjoy the anime. \\n\\n\r\nThis is not a perfect show, but its one where you have to look past the pre conceptions that you may have and just try it out. I would recommend this anime to most people. Just dont take it at face value and explore the possibilities.",

            "content": "A story of a young high school boy wishing to have a servant whom he could care for, and it came true with an angel lifting him in spirit. Now.... it's time to look at girl's asses.\r\nI couldn't tell how I felt about watching this, I was disgusted, smiling (unironically), felt weirded out, and I felt bad. This anime couldn't tell whether to be a drama, love, action or comedic story. It can have all 4, but it lacks the potential. I will be talking about the Art, Genre, Characters, and the Story.\r\nArt: There are times when the art style is professionally made for actionand comedy, then most of the time it looks like a bunch of amateurs made a scene look boring. I wasn't too fond of the art style much, I also did not enjoy having the breasts of every woman 3 times bigger than their heads, it was easily distracting and loses focus of how serious some scenes show.\\n\\n\r\nGenre: There is easily three things that the Anime has, Comedy, Drama, and Romance. First off, the whole show was a whole comedic festival, but it didn't make me laugh once, rather, I did laugh, just not the way the show wanted. I'll get into why it wasn't funny at all when we get into the characters, but lets look over the drama. Hardly any drama, so why mention? Because there was a half of a season of one of the characters attempting to capture the fallen angel, but then there is troubling going on with the main character, as she grows a connection towards him and she doesn't seem to want to cause any harm. Another reason for drama is with the same character (who was trying to capture) going through troublesome times with her master. I'll get more into that later. Finally romance, there is a love triangle, two people try to find out what it's like to have emotions, it was boring and rushed over. Then there is action... I don't care for it.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: I would've gave this anime a 3 or a 4, but within half of the season, there was finally some character development and understanding of each character, let me describe the characters that show up the most.\\n\\n\r\nSakurai: An energetic, pervert who is desperate to see nudity off of women. He's the main reason why this whole show wasn't funny once. The development of this character is like any pedophile anonymous character. I wouldn't have mind if he was a pervert, if he were to have the right ideas, or not an instant idiot. Then it wouldn't be so bad, but instead I question why people like this character in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nIkaros: The story mostly revolves her facing herself and trying to act more human-like. Soon she is aware she is a weapon, but her master (Sakurai) denies her to use any source of violence against anyone. SO what does that leave her to be? An air head, quiet, and stubborn girl (not like a loli stubborn [yes, it's quite embarrassing to say loli], just stubborn as of making mistakes) As the anime moves forward, you kind of grow attach to this character, as she learns from her mistakes and tries to support everyone. But, the first half of the season is just her standing around and acting funny. Which didn't give me a chuckle.\\n\\n\r\nNymph: She appears within half of the season, no introduction, nothing knowing about her, she just showed up, eating a bag of chips. I thought it was lazy, and appalling that this is how you introduce the next side character to this story. She does, however, develop character and you finally understand her. Which is great and makes her a likeable character. I have nothing much to say, other than, she's a good character.\\n\\n\r\nSugata: At this point, these character share no interest whatsoever, they are just bland, boring, and backstaged characters who are there for fun. This character, believes there is a new world among earth, and wishes to explore it. However, we mostly get to see him goofing around in a serious manner,  he somehow manages to get alot of info through technology, which doesn't make any sense, and he always hangs out with the characters with no purpose, he just sits there, watches people. It's pointless.\\n\\n\r\nMitsuki: Another Bland and boring character, she is violent, nice, and has a crush on Sakurai. However, Sakurai always has a dirty mind while seeing Mitsuki, and it clearly shows, therefore, she becomes violent against him. It gets old real fast, and it feels pointless. Remove this character, and nothing changes. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nSatsukitane: The final character, and I must say, she is the most uninteresting character in this whole story. She's there because she is there. She is.... I don't know what she is, other than what I assume, she loves to play with people. That's it, and it's a piss poor job to try to bring up a character that is a woman and does absolutely nothing other than bring comedy.\\n\\n\r\nStory: There was no main focus the whole first season, it was just a montage of boring, pornish, comedic episodes which were cringy and facepalming. Finally, after Nymph shows up out of nowhere, things get interesting. The main plot is that the angels from above are trying to bring back Ikaros back from earth, but is challenging because she refuses, therefore it leads toward violence and drama. A few sub plots here and there, Ikaros tries to find the meaning of life as a human, and as well as Nymph. The story isn't big, but it's enough to create a decent show.\\n\\n\r\nUsually when I rate things a 5, I would've said it's ok to watch and I'm sure you'll probably enjoy it better than I did. In all of honesty, I disliked this show, I gave it a 5, because it showed characters and a plot. If you think you'll enjoy the comedy, then you'll rate it higher than I did. I won't recommend anyone watching this, if you are up for the challenge of watching this mix up of an anime, go ahead. I'm not going back to this one. \\n\\n\r\nThis anime is rated a 5, nothing more, luckily nothing less.",

            "content": "After watching this anime, I was surprised by its level of popularity. While it does not seem to be as popular as some other titles, I am quite surprised by its score and praise it gets all of a sudden. Maybe there is something I don't see, but I beg to differ. Whether you agree with me or not is up to you, of course.\r\nStory: 4/10.\r\nAn ordinary guy without any outstanding qualities suddenly ends up being surrounded by a bunch of pretty girls. That is the basic formula of any harem, leaving you wonder what's so good about this ordinary main character that makes girlsfall for him so easily if he is so painfully average and bland. What makes it different from other similar shows? Nothing. Mysterious girl, the main candidate for the average guy's love interest, with a few skeletons  in the closet and amnesia, and other girls - their purpose is to serve as decorations and fuel the main character's ego. Jokes were pretty questionable and fanservice-based, nothing new, original... or funny at the very least.\\n\r\nThere isn't much to say about this story because it follows said standard formula and there is nothing special or unique about the plot and it's pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 6/10.\\n\r\nNow, art in this anime is not bad, although the design of the main female character is cringe-worthy. The only character I found cute was Nymph, other characters were pretty forgettable in terms of character designs. The art style itself is cute, but somewhat boring and bland, if you ask me. I don't think art is a very important aspect, but I've seen better.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 5/10.\\n\r\nThere is one song I remember fairly well, performed by Ikaros. That was beautiful, but everything else was pretty forgettable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 3/10.\\n\r\n\"I'm apathetic and non-athletic.\" (c) Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.\\n\r\nAh, these bland characters that are hard to like due to lack of any sort of personality, isn't it easy to grow tired of them? Tomoki is the kind of character whose face you fail to remember, Ikaros has an emotional range of a teaspoon and it doesn't work as well as it does in Evangelion or The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Nymph is your typical loli and wait, were there other characters? What were their names again?\\n\r\nI personally liked Nymph as she, despite being nothing special, still managed to stand out due to having a relatively bright personality in comparison to the rest of the cast. And even she is not interesting enough to save this show.\\n\r\nSumming it up, this show has a ridiculously forgettable and boring cast, isn't it disappointing?\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 4/10.\\n\r\nThis show is incredibly boring. I couldn't get myself to laugh at any of this show's so-called jokes and gags, I failed to get attached to at least one character (I did like Nymph, but not much enough to 'like like' her, if you get what I mean) and when it was over, I let out a sigh of relief.\\n\\n\r\nI don't care for the manga or any other seasons, sequels or whatever else this franchise has to offer. This anime doesn't stand out, it doesn't offer anything interesting or worth mentioning. It's... something. And not in a good way. It's just as bland as Ikaros as her apathetic emotionless face sums up the very nature of this anime, Not a disaster, just an incredibly boring series that tries too hard to be more than it is in reality.",

            "content": "Started by reading a synopsis of this anime. It sounded interesting and good. Started watching the first season and liked it for the most part. The main characters pervyness and stupidity was too exaggerated for my taste but those parts were spread out enough that you could overlook it and the main story and the other characters held it up to some extant. Than I started watching the second season and it was so poor that I started clicking my way thru the episodes just 'cause I wanted to know the conclusion. The main \"protagonist\" devolved from the overly pervy and stupid kid he wasin the first season into what I can only describe as an unappealing, antisocial serial rapist in the making. 80% of the second season he's drawn as a three year old and is depicted as someone that anyone and everyone would want to beat with a baseball bat. I mean... it is an anime and one should consider that it's not meant for realism but no person in their right mind could have enough imagination to think that every one he ever meets wouldn't want to instantly kill him, much less that anyone would like him. It's really to bad because if they had made that main char just a bit less of an a**hole this could have been really good since the storyline was so promising but the \"protagonist\" drags the whole show down with him. \\n\\n\r\nI'll finish up with an example of how \"challenged\" the main char is: He has a really beautiful and sexy angeloid who is, in effect, his slave. She has told him very clearly that she would do ANYTHING for him. And he's is VERY aware of this. It's been made REALLY clear. And yet he seems to see her as part of the furniture and instead tries to peek on or molest every other girl but her and really trying to make everyone hate him. Doesn't really make sense now, does it?",

My goddess\u201d but it still has its own uniqueness.\r\nJust when Tomoki thought that life would be just peace and quiet like he always wanted it to be a weird and busty angel-robot like being came down in front of him. He knows that troubles will come his way and he should say goodbye to his peace and quiet life. \r\nThis series is your everyday harem story where a lot of girls fall in love with a single guy. The harem is almost complete with the childhood friend who won\u2019t admit her feelings and would always get violent whenever she\u2019sjealous, a small but very proud girl who bosses around, and an enigmatic girl who just want to stay beside her beloved master. It doesn\u2019t have a very serious type of main plot however that exactly works for the series. The amazing part is how magnificently the serious and hilarious parts are balance. This serious is extremely hilarious. Just when you thought that the scene is getting serious it would turn out to be a comical act and that absolutely works for the story.\\n\\n\r\nAlmost all the characters are extremely hilarious. Each of them has their own unique way of being hilarious. Surprisingly enough, they can really be helpful or serious in the most important moments. Even the apparition of the perverted grandfather of Tomoki is hilarious with his twisted and ecchi advises to his grandson. What\u2019s really amazing is that the most hilarious and weird of them all is also the most serious one in crucial times. He is the most perverted character I\u2019ve ever seen in the hundreds of series I\u2019ve seen. There are times when I question myself why the hell those girls fall in love it him.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation is not that great but it is still done well enough. The angeloids are interesting to look at. The voice of Tomoki is so damn perfect for his perverted and hilarious character.\\n\\n\r\nIn the beginning, it was quite boring but after watching episodes after episodes it was interesting enough and before I knew it I was already entertained.\\n",

I'm a really modest and calm person, but this made me literally scream at the screen so many times. The mind f**k going on these series is unbelievable. Exploding underwear ... checked. Metamorphosis gender f**king swap .. checked. Cancer ... double f**king checked. This anime took me very close to getting a brain aneurysm. Everything here is over the top (looping around to infinity).\r\nBut lets leave out the fact that this anime has too much ecchi, some quite lame ecchi jokes and a overly (absurdly) perverted protagonist.What is then left you ask? Actually not a bad (and not very original) story and a decent amount of character development, making this one of the toughest to rate anime ever.\\n\\n\r\nStory (5/10)\\n\r\nLot of stealing from different anime from NGE to Angel Beats to Chobits to DearS to Serial Experiments Lain to ... I could go on forever. Fakedeep info provided to the viewers makes it look really bad. All that left aside there is some beauty and a tragic side in the story, which again, gets suffocated by extreme perversion.\\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10)\\n\r\nThere were situations where they skipped so many frames it hurt my eyes. Very frequent use of comedic style was annoying and apparently a good way to cut production costs, some use of CGI (even on characters). Although there were really well animated scenes and the overall quality of art seemed consistent.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (3/10)\\n\r\nThe protagonist ..s**t, you have to see it... to understand it. Maybe its soo bad its good ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0). The rest were just plain horrible or awfully stereotypical. \\n\\n\r\nSound (8/10)\\n\r\nThe ED's were quite different from the usual, nice refreshing experience. As it is a comedy, some usual meme music was used to the scenes.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (4/10)\\n\r\nIt all came together into a horrible mess. It was painful, but not boring to watch.\\n\r\nA very sweet pain (  \u034c\u25e1  \u034c).\\n\\n\\n\r\nOverall rating 5/10. Enough to see where the plot will be going in the next season.",
