            "content": "There are times you get a reminder that no matter how many swords, boobs and magic you throw at a show it can\u2019t save it from the boring characters among it all. Welcome to the world of Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, where strong personalities are obviously illegal and main characters are inexplicably attractive to women. A 13-episode fantasy story put to screen by J.C. Staff and based on a light novel, \u2018DanMachi\u2019 can at times be an enjoyable experience if you shut your brain off. Action is served up in droves but in an equal share comes a blandcast and a setting that doesn\u2019t exactly shout out originality.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the journey of Bell Cranel. Bell is an \u2018adventurer\u2019, one who goes forth to the dungeon to seek fame and glory while putting their life on the line to do so. There he encounters the talented and renowned \u2018Sword Princess\u2019 Aiz Wallenstein. Suddenly he\u2019s love struck. With the help of his goddess Hestia, Bell sets out to conquer not only beasts but also his fear of approaching the girl of his dreams.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll put my positive first: This is that show that doesn\u2019t dwell on things for too long. Bell makes progression at a ridiculous rate but at least events keep coming and every episode feels fresh in some way. Different enemies provide a new challenge. Some of these enemies remind Bell of when he was weaker and it brings some painful memories. He has to overcome these grim reminders and apply the new knowledge he\u2019s learned to beat his enemies. Some also force him to change up his technique and get creative. For all its terrible harem schlock this is at least a nicely paced adventure. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the later episodes had some more interesting fights with more than just some crystals on the line. The cast also expands a little at that point, definitely to the show\u2019s benefit. At that point it really starts to feel like we are watching something interesting come together. There\u2019s also this sense that Bell is really fighting for something he wants and not simply hacking at things for no reason. That\u2019s where the praise ends in this department.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the problem: Bell doesn\u2019t truly earn anything in his line of adventuring. Everything that helps him become stronger is either served to him on a silver platter or overcome through some ridiculous newfound level of power. Through certain attributes Bell is rendered pretty much unbeatable and given an unfair boost of all other adventures. With that you say goodbye to almost all the tension this show creates within the dungeon. If something does hold Bell back it takes no time for him to find a way around it. Some methods he uses to do so are out of left field and not properly explained. When an explanation for them does arrive \u2013 very much out of the blue \u2013 it comes at a ridiculous moment. While it does excuse a lot of Bell\u2019s powerful capabilities, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. The plot armour simply stacks higher on him.\\n\\n\r\nAn early scene posits Bell as the runty adventurer who can\u2019t achieve anything and you get the sense that this could be a tough rise through the ranks. But before you know it he\u2019s making a name for himself in the field quicker than you know it. Why? Because of the power of love, which as we all know is far stronger than any physical material. How touching. Why couldn\u2019t his romance simply be a driving force instead of something that literally has the capability to bolster his stats?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story has redeemable moments, and is actually decently written, the characters reduce this show to a mess on many occasions. Let\u2019s start with our main man. Bell is just another run-of-the-mill anime MC. He\u2019s just\u2026 there. There\u2019s no background to his character to at least give us an idea of why he wants to take up adventuring in the first place. He\u2019s an example of the \u2018play it safe\u2019 approach to characters. By stripping him of any hard-hitting character faults he gains likeability but at the same time becomes a lot less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the pint-sized goddess Hestia who has a bust size and a temperament trying to outdo each other in volume. As annoying as her character can be at least her affection for Bell, compared to the rest of the female cast, actually makes sense. Bell is her only familia member so it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s going to be a little clingy. The writers play up this fact though to the point that it starts degrading her character. Hestia goes from someone looking for validation and purpose to being a paranoid stalker. A very, very annoying paranoid stalker. Top that off with an abundance of ridiculous fanservice involving her and it\u2019s a great way for me to stop taking a character\u2019s problems seriously. At times we get a peek into seeing a different side of her but it remains hidden in the shadows, presumably for that inevitable second season some time down the track.\\n\\n\r\nIt would also have been nice if the girl Bell desires so badly, Aiz, actually had some semblance of personality that makes her a worthy target of his affection. I guess she\u2019s a blonde, green-eyed beauty in questionably-designed armour who can swing a sword well. Sure she\u2019s got it on the looks front but the show never once makes me feel like she\u2019s worthwhile being the end goal of our main character \u2013 even taking into account the fact she\u2019s helped him out before in some tough situations. In defence of Aiz she at least isn\u2019t going completely head over heels for our white-haired friend. But in the face of that, she still feels like a soulless background object.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t want a character study out of show about fighting beasts in dungeons and levelling up. You\u2019d not be of sound mind to want that. I just want something entertaining with a cast I really want to cheer on. More personality and overall likeability could have been breathed into the group. My problems are only made worse by the fact that every piece of comedy missed the mark. Considering it makes up a large portion of the show you can imagine my frustration when some comedic intervals just dragged on and on.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nIf you value strong, interesting characters then this isn\u2019t for you. If you value the creation of original ideas and environments then this isn\u2019t for you. If watching a cardboard cut-out, danger-immune, overpowered main character whose presence makes every female he encounters flood the vicinity in juices of excitement while living with a four-foot god with a breast size that has the second half of the alphabet in its sights then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe more people keep dishing praise on shows like these, the less encouragement we give studios to adapt exciting and challenging material or create interesting original works. I guess what sells, sells. DanMachi isn\u2019t remotely close to the worst shows I\u2019ve watched but it brings absolutely nothing new to the anime table. There are less memorable moments in this series then there are words in its own title.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be nice enough to say that there were brief moments where I did sit enough and give it some attention. I can see why other people can enjoy it for longer periods than myself. There\u2019s flashy fights and some nicely animated sequences that even got a cynical man like me to sit up and say \u2018Yeah. That\u2019s alright\u2019. The story isn\u2019t going to blow your socks off but it never drags. The action keeps coming and the show rarely sits down for a breather. However I feel like a lot of the purpose of the world is kept locked away from us, which got on my nerves. There\u2019s characters pulling the strings from shadows but even as the show comes to a close we learn almost nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nI can stop hacking away at the show for a moment when it comes to the art department. With a J.C. Staff anime you know you\u2019re at least going to get some well-polished art and decent animation. Fights have plenty of impact and punch thanks to a combination sound and debris.  You can really feel the weight behind every sword swing, fist flying and rock scattering. The fights are clearly the show\u2019s strong point and the technical side of things have gone a long way to achieving that. \\n\\n\r\nSome may find entertainment in the fight choreography - a very fair point - but when a particular outcome always feels certain then I can\u2019t put myself in that boat. There is virtually no interesting complications character-wise. There\u2019s catering for every character trope imaginable. There\u2019s fan service ready to leap out at you from every corner. For everything that DanMachi does right it seems to do two other things wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIs it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? I still don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t know if I want to hang around longer to find out the answer.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe easiest way to sum up Is it Wrong to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon, or Danmachi for short, was eloquently put by Youtuber Demolition-D as \u201cSword Art Online: Fat-Fucking-Titties edition\u201d. Who am I to argue with such a flawless summation? There is no question about what Danmachi is; it\u2019s an otaku-pandering, self-insertion, video-game-inspired LN adaptation. The real question lies in whether you will love it for what it is, or hate it for what it is. In case you haven\u2019t guessed it by now, I fall into the latter category. This shallow, ridiculous, and remarkably unoriginal work is a good exampleof everything wrong with anime today. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Bell Cranel is an adventurer; someone who explores dangerous dungeons and fights monsters for a living. He and his \u201cgoddess\u201d, which is basically a glorified manager, Hestia, make up the smallest \u201cfamilia\u201d in all the land. This is the story of Bell winning every fight he\u2019s ever been involved in one way or another, making every girl he comes into contact with fall in love with him despite his obvious lack of any charisma whatsoever, and gaining special abilities that nobody else can use for no discernable reason. In other words, it\u2019s your standard LN adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nDanmachi\u2019s plot is what you get when you take SAO\u2019s plot and crank it up a notch on the pandering scale. MORE fanservice. MORE blood. LARGER harems. MORE white-knighting from the protagonist. DOUCHIER side characters to make the protagonist look good by comparison. And, of course, LESS actual substance. It\u2019s seriously like someone looked at the already stupid LN video game formula and said \u201cHmmm, how do we make this even harder to take seriously?\u201d But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let\u2019s start with the first reason Danmachi\u2019s plot is bad: plot armor and melodrama. Much like a battle shounen, it is painfully obvious in any video game LN adaptation that the MC is never actually in any danger. However, the show spares no expense in convincing you that he is using the cheapest tactics possible. Last second saves? Check. Asspulled power ups? Check. Deus ex machina? Check-aruney. The entirety of the plot consists of Bell and the other main characters being put it perilous situations that even the most na\u00efve of viewers can recognize will be resolved smoothly at the last second. Over and over and over again. It\u2019s bad writing, it\u2019s repetitive, and it\u2019s not entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s at this point in the review that I realize there were so many things wrong with the show that I don\u2019t even know what to talk about next. This may be a bizarre order of doing things, but now let\u2019s talk about Bell Cranel; the protagonist. Dear. God. What an annoying, insufferable, shallow, clich\u00e9d, gary-stu, self-insert, AWFUL character. When you talk about characters who might as well be literally Gandhi, you can go ahead and put this saint at the top of the list. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING would ever cause this guy to do something wrong or immoral. People can betray him, steal from him, assault him, whatever; he just takes the abuse like a proverbial Jesus Christ and instantly forgives all wrongdoings. After all, they wouldn\u2019t want to give off the impression that he is human or anything! Real people don\u2019t have flaws or negative emotions, right? It\u2019s SO much more interesting to have an idealized concept of all that is good in the world without an ounce of moral ambiguity so that otakus can fap to fantasies of the hundreds of sex objects that flock to his holy cock! Oh, and you better believe that he has special abilities that nobody else in the entire world has! It\u2019s not enough that he\u2019s the most righteous organism on planet Earth, but he also has a super special power that enables all of his skills to be as high as they possibly can AND enables him to level up faster than anyone else who has ever lived! Now, I want you to guess the explanation they give for why this makes sense; this is their GENIUS explanation for why Bell has this one-of-a-kind ability that makes him the most special person in all the land: BECAUSE HE\u2019S IN LOVE. \u2026OHHHHH! WELL THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE! FUCK. I mean... just\u2026 fuck. I won\u2019t even question it. In conclusion, Bell sucks. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the trend of shallow, awful characters continues with the rest of the cast. Let\u2019s start by addressing the elephant in the room; Hestia. Fucking. Hestia. *Sigh\u2026 Just\u2026 why? I must be the ten-billionth person to ask this, but what the hell is the obsession with her? She is no different than any other 1 dimensional, big-boobed, harem-fodder nobody in a slutty outfit that allows us to instantly identify her as a sex-object, as if we wouldn\u2019t have figured it out anyway. The absolute best description you can give about Hestia is that she functions as comic relief, and I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s very funny. That brings us to Lili, the other 1-dimmensional sex object who occupies the loli, furry, and tortured fetishes all at the same time. Impressive writers. Very impressive. Fetish writers around the world will have to come up with an answer to that. Maybe if she was also a robot-childhood-friend? Anyway, I\u2019m not even going to mention the rest of the harem since they are completely one-dimensional and indistinguishable. Let\u2019s also go over the nameless side-characters; I feel the need to bring attention to the fact that Bell is the ONLY adventurer in the entire world who is not a tremendous asshole. The \u201cvillain\u201d adventurers have no depth at all, of course, but they are still made out as such blatantly awful people in order to FURTHER drive home the fact that Bell is Jesus. Not only is this lazy characterization, it\u2019s also blatantly black-and-white morality, which makes the show require even less thought. This is one of the worst character casts since, well, Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also take a moment to discuss how incredibly creative the monsters in this show are. Danmachi brings us such breathtaking and original monster designs such as, a bunny. A wolf. A minotaur. Oh, and who could forget the floor boss, \u201cliterally a titan from Attack on Titan\u201d? Truly masterful creativity from these animators. It\u2019s clear that a lot of work went into this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the paragraph where I planned on talking about how misogynistic this show is and how distracting the constant fan service is, but do I really need to give you that whole spiel? I already briefly talked about this stuff, and I feel like it\u2019s so obvious why these aspects of a show are flaws that I shouldn\u2019t need to explain it. Women with the obedience and dedication of slaves and no complexity whatsoever? It\u2019s every otaku\u2019s dream! And that\u2019s precisely why this show is going to make a ton of money.\\n\\n\r\nI could keep going. Really, I could. I could talk all day about what an awful betrayal of the basic fundamentals of writing this show is, but I think you get the idea. The reality is, a lot of people are going to like this show. A large percentage of anime fans are not at all bothered by anything I just mentioned, because for them, a self-insertion work is all they need. That\u2019s fine and dandy for them, but from my point of view, this show and all shows like it are cancer. Danmachi is the antithesis of the clever and intelligent shows that made me become a fan of the medium in first place; it\u2019s a brain-dead, effortless advertisement for the LN that ends incomplete. If you liked SAO or any other similar LN video game adaptation, you\u2019ll love Danmachi. Everyone else? STAY. AWAY. Far, FAR away.\\n",

            "content": "Danmachi is a textbook example of an anime that is truly a guilty pleasure in its own right. It doesn't have the most impressive writing, there are tons of clich\u00e9s and fanservice, and the pacing is sometimes questionable but even so it never ever fails to be entertaining, which is something I can't say for most anime.\r\nDanmachi follows a popular trend in recent years of having a setting that takes place entirely within an MMORPG game world. The difference this time however is that... it actually doesn't. Instead, the story takes place in the characters' real world, but their real world functions like a game.Adventurers gain experience points, earn loot, level up, gain skills and magic etcetera, but it all still takes place in their own actual reality. There is a magical dungeon which adventurers go to in search for treasure in order to make a living for themselves. They have to fight the local monsters found inside the dungeon in order to get the loot to drop, and in the process they level up, gain experience and become stronger. Pretty simple. It's a quite fresh take on what is otherwise a somewhat overused concept in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when a young rookie adventurer named Bell Cranel one day gets his life saved by a female swordmaster within the dungeon. Her name is Ais Wallenstein, a quiet, airheaded yet very powerful woman whom Bell instantly falls in love with. He sets a goal for himself to become stronger so that he one day might be worthy to stand beside Ais as an equal. Upon doing this, he gains a unique ability which makes him gain experience points at an unbelievable rate as long as he stays true to those feelings of affection.\\n\\n\r\nBell is an extremely shy and innocent boy, but also a very passionate one. What I like about him is that he actually feels like a real human being. He's not a typical self-insert imbalanced protagonist like Kirito (even if they do have the same voice actor), nor is he a generic shounen lead relying on nakama power. Rather he comes across as a very kind-hearted person who truly cares for those he's close to, and will do anything to help them in any way he can. He's someone you can genuinely relate to and cheer for during his struggles, and given the nature of Danmachi's dungeon crawling oriented storyline, that's a pretty important factor.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead on the other hand would be the poster girl of the 2015 anime fanart community, namely the illustrious goddess Hestia; perhaps the only character ever who somehow ended up more famous than the series  which she actually comes from. There are numerous reasons for her insane popularity outbreak. For one, she's an oppai loli, which is an incredibly rare sight in anime regardless of series, but she's also an incredibly energetic, fun and loveable genki girl who keeps breathing life into the show and makes it interesting for the viewer. She's madly in love with Bell, but she doesn't try to hide it any way whatsoever. She keeps dropping hints everywhere that she just wants him to push her down already, but of course Bell doesn't pick up on this very well\u2026 because you know, protagonists in anime don't do that for whatever reason. Lastly of course there's the unmistakable outfit and boob string she wears which took the internet by storm so hard it became an actual fashion trend in real life Japan, but I'm sure you know all about that by now. Anyway, as a goddess Hestia is the leader of a \"Familia\" which operates more or less like a Guild in your typical RPG, where Bell is the only other member, and thus they spend their lives together in a rundown church, barely scraping by with what little money they can earn. Watching the pair of them living their unorthodox lives together never fails to make me smile.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's half a dozen other girls as well, either side characters or main characters introduced later on in the story who also conveniently enough end up falling in love with Bell (shocking, I know) so Danmachi is definitely a harem in the end even if MAL might not have it tagged as one. That being said it doesn't really focus on the harem elements all that much; it's mostly a secondary factor. The main attention is pretty much always on the adventuring aspect itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot progression of Danmachi is fairly straightforward. It basically follows Bell's struggles as well as how his relationships progress with the other adventurers he ends up encountering during them. You can probably imagine what a shounen adventure anime about RPG dungeon crawling is like, and that image is probably dead on as far as Danmachi is concerned. What I really like about it though is how it manages to present the dungeon as an environment. It actually feels threatening and ominous the deeper you get inside it. Have you ever ended up in a zone that is way too difficult for your character's current level when playing an RPG, and you can't manage to find a way to get back out alive? I mean in the kind of game where you only have one life, or at least you really can't afford to die? That's kind of the same feeling as Danmachi manages to give off to the viewer. As a result, the harder fights in the story feel awfully tense and relatable to any somewhat experienced gamer watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptation-wise, Danmachi is honestly pretty rushed as it spans a whole 5 light novel volumes in just 13 episodes. Yet despite that I never really felt like it was too much of a problem. Somehow, someway even from an anime-only standpoint the plot feels perfectly coherent and understandable. In fact as far as enjoyment value goes I'd even say I liked the anime *more* than the novels, because a) the fight scenes come across better animated, and b) Hestia's character is *way* more likeable in the anime. Yes, there is a lot of content from the novels that is skipped, but it feels like it didn't hurt the overall story very much to leave it out either, so it works out anyway. The only thing the anime occasionally lacks is some proper explanations of certain skills' and items' functionalities, but other than that I don't have a whole lot to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, Danmachi is far from a masterpiece, yet given the premise I think it delivers a lot more than most people probably expected coming into it. The story has most definitely been done before, but Danmachi adds its own twist to it and more importantly it does it *well*. It goes to show that with proper execution, a time-tested concept is still perfectly viable, and as a result it provides an anime that always leaves you with a smile on your face. Call it generic or shallow or whatever, but that doesn't change the fact that it's easily one of the most entertaining anime of the year thus far. And really, when it all comes down to it... that's essentially all that matters.",

My Breastia Can't Be This Cute\r\na.k.a. Not SAO \r\nis the latest anime to follow the video game trend that's become increasingly popular within the anime medium. These video game type series, usually MMORPG based, have gotten so commonplace in the last handful of years that they're starting to form their own sub-genre altogether, in a similar fashion to the \"moe/cute girls doing cute things\" craze in the mid-2000s. With an easy premise to understand, little to nothing tocomprehend story-wise, and a \"turn your brain off\" level of entertainment value, DanMachi was tailor-made for mainstream success. But whatever integrity it may have had was lost somewhere in the creases of blue boob ribbons. If Maslow's Pyramid were ever accommodated to show the level of quality a title holds, DanMachi would presumably fall somewhere in the lower segments. This isn't to say that the show doesn't retain some sort of value, but in the bigger scheme of things, it's as significant as the crusty end slice of a loaf of bread. \\n\\n\r\nBrief synopsis: Set in a world that functions and operates like an MMORPG, we follow Bell Cranel, residential pussy protagonist and one in many self-proclaimed \"adventurers\" that strive to become the best of the best. These adventurers are aided by Gods/Goddesses who descended from the heavens to live among them. With one God/Goddess being the leader, many adventurers join them to form a guild (or for modern day standards, they're essentially a gang). After a chance encounter with another adventurer named Aiz \"no personality\" Wallenstein, or better known the world over as the \"Sword Princess,\" our protagonist is motivated to become a better adventurer, if only for a chance to woo her over in the future. With the aid of his Goddess Loli Big Boo\u2014 Hestia, he sets off on his journey to do just that. \\n\\n\r\nDespite what the paint-by-numbers premise would have you believe, DanMachi doesn't seem to understand the construct of its own narrative. Beyond just meeting regulatory standards, the actual story and content itself never quite mesh. It tries to tell a coming-of-age tale, but our protagonist is never shown going through any of the proper stages of character progression usually associated with this kind of narrative. Instead of seeing him make mistakes to later learn from them, all of his conflicts are overcome by the writers splooging out dues ex machinas at every given turn. His advancements aren't earned through hard work and determination but are simply handed to him on a silver platter, making him yet another \"chosen one\" figurehead who's nuts haven't dropped, yet finds himself winning every battle like he's the spawn of Guts and Chuck Norris.\\n\\n\r\nWhy rally for a protagonist if the outcome is always the same? Why portray him as a struggling newbie when he's merely going to gain powerful abilities and weaponry without any foreshadowing towards it? The show quite literally writes in a new power-up every other episode (no I'm not kidding, see spoiler section below), so by the time we're at the halfway point, he's practically outpaced most of the seasoned adventurers set in the same world. This could have been done in a more believable fashion had they given any of sort of proper explanation behind these events, but DanMachi makes no attempts to do so. It shrugs off all accountability and goes back to dangling boob strings like a set of shiny car keys to keep the audiences distracted from the underhanded ploy taking place. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the show does have going for it, however, is the setting itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of DanMachi doesn't waste time debuting its features, with a medieval/high fantasy inspired architecture, it creates an interesting subculture, being anachronistic in its implementation, yet obtuse concept-wise since gaming mechanics are treated as much of a central pillar as its Middle Ages inspiration. Since the game aspects are as much of a part of real life to the inhabitants of DanMachi's universe, it's quite easy to buy into the world from the get-go. There's a weird amalgamation of game physics and natural world properties that the show fully embraces; it's grounded in our universe but slightly left-of-center given that game stats and leveling up is treated with the same sense of normalcy that gravity is. This includes adventurers that have to kill monsters to generate income and possibly to keep regular civilians safe. When they defeat these monsters, gems are left behind from their carcass (similar to most MMORPGs). And while the world mechanics and how things function were never explained to any reasonable amount of detail, the implied base knowledge that most viewers would have going in as to how these games work made it feel suitable despite its tendency to underwrite the parameters of its fantasy elements.\\n\\n\r\nDoes the prospect of killing monsters and taking gems out their hides for a line of profession make sense? Well no, of course not. But was it fun? Yea, it sure was. For an anime that borrows its world functions from video games, DanMachi accomplishes what it had set out to do. It didn't place any further foresight as to how the macroeconomics of its world operates but that's fine since no one was expecting it to do so in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was expecting, however, was better pacing, to be more specific, pacing that wasn't the equivalency of the show trying to belch out the alphabet in one breath. After the introductory episodes (1-3) in which the show maintained a steady pace, it then began to rush through plot points and character introductions at breakneck speeds. Where we were initially given a few episodes to establish the person's backstory, personality, and motivation, the show later attempts the same kind of effort in just one episode. It's as if the show had plans for 2-Cours and was later informed by the studio heads that they canceled plans for the 2nd season, and in a state of panic, the creators condensed everything in its screenplay into whatever schedueled episodes they had left. It's jarring, to say the least, doubly so when plot points are whizzing by without any proper setup or payoff. Shit sorta just... happens. \\n\\n\r\nBut what did have staying power was a pair of underage sweater puppies. The kind of visual eye-candy that's predestined to overshadow the rest of the characters involved. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of DanMachi is of your garden variety, with many having indistinguishable personality traits from other shows. Our protagonist, Bell Cranel, is your typical dense bishounen beta-male who always strive to do the right thing. The kind of boy scout character that you just want to strangle repeatedly for his unrealistic amount of idealism. And like most protagonists of this ilk, he too has the uncanny ability to attract every female character in the series for no real reason whatsoever. But he isn't the one that the show would be remembered for, that honor lies with Hestia. \\n\r\nIn the same way that Yuno Gasai is more popular than the show she's a part of, so too is DanMachi's mascot, Hestia. Infamous for her boob ribbon, Breastia has become the subject matter of many fan arts, sending manchildren the world over clambering for their body pillows. With a bubbly personality and an extreme infatuation for our pussy protagonist, she's ideal power fantasy material for anyone that chooses to self-insert themselves into the show. The only \"depth\" found here is in the endless cleavage birthed from her unnaturally huge milk jugs. A character who's only purpose is to serve as someone's 2D desktop waifu. But even this cheap trophy-wife model offers more to like than the show's designated love interest. \\n\r\nAiz Wallenstein, the girl of Bell's affection, does not compute emotion. With the personality of a brick wall and the combat ability of a one-man-army, she's mostly just an idolized Mary Sue placed in the story to be Bell's object of admiration. Outside of that, her nonpresence has made her nothing but a goal for Bell to reach. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is mostly forgettable tag-along members that fall into one of three camps:\\n\\n\r\na.) another female for Bell's harem\\n\r\nb.) another female for Bell's harem\\n\r\nc.) Welf Crozzo, the one trick pony\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to how underbaked the character writing was, the production as a whole also underperformed.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of DanMachi is a mixed bag of passable to awful. There are moments where the show boasts decently-choreographed action scenes that get you pumped up, only to be followed up by jarring CGI monsters and choppy animation. This lack of consistency can be contributed to J.C.Staff's workload, as they were also adapting Shokugeki no Soma during the same period they worked on DanMachi, which could have resulted in an improper allocation of manpower. The art, for the most part, was appealing, with suitable color choices that made the landscapes and characters pop. The peppy tone in which the characters moved and carefree disposition in how its world was colored to life helped compensate where other departments failed. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack was concerned, there isn't much to say. The opening theme is your standard j-pop track, far from distinctive when placed in a crowd, and could easily be replaced without making so much of a difference. And like most medieval fantasy shows before it, this too has a very standard soundtrack, using all the bells and whistles you'd expect from something trying to portray that period. That basic Celtic music in pub/Inn settings and those usual orchestral choir sections during fight scenes. It's all very standard. And that's basically DanMachi in a nutshell, a show trying to portray things it can't fully grasp and coming off middling because of it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n****SPOILER SECTION******\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the erratic pacing and contrived plotting, every other episode of Danmachi has the main character receiving a power-up of some sort. 1st we find out that he has \"unlimited potential,\" in other words, he's a borderline overpowered beta-male. And then, only two episodes later, he's handed another powerful weapon that he never earns. By the 5th episode, he gets a book that conveniently teaches him fire magic. And if that wasn't enough, he gets an ability to KO any opponent as a last ditch final attack only a few episodes after. And this trend of gaining a new advantage never stops either, happening all the way up to the very finale of the show, robbing the purpose behind even creating a coming-of-age story. The show actively fights against the idea of earned rewards. And to put the icing on the shit cake, we find out he's a Demigod as well, as if being plot armored and overpowered wasn't enough of a buffer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there were introductions to people that amount to nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, characters like Welf Crozzo was given a backstory, motivation and character introduction within one episode just to serve the role of a plot device. A character whose entire purpose in the narrative is to be Bell's blacksmith, yet is marketed as a defining side character despite the rushed-job given to indoctrinate him into the group. This isn't just an isolated incident either, as every character introduced after the third episode mark is simply pushed off an assembly line with no time given to even let the \"archetype\" that is their paint to dry. \\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, you're not watching this because it has something to offer, you're watching it because there's nothing else to do. \\n\\n\r\n****END OF SPOILERS****\\n\\n\\n\r\nGoing into DanMachi, all I expected to get out of it was easy-to-consume entertainment, and that's precisely what I got. Because of its simplistic story and surface-level depiction, I never felt frustrated watching it since the show never gave me a reason to care, to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nWith DanMachi, what you see is what you get. It's a show that isn't trying to be more than what it is and is honest about that. And while that's a commendable attribute, it just isn't enough to be anything more than just that. It's easygoing content that offers nothing else when it's all said and done. DanMachi is the intermission title you watch before watching your next \"must watch\" series. An anime that will forever be remembered for a pair of loli boobs than it will for anything else.",

            "content": "Danmachi is an anime made to be simple. First of all, you won't see anything complex here. I see it as one of the budget anime, where there's nothing special about it, but it sells. It feels like sao season 3, just with more fan service. The purpose that I've found of Danmachi, is to serve as a passtime, and relaxation after you've exhausted the list of must watch anime, or if you want something \"casual\".\r\nRight at the start, there is a narration, that quickly shows you a bit of how the world works. Later on, in the first episode you will of course findout more.  What you will be finding out is, that that world is basically an RPG. It doesn't say anything about this being a game, but it simply works like that. People that aren't gamers probably won't understand most of the stats, leveling and item thingies. There are adventurers, that follow certain goddesess, which lost their divine power, just to have fun with mortals. The purpose is to conquer the Dungeon that is in the center of the world, and beat all the bosses. Doesn't sound like anything special, does it? Feels like you're watching someone else play an MMORPG, since everything is very easy-going. \\n\\n\r\n*Minor spoilers in this paragraph\\n\r\nThe adventurer that we are following is Bell Cranel. He is a guy that is naive, wants to be a hero, good mannered. But he's STUPID. The first scene we meet him, is when he was being chased down, just to see him soon saved from the strongest adventurer there is, that is supposedly a female. After being saved, he falls in love with her, and his motive is, I MUST GET STRONGER JUST TO REACH HER. Later on I will talk more about her. Soon after we meet his goddess, that is Hestia. I can describe her very quickly. Loli, with boobs, and throughout the entire series, you will only see her going after Bell. This serves to stop Bell from ending up with anyone. Hilarity ensues, except i didn't find it that funny, because it's the most stupid love triangle. Instead of bell going for the one that is extremely caring for him, he chases the strongest female, that turns out to be an airhead which we will see later on. And because it is all like that, the dialog is extremely stupid, leading to nothing. If they're not talking about adventure, they're talking about how the sky is beautiful or something like that. Another stupid character he meets, his supporter, living in the guild with the most ridiculous motive (more wine!). She has a very inconsistent personality. At first she wants to scam Bell, for his items. She accidentally falls down, the weapon gets out, and miraculously, that happens in front of a good character related to Bell. Cheap trick just to get the supporter some forced character development. Bell soon gets it back, without him noticing anything, 'cause it's Bell! Soon after witnessing her betray him again before his very own eyes, and she tells him that she already betrayed him once before, Bell forgives her, risks his live to save her, and the harem increases. On the question why? He answers that he didn't know (but he does! The writer told him, that he will gain a new motive; protect thine friends!) Most of the characters are plot devices that lead to a boring story.\\n\\n\r\nBell cranel has a Premium account, and he's the only one. He's the chosen one, and while the world seems very balanced, Bell with his unstable personality, manages to do great things, and beat monsters, that realistically speaking, if the world is based on stats, his weapons should just break. What's the point in stats and leveling, if it doesn't even show how powerful someone is. But he gets an ability, that makes it impossible to lose. Literally impossible, even though it is not instant. He's just beating everything through out his screams, that sound really good. He isn't a chicken Gary Stu like i describe him, he first falls, and than comes back, it isn't like he's god mode walking through everything. He also sees invisible people because he feels their eyes on him, perfect logic. Premium account, or hacker? You decide! \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are very good, not anti-climatic, they also have very nice music, and sounds, and are also animated extremely well. There's even a lot of blood going, and you can feel really well how the monsters get sliced up. The music is really epic, but the opening is just, no. It feels like it is for some slice of life show. It should sound more adrenaline pumping and exciting not like this. The music is at it's peak in the fights as i mentioned. And this is one of the few anime where i really enjoy the fights. Even though they're just shit Bell has to go through. However, the art and character designs are not well done for 2015, but they aren't terrible. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't talk about all the characters, since most of them exist just to be there. Nothing to talk about them, since they don't do much for the plot. Even though it is all cliched, by my point of view, i usually don't like this stuff, and would rate this even lower. The only special thing about Danmachi is that it is not boring to watch; it's so easy-going with many flaws.  It's like so simple, that it is fun in the same time, it gives off some kind of a nice feeling. If it is nice why is it only 4? Because the characters, are mostly annoying, and the story is just shit Bell goes through, without him receiving any character development.\\n\\n\r\nI've just stated in this Review mostly how I feel about it. It is of course possible for people to enjoy this. Since it is, like I mentioned, very simple. If it isn't objectively good, it doesn't mean it won't be fun. With being simple, and the way the pacing is easy-going, together with intense battles, there is no sin if you enjoy it. It doesn't try much to be what it isn't, and I didn't give 4 since it failed, rather because i didn't like it. Since i usually burn this kind of anime down and I didn't really hate it as much as I could, most people would still find much more enjoyment in Danmachi than me.",

            "content": "Dungeon ni Deai wo Motome..... Or DanMachi for short(What is with all the anime shows with long ass titles nowadays?), was an anime that aired last season that sparked a tiny bit of attention, probably due to the fact that it has the fantasy/romance/adventure tags and it shared some similarities with SAO. Being one of the most controversial shows of the spring season, I noticed that many people are giving high ratings for it, 7, 8, and higher. While everyone is entitled to their opinions, after watching all 13 episodes, I have concluded that DanMachi is deserving of a 5/10, which might be low tosome people, but I think it's fair for what DanMachi was able to offer. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The plot of the show is actually very simple. To summarize it, the story follows Bell Cranel, a newbie adventurer who strives to become stronger in order to catch up to the girl he likes who is also an adventurer. With the support of his goddess Hestia, they both go on a journey to achieve their goals through dungeon exploration and encounters with other adventurers. First, I'll start out with the bad points. I'll be blunt. The story does not go anywhere. It may look like it, but it really doesn't. The whole story is supposed to be showcasing Bell and Hestia's journey, how he reaches his goal of becoming stronger, with the support of his goddess. But the thing is, Bell was already strong to start with. There wasn't one part where Bell failed. I won't give any specific details, but every time he encountered a new problem or enemy, he would almost fall or give up, but he just got stronger in every situation and pulled something out of his ass each time. In all seriousness though, because of this, there really wasn't much story development in that respect. Bell is already strong, and we just see him get even stronger and nothing really changes story wise. It's a typical anime cliche, which we have seen a lot in shounen. The plot is basically, \\n\r\nbeat enemy - make friends - get even stronger - beat enemy - make more friends \\n\r\nAnd the cycle continues. The other issue is the story has some plotholes. What I mean by that is nothing is really explained. We are given an introduction into this world of adventure, filled with dungeons, monsters, magic, weapons and so forth. It's interesting and grabs your attention, but the information they give is very vague, if they gave any at all. And then as you watch through the show you are left with a bunch of questions which can distract from entire story. You might be able to figure things out by piecing information together, but it would have been much better if they made some aspects of the story and setting clear, which would have strengthen the foundation of the show. There are also times where the goal of the plot is forgotten. They threw in some romance in attempt to push the story forward, but that aspect of it goes nowhere and is completely ignored after the first and second episodes, which was the main reason Bell wanted to get stronger in the first place, and they changed it to him wanting to boost his stats. The ending was also unsatisfying and didn't make much sense.  Anyways, if there is anything that DanMachi does well with it's story is bringing something new each episode. Whether it's a new battle with a new enemy, or the characters shopping in the town, each episode has something that sets it apart from the rest and keeps it refreshing. There are also some small side character arcs which help in keeping your interest. Besides that, DanMachi's plot has quite a few flaws, more than good. The show can also feel overdramatic, but despite all that, with the fantasy/adventure aspect along with the some comedy, makes it a lot easier to watch. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: I thought the animation/art was good. The details of the characters, setting, weapons, and even the monsters were all done well. Colors were nice and bright, and  the action scenes were clear and fluid. There really wasn't anything I found myself uncomfortable with, I think it's around the quality you would expect from an anime show in 2015. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND: Th music in the show I wouldn't say is very distinct, or something that I would listen to outside of the anime, but I thought the soundtracks were fitting of the show and the setting that we were dealing with. I also enjoyed the opening song, I found myself wanting to actually listen to it instead of skipping it. I can't say so much about the ending, but the OP was enjoyable I found. Other than that, there isn't anything particularly memorable that I would want to listen too all the time. The main characters voices, Hestia and Bell, got annoying at some point though and I got tired of hearing them. But it really depends on you. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Honestly, the characters were mediocre. As the MC's, we have Bell and Hestia, and then we have many supporting characters, including Crozzo, Arde, Wallenstein, Eina, Ryu, Freya, to name some of the more important ones. DanMachi actually has quite an arrange of characters, but there are some issues revolving around them. For example, Bell is really just your standard MC. He wants to be a hero, and he tries way too hard to get you to like him. We are given little background about why he wants to be an adventurer, and he's given all these positive qualities which just makes him all the less interesting. Not to mention the fact that he is over powered, when compared to many other characters in the show(besides Wallenstein), as he has this extreme growth rate and skills which no one else has which pretty much makes him stronger than everyone else and gives him the ability to get to pull through any dire situation. Hestia, the other MC, can be described with one word. ANNOYING. In the beginning of the show, she was actually a fun character to watch, mainly because of the dynamics between her and Bell. As a goddess who is looking after him, it is evident that she really cares for Bell and wants to help him reach his goals. This side of her is what makes her stick out as a character, and her interactions with Bell can be quite cute, and she adds a lot of humor to the show. At some point though she does get annoying because she starts becoming a stalker instead, and getting very paranoid when Bell interacts with other girls. At that point she becomes an annoying stalker with enormous boobs. Then there is Wallenstein, who Bell supposedly likes, but nothing ever develops between them as the driving force of the story changed. Wallenstein can be described as one of your cool, composed characters with striking beauty. But to summarize her character, she's as airhead who shows no emotion whatsoever and can kick ass. She really had no personality, which in turn made no sense why Bell would have been attracted to her. I think she would have been a really cool character if she actually showed some emotion and was clear about her feelings, but she's a dead character from what I can tell which is disappointing. Besides that, there are many other characters that are actually way more interesting, but sadly any sort development was shafted through the show. We do get hear/see some of the characters backstories and motives, but none of them were fleshed out enough to really bring out the characters. The only time we get any real development is through the small arcs with some of the supporting characters, like Lili. Other than that, we can see some slight change within the characters, but none of it was touched on, and we don't get much depth. There are also characters like Freya, who played a part in the story and were shown frequently, but their motives were never revealed and as characters they were never touched on. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT: Overall, I'd say DanMachi is just another average anime. There isn't anything that makes it good or stand out, but I wouldn't put it off as complete garbage. The atmosphere and setting of the show keep it interesting, enough to make you watch it and get through it without wanting to punch your computer screen or drop it. It is to say that it wasn't as good as I expected it to be either, but some part of me enjoyed it, probably due to the similarity it shares with SAO. Anywho, if you're thinking about watching this, go for it. If you enjoy fantasy and action, then you may like this more than I do. Just for your information though, don't be deceived by the title, it is not wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon, but the MC never picks up one if that's what you are thinking. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

So, you know, have fun but don't talk to me about it.]\r\nSo, I\u2019m gonna do my first review on something dangerous. Something with a lot of fans, and a lot of haters. One side will hate you regardless, unless you can squeeze yourself in the middle somehow.\r\nSadly, no. No, Icannot. You already know which side I\u2019ve chosen. I did not like Danmachi, so much that I won\u2019t even bother copy/pasting its (ridiculous) full name.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, it\u2019s nothing more than a cashgrab, one that doesn\u2019t make me feel bad about all the anime torrents and unofficial websites that everyone outside of Japan uses.

You have a modern, popular concept with a general, an average shounen protagonist, and some nice, juicy fanservice to make sure you don\u2019t look away and so the merchandise sells. Oh, and we\u2019ll throw in some blood as well. It worked for Attack on Titan, so we might as well.\\n\\n\r\nDanmachi does nothing to separate itself from anything. It\u2019s simply a watered-down action/adventure anime meant to please those who ride on the most popular anime, for those who are easily amused. Like a Taylor Swift song. I\u2019d try to tell you to not watch it, but who am I kidding. It\u2019s already gonna have a fuckton of seasons, so it already won. GG Danmachi.\\n\\n\r\nWell, we\u2019re already this far in, so let\u2019s start talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story.\\n\r\nDanmachi takes place in a fantasy city with its most notable feature being the dungeon: a tower that stretches so high that it disappears into the clouds. \u2026Did I lose you there? Yes, the dungeon is a damn TOWER, no matter how many times it\u2019s referred to as a dungeon, or how many times you actually see someone go DOWN in the dungeon. Either this tower is not actually the dungeon and is instead some random point in the setting that the camera likes to see, or nobody really knows what a dungeon is. \\n\r\nWell, hey, the world itself seems to be pretty weird. I mean, the people here have actual stats and levels, like an RPG. Except this only seems to apply for combat in the dungeon, at least from what I heard. And generally, people that fight in the dungeon are only those who have received powers from a god. I\u2019m assuming this is the only area of civilization in this series\u2019 entire world, since actual gods and goddesses seem to put a huge focus on it, and they basically have their own currency and everything. Iiiiit\u2019s a small world aaaafter all\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, cue the main character, believe it! Kirito is a young man with the simple ambition of becoming stronger! He truly is an hero, because when the going gets tough, he always has a convenient way out! \u2026Wait, what? Oh, sorry. I meant Bell. Not Kirito. Same rules apply, though. Bell, who even has Kirito\u2019s voice actor, is your basic protagonist. He wants an adventure, he wants to be stronger, he\u2019s heroic, he\u2019s fighting for recognition, and he\u2019ll never give up on it! Believe it!! Overall, this is just the start of Bell\u2019s adventure into an underground sky tower, so a lot of results are just him getting something, from power-up to party member. In the most basic sense, it\u2019s nothing special. In a more specific sense, it\u2019s still nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest can essentially be summed up as \u201cshit happens\u201d, which can be expected when there\u2019s nothing really at stake in the plot. Bell and his partner Hestia seem to be just fine in their small house, but I guess it\u2019s just not enough so LET\u2019S GO KILL THINGS. Oh, and Bell wants senpai to notice him. Really, I just laugh that Bell works so hard to get attention from some emotionless girl who saved him a couple times, and then casts aside the girl who\u2019s constantly supported him. Priorities. \\n\r\nBut along with Bell\u2019s dumb, pointless motives are his abilities, his ways out. His growth in strength is LITERALLY determined by his emotions in battles. Basically \u201cdo it 4 da waifu\u201d. There\u2019s one fight towards the end where he fights someone that can turn invisible. Why this person isn\u2019t like the strongest person in the show is beyond me, but anyway Bell ends up defeating him because he could \u201cfeel his eyes on him\u201d. Okay, Bell. Sure. It\u2019s not like this crap is uncalled for, though, because the plot itself has predictable outcomes. I mean, call me crazy, but I think the person that smirked darkly at the end of a scene MIGHT be up to no good. But first, a word from the main villain on what she\u2019s about to do.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what really makes me displeased? The characters.\\n\\n\r\nBell Cranel, the main character. A young man with the goal of becoming stronger, inspired by his dead family member! Truly riveting! 10/10 character! No, he\u2019s just some typical, beginning adventurer who likes to play the hero. Nothing else. But what I actually hate is that this show tries SO HARD to get you to like him. In the pilot episode, there\u2019s a scene where some asshole in a bar starts ranting about how utterly terrible Bell is, not knowing that Bell is like 10 feet away. This scene goes on for MINUTES, just blabbing about Bell being a scrublord tomato dork who will never have his dream girlfriend as his girlfriend. I can feel Danmachi\u2019s cold, dead hands grabbing me by the shoulders yelling \u201cFEEL BAD! LOVE HIM! LOVE HIIIIIIIIM!\u201d as it shakes me violently. It not only wants you to feel bad, but makes you want to be him, as he tries to be the badass hero you dreamed about in your early childhood, only this time he has a fair supply of titties surrounding him. I think I\u2019ve complained enough about him. Let\u2019s move on to the other lead.\\n\\n\r\nHestia. Oh my god. I heard about this character before I heard about the actual anime. I saw the dumb hestia.dance thing and that she was \u201chestia bestia\u201d or some shit. I hate whoever is responsible for this. Hestia became unbearably annoying by the show\u2019s end. She obviously loves and supports Bell, who lacks the brainpower to actually realize that, and she becomes clingy and gets mad whenever Bell\u2019s around one of his many harem members. In context, this isn\u2019t a recipe for disaster or anything, but it\u2019s so overdone that it gets ridiculous. Hell, she\u2019s ruined some scenes entirely, like one time where Bell and Aiz have a conversation by themselves, only to be interrupted by Hestia yelling at Bell, including some 5-10 minute long scream. It was the 592nd time that I\u2019ve contemplated suicide. Really, I want to know what is so appealing about this character beyond the fanservice. She\u2019s literal, walking fanservice, and even then you can find much better. I mean, come on.\\n\\n\r\nLiliruca: a furry with one of the most ridiculous and idiotic backstories I\u2019ve ever heard. Her familia does everything for wine, basically. And as for herself, she couldn\u2019t cut it as an adventurer, so she became a supporter instead. Despite the name, it\u2019s apparently so useless that she was bullied for being one, despite being kept around. Basically, her backstory is that people are assholes to a facepalming degree, and she therefore takes it out on the first honest person she meets. What a nice girl.\\n\\n\r\nAiz. There\u2019s nothing to say about this character, really. She\u2019s strong, Bell loves her, and that\u2019s about it. She\u2019s some quiet, passive person who doesn\u2019t show any real personality. She herself seems to have the pointless goal of getting stronger for no reason, so at least they have something in common I guess.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone else doesn\u2019t get enough screentime to be worth mentioning. And now I\u2019ll throw in the flavor parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually pretty decent. It didn\u2019t exactly jump out at me, but there were times where it got my attention enough. The opening is absolutely garbage, though, I mean there are bad shows with great openings so I\u2019m not biased, but it is seriously one of the most lackluster openings I\u2019ve heard in a while. The ending theme isn\u2019t very interesting either, but I\u2019d be a liar if I said I actually cared about ED\u2019s. Then you have the visuals, which are pretty solid. I\u2019m not a master judge in this part, so all I can tell you is that it\u2019s not bad.\\n\\n\r\nI think I\u2019ve covered what I need to say. Danmachi is just not worth your time if you want to take something seriously. Even if you\u2019re super casual and into the basics like Fairy Tail and Bleach, I still encourage you to shy away from this and expand your horizons. But who am I to say what you can\u2019t like? I for one certainly did not this, though. The 2/10 I gave it may or may not be fair based on my comments, but most of all it\u2019s given this score to note it as one of my least favorite anime, ever. Of course, I don\u2019t flat-out expect you to agree, and if this was poorly written instead of being just disagreeable, there\u2019s a helpful/unhelpful button. After all I am inexperienced in both watching and reviewing, but I hope I have at least some merit in my words. Regardless, thank you for your time.",

            "content": "\"Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon\" is a goddamn abomination. JC Staff capitalizing on the video game anime craze was already a flag, but to go this far... is pathetic. This is every anime you have ever seen. This is everything wrong with anime. This anime is the exact reason why anime is ostracized at face value. This is what anime viewers should be trying to stop.\r\nThere is a story. It is hyper-simplistic. So stupid that anyone could understand it. Yet the plot points make little to no sense. The main character Bell Cranel starts his adventures with his well-endowed companion,the goddess Hestia. Why this girl is supposed to be Hestia I have no clue. She does nothing Hestia-esque. Her character design has nothing to do with Hestia. She's blatantly an oversexualized little girl with a bra made out of string. A quick aside - bras made out of string do not exist. They do not exist because they do not work. \\n\\n\r\nSo Bell Cranel and his representative goddess have to go into a dungeon to, like, do adventures or something (unexplained). But Bell Cranel is very weak so every episode an unforeshadowed deus ex machina pops out of nowhere and saves him. There is no character progression and no power scaling boundaries set. Then things get really crazy, because the bad guy gives Bell Cranel a very strong power for no reason at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guy gives the main character super powers for an unexplained reason. All of the main characters powers are given to him for an unexplained reason. The villain, the evil character, the bad guy gives the protagonist, the good guy, the hero, his super powers. The rest of the anime is spent on everyone being impressed that the main character has super powers. Please note that it is completely unexplained why the bad guy gives the good guy his super powers. And why he can just have super powers. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there is a harem. Of course the camera angles settle on poorly animated breasts whenever a girl is on the screen. Of course the fight scenes are embarrassing and the main character has to use his unexplained super power to kill the bad guy. I have no clue if this is supposed to be an underdog story or not because Bell Cranel is so overpowered yet everyone in the world wants to help him. Everything is contradictory.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is abysmal. It is the worst writing I have seen in anime in a while. Every single character is an archetypal character with an archetypal backstory. There are three episodes spent on the lolita character they introduce in the middle of the season that are obvious and cringe worthy in terms of direction. You knew exactly what was going to happen. Every single scene was predictable, yet the script was just rehashed lines. The script is the nail in the coffin with gems like \"I'll save you because you're a woman.\" They took garbage, put garbage on top of it, threw in a couple of minotaurs and little girls and sold it for 76 bucks per blu-ray after the current Yen to US Conversion rate. If you buy this anime, it's associated manga or light novels, figurines, buttons, pins, moist towelettes, and so on... you will hurt my feelings. I'll consider it a personal attack.\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi is so terrible and so idiotic. Nothing is ever explained and the most random drama ensues at the most opportune times. The final episode is just one huge monster battle for, once again, a completely unexplained reason. Every episode something crazy happens and it simply does not get explained. Like Hestia's Divine Powers, or why Hermes is a jerk, or what Hephaestus and Crozzeo's relationship is... and... and... everything. But don't worry because I'm sure everything will be explained in season two! Even sarcastically that hurts to type. \\n\\n\r\nOnly watch this anime ironically. If you watch this anime ironically I'll still be upset with you. Take my advice like a doting mother or teacher who said you can redo a paper. I really care about you, anonymous, I really do. I want you to love anime. I want people to respect your great taste. I want you to succeed in life. Watching this anime won't help you get any of those things. \\n\\n\r\nPlease select one of the other of thousands of anime that exist. May I recommend Urawa no Usagi-Chan? That's probably better because there's only one level of irony. One level of irony is better than the many you're going to have to explain with this one. This is so bad it's bad bad and then a couple layers past that. It's so bad it's bad that it's still bad and that means that even if you think it's bad and know it's bad it can get worse because you knowingly fear it's badness as you watch it and understand completely that you are subjecting yourself to something that is just bad without any way to escape the badness because under no circumstances can you figure out how someone would think it's good so you resign yourself to just watching something that is bad. In simple terms, anonymous, this is very bad please don't watch it. Even if you do watch this anime to watch something bad and feel bad watching something bad I'll probably still be disappointed in you though, anonymous. Just don't do it please!!\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, can someone please tell me why if they are descending the dungeon why the dungeon stretches into the sky? Does that even make any sense? And why can gods and goddesses just sneak into the dungeon like it's no big deal? And why is this world's entire economy based around some sort of video game spawn thing? Why is the elf so powerful? And do we really not care she murdered a bunch of people in cold blood? Is there no jail in this world? And just goddamn why? Why does this anime exist?!\\n\\n\r\nAll these questions and more - completely unanswered in season two of \"Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon!\"",

            "content": "I decided to write a review for \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\" due to some of the hate I saw it receiving and wanted to provide my perspective. This is my first review so don't expect it to be well polished.\r\nStory: The story isn't this rpg's strong point. Truthfully, this rpg doesn't have a single strong point. It's a combination of different things that make this rpg enjoyable to watch. The story isn't really explained in detail. We are really just given an explanation of gods and goddesses and the aspects of the anime develop more and more with eachepisode. The best thing I find about the story is that it's not really there. This allows me to enjoy each episode separately and be surprised by the things they introduce. It's the same reason why Gintama is enjoyable if you have seen that anime. Many people compare this anime to SAO but I find it more bearable to watch because things aren't as serious until certain points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character, Bell, is simply setup to become a hero. It's like in an rpg game where the main character is meant to have the best stats and skills as they level up. People say the main character just becomes overpowered after a few episodes but I feel that he is reasonably average. He is always shadowed by the sword princess, who he wishes to surpass. He isn't the strongest person around. I hated Kirito in SAO because he was ridiculously overpowered. It didn't really explain why he was overpower either. The other main character, Goddess Hestia, is a great component of the show. With her addition, I feel that this show is a parody of the usual harem. Several times Hestia will point out the amount of times she finds Bell with a different female. In addition, none of the other female characters display the amount of affection that Hestia shows except Lili. Other characters are introduced but never really expanded on.i. I feel that this anime could improve a lot if they added more character expansion, especially with Freya who seems like the main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is simple but I feel they use the money they save to add in a decent amount of action and quality animation. I was surprised at how well animated the fight in episode 8 was. However, I really wish the Dungeon and it's enemies had more variety. In the later episodes, it seems like they are trying to remedy this. The dungeon definitely holds a lot of promise. The characters could also use more design. They show a lot of expensive equipment available in shops around the city but you don't see even the best fighters with anything flashy equipped.  We all know that the strong people are suppose to have cool armor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A feel like this anime is so enjoyable because of how average it is. I never have any high expectations. Every episode I watch is good and I know that the following episode will be good and so forth. I hate anime where you wait a week for a new episode and that episode is nothing but talking and a complete let down. That never happens with this show. Every week is worth the wait. This anime didn't start off boiling hot and simmered down. Instead, it started out cold and is slowly warming up, just like an RPG. Because it's a mix of comedy, action, and harem , every episode has the possibility of being either full of jokes, action, or character/relationship development.",

            "content": "I just finished this anime series, and I'm going to be completely honest with this anime series. Me personally I like the show, as much as people say its \"Generic\" but its not a bad show to begin with. For me this would be my most favourite show of the season. If you disagree with me, I need to ask you to leave my review, because this will not be a rant.\r\nSo let's start off with the review of, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story itself takes place in a medieval fantasy world, where I actually likethe aspect. Other than that it starts out very generic as people claim, however I think people takes the show as a very misleading title, thinking it would be some sort of guy chasing after girls and trying to make a harem of his own. Actually this is not the case of the story. The story revolves on our Main Protagonist Bell, who wants to become stronger to get the person that he loves. I'll get to the characters later but let's say, the story revolves on explanations and how the world works, the Main Character slowly progresses on becoming stronger, and to be honest, if it wasn't for the slow paced, and if it was rushed it would be very very painful to watch. As the story progressed, we get a lot of the world building aspect, we get some moments where we're giggling or laughing, moments when we kind of feel attached. The story revolves around our cast as well having to go through situations, in the end of the day of the final episode I honestly like how it ended, and it gives hints for a possible second season. Note the story isn't that great and it starts as an average story, but then it shows the true colors of the show, and its a show, that knows what it wants to be. A show full of fun and giggles. In a good way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWe get a varied amount of characters in this anime, starting off with our Main Protagonist Bell, our generic protagonist. He seems generic but doesn't strive to be so serious like other shows. What I like about him is his personality being shy and somehow nervous at first, and at the time progress we see his progress of becoming strong. Take a note that the ability was reveled, so if it wasn't it would be considered an asspull. He in the end developed into at least good developed, but there are still more mysteries around him.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we got Hestia, our little busty girl Goddess. I know, some people would say she's useless, she's the best, she's waifu material. But let me take my personal opinion at hand please. As much as people say she's useless in terms of supporting, at least for me she shines the series with her obsession with Bell and her personality makes me giggle. She didn't support much on the show, but she became funny in the series at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nAiz, we see her as a dependant girl who fights without help of a man, and if you check, we see that she doesn't need to be save or anything, she shows as a character that can strive on her own and help Bell out in some cases until later on.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other cast, I remember the cat girl's name but she got some pretty nice development as well, won't tell much about her, same with Ryu, and other characters as well. What it did bugged me was just bits of these characters being forgotten after a while, however they still participate as apart of the show and makes the series fun to watch for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally think the artstyle and animation looks very well from a series like this. It kept its consistencies and even with the animation looking very fluid and dynamic, entertaining to watch. When it comes to fight scenes it lets the show shine bright with the different styles and atmospheric sceneries. So I personally find the art very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy most favourite thing about this show would be the music, from heart touching, normal, to tension moments, the show has a soundtrack that I cant stop listening to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and the Ending song, I prefer the ending song more than the Opening song, but the Opening song is not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that fully entertained me among expectations, and from a generic start to a true colors shown, I do not regret watching the series, and I had more enjoyment on this anime than the others from this season. But enjoyment for me is subjective, people might not enjoy it, people would enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Veredict: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd a note, this is an opinion, you can like it, you can hate it. But I personally love this show more. It's enjoyable and its good.\\n",

            "content": "When you see a title this long and silly, then you may also be asking yourself if you should watch the show. \u201cIs it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?\u201d That\u2019s the translated title for this series which really sparks a bit of curiosity. Just judging on the surface, you can tell the story has relations to dungeons and girls. What you may not expect would be the presence of goddesses that really spices up the excitement. \r\nFor the purpose of this review, the series will be referred by its shortened title \u201cDanMachi\u201d. Adapted from the light novel of the samename, DanMachi is essentially a fantasy adventure show. The setting takes place in a fictional world known as \u2018Orario\u2019. While this name isn\u2019t anything special to remember by, its features crafts many possibilities because of the existence of Dungeon. This is a basically a location that contains all sorts of supernatural creatures ranging from minotaurs, dragons, goblins, etc. Why do people visit this place? The answer is simply for the rewards. Although the series isn\u2019t based on a MMORPG game, it has similar themes in that monsters drops valuable loot. At the center of the story is a young man named Bell Cranel. DanMachi chronicles his adventure as he picks up girls in dungeons in this world of bizarreness.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is pretty straightforward. No less than 5 minutes into the first episode and we can see that Bell gets himself in a bit of trouble involving dungeons. Perhaps trouble would be an understatement because Bell\u2019s life does get put into jeopardy when he gets trapped by a minotaur. Luckily, a young girl by the name of Aiz coms to his recuse. This encounter not only saves Bell but he also falls in love with her. Ironic really. The girl picks up the guy in this case. However, this isn\u2019t what it all seems. As the series progresses on, Bell gets involved in acquaintance and relationships with many other girls. Perhaps the most prominent of them is a goddess named Hestia. She is part of a group known as Hestia Familia where he and Hestia are the only two members. Bell is shown to work very hard every day to get by. As a character of only 14 years of age, he takes a lot of responsibility and display insurable amounts of courage as the story progresses. Alongside is Hestia who supports and unknown to Bell also is in love with him. So in essence, Bell already has a girl picked up but he just doesn\u2019t realize it. In Hestia\u2019s case, she throws a lot of hints towards Bell that he fails to recognize. Although they don\u2019t act entirely like lovers, they are very close. And this is where the fun comes in. DanMachi crafts relationships in this series with a comedy formula. It never tries to act too serious despite some of the dangers that exists in this show.\\n\\n\r\nGirls. A main emphasis in this show is how Bell meets them during his adventure. From the elegant swordswoman Aiz to mischievous traveler Liliruca Arde, the series continuously shows Bell\u2019s development. A strong point about his character is how he can influence others with his kindness. It also gets some of them curious such as the case of Aiz. She often wonders about how Bell can get so strong in such a short of time. Over the course of the show, Bell develops a relationship with Aiz through their training sessions. There\u2019s also harem tropes that becomes more and more evident as Bell builds connections with them. While it\u2019s not fully shown whether Aiz likes Bell or not, there\u2019s definitely a certain curiosity that she has for the young man. As generic as this seems, I actually find the series to be genuinely entertaining. This is because Bell isn\u2019t overpowered nor is he a weakling. More like a balance of both, it gets the viewers curious about how much he will improve. Characters such as Bete Loga and Freya are also surprised at his improvement despite their initial outlook of Bell. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the show follows a rather straightforward set of mechanics. There is no central antagonist introduced in this season nor are there any game tropes that indicates some sort of setting that relates to MMORPG survival. It\u2019s simple with established mechanics such as the Familia, groups in the story with specialized skills including item crafting and monster hunting. So in essence, the series almost has a slice of life-like tone at times. What it sets differently apart from some adventure is mostly the relationship building. To be quite honest, there\u2019s perhaps far too much of it. Bell and Hestia\u2019s relationship makes up the core of the show. While some episodes doesn\u2019t exclusively focus on this, it still ultimately communicates the message to the audience that the pair is inseparable. Unfortunately, Bell treats Hestia more like a close friend than a girlfriend. And this becomes a source of annoyance for Hestia. It can also be a source of annoyance for the viewers as it shows how dense he can be. Romance is subtle as we don\u2019t really see much development except on casual levels. Despite this, the show often transits between relationships and fantasy adventure. What I do find disappointing is that the focus is too much on our two main characters. Even as a prominent character in the show, we don\u2019t learn much about Aiz from this adaptation. There\u2019s little we see from her background but only her personality on the surface. Similarly, her guild mates are often trying to impress her (both guys and girls included). It\u2019s paltry in the end in terms of characterization. On the other hand, it\u2019s nice to see that Bell can make friends outside of his Familia such as Welf, a blacksmith who made his armor and a member of the Herme Familia. In this way, it shows how Bell interacts with other characters that are not so close to him while allowing the audience to see his other characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nBased on the light novel, I am on most parts satisfied with the adaptation. While it\u2019s not frame by frame faithful to the source, it captures the most important parts. These include the magical contents such as the various items that are shown. Skills and abilities that Bell learns are also introduced such as the Fire Bolt. In the background, there\u2019s a considerable amount of world building. In fact, the world fiction of the show is one of the features that is very noticeable. The supernatural creatures that exists in their world are crafted to make them look real. While it isn\u2019t unique compared to most fantasy adventure stories, DanMachi attracts appeal to any fan who wants to see how their world functions. From dampy dungeons to enchanting forests, this show exhibits an attractive appeal to fantasy. It even has a good amount of explanation for how stats and skillsets work including limitations to adventurers\u2019 levels. The comedy can sometimes feel a bit of a hit or miss but on most parts flows well with the story. It can also mislead viewers sometimes as some episodes that are seemingly indulged by humor turns serious with the buildup and execution. For such a goofy title, that\u2019s saying something.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff is behind the wheels to operate this show. What you see from the preview is what you get. The artwork retains a fantasy atmosphere with its elegant world. There\u2019s careful texture that decorates the world of Orario with what it has to offer. The dungeons is still the most prominent feature as the show creates its features to look legitimately menacing. At the same time, it also display a good fixture of concrete detail. These ranges from the various monsters to the magical elements that are displayed throughout the show such as Bell\u2019s abilities. Fans who wants to be serviced will feel pleased at times because the show does show a bit of skin. These include Aiz\u2019s partially broken armor, Hestia\u2019s outfit, or even the inevitable bath scenes. It\u2019s also noticeable that character designs for the series puts a lot of emphasis into the female characters. All the gods and goddesses are designed to look beautiful or seductive. In the case of Freya, she also display a bit of yandereness with her expressions. However, the character expressions is a bit silly for its own good at times. This is mostly coming from Bell especially in the first half of the show that makes him react more like a kid than an adventurer. His puppy crush on Aiz brings this out the most. On the other hand, who can forget about Hestia\u2019s jealousy when she sees Bell hanging out with a girl?\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, DanMachi\u2019s soundtrack matches very well with its consistency. If there\u2019s any first impressions, soundtrack should be one to name especially for its battle oriented OST. The extensive fighting in some episodes as well as the thriller-like feeling of dungeon conquests flows quite well with the intense soundtrack. It brings a heavy feeling and even bit of realism of what being part of an adventurer is like in the dungeons just by the sheer music too. The OP and ED theme songs are more lighthearted. And in general, most of the humorous and slice of life scenes has a more relaxing feeling. Finally, there\u2019s the voice mannerisms. Hestia is a big of mixed bag. Her voice sometimes sounds like a spoiled brat while other times shows a very caring friend. Aiz\u2019s soft voice makes her one of the more calm characters; a bit of contrast to Bell\u2019s personality. And then there are many other characters with a wide dynamic range of voice expressions. The ones that stands out the most are the goddesses such as Freya while others\u2026well, not so much. Bell would fit into that category as his voice matches mostly as a teenager.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does DanMachi really try to appeal? If it\u2019s a fantasy and adventure story, then that\u2019s a success with its fantastic world fiction and mechanics. When it comes to characterization though, that\u2019s more of its Achilles\u2019 Heel. It does make up for it with concrete relationships especially in the case of Bell and Hestia. Other times, the show tries to capitalize on Bell\u2019s adventure by presenting us his improvements. Now I do have to say that the comedy feels a bit repetitive while other times, the story\u2019s consistency feels blend. As a 1 cour show, expect certain elements of the original source to be omitted or changed. Still, DanMachi is a story that shows how fantasy can be fun. It may not feel original but it has a lot of reasons to make us think of its title.",

            "content": "All right Lion Tamers. We look at another anime. This time, I found one I actually like.\r\nIt's called \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\", what a mouthful! Translation is 'Dzun-ge would be wrong I'll seek a meeting to sound day', I swear that's the Google Translation.\r\nThere is a short name some use \"DanMachi\", don't ask me I have no idea. Google Translation is 'Dan-Machi'.\r\nA lot of the time; most of us get caught up in the story, or the music, or the dialog, or the artwork, or the characters. \r\nBut then there is the forest, hiding in all those trees. AndDanMachi is one of these shows, that shows us that sometimes the forest is more important than the trees.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nI'll discuss the Anime's specifics in a moment, but I want to have a word about the meanings of things. Sometimes Anime has a meaning that shines far above the actual artwork. DanMachi is one of those rare shining lights.\\n\\n\r\nFor once, we have a show that stands up and shouts to the highest mountaintops.\\n\\n\r\nThat our faith in our fellow Man, is more important than the impending threats, the suffering that is a consequence of standing up for our friends, and loved ones. That courage in the face of enemies, in the defense of our true friends and loved ones, speaks louder than any fear.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact that no one else sees it, isn't the same as if it never happened at all. Things that are important in our life, are not, unless we are willing to suffer to protect them. Things that are important, has nothing to do with the property we own, or the school we go to, or the stores we frequent.\\n\\n\r\nThe valuable things are those items we carry with us for our entire lives, that enrichen it, and make the days we live in the future, seem richer for knowing those things.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that leads us to DanMachi, and a little fellow that would not surrender his belief for temporary freedom from fear and pain. And because he stood up and fought to protect what he held dear, his faith in the strength of the friendship and love of his fellows; his fellows responded in kind. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, those things many would find a weakness in his character, was exactly the forces martial'd, to bring about the friendships he gained. These friendships and loved ones were a direct consequence of his behavior. All of these people that centered upon him, as a compass point; were not there to form a harem, or a club. They are friends and neighbors, their behavior paid for, by his offering his spirit of neighborhood to his fellows.\\n\\n\r\nFirst.\\n\\n\r\nThe spirit of neighborhood, and fellowship are not weakness; they are an enormous strength. When we forget that, we give a heave-ho to our own lives within the context of our own way of life, without safety, without friends, without community. But most of all, our neighborhoods become embattled contests for survival, and the grace of a civilized culture is the victim.\\n\\n\r\nBell has two character traits that are all to rare in the description of a male hero: charity, and mercy. He gave of himself, in the name of his friends, and they became his neighbors. What is a neighbor, but a person who stands with you, when your sense of community is threatened?\\n\\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be Human? Does it mean we are all born Human? I don't believe that. Being Human is to decide to operate by set of principles that define what it is to be Human. Being a Human Being has nothing to do with biology, or procreation, or how we look. It is defined by how we believe we should behave among our fellow Humans.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that many try to gain our faith in themselves, as if all Men deserve to be trusted as if we were all Human, is a deceit of the highest order, a con-game. Especially when non-Human Homo-Sapiens walk among us trying to get the results of these values from us, without trading in kind. These are liars, cheats and thieves.\\n\\n\r\nIs it any wonder that the motto of the U.S. Air Force Academy is \"I shall not lie, cheat or steal; or tolerate anyone who does.\"? Those who do, don't stay at the Academy long.\\n\\n\r\nThe little female character, Miss Arde, is a case in point. She had been beaten, kicked, dropped into terror, mistreated in so many ways; that she had lost her  faith in her fellow Man. But just as in real life, it only took one true faithful spirit to teach her that not everyone had to live as she had. She realized what she was doing wasn't living; she had sold her soul to pay for existence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of it, she mistrusted Bell's motives, even to betraying him because he was an easy mark. True Humans usually are. Until Miss Arde realized that it was the very things she thought of as weaknesses, that were the very causes for Bell's decisions to defend her when she least expected it.\\n\\n\r\nWeakness? Lost promises? Can't relate to people of the same stripe? I don't think so. Bell is a symbol of all that is good in Man, and needs to be nurtured for its own sake.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nNow I can talk about the basic production of DanMachi.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a wonderful story, that covers an enormous amount of back-story and premise in 13-episodes. I would have appreciated more episodes, to give more depth of history, but this Anime was adequate in this regard, for what was offered.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was very good, even having some parallax artwork in moments where Bell or some other characters are walking down a street, or images of large panoramas are described. This is 'J.C. Staff' at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was, for once, something I could sink my teeth into. Catchy tunes, with fine melodies. Singing that is worthy of the name. Harmonies that work together with the voices, to make something that is pleasant to hear. While I would have preferred to have music that also had import to the show itself, after all, we are dealing with an alternate universe, with Gods who walk among the ordinary gentry. And the basic soundtrack was also appropriate to the moments in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting, each one a three-dimensional personality. Even the girls were varied, and while they tended to be way to cute for real life; still all bounced off each other (no pun intended) as people would in a real town, with real neighborhoods. There is nothing unusual about a girl finding herself interested in a boy who has a history of treating other people with dignity and respect. And this happened quite a few times. Rare? Never. Many girls become women who marry such boys, who grow up to be good men.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that began to not jive very well is that even though the beginnings of the tale centers on a little God named Hestia, who pairs herself with her one and only Adventurer, in an old deserted non-Greek-God Worship Church; as they developed in their community, and became somewhat richer, they stayed in the rent-free squatters life-style. Never to be improved upon, as they could afford more and better. Everything in their lives were old, hand-me-down and discarded by every one. Including the building itself.\\n\\n\r\nOne has to wonder about that. And then there's the debt to be paid, by Hestia, for the knife Hephaistios created for Bell. But these items are for another season. If there ever is another one. This show is one of those that deserves another season. After all, we still don't have a motivation for the actions of Freya. This is not a weakness, it just needs some more episodes, to place Freya on center stage. Something that was never done, in the interests of developing the rest of the plot. This is not an error. It is an author's license.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the above, I finish this review of a short, flawed, but otherwise excellent offering. Slickly written, with comedy, pathos, heartfelt emotions; and a soaring set of principles that is all too rare.\\n\\n\r\nI give DanMachi a solid 9!\\n\\n",

            "content": "As I finished this series and went to go adjust my anime list, I had a look down at the reviews, and saw that people were all over  the place with 'Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka', or as I'm going to call it, Dungeon, and I figure that I might as well give my input on it. Now be gentle, as  this is my first review, a. \r\nStory:\r\nOne of the weakest points of Dungeon.\r\n I felt like the series tried to start with the angle of Bell, the protagonist, following after his grandfathers words to go find agirl in a dungeon, but it quickly loses most of this focus, only being briefly mentioned throughout the rest of the series. The separate story arcs themselves were also nothing special, with the usual Lose-Train-Win or the classic Lose-Remember your friends-Win. Its a tried and tested method, and while not executed particularly badly, I'm probably not going to remember the story after a week. Unyieldingly average.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt looks good. most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nIn a world of magic, all the effects were done pretty well in my opinion, and the monsters were not bad, albeit very clich\u00e9 , but where it really stood out was in the big, important fight scenes, where everything was moving smooth as silk, and you really couldn't help but enjoy watching. Although, some scenes look pretty bland, and all the gore they tried to put into it deducted from the whole feel, as its not done as well as the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nActively Terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I feel all the contriversy around this series stems from: the characters. Ill go through a few examples. Bell Cranel: the main protagonist, and from the looks of things possibly the most pandering character I've ever seen. A pure hearted naturally talented god of women. If you thought Kirito was bad, this guy is on a whole nother level, hes a god damn otaku wet dream. He puts up with abuse from anyone, always gets the girl, and saves the day at the last minute, and with almost no character development! After the second episode, I could pretty much tell how the rest of the series was going to go, and I wasn't far off. Everyone is tailored to make Bell seem like a god amongst men. Girls with dark pasts confide in him, and he solves all their problems, people abusing him, only for him to show them the error of their ways and turning them good. Almost no-one in the show has any real personality that dosen't try to make Bell look cool. And once you realise that for yourself, if you don't stop the series there, you're just going to give up on seeing any development at all.\\n\r\nI could also talk about the excessive fan service, and how in my opinion hampers the overall series, but I'm sure someone else has talked about it with more eloquence than I can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt's dumb fun, but I can see why people don't like it.\\n\\n\r\nI've pretty much covered anything I needed to say, but as a closing statement, let me say this, If you're a fan of deep characters, and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, stay away. Even If you do want to watch it, if you don't like the first episode, it doesn't get better. If, on the other hand, you like super op characters pulling chicks with bigger chests than personalities, ala Sword Art Online, you might get some enjoyment out of this.",

            "content": "***contains trace amounts of spoilers and mild profanity, please consult your doctor before reading***\r\nI've been seeing opinions that this anime is a worse version of Sword Art Online and I must strongly object. In fact I'll argue there're some significant improvements over the posterchild of everything wrong with anime. \r\nFor starters the adventure aspect received proper attention, SAO had barely any fights with monsters or dungeon crawling, most of it resolved around the mc being a harem king, doing a detective game and numerous other activities that introduced absolutery nothing of value to the main plot. In DanMachi it actually resolves around the adventure andfighting! All the other harem-esque nonsense exists but the main theme of the anime is actually explored, they got that part right at least (or right-er anyway). \\n\\n\r\nSecondarily, people's motivations actually make sense. In SAO despite having a common interest of escaping the dungeon player rivalry was intense, and some people even resolved to perma killing. Considering bosses don't respawn it made the drama both absurd and pointless, that hatred for beta testers was just ridiculous. In here however the ones who advance deeper in the dungeon get the edge over other familias, more money, better equipment; occasional cooperation exists but it's driven mostly by pragmatic gains. Shanty town in the lower dungeon set absurd prices to rip-off adventurers passing by, but in a situation of need everyone teams up against a common enemy. Different familias can join forces to take on a boss but it doesn't change a fact it's a competition among the gods, even if driven by nothing more than vanity of being better (likely allusion to greek gods being fickle douchebags that toy with human lives for their own amusement). Behaviors follow logic patterns, nakama nonsense exist only in minimal amounts, and that already is a step forward (or rather reverse from a step backward, eh?).\\n\\n\r\nShallow characterization is an obvious flaw, but hey, at least the author bothered to equip his heroes with some. That party that dumped the monsters on the the protagonist did so to protect their own wounded, and they felt guilt for it later. Human behavior and moral choices, something that SAO can't do.\\n\\n\r\nAccusations of taking misogyny up to new levels are incorrect. The levels are quite standard (no one said it's a good standard) and in some cases there's improvement over Demonspawn 2012. For example the elf chick, she has her own reasons for going back to the dungeon, the regret over her lost party members. She assists the albino lab rat on occasions but it's driven by the need to prevent another tragedy where she failed previously, not because the mc is \"attractive\". See? Actual character. The Sword Princess remains the strongest fighter throughout the whole series,  even when the mc tries to catch up to her armed with godlike growth skills,  still remains vastly inferior. No excuse for lack of personality but it's worth noting. And the goddess Freya that enabled the growth as well? Playing with whitehair boy for nothing more than fun, turning his desperate struggle for survival into a pass time joke activity. \"Let's traumatize this kid by putting him into extreme mortal danger, motivate him with a possibility of heavy humilation in front of his loved one, so I can orgasm to my sadistic fantasy later.\" \\n\\n\r\nThis is where we arrive at a suprising conclusion: if anything the show is heavier on the misandry side. The male protagonist is a worthless unsympathetic nobody (as in \"so beta it's revolting\"), and the only reason he can reach the top is through love. Power of love is a retarded plot device on it's own but the really bad thing is the resulting implication - without love he's worthless. Or more simply, the only reason he's ascended from a pathetic loser state forever doomed to be an unremarkable peon, into a S-rank hero is because of a girl. And even then he can only get his rear end whipped a little less than before by the top player. Getting a level up? Only because Freya made special effort for nothing more than maniacal egocentrism, incidentally arranged through her male henchman with a personality of a wet dishrag, and a few cases of accidental manslaughter (adventureres that got rekt by the pet minotaur). Something banal as updating stats? Not without a loli sitting on your ass.  Superpowerful weapon? Woman smith doing a big favour on a pity credit basis. Learning magic since he had zero chance of overcoming the hurdle on his own? Female mercy, and someone is going to miss that book but the chick is cute so screw moral implications of property theft. The little furry girl that tried to scam and murder him for purely immoral reasons? Forgiven without a blink. Because why bother having personality or rationality, that'd just be insensitve. The planned joke of mc being a damsel in distress unitnentionally becomes an offensive stereotype itself, talk about hilarious irony :) \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the position of all time worst title remains secure. DanMachi suffers from many of the plagues of modern anime (idiotic overpowered doormat mc, horrible writing, pandering, wish fulfillment etc) but nowhere does it fall below the Unholy Abomination 2012. At the very least it succeded in belonging to the adventure/action segment, and in some cases it's made noticeable improvements over the One Which Must Not Be Named (Without A Lot Of Criticism). If there's anything DanMachi truly excels in is that it hates it's male characters much more than the female ones. Not that pushing one extreme into the other is an improvement in the subject, but it shows we're dealing with a quite different type of bad show. Not worse, just a more unique type of bad.\\n",

            "content": "Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? Pfft, it's the best way to pick up girls! \r\nMore commonly referred to as DanMachi, \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka?\" is a fantasy, action, adventure, romance and, to some extent, comedy anime. The tags aren't inaccurate, as these themes are visible throughout all twelve episodes. After watching each episode weekly as they were released, I've come to that conclusion that DanMachi is deserving of around a 7/10.\r\nStory: 6\r\nDanMachi's main story line is decent. With plot twists every few episodes, it's safe to say that the main story is pretty excitingand definitely drags you into continuing the series. There are some brilliant moments of tension and the story changes its side character focus every so often, which keeps things fresh. At the start of the anime, the story shows a lot of promise, with an amazing RPG-style fantasy world being shown. However, this is exactly where it falls flat. I found myself asking questions about the world as the anime went on... \"Why is there a massive dungeon tower in the middle of the world (that's extremely reminiscent of the one in Sword Art Online?\" \"What other towns and cities are there?\" \"Why did the Gods choose to live with humans?\" \"Who says what the Gods can and can't do?\" \"Why do people get exp. like in a video game?\" \"Why did people start going into the dungeon in the first place?\" \"What do the magic rocks that monsters drop even do?\" \"Who put the monsters in the dungeon?\".  I could go on for ages. Point is, they presented a wonderful and interesting world and explained nothing about it. To me, this detracted from the story greatly as I was unable to immerse myself into the world due to the fact I was constantly saying: \"B-b-but that doesn't make sense! Why?\". I can only hope that this is elaborated more upon in season two.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi's artwork and animation is stellar. The character designs are all incredibly lovable and unique, especially the Goddess, Hestia. The weapons, armor and monsters are all terrifying and very well designed. If you were looking for flaws in the animation, you would not find any, with action and fight scenes that are so very clear and fun to watch. The style of the world is just simply awesome, my favorite part being the backstreet alleyway in the city. However, the only drawback with the overall art is that it bears shocking resemblance to Sword Art Online. I understand that it's from the same studio, but it's as if they didn't even try making it different.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, the battle songs and tavern music definitely add to the feel of the world and help you become more immersed. The opening is catchy but kind of weird and doesn't really fit the anime if you ask me. The ending is the same really. It seems somewhat out of place at times, especially when there's an intense cliffhanger and then it suddenly plays all cheery and upbeat. Kind of ruins the cliffhanger-y mood. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne good aspect of this anime is the array of vibrant and lovable characters it presents. With each character being unique and incredibly well designed, it's somewhat hard to find many faults with the characters. Hestia in particular being just so damn cute and hilarious. However, the main issue I have with the characters is with the protagonist. Bell is a pretty normal kid in terms of personality. However, that's all he is- he's an average kid trying to win over a girl. There's nothing unique or entertaining really about his personality and DanMachi relies on side characters for its comedy relief and bizarre traits. Some side characters even have dark and intruiging back stories, with development being shown in some!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nDespite huge drawbacks with the story, DanMachi's animation and lovable characters make it a pretty enjoyable watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned slightly earlier on in the review, DanMachi bears striking resemblance with the older, more popular Sword Art Online. In fact, even so to the point where some characters' faces look identical and the main character has the same voice actor. In short, if you disliked Sword Art Online, it's pretty likely you'll dislike this too. However, the vice-versa rule applies here too! If you enjoyed SAO, then you'll enjoy DanMachi. Althoguh, that's not to say it's a carbon copy. It does have its unique aspects and is a must watch for any adventure/RPG anime lovers out there.",

            "content": "With an absurdly long title such as, \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" your first inclination is to think that the show is trying too hard to pander from just the title alone. With Romance, Fantasy, Action, and Comedy spliced in with an element of Harem, your anticipation going into this will probably sink into apathy. But fret not my dear friends, this anime, shortly titled DanMachi, actually has much more to offer than your prototypical otaku bait anime. That is if you think a story is essential in anime that fit this description.\r\nWhen I say otaku bait, Imean the classic stereotype of a protagonist who is relatable to your average Japanese teenager, a sexy loli girl with a beautiful petite body who sticks with him thick and thin, and a plot that owes itself to another shonen show's popularity in similarities. In which case, the shonen show DanMachi wants to emulate is Sword Art Online. In DanMachi, a boy, named Bell-kun, who craves to become a great adventurer to prove himself to be a strong warrior in the eyes of so many people by leveling up his attributes to accomplish this feat. Does that sound familiar? Thought so. However, DanMachi is set in an actual fantasy world, not an MMO. So it is a fantasy interpretation of Sword Art in some fashion.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who might be discouraged by this comparison I mentioned, I assure you that DanMachi isn't just another clone for Sword Art Online. For one thing, the plot itself is not of the same magnitude of Sword Art Online. DanMachi's plot is somewhat barebones and can easily be summed up in a sentence or two: \"Boy wants to be an adventurer to overcome difficulties in life. With the help of his sexy Goddess sidekick, he will be able to achieve this goal.\" That's pretty all there is to it. By the time I was halfway through it, I was hoping that there was more to it than just this fundamental premise. By the time the last couple episodes have gone through, there wasn't that much to go on than just that.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the only big gripe DanMachi has going for that keeps it from being great. Still, with all that is said and done, there many admirable qualities to the show that can add up to an outstanding experience. The first one to mention is the characters Bell-kun and Hestia. Individually and together, they add a lot of great hilarious and impactful moments from their dialogue and actions. It becomes evident from the excellent chemistry they both create whenever they are both together on-screen, whether they are fighting various monsters together or happily having a lovey-dovey date together, at least to Hestia's perspective. Bell-kun himself may seem like a weakling of an adventurer with a soft, calm voice but he proves himself worthy to rival some of the better shonen protagonists you typically see. It also helps that he has a very likable personality that puts him in a comfortable position for us to root for him in his journey.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the one and only goddess herself, Hestia-chan. I mean, what can you say about the bootylicious, big chested, and genki archetypical loli that hasn't been said already? Well, I will tell you one thing that can be added into those three categories: Awesome. Why should this title be mentioned in the same breath as her name you may ask? Most of it has to do with how her personality ranges in all sorts of hilarious and adorable ways that make her very expressive. These expressions make you feel an attachment to her when she is acting serious, humorous, or just all around flirty with Bell-kun. Not to mention that her voice actress, Inori Minase, gives it her all in creating a wonderful character with her remarkably expressive voice. It also provides a delicate balance between her wild and joyful nature and Bell-kun's quiet and gentle personality that makes their camaraderie even more exciting and hilarious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBesides our two main leads, the rest of the characters are, unfortunately, not up to par with these two. The only supporting role that I can remember liking was Lili, only because she at least had something that made her distinctive from the rest of the cast. That something being that overly large backpack of hers that doubles her small size, go figure. The rest of the supporting cast can be encapsulated into one word: boring. It all comes down to how the writers put minimal effort in making the supporting cast at least somewhat enjoyable so that it doesn't seem like the only thing carrying the show is our two main leads. All they come down to is them making semi-funny jokes and get involved in fight scenes with Bell-kun or Hestia; which, to DanMachi's credit, are very well done.\\n\\n\r\nHere is where another of DanMachi's strong points starts to bloom. If you thought shonen action shows fighting has gotten tedious in recent years, you'd be right. However, DanMachi manages to set the bar up pretty high with the amount of great tenacity and flair it gives to the action sequences with the monsters and other characters. What helps is how great the animation flows through these sequences with nice fluid movements with the characters and how they use their weapons in combat. There are the occasional \"cutting corners\" in animation, but not to the point where it becomes jarring. Even outside of the action, the animation leaves a strong impression with how well detailed it shows off its medium-sized budget.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the animation work wonders, but the art design also leaves a solid impression in DanMachi. Not just with the character design, but also the design of the world itself. The world is your general fantasy world with a few new things added that you may or may not have seen before. The backgrounds have a subtle elegance to their artistic influence, from the massive scope of the mountains to the urban-style design of the city that our main characters live in. Character designs are quite colorful and eloquent in how beautiful they look, especially Hestia. Even if you have no taste in petite girls, Hestia will no doubt raise a few eyebrows, and maybe raise a few other things.\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi was surely a surprise for me to experience this Spring. Where it lacks from a story and mostly character standpoint, it succeeds in providing a fun action/hybrid anime with its stellar art and animation department and a great duo from Hestia and Bell-kun with their fantastic chemistry. It managed to tickle my action and ecchi bone enough for me to say that it was a worthwhile adventure to take part in. As far as experiences go, this is one where the journey itself is the fun part while the end of it makes you want to yearn for more. For me at least, I want more Hestia-chan in the future. Please?\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B",

Action is served up in droves but in an equal share comes a blandcast and a setting that doesn\u2019t exactly shout out originality.\\n\\n\r\nStory\\n\\n\r\nWe follow the journey of Bell Cranel. Bell is an \u2018adventurer\u2019, one who goes forth to the dungeon to seek fame and glory while putting their life on the line to do so. There he encounters the talented and renowned \u2018Sword Princess\u2019 Aiz Wallenstein. Suddenly he\u2019s love struck. With the help of his goddess Hestia, Bell sets out to conquer not only beasts but also his fear of approaching the girl of his dreams.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll put my positive first: This is that show that doesn\u2019t dwell on things for too long. Bell makes progression at a ridiculous rate but at least events keep coming and every episode feels fresh in some way. Different enemies provide a new challenge. Some of these enemies remind Bell of when he was weaker and it brings some painful memories. He has to overcome these grim reminders and apply the new knowledge he\u2019s learned to beat his enemies. Some also force him to change up his technique and get creative. For all its terrible harem schlock this is at least a nicely paced adventure. \\n\\n\r\nSome of the later episodes had some more interesting fights with more than just some crystals on the line. The cast also expands a little at that point, definitely to the show\u2019s benefit. At that point it really starts to feel like we are watching something interesting come together. There\u2019s also this sense that Bell is really fighting for something he wants and not simply hacking at things for no reason. That\u2019s where the praise ends in this department.\\n\\n\r\nHere\u2019s the problem: Bell doesn\u2019t truly earn anything in his line of adventuring. Everything that helps him become stronger is either served to him on a silver platter or overcome through some ridiculous newfound level of power. Through certain attributes Bell is rendered pretty much unbeatable and given an unfair boost of all other adventures. With that you say goodbye to almost all the tension this show creates within the dungeon. If something does hold Bell back it takes no time for him to find a way around it. Some methods he uses to do so are out of left field and not properly explained. When an explanation for them does arrive \u2013 very much out of the blue \u2013 it comes at a ridiculous moment. While it does excuse a lot of Bell\u2019s powerful capabilities, it\u2019s a double-edged sword. The plot armour simply stacks higher on him.\\n\\n\r\nAn early scene posits Bell as the runty adventurer who can\u2019t achieve anything and you get the sense that this could be a tough rise through the ranks. But before you know it he\u2019s making a name for himself in the field quicker than you know it. Why? Because of the power of love, which as we all know is far stronger than any physical material. How touching. Why couldn\u2019t his romance simply be a driving force instead of something that literally has the capability to bolster his stats?\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nWhile the story has redeemable moments, and is actually decently written, the characters reduce this show to a mess on many occasions. Let\u2019s start with our main man. Bell is just another run-of-the-mill anime MC. He\u2019s just\u2026 there. There\u2019s no background to his character to at least give us an idea of why he wants to take up adventuring in the first place. He\u2019s an example of the \u2018play it safe\u2019 approach to characters. By stripping him of any hard-hitting character faults he gains likeability but at the same time becomes a lot less interesting.\\n\\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the pint-sized goddess Hestia who has a bust size and a temperament trying to outdo each other in volume. As annoying as her character can be at least her affection for Bell, compared to the rest of the female cast, actually makes sense. Bell is her only familia member so it\u2019s understandable that she\u2019s going to be a little clingy. The writers play up this fact though to the point that it starts degrading her character. Hestia goes from someone looking for validation and purpose to being a paranoid stalker. A very, very annoying paranoid stalker. Top that off with an abundance of ridiculous fanservice involving her and it\u2019s a great way for me to stop taking a character\u2019s problems seriously. At times we get a peek into seeing a different side of her but it remains hidden in the shadows, presumably for that inevitable second season some time down the track.\\n\\n\r\nIt would also have been nice if the girl Bell desires so badly, Aiz, actually had some semblance of personality that makes her a worthy target of his affection. I guess she\u2019s a blonde, green-eyed beauty in questionably-designed armour who can swing a sword well. Sure she\u2019s got it on the looks front but the show never once makes me feel like she\u2019s worthwhile being the end goal of our main character \u2013 even taking into account the fact she\u2019s helped him out before in some tough situations. In defence of Aiz she at least isn\u2019t going completely head over heels for our white-haired friend. But in the face of that, she still feels like a soulless background object.\\n\\n\r\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I don\u2019t want a character study out of show about fighting beasts in dungeons and levelling up. You\u2019d not be of sound mind to want that. I just want something entertaining with a cast I really want to cheer on. More personality and overall likeability could have been breathed into the group. My problems are only made worse by the fact that every piece of comedy missed the mark. Considering it makes up a large portion of the show you can imagine my frustration when some comedic intervals just dragged on and on.\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nIf you value strong, interesting characters then this isn\u2019t for you. If you value the creation of original ideas and environments then this isn\u2019t for you. If watching a cardboard cut-out, danger-immune, overpowered main character whose presence makes every female he encounters flood the vicinity in juices of excitement while living with a four-foot god with a breast size that has the second half of the alphabet in its sights then this is for you.\\n\\n\r\nThe more people keep dishing praise on shows like these, the less encouragement we give studios to adapt exciting and challenging material or create interesting original works. I guess what sells, sells. DanMachi isn\u2019t remotely close to the worst shows I\u2019ve watched but it brings absolutely nothing new to the anime table. There are less memorable moments in this series then there are words in its own title.\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ll be nice enough to say that there were brief moments where I did sit enough and give it some attention. I can see why other people can enjoy it for longer periods than myself. There\u2019s flashy fights and some nicely animated sequences that even got a cynical man like me to sit up and say \u2018Yeah. That\u2019s alright\u2019. The story isn\u2019t going to blow your socks off but it never drags. The action keeps coming and the show rarely sits down for a breather. However I feel like a lot of the purpose of the world is kept locked away from us, which got on my nerves. There\u2019s characters pulling the strings from shadows but even as the show comes to a close we learn almost nothing new.\\n\\n\r\nI can stop hacking away at the show for a moment when it comes to the art department. With a J.C. Staff anime you know you\u2019re at least going to get some well-polished art and decent animation. Fights have plenty of impact and punch thanks to a combination sound and debris.  You can really feel the weight behind every sword swing, fist flying and rock scattering. The fights are clearly the show\u2019s strong point and the technical side of things have gone a long way to achieving that. \\n\\n\r\nSome may find entertainment in the fight choreography - a very fair point - but when a particular outcome always feels certain then I can\u2019t put myself in that boat. There is virtually no interesting complications character-wise. There\u2019s catering for every character trope imaginable. There\u2019s fan service ready to leap out at you from every corner. For everything that DanMachi does right it seems to do two other things wrong.\\n\\n\r\nIs it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? I still don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t know if I want to hang around longer to find out the answer.",

            "content": "**SPOILER FREE REVIEW**\r\nThe easiest way to sum up Is it Wrong to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon, or Danmachi for short, was eloquently put by Youtuber Demolition-D as \u201cSword Art Online: Fat-Fucking-Titties edition\u201d. Who am I to argue with such a flawless summation? There is no question about what Danmachi is; it\u2019s an otaku-pandering, self-insertion, video-game-inspired LN adaptation. The real question lies in whether you will love it for what it is, or hate it for what it is. In case you haven\u2019t guessed it by now, I fall into the latter category. This shallow, ridiculous, and remarkably unoriginal work is a good exampleof everything wrong with anime today. \\n\\n\r\nSynopsis: Bell Cranel is an adventurer; someone who explores dangerous dungeons and fights monsters for a living. He and his \u201cgoddess\u201d, which is basically a glorified manager, Hestia, make up the smallest \u201cfamilia\u201d in all the land. This is the story of Bell winning every fight he\u2019s ever been involved in one way or another, making every girl he comes into contact with fall in love with him despite his obvious lack of any charisma whatsoever, and gaining special abilities that nobody else can use for no discernable reason. In other words, it\u2019s your standard LN adaptation.\\n\\n\r\nDanmachi\u2019s plot is what you get when you take SAO\u2019s plot and crank it up a notch on the pandering scale. MORE fanservice. MORE blood. LARGER harems. MORE white-knighting from the protagonist. DOUCHIER side characters to make the protagonist look good by comparison. And, of course, LESS actual substance. It\u2019s seriously like someone looked at the already stupid LN video game formula and said \u201cHmmm, how do we make this even harder to take seriously?\u201d But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Let\u2019s start with the first reason Danmachi\u2019s plot is bad: plot armor and melodrama. Much like a battle shounen, it is painfully obvious in any video game LN adaptation that the MC is never actually in any danger. However, the show spares no expense in convincing you that he is using the cheapest tactics possible. Last second saves? Check. Asspulled power ups? Check. Deus ex machina? Check-aruney. The entirety of the plot consists of Bell and the other main characters being put it perilous situations that even the most na\u00efve of viewers can recognize will be resolved smoothly at the last second. Over and over and over again. It\u2019s bad writing, it\u2019s repetitive, and it\u2019s not entertaining.\\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s at this point in the review that I realize there were so many things wrong with the show that I don\u2019t even know what to talk about next. This may be a bizarre order of doing things, but now let\u2019s talk about Bell Cranel; the protagonist. Dear. God. What an annoying, insufferable, shallow, clich\u00e9d, gary-stu, self-insert, AWFUL character. When you talk about characters who might as well be literally Gandhi, you can go ahead and put this saint at the top of the list. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING would ever cause this guy to do something wrong or immoral. People can betray him, steal from him, assault him, whatever; he just takes the abuse like a proverbial Jesus Christ and instantly forgives all wrongdoings. After all, they wouldn\u2019t want to give off the impression that he is human or anything! Real people don\u2019t have flaws or negative emotions, right? It\u2019s SO much more interesting to have an idealized concept of all that is good in the world without an ounce of moral ambiguity so that otakus can fap to fantasies of the hundreds of sex objects that flock to his holy cock! Oh, and you better believe that he has special abilities that nobody else in the entire world has! It\u2019s not enough that he\u2019s the most righteous organism on planet Earth, but he also has a super special power that enables all of his skills to be as high as they possibly can AND enables him to level up faster than anyone else who has ever lived! Now, I want you to guess the explanation they give for why this makes sense; this is their GENIUS explanation for why Bell has this one-of-a-kind ability that makes him the most special person in all the land: BECAUSE HE\u2019S IN LOVE. \u2026OHHHHH! WELL THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE! FUCK. I mean... just\u2026 fuck. I won\u2019t even question it. In conclusion, Bell sucks. Moving on.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the trend of shallow, awful characters continues with the rest of the cast. Let\u2019s start by addressing the elephant in the room; Hestia. Fucking. Hestia. *Sigh\u2026 Just\u2026 why? I must be the ten-billionth person to ask this, but what the hell is the obsession with her? She is no different than any other 1 dimensional, big-boobed, harem-fodder nobody in a slutty outfit that allows us to instantly identify her as a sex-object, as if we wouldn\u2019t have figured it out anyway. The absolute best description you can give about Hestia is that she functions as comic relief, and I don\u2019t even think she\u2019s very funny. That brings us to Lili, the other 1-dimmensional sex object who occupies the loli, furry, and tortured fetishes all at the same time. Impressive writers. Very impressive. Fetish writers around the world will have to come up with an answer to that. Maybe if she was also a robot-childhood-friend? Anyway, I\u2019m not even going to mention the rest of the harem since they are completely one-dimensional and indistinguishable. Let\u2019s also go over the nameless side-characters; I feel the need to bring attention to the fact that Bell is the ONLY adventurer in the entire world who is not a tremendous asshole. The \u201cvillain\u201d adventurers have no depth at all, of course, but they are still made out as such blatantly awful people in order to FURTHER drive home the fact that Bell is Jesus. Not only is this lazy characterization, it\u2019s also blatantly black-and-white morality, which makes the show require even less thought. This is one of the worst character casts since, well, Sword Art Online.\\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s also take a moment to discuss how incredibly creative the monsters in this show are. Danmachi brings us such breathtaking and original monster designs such as, a bunny. A wolf. A minotaur. Oh, and who could forget the floor boss, \u201cliterally a titan from Attack on Titan\u201d? Truly masterful creativity from these animators. It\u2019s clear that a lot of work went into this show.\\n\\n\r\nThis is the paragraph where I planned on talking about how misogynistic this show is and how distracting the constant fan service is, but do I really need to give you that whole spiel? I already briefly talked about this stuff, and I feel like it\u2019s so obvious why these aspects of a show are flaws that I shouldn\u2019t need to explain it. Women with the obedience and dedication of slaves and no complexity whatsoever? It\u2019s every otaku\u2019s dream! And that\u2019s precisely why this show is going to make a ton of money.\\n\\n\r\nI could keep going. Really, I could. I could talk all day about what an awful betrayal of the basic fundamentals of writing this show is, but I think you get the idea. The reality is, a lot of people are going to like this show. A large percentage of anime fans are not at all bothered by anything I just mentioned, because for them, a self-insertion work is all they need. That\u2019s fine and dandy for them, but from my point of view, this show and all shows like it are cancer. Danmachi is the antithesis of the clever and intelligent shows that made me become a fan of the medium in first place; it\u2019s a brain-dead, effortless advertisement for the LN that ends incomplete. If you liked SAO or any other similar LN video game adaptation, you\u2019ll love Danmachi. Everyone else? STAY. AWAY. Far, FAR away.\\n",

            "content": "Danmachi is a textbook example of an anime that is truly a guilty pleasure in its own right. It doesn't have the most impressive writing, there are tons of clich\u00e9s and fanservice, and the pacing is sometimes questionable but even so it never ever fails to be entertaining, which is something I can't say for most anime.\r\nDanmachi follows a popular trend in recent years of having a setting that takes place entirely within an MMORPG game world. The difference this time however is that... it actually doesn't. Instead, the story takes place in the characters' real world, but their real world functions like a game.Adventurers gain experience points, earn loot, level up, gain skills and magic etcetera, but it all still takes place in their own actual reality. There is a magical dungeon which adventurers go to in search for treasure in order to make a living for themselves. They have to fight the local monsters found inside the dungeon in order to get the loot to drop, and in the process they level up, gain experience and become stronger. Pretty simple. It's a quite fresh take on what is otherwise a somewhat overused concept in recent years.\\n\\n\r\nThe story begins when a young rookie adventurer named Bell Cranel one day gets his life saved by a female swordmaster within the dungeon. Her name is Ais Wallenstein, a quiet, airheaded yet very powerful woman whom Bell instantly falls in love with. He sets a goal for himself to become stronger so that he one day might be worthy to stand beside Ais as an equal. Upon doing this, he gains a unique ability which makes him gain experience points at an unbelievable rate as long as he stays true to those feelings of affection.\\n\\n\r\nBell is an extremely shy and innocent boy, but also a very passionate one. What I like about him is that he actually feels like a real human being. He's not a typical self-insert imbalanced protagonist like Kirito (even if they do have the same voice actor), nor is he a generic shounen lead relying on nakama power. Rather he comes across as a very kind-hearted person who truly cares for those he's close to, and will do anything to help them in any way he can. He's someone you can genuinely relate to and cheer for during his struggles, and given the nature of Danmachi's dungeon crawling oriented storyline, that's a pretty important factor.\\n\\n\r\nThe female lead on the other hand would be the poster girl of the 2015 anime fanart community, namely the illustrious goddess Hestia; perhaps the only character ever who somehow ended up more famous than the series  which she actually comes from. There are numerous reasons for her insane popularity outbreak. For one, she's an oppai loli, which is an incredibly rare sight in anime regardless of series, but she's also an incredibly energetic, fun and loveable genki girl who keeps breathing life into the show and makes it interesting for the viewer. She's madly in love with Bell, but she doesn't try to hide it any way whatsoever. She keeps dropping hints everywhere that she just wants him to push her down already, but of course Bell doesn't pick up on this very well\u2026 because you know, protagonists in anime don't do that for whatever reason. Lastly of course there's the unmistakable outfit and boob string she wears which took the internet by storm so hard it became an actual fashion trend in real life Japan, but I'm sure you know all about that by now. Anyway, as a goddess Hestia is the leader of a \"Familia\" which operates more or less like a Guild in your typical RPG, where Bell is the only other member, and thus they spend their lives together in a rundown church, barely scraping by with what little money they can earn. Watching the pair of them living their unorthodox lives together never fails to make me smile.\\n\\n\r\nThen there's half a dozen other girls as well, either side characters or main characters introduced later on in the story who also conveniently enough end up falling in love with Bell (shocking, I know) so Danmachi is definitely a harem in the end even if MAL might not have it tagged as one. That being said it doesn't really focus on the harem elements all that much; it's mostly a secondary factor. The main attention is pretty much always on the adventuring aspect itself.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot progression of Danmachi is fairly straightforward. It basically follows Bell's struggles as well as how his relationships progress with the other adventurers he ends up encountering during them. You can probably imagine what a shounen adventure anime about RPG dungeon crawling is like, and that image is probably dead on as far as Danmachi is concerned. What I really like about it though is how it manages to present the dungeon as an environment. It actually feels threatening and ominous the deeper you get inside it. Have you ever ended up in a zone that is way too difficult for your character's current level when playing an RPG, and you can't manage to find a way to get back out alive? I mean in the kind of game where you only have one life, or at least you really can't afford to die? That's kind of the same feeling as Danmachi manages to give off to the viewer. As a result, the harder fights in the story feel awfully tense and relatable to any somewhat experienced gamer watching it.\\n\\n\r\nAdaptation-wise, Danmachi is honestly pretty rushed as it spans a whole 5 light novel volumes in just 13 episodes. Yet despite that I never really felt like it was too much of a problem. Somehow, someway even from an anime-only standpoint the plot feels perfectly coherent and understandable. In fact as far as enjoyment value goes I'd even say I liked the anime *more* than the novels, because a) the fight scenes come across better animated, and b) Hestia's character is *way* more likeable in the anime. Yes, there is a lot of content from the novels that is skipped, but it feels like it didn't hurt the overall story very much to leave it out either, so it works out anyway. The only thing the anime occasionally lacks is some proper explanations of certain skills' and items' functionalities, but other than that I don't have a whole lot to complain about.\\n\\n\r\nAll-in-all, Danmachi is far from a masterpiece, yet given the premise I think it delivers a lot more than most people probably expected coming into it. The story has most definitely been done before, but Danmachi adds its own twist to it and more importantly it does it *well*. It goes to show that with proper execution, a time-tested concept is still perfectly viable, and as a result it provides an anime that always leaves you with a smile on your face. Call it generic or shallow or whatever, but that doesn't change the fact that it's easily one of the most entertaining anime of the year thus far. And really, when it all comes down to it... that's essentially all that matters.",

My Breastia Can't Be This Cute\r\na.k.a. Not SAO \r\nis the latest anime to follow the video game trend that's become increasingly popular within the anime medium. These video game type series, usually MMORPG based, have gotten so commonplace in the last handful of years that they're starting to form their own sub-genre altogether, in a similar fashion to the \"moe/cute girls doing cute things\" craze in the mid-2000s. With an easy premise to understand, little to nothing tocomprehend story-wise, and a \"turn your brain off\" level of entertainment value, DanMachi was tailor-made for mainstream success. But whatever integrity it may have had was lost somewhere in the creases of blue boob ribbons. If Maslow's Pyramid were ever accommodated to show the level of quality a title holds, DanMachi would presumably fall somewhere in the lower segments. This isn't to say that the show doesn't retain some sort of value, but in the bigger scheme of things, it's as significant as the crusty end slice of a loaf of bread. \\n\\n\r\nBrief synopsis: Set in a world that functions and operates like an MMORPG, we follow Bell Cranel, residential pussy protagonist and one in many self-proclaimed \"adventurers\" that strive to become the best of the best. These adventurers are aided by Gods/Goddesses who descended from the heavens to live among them. With one God/Goddess being the leader, many adventurers join them to form a guild (or for modern day standards, they're essentially a gang). After a chance encounter with another adventurer named Aiz \"no personality\" Wallenstein, or better known the world over as the \"Sword Princess,\" our protagonist is motivated to become a better adventurer, if only for a chance to woo her over in the future. With the aid of his Goddess Loli Big Boo\u2014 Hestia, he sets off on his journey to do just that. \\n\\n\r\nDespite what the paint-by-numbers premise would have you believe, DanMachi doesn't seem to understand the construct of its own narrative. Beyond just meeting regulatory standards, the actual story and content itself never quite mesh. It tries to tell a coming-of-age tale, but our protagonist is never shown going through any of the proper stages of character progression usually associated with this kind of narrative. Instead of seeing him make mistakes to later learn from them, all of his conflicts are overcome by the writers splooging out dues ex machinas at every given turn. His advancements aren't earned through hard work and determination but are simply handed to him on a silver platter, making him yet another \"chosen one\" figurehead who's nuts haven't dropped, yet finds himself winning every battle like he's the spawn of Guts and Chuck Norris.\\n\\n\r\nWhy rally for a protagonist if the outcome is always the same? Why portray him as a struggling newbie when he's merely going to gain powerful abilities and weaponry without any foreshadowing towards it? The show quite literally writes in a new power-up every other episode (no I'm not kidding, see spoiler section below), so by the time we're at the halfway point, he's practically outpaced most of the seasoned adventurers set in the same world. This could have been done in a more believable fashion had they given any of sort of proper explanation behind these events, but DanMachi makes no attempts to do so. It shrugs off all accountability and goes back to dangling boob strings like a set of shiny car keys to keep the audiences distracted from the underhanded ploy taking place. \\n\\n\r\nWhat the show does have going for it, however, is the setting itself. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of DanMachi doesn't waste time debuting its features, with a medieval/high fantasy inspired architecture, it creates an interesting subculture, being anachronistic in its implementation, yet obtuse concept-wise since gaming mechanics are treated as much of a central pillar as its Middle Ages inspiration. Since the game aspects are as much of a part of real life to the inhabitants of DanMachi's universe, it's quite easy to buy into the world from the get-go. There's a weird amalgamation of game physics and natural world properties that the show fully embraces; it's grounded in our universe but slightly left-of-center given that game stats and leveling up is treated with the same sense of normalcy that gravity is. This includes adventurers that have to kill monsters to generate income and possibly to keep regular civilians safe. When they defeat these monsters, gems are left behind from their carcass (similar to most MMORPGs). And while the world mechanics and how things function were never explained to any reasonable amount of detail, the implied base knowledge that most viewers would have going in as to how these games work made it feel suitable despite its tendency to underwrite the parameters of its fantasy elements.\\n\\n\r\nDoes the prospect of killing monsters and taking gems out their hides for a line of profession make sense? Well no, of course not. But was it fun? Yea, it sure was. For an anime that borrows its world functions from video games, DanMachi accomplishes what it had set out to do. It didn't place any further foresight as to how the macroeconomics of its world operates but that's fine since no one was expecting it to do so in the first place.\\n\\n\r\nWhat I was expecting, however, was better pacing, to be more specific, pacing that wasn't the equivalency of the show trying to belch out the alphabet in one breath. After the introductory episodes (1-3) in which the show maintained a steady pace, it then began to rush through plot points and character introductions at breakneck speeds. Where we were initially given a few episodes to establish the person's backstory, personality, and motivation, the show later attempts the same kind of effort in just one episode. It's as if the show had plans for 2-Cours and was later informed by the studio heads that they canceled plans for the 2nd season, and in a state of panic, the creators condensed everything in its screenplay into whatever schedueled episodes they had left. It's jarring, to say the least, doubly so when plot points are whizzing by without any proper setup or payoff. Shit sorta just... happens. \\n\\n\r\nBut what did have staying power was a pair of underage sweater puppies. The kind of visual eye-candy that's predestined to overshadow the rest of the characters involved. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters of DanMachi is of your garden variety, with many having indistinguishable personality traits from other shows. Our protagonist, Bell Cranel, is your typical dense bishounen beta-male who always strive to do the right thing. The kind of boy scout character that you just want to strangle repeatedly for his unrealistic amount of idealism. And like most protagonists of this ilk, he too has the uncanny ability to attract every female character in the series for no real reason whatsoever. But he isn't the one that the show would be remembered for, that honor lies with Hestia. \\n\r\nIn the same way that Yuno Gasai is more popular than the show she's a part of, so too is DanMachi's mascot, Hestia. Infamous for her boob ribbon, Breastia has become the subject matter of many fan arts, sending manchildren the world over clambering for their body pillows. With a bubbly personality and an extreme infatuation for our pussy protagonist, she's ideal power fantasy material for anyone that chooses to self-insert themselves into the show. The only \"depth\" found here is in the endless cleavage birthed from her unnaturally huge milk jugs. A character who's only purpose is to serve as someone's 2D desktop waifu. But even this cheap trophy-wife model offers more to like than the show's designated love interest. \\n\r\nAiz Wallenstein, the girl of Bell's affection, does not compute emotion. With the personality of a brick wall and the combat ability of a one-man-army, she's mostly just an idolized Mary Sue placed in the story to be Bell's object of admiration. Outside of that, her nonpresence has made her nothing but a goal for Bell to reach. \\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is mostly forgettable tag-along members that fall into one of three camps:\\n\\n\r\na.) another female for Bell's harem\\n\r\nb.) another female for Bell's harem\\n\r\nc.) Welf Crozzo, the one trick pony\\n\\n\r\nSimilar to how underbaked the character writing was, the production as a whole also underperformed.\\n\\n\r\nThe presentation of DanMachi is a mixed bag of passable to awful. There are moments where the show boasts decently-choreographed action scenes that get you pumped up, only to be followed up by jarring CGI monsters and choppy animation. This lack of consistency can be contributed to J.C.Staff's workload, as they were also adapting Shokugeki no Soma during the same period they worked on DanMachi, which could have resulted in an improper allocation of manpower. The art, for the most part, was appealing, with suitable color choices that made the landscapes and characters pop. The peppy tone in which the characters moved and carefree disposition in how its world was colored to life helped compensate where other departments failed. \\n\\n\r\nAs far as the soundtrack was concerned, there isn't much to say. The opening theme is your standard j-pop track, far from distinctive when placed in a crowd, and could easily be replaced without making so much of a difference. And like most medieval fantasy shows before it, this too has a very standard soundtrack, using all the bells and whistles you'd expect from something trying to portray that period. That basic Celtic music in pub/Inn settings and those usual orchestral choir sections during fight scenes. It's all very standard. And that's basically DanMachi in a nutshell, a show trying to portray things it can't fully grasp and coming off middling because of it. \\n\\n\\n\r\n****SPOILER SECTION******\\n\\n\r\nBecause of the erratic pacing and contrived plotting, every other episode of Danmachi has the main character receiving a power-up of some sort. 1st we find out that he has \"unlimited potential,\" in other words, he's a borderline overpowered beta-male. And then, only two episodes later, he's handed another powerful weapon that he never earns. By the 5th episode, he gets a book that conveniently teaches him fire magic. And if that wasn't enough, he gets an ability to KO any opponent as a last ditch final attack only a few episodes after. And this trend of gaining a new advantage never stops either, happening all the way up to the very finale of the show, robbing the purpose behind even creating a coming-of-age story. The show actively fights against the idea of earned rewards. And to put the icing on the shit cake, we find out he's a Demigod as well, as if being plot armored and overpowered wasn't enough of a buffer.\\n\\n\r\nAnd then there were introductions to people that amount to nothing at all.\\n\\n\r\nFor example, characters like Welf Crozzo was given a backstory, motivation and character introduction within one episode just to serve the role of a plot device. A character whose entire purpose in the narrative is to be Bell's blacksmith, yet is marketed as a defining side character despite the rushed-job given to indoctrinate him into the group. This isn't just an isolated incident either, as every character introduced after the third episode mark is simply pushed off an assembly line with no time given to even let the \"archetype\" that is their paint to dry. \\n\\n\r\nSo at the end of the day, you're not watching this because it has something to offer, you're watching it because there's nothing else to do. \\n\\n\r\n****END OF SPOILERS****\\n\\n\\n\r\nGoing into DanMachi, all I expected to get out of it was easy-to-consume entertainment, and that's precisely what I got. Because of its simplistic story and surface-level depiction, I never felt frustrated watching it since the show never gave me a reason to care, to begin with. \\n\\n\r\nWith DanMachi, what you see is what you get. It's a show that isn't trying to be more than what it is and is honest about that. And while that's a commendable attribute, it just isn't enough to be anything more than just that. It's easygoing content that offers nothing else when it's all said and done. DanMachi is the intermission title you watch before watching your next \"must watch\" series. An anime that will forever be remembered for a pair of loli boobs than it will for anything else.",

            "content": "Danmachi is an anime made to be simple. First of all, you won't see anything complex here. I see it as one of the budget anime, where there's nothing special about it, but it sells. It feels like sao season 3, just with more fan service. The purpose that I've found of Danmachi, is to serve as a passtime, and relaxation after you've exhausted the list of must watch anime, or if you want something \"casual\".\r\nRight at the start, there is a narration, that quickly shows you a bit of how the world works. Later on, in the first episode you will of course findout more.  What you will be finding out is, that that world is basically an RPG. It doesn't say anything about this being a game, but it simply works like that. People that aren't gamers probably won't understand most of the stats, leveling and item thingies. There are adventurers, that follow certain goddesess, which lost their divine power, just to have fun with mortals. The purpose is to conquer the Dungeon that is in the center of the world, and beat all the bosses. Doesn't sound like anything special, does it? Feels like you're watching someone else play an MMORPG, since everything is very easy-going. \\n\\n\r\n*Minor spoilers in this paragraph\\n\r\nThe adventurer that we are following is Bell Cranel. He is a guy that is naive, wants to be a hero, good mannered. But he's STUPID. The first scene we meet him, is when he was being chased down, just to see him soon saved from the strongest adventurer there is, that is supposedly a female. After being saved, he falls in love with her, and his motive is, I MUST GET STRONGER JUST TO REACH HER. Later on I will talk more about her. Soon after we meet his goddess, that is Hestia. I can describe her very quickly. Loli, with boobs, and throughout the entire series, you will only see her going after Bell. This serves to stop Bell from ending up with anyone. Hilarity ensues, except i didn't find it that funny, because it's the most stupid love triangle. Instead of bell going for the one that is extremely caring for him, he chases the strongest female, that turns out to be an airhead which we will see later on. And because it is all like that, the dialog is extremely stupid, leading to nothing. If they're not talking about adventure, they're talking about how the sky is beautiful or something like that. Another stupid character he meets, his supporter, living in the guild with the most ridiculous motive (more wine!). She has a very inconsistent personality. At first she wants to scam Bell, for his items. She accidentally falls down, the weapon gets out, and miraculously, that happens in front of a good character related to Bell. Cheap trick just to get the supporter some forced character development. Bell soon gets it back, without him noticing anything, 'cause it's Bell! Soon after witnessing her betray him again before his very own eyes, and she tells him that she already betrayed him once before, Bell forgives her, risks his live to save her, and the harem increases. On the question why? He answers that he didn't know (but he does! The writer told him, that he will gain a new motive; protect thine friends!) Most of the characters are plot devices that lead to a boring story.\\n\\n\r\nBell cranel has a Premium account, and he's the only one. He's the chosen one, and while the world seems very balanced, Bell with his unstable personality, manages to do great things, and beat monsters, that realistically speaking, if the world is based on stats, his weapons should just break. What's the point in stats and leveling, if it doesn't even show how powerful someone is. But he gets an ability, that makes it impossible to lose. Literally impossible, even though it is not instant. He's just beating everything through out his screams, that sound really good. He isn't a chicken Gary Stu like i describe him, he first falls, and than comes back, it isn't like he's god mode walking through everything. He also sees invisible people because he feels their eyes on him, perfect logic. Premium account, or hacker? You decide! \\n\\n\r\nThe fights are very good, not anti-climatic, they also have very nice music, and sounds, and are also animated extremely well. There's even a lot of blood going, and you can feel really well how the monsters get sliced up. The music is really epic, but the opening is just, no. It feels like it is for some slice of life show. It should sound more adrenaline pumping and exciting not like this. The music is at it's peak in the fights as i mentioned. And this is one of the few anime where i really enjoy the fights. Even though they're just shit Bell has to go through. However, the art and character designs are not well done for 2015, but they aren't terrible. \\n\\n\r\nI didn't talk about all the characters, since most of them exist just to be there. Nothing to talk about them, since they don't do much for the plot. Even though it is all cliched, by my point of view, i usually don't like this stuff, and would rate this even lower. The only special thing about Danmachi is that it is not boring to watch; it's so easy-going with many flaws.  It's like so simple, that it is fun in the same time, it gives off some kind of a nice feeling. If it is nice why is it only 4? Because the characters, are mostly annoying, and the story is just shit Bell goes through, without him receiving any character development.\\n\\n\r\nI've just stated in this Review mostly how I feel about it. It is of course possible for people to enjoy this. Since it is, like I mentioned, very simple. If it isn't objectively good, it doesn't mean it won't be fun. With being simple, and the way the pacing is easy-going, together with intense battles, there is no sin if you enjoy it. It doesn't try much to be what it isn't, and I didn't give 4 since it failed, rather because i didn't like it. Since i usually burn this kind of anime down and I didn't really hate it as much as I could, most people would still find much more enjoyment in Danmachi than me.",

            "content": "Dungeon ni Deai wo Motome..... Or DanMachi for short(What is with all the anime shows with long ass titles nowadays?), was an anime that aired last season that sparked a tiny bit of attention, probably due to the fact that it has the fantasy/romance/adventure tags and it shared some similarities with SAO. Being one of the most controversial shows of the spring season, I noticed that many people are giving high ratings for it, 7, 8, and higher. While everyone is entitled to their opinions, after watching all 13 episodes, I have concluded that DanMachi is deserving of a 5/10, which might be low tosome people, but I think it's fair for what DanMachi was able to offer. \\n\\n\r\nSTORY: The plot of the show is actually very simple. To summarize it, the story follows Bell Cranel, a newbie adventurer who strives to become stronger in order to catch up to the girl he likes who is also an adventurer. With the support of his goddess Hestia, they both go on a journey to achieve their goals through dungeon exploration and encounters with other adventurers. First, I'll start out with the bad points. I'll be blunt. The story does not go anywhere. It may look like it, but it really doesn't. The whole story is supposed to be showcasing Bell and Hestia's journey, how he reaches his goal of becoming stronger, with the support of his goddess. But the thing is, Bell was already strong to start with. There wasn't one part where Bell failed. I won't give any specific details, but every time he encountered a new problem or enemy, he would almost fall or give up, but he just got stronger in every situation and pulled something out of his ass each time. In all seriousness though, because of this, there really wasn't much story development in that respect. Bell is already strong, and we just see him get even stronger and nothing really changes story wise. It's a typical anime cliche, which we have seen a lot in shounen. The plot is basically, \\n\r\nbeat enemy - make friends - get even stronger - beat enemy - make more friends \\n\r\nAnd the cycle continues. The other issue is the story has some plotholes. What I mean by that is nothing is really explained. We are given an introduction into this world of adventure, filled with dungeons, monsters, magic, weapons and so forth. It's interesting and grabs your attention, but the information they give is very vague, if they gave any at all. And then as you watch through the show you are left with a bunch of questions which can distract from entire story. You might be able to figure things out by piecing information together, but it would have been much better if they made some aspects of the story and setting clear, which would have strengthen the foundation of the show. There are also times where the goal of the plot is forgotten. They threw in some romance in attempt to push the story forward, but that aspect of it goes nowhere and is completely ignored after the first and second episodes, which was the main reason Bell wanted to get stronger in the first place, and they changed it to him wanting to boost his stats. The ending was also unsatisfying and didn't make much sense.  Anyways, if there is anything that DanMachi does well with it's story is bringing something new each episode. Whether it's a new battle with a new enemy, or the characters shopping in the town, each episode has something that sets it apart from the rest and keeps it refreshing. There are also some small side character arcs which help in keeping your interest. Besides that, DanMachi's plot has quite a few flaws, more than good. The show can also feel overdramatic, but despite all that, with the fantasy/adventure aspect along with the some comedy, makes it a lot easier to watch. \\n\\n\r\nART/ANIMATION: I thought the animation/art was good. The details of the characters, setting, weapons, and even the monsters were all done well. Colors were nice and bright, and  the action scenes were clear and fluid. There really wasn't anything I found myself uncomfortable with, I think it's around the quality you would expect from an anime show in 2015. \\n\\n\r\nMUSIC/SOUND: Th music in the show I wouldn't say is very distinct, or something that I would listen to outside of the anime, but I thought the soundtracks were fitting of the show and the setting that we were dealing with. I also enjoyed the opening song, I found myself wanting to actually listen to it instead of skipping it. I can't say so much about the ending, but the OP was enjoyable I found. Other than that, there isn't anything particularly memorable that I would want to listen too all the time. The main characters voices, Hestia and Bell, got annoying at some point though and I got tired of hearing them. But it really depends on you. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER: Honestly, the characters were mediocre. As the MC's, we have Bell and Hestia, and then we have many supporting characters, including Crozzo, Arde, Wallenstein, Eina, Ryu, Freya, to name some of the more important ones. DanMachi actually has quite an arrange of characters, but there are some issues revolving around them. For example, Bell is really just your standard MC. He wants to be a hero, and he tries way too hard to get you to like him. We are given little background about why he wants to be an adventurer, and he's given all these positive qualities which just makes him all the less interesting. Not to mention the fact that he is over powered, when compared to many other characters in the show(besides Wallenstein), as he has this extreme growth rate and skills which no one else has which pretty much makes him stronger than everyone else and gives him the ability to get to pull through any dire situation. Hestia, the other MC, can be described with one word. ANNOYING. In the beginning of the show, she was actually a fun character to watch, mainly because of the dynamics between her and Bell. As a goddess who is looking after him, it is evident that she really cares for Bell and wants to help him reach his goals. This side of her is what makes her stick out as a character, and her interactions with Bell can be quite cute, and she adds a lot of humor to the show. At some point though she does get annoying because she starts becoming a stalker instead, and getting very paranoid when Bell interacts with other girls. At that point she becomes an annoying stalker with enormous boobs. Then there is Wallenstein, who Bell supposedly likes, but nothing ever develops between them as the driving force of the story changed. Wallenstein can be described as one of your cool, composed characters with striking beauty. But to summarize her character, she's as airhead who shows no emotion whatsoever and can kick ass. She really had no personality, which in turn made no sense why Bell would have been attracted to her. I think she would have been a really cool character if she actually showed some emotion and was clear about her feelings, but she's a dead character from what I can tell which is disappointing. Besides that, there are many other characters that are actually way more interesting, but sadly any sort development was shafted through the show. We do get hear/see some of the characters backstories and motives, but none of them were fleshed out enough to really bring out the characters. The only time we get any real development is through the small arcs with some of the supporting characters, like Lili. Other than that, we can see some slight change within the characters, but none of it was touched on, and we don't get much depth. There are also characters like Freya, who played a part in the story and were shown frequently, but their motives were never revealed and as characters they were never touched on. \\n\\n\r\nOVERALL/ENJOYMENT: Overall, I'd say DanMachi is just another average anime. There isn't anything that makes it good or stand out, but I wouldn't put it off as complete garbage. The atmosphere and setting of the show keep it interesting, enough to make you watch it and get through it without wanting to punch your computer screen or drop it. It is to say that it wasn't as good as I expected it to be either, but some part of me enjoyed it, probably due to the similarity it shares with SAO. Anywho, if you're thinking about watching this, go for it. If you enjoy fantasy and action, then you may like this more than I do. Just for your information though, don't be deceived by the title, it is not wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon, but the MC never picks up one if that's what you are thinking. \\n\\n\\n\\n",

It's also old and not how I would've written it nowadays, but since it's \"helpful\" I'm obligated to keep it but not obligated enough to watch this show again to refresh my knowledge and polish the review. So, you know, have fun but don't talk to me about it.]\r\nSo, I\u2019m gonna do my first review on something dangerous. Something with a lot of fans, and a lot of haters. One side will hate you regardless, unless you can squeeze yourself in the middle somehow.\r\nSadly, no. No, Icannot. You already know which side I\u2019ve chosen. I did not like Danmachi, so much that I won\u2019t even bother copy/pasting its (ridiculous) full name.\\n\\n\r\nFrankly, it\u2019s nothing more than a cashgrab, one that doesn\u2019t make me feel bad about all the anime torrents and unofficial websites that everyone outside of Japan uses. It\u2019s the perfect money-maker. You have a modern, popular concept with a general, an average shounen protagonist, and some nice, juicy fanservice to make sure you don\u2019t look away and so the merchandise sells. Oh, and we\u2019ll throw in some blood as well. It worked for Attack on Titan, so we might as well.\\n\\n\r\nDanmachi does nothing to separate itself from anything. It\u2019s simply a watered-down action/adventure anime meant to please those who ride on the most popular anime, for those who are easily amused. Like a Taylor Swift song. I\u2019d try to tell you to not watch it, but who am I kidding. It\u2019s already gonna have a fuckton of seasons, so it already won. GG Danmachi.\\n\\n\r\nWell, we\u2019re already this far in, so let\u2019s start talking about it.\\n\\n\r\nThe story.\\n\r\nDanmachi takes place in a fantasy city with its most notable feature being the dungeon: a tower that stretches so high that it disappears into the clouds. \u2026Did I lose you there? Yes, the dungeon is a damn TOWER, no matter how many times it\u2019s referred to as a dungeon, or how many times you actually see someone go DOWN in the dungeon. Either this tower is not actually the dungeon and is instead some random point in the setting that the camera likes to see, or nobody really knows what a dungeon is. \\n\r\nWell, hey, the world itself seems to be pretty weird. I mean, the people here have actual stats and levels, like an RPG. Except this only seems to apply for combat in the dungeon, at least from what I heard. And generally, people that fight in the dungeon are only those who have received powers from a god. I\u2019m assuming this is the only area of civilization in this series\u2019 entire world, since actual gods and goddesses seem to put a huge focus on it, and they basically have their own currency and everything. Iiiiit\u2019s a small world aaaafter all\u2026\\n\\n\r\nAnd now, cue the main character, believe it! Kirito is a young man with the simple ambition of becoming stronger! He truly is an hero, because when the going gets tough, he always has a convenient way out! \u2026Wait, what? Oh, sorry. I meant Bell. Not Kirito. Same rules apply, though. Bell, who even has Kirito\u2019s voice actor, is your basic protagonist. He wants an adventure, he wants to be stronger, he\u2019s heroic, he\u2019s fighting for recognition, and he\u2019ll never give up on it! Believe it!! Overall, this is just the start of Bell\u2019s adventure into an underground sky tower, so a lot of results are just him getting something, from power-up to party member. In the most basic sense, it\u2019s nothing special. In a more specific sense, it\u2019s still nothing special.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest can essentially be summed up as \u201cshit happens\u201d, which can be expected when there\u2019s nothing really at stake in the plot. Bell and his partner Hestia seem to be just fine in their small house, but I guess it\u2019s just not enough so LET\u2019S GO KILL THINGS. Oh, and Bell wants senpai to notice him. Really, I just laugh that Bell works so hard to get attention from some emotionless girl who saved him a couple times, and then casts aside the girl who\u2019s constantly supported him. Priorities. \\n\r\nBut along with Bell\u2019s dumb, pointless motives are his abilities, his ways out. His growth in strength is LITERALLY determined by his emotions in battles. Basically \u201cdo it 4 da waifu\u201d. There\u2019s one fight towards the end where he fights someone that can turn invisible. Why this person isn\u2019t like the strongest person in the show is beyond me, but anyway Bell ends up defeating him because he could \u201cfeel his eyes on him\u201d. Okay, Bell. Sure. It\u2019s not like this crap is uncalled for, though, because the plot itself has predictable outcomes. I mean, call me crazy, but I think the person that smirked darkly at the end of a scene MIGHT be up to no good. But first, a word from the main villain on what she\u2019s about to do.\\n\\n\r\nBut you know what really makes me displeased? The characters.\\n\\n\r\nBell Cranel, the main character. A young man with the goal of becoming stronger, inspired by his dead family member! Truly riveting! 10/10 character! No, he\u2019s just some typical, beginning adventurer who likes to play the hero. Nothing else. But what I actually hate is that this show tries SO HARD to get you to like him. In the pilot episode, there\u2019s a scene where some asshole in a bar starts ranting about how utterly terrible Bell is, not knowing that Bell is like 10 feet away. This scene goes on for MINUTES, just blabbing about Bell being a scrublord tomato dork who will never have his dream girlfriend as his girlfriend. I can feel Danmachi\u2019s cold, dead hands grabbing me by the shoulders yelling \u201cFEEL BAD! LOVE HIM! LOVE HIIIIIIIIM!\u201d as it shakes me violently. It not only wants you to feel bad, but makes you want to be him, as he tries to be the badass hero you dreamed about in your early childhood, only this time he has a fair supply of titties surrounding him. I think I\u2019ve complained enough about him. Let\u2019s move on to the other lead.\\n\\n\r\nHestia. Oh my god. I heard about this character before I heard about the actual anime. I saw the dumb hestia.dance thing and that she was \u201chestia bestia\u201d or some shit. I hate whoever is responsible for this. Hestia became unbearably annoying by the show\u2019s end. She obviously loves and supports Bell, who lacks the brainpower to actually realize that, and she becomes clingy and gets mad whenever Bell\u2019s around one of his many harem members. In context, this isn\u2019t a recipe for disaster or anything, but it\u2019s so overdone that it gets ridiculous. Hell, she\u2019s ruined some scenes entirely, like one time where Bell and Aiz have a conversation by themselves, only to be interrupted by Hestia yelling at Bell, including some 5-10 minute long scream. It was the 592nd time that I\u2019ve contemplated suicide. Really, I want to know what is so appealing about this character beyond the fanservice. She\u2019s literal, walking fanservice, and even then you can find much better. I mean, come on.\\n\\n\r\nLiliruca: a furry with one of the most ridiculous and idiotic backstories I\u2019ve ever heard. Her familia does everything for wine, basically. And as for herself, she couldn\u2019t cut it as an adventurer, so she became a supporter instead. Despite the name, it\u2019s apparently so useless that she was bullied for being one, despite being kept around. Basically, her backstory is that people are assholes to a facepalming degree, and she therefore takes it out on the first honest person she meets. What a nice girl.\\n\\n\r\nAiz. There\u2019s nothing to say about this character, really. She\u2019s strong, Bell loves her, and that\u2019s about it. She\u2019s some quiet, passive person who doesn\u2019t show any real personality. She herself seems to have the pointless goal of getting stronger for no reason, so at least they have something in common I guess.\\n\\n\r\nAnyone else doesn\u2019t get enough screentime to be worth mentioning. And now I\u2019ll throw in the flavor parts.\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is actually pretty decent. It didn\u2019t exactly jump out at me, but there were times where it got my attention enough. The opening is absolutely garbage, though, I mean there are bad shows with great openings so I\u2019m not biased, but it is seriously one of the most lackluster openings I\u2019ve heard in a while. The ending theme isn\u2019t very interesting either, but I\u2019d be a liar if I said I actually cared about ED\u2019s. Then you have the visuals, which are pretty solid. I\u2019m not a master judge in this part, so all I can tell you is that it\u2019s not bad.\\n\\n\r\nI think I\u2019ve covered what I need to say. Danmachi is just not worth your time if you want to take something seriously. Even if you\u2019re super casual and into the basics like Fairy Tail and Bleach, I still encourage you to shy away from this and expand your horizons. But who am I to say what you can\u2019t like? I for one certainly did not this, though. The 2/10 I gave it may or may not be fair based on my comments, but most of all it\u2019s given this score to note it as one of my least favorite anime, ever. Of course, I don\u2019t flat-out expect you to agree, and if this was poorly written instead of being just disagreeable, there\u2019s a helpful/unhelpful button. After all I am inexperienced in both watching and reviewing, but I hope I have at least some merit in my words. Regardless, thank you for your time.",

            "content": "\"Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon\" is a goddamn abomination. JC Staff capitalizing on the video game anime craze was already a flag, but to go this far... is pathetic. This is every anime you have ever seen. This is everything wrong with anime. This anime is the exact reason why anime is ostracized at face value. This is what anime viewers should be trying to stop.\r\nThere is a story. It is hyper-simplistic. So stupid that anyone could understand it. Yet the plot points make little to no sense. The main character Bell Cranel starts his adventures with his well-endowed companion,the goddess Hestia. Why this girl is supposed to be Hestia I have no clue. She does nothing Hestia-esque. Her character design has nothing to do with Hestia. She's blatantly an oversexualized little girl with a bra made out of string. A quick aside - bras made out of string do not exist. They do not exist because they do not work. \\n\\n\r\nSo Bell Cranel and his representative goddess have to go into a dungeon to, like, do adventures or something (unexplained). But Bell Cranel is very weak so every episode an unforeshadowed deus ex machina pops out of nowhere and saves him. There is no character progression and no power scaling boundaries set. Then things get really crazy, because the bad guy gives Bell Cranel a very strong power for no reason at all.\\n\\n\r\nThe bad guy gives the main character super powers for an unexplained reason. All of the main characters powers are given to him for an unexplained reason. The villain, the evil character, the bad guy gives the protagonist, the good guy, the hero, his super powers. The rest of the anime is spent on everyone being impressed that the main character has super powers. Please note that it is completely unexplained why the bad guy gives the good guy his super powers. And why he can just have super powers. \\n\\n\r\nAnd of course there is a harem. Of course the camera angles settle on poorly animated breasts whenever a girl is on the screen. Of course the fight scenes are embarrassing and the main character has to use his unexplained super power to kill the bad guy. I have no clue if this is supposed to be an underdog story or not because Bell Cranel is so overpowered yet everyone in the world wants to help him. Everything is contradictory.\\n\\n\r\nThe writing is abysmal. It is the worst writing I have seen in anime in a while. Every single character is an archetypal character with an archetypal backstory. There are three episodes spent on the lolita character they introduce in the middle of the season that are obvious and cringe worthy in terms of direction. You knew exactly what was going to happen. Every single scene was predictable, yet the script was just rehashed lines. The script is the nail in the coffin with gems like \"I'll save you because you're a woman.\" They took garbage, put garbage on top of it, threw in a couple of minotaurs and little girls and sold it for 76 bucks per blu-ray after the current Yen to US Conversion rate. If you buy this anime, it's associated manga or light novels, figurines, buttons, pins, moist towelettes, and so on... you will hurt my feelings. I'll consider it a personal attack.\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi is so terrible and so idiotic. Nothing is ever explained and the most random drama ensues at the most opportune times. The final episode is just one huge monster battle for, once again, a completely unexplained reason. Every episode something crazy happens and it simply does not get explained. Like Hestia's Divine Powers, or why Hermes is a jerk, or what Hephaestus and Crozzeo's relationship is... and... and... everything. But don't worry because I'm sure everything will be explained in season two! Even sarcastically that hurts to type. \\n\\n\r\nOnly watch this anime ironically. If you watch this anime ironically I'll still be upset with you. Take my advice like a doting mother or teacher who said you can redo a paper. I really care about you, anonymous, I really do. I want you to love anime. I want people to respect your great taste. I want you to succeed in life. Watching this anime won't help you get any of those things. \\n\\n\r\nPlease select one of the other of thousands of anime that exist. May I recommend Urawa no Usagi-Chan? That's probably better because there's only one level of irony. One level of irony is better than the many you're going to have to explain with this one. This is so bad it's bad bad and then a couple layers past that. It's so bad it's bad that it's still bad and that means that even if you think it's bad and know it's bad it can get worse because you knowingly fear it's badness as you watch it and understand completely that you are subjecting yourself to something that is just bad without any way to escape the badness because under no circumstances can you figure out how someone would think it's good so you resign yourself to just watching something that is bad. In simple terms, anonymous, this is very bad please don't watch it. Even if you do watch this anime to watch something bad and feel bad watching something bad I'll probably still be disappointed in you though, anonymous. Just don't do it please!!\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly, can someone please tell me why if they are descending the dungeon why the dungeon stretches into the sky? Does that even make any sense? And why can gods and goddesses just sneak into the dungeon like it's no big deal? And why is this world's entire economy based around some sort of video game spawn thing? Why is the elf so powerful? And do we really not care she murdered a bunch of people in cold blood? Is there no jail in this world? And just goddamn why? Why does this anime exist?!\\n\\n\r\nAll these questions and more - completely unanswered in season two of \"Is It Wrong to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon!\"",

            "content": "I decided to write a review for \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\" due to some of the hate I saw it receiving and wanted to provide my perspective. This is my first review so don't expect it to be well polished.\r\nStory: The story isn't this rpg's strong point. Truthfully, this rpg doesn't have a single strong point. It's a combination of different things that make this rpg enjoyable to watch. The story isn't really explained in detail. We are really just given an explanation of gods and goddesses and the aspects of the anime develop more and more with eachepisode. The best thing I find about the story is that it's not really there. This allows me to enjoy each episode separately and be surprised by the things they introduce. It's the same reason why Gintama is enjoyable if you have seen that anime. Many people compare this anime to SAO but I find it more bearable to watch because things aren't as serious until certain points.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: The main character, Bell, is simply setup to become a hero. It's like in an rpg game where the main character is meant to have the best stats and skills as they level up. People say the main character just becomes overpowered after a few episodes but I feel that he is reasonably average. He is always shadowed by the sword princess, who he wishes to surpass. He isn't the strongest person around. I hated Kirito in SAO because he was ridiculously overpowered. It didn't really explain why he was overpower either. The other main character, Goddess Hestia, is a great component of the show. With her addition, I feel that this show is a parody of the usual harem. Several times Hestia will point out the amount of times she finds Bell with a different female. In addition, none of the other female characters display the amount of affection that Hestia shows except Lili. Other characters are introduced but never really expanded on.i. I feel that this anime could improve a lot if they added more character expansion, especially with Freya who seems like the main antagonist.\\n\\n\r\nArt: The art is simple but I feel they use the money they save to add in a decent amount of action and quality animation. I was surprised at how well animated the fight in episode 8 was. However, I really wish the Dungeon and it's enemies had more variety. In the later episodes, it seems like they are trying to remedy this. The dungeon definitely holds a lot of promise. The characters could also use more design. They show a lot of expensive equipment available in shops around the city but you don't see even the best fighters with anything flashy equipped.  We all know that the strong people are suppose to have cool armor.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: A feel like this anime is so enjoyable because of how average it is. I never have any high expectations. Every episode I watch is good and I know that the following episode will be good and so forth. I hate anime where you wait a week for a new episode and that episode is nothing but talking and a complete let down. That never happens with this show. Every week is worth the wait. This anime didn't start off boiling hot and simmered down. Instead, it started out cold and is slowly warming up, just like an RPG. Because it's a mix of comedy, action, and harem , every episode has the possibility of being either full of jokes, action, or character/relationship development.",

            "content": "I just finished this anime series, and I'm going to be completely honest with this anime series. Me personally I like the show, as much as people say its \"Generic\" but its not a bad show to begin with. For me this would be my most favourite show of the season. If you disagree with me, I need to ask you to leave my review, because this will not be a rant.\r\nSo let's start off with the review of, Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story itself takes place in a medieval fantasy world, where I actually likethe aspect. Other than that it starts out very generic as people claim, however I think people takes the show as a very misleading title, thinking it would be some sort of guy chasing after girls and trying to make a harem of his own. Actually this is not the case of the story. The story revolves on our Main Protagonist Bell, who wants to become stronger to get the person that he loves. I'll get to the characters later but let's say, the story revolves on explanations and how the world works, the Main Character slowly progresses on becoming stronger, and to be honest, if it wasn't for the slow paced, and if it was rushed it would be very very painful to watch. As the story progressed, we get a lot of the world building aspect, we get some moments where we're giggling or laughing, moments when we kind of feel attached. The story revolves around our cast as well having to go through situations, in the end of the day of the final episode I honestly like how it ended, and it gives hints for a possible second season. Note the story isn't that great and it starts as an average story, but then it shows the true colors of the show, and its a show, that knows what it wants to be. A show full of fun and giggles. In a good way. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nWe get a varied amount of characters in this anime, starting off with our Main Protagonist Bell, our generic protagonist. He seems generic but doesn't strive to be so serious like other shows. What I like about him is his personality being shy and somehow nervous at first, and at the time progress we see his progress of becoming strong. Take a note that the ability was reveled, so if it wasn't it would be considered an asspull. He in the end developed into at least good developed, but there are still more mysteries around him.\\n\\n\r\nNext up we got Hestia, our little busty girl Goddess. I know, some people would say she's useless, she's the best, she's waifu material. But let me take my personal opinion at hand please. As much as people say she's useless in terms of supporting, at least for me she shines the series with her obsession with Bell and her personality makes me giggle. She didn't support much on the show, but she became funny in the series at the very least.\\n\\n\r\nAiz, we see her as a dependant girl who fights without help of a man, and if you check, we see that she doesn't need to be save or anything, she shows as a character that can strive on her own and help Bell out in some cases until later on.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the other cast, I remember the cat girl's name but she got some pretty nice development as well, won't tell much about her, same with Ryu, and other characters as well. What it did bugged me was just bits of these characters being forgotten after a while, however they still participate as apart of the show and makes the series fun to watch for me.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation: 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI personally think the artstyle and animation looks very well from a series like this. It kept its consistencies and even with the animation looking very fluid and dynamic, entertaining to watch. When it comes to fight scenes it lets the show shine bright with the different styles and atmospheric sceneries. So I personally find the art very good.\\n\\n\r\nSound/Music: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nMy most favourite thing about this show would be the music, from heart touching, normal, to tension moments, the show has a soundtrack that I cant stop listening to.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the Opening and the Ending song, I prefer the ending song more than the Opening song, but the Opening song is not bad either.\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nIt's a show that fully entertained me among expectations, and from a generic start to a true colors shown, I do not regret watching the series, and I had more enjoyment on this anime than the others from this season. But enjoyment for me is subjective, people might not enjoy it, people would enjoy it.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Veredict: 8/10\\n\\n\r\nAnd a note, this is an opinion, you can like it, you can hate it.

            "content": "When you see a title this long and silly, then you may also be asking yourself if you should watch the show. \u201cIs it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?\u201d That\u2019s the translated title for this series which really sparks a bit of curiosity. Just judging on the surface, you can tell the story has relations to dungeons and girls. What you may not expect would be the presence of goddesses that really spices up the excitement. \r\nFor the purpose of this review, the series will be referred by its shortened title \u201cDanMachi\u201d. Adapted from the light novel of the samename, DanMachi is essentially a fantasy adventure show. The setting takes place in a fictional world known as \u2018Orario\u2019. While this name isn\u2019t anything special to remember by, its features crafts many possibilities because of the existence of Dungeon. This is a basically a location that contains all sorts of supernatural creatures ranging from minotaurs, dragons, goblins, etc. Why do people visit this place? The answer is simply for the rewards. Although the series isn\u2019t based on a MMORPG game, it has similar themes in that monsters drops valuable loot. At the center of the story is a young man named Bell Cranel. DanMachi chronicles his adventure as he picks up girls in dungeons in this world of bizarreness.\\n\\n\r\nThe series is pretty straightforward. No less than 5 minutes into the first episode and we can see that Bell gets himself in a bit of trouble involving dungeons. Perhaps trouble would be an understatement because Bell\u2019s life does get put into jeopardy when he gets trapped by a minotaur. Luckily, a young girl by the name of Aiz coms to his recuse. This encounter not only saves Bell but he also falls in love with her. Ironic really. The girl picks up the guy in this case. However, this isn\u2019t what it all seems. As the series progresses on, Bell gets involved in acquaintance and relationships with many other girls. Perhaps the most prominent of them is a goddess named Hestia. She is part of a group known as Hestia Familia where he and Hestia are the only two members. Bell is shown to work very hard every day to get by. As a character of only 14 years of age, he takes a lot of responsibility and display insurable amounts of courage as the story progresses. Alongside is Hestia who supports and unknown to Bell also is in love with him. So in essence, Bell already has a girl picked up but he just doesn\u2019t realize it. In Hestia\u2019s case, she throws a lot of hints towards Bell that he fails to recognize. Although they don\u2019t act entirely like lovers, they are very close. And this is where the fun comes in. DanMachi crafts relationships in this series with a comedy formula. It never tries to act too serious despite some of the dangers that exists in this show.\\n\\n\r\nGirls. A main emphasis in this show is how Bell meets them during his adventure. From the elegant swordswoman Aiz to mischievous traveler Liliruca Arde, the series continuously shows Bell\u2019s development. A strong point about his character is how he can influence others with his kindness. It also gets some of them curious such as the case of Aiz. She often wonders about how Bell can get so strong in such a short of time. Over the course of the show, Bell develops a relationship with Aiz through their training sessions. There\u2019s also harem tropes that becomes more and more evident as Bell builds connections with them. While it\u2019s not fully shown whether Aiz likes Bell or not, there\u2019s definitely a certain curiosity that she has for the young man. As generic as this seems, I actually find the series to be genuinely entertaining. This is because Bell isn\u2019t overpowered nor is he a weakling. More like a balance of both, it gets the viewers curious about how much he will improve. Characters such as Bete Loga and Freya are also surprised at his improvement despite their initial outlook of Bell. \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of story, the show follows a rather straightforward set of mechanics. There is no central antagonist introduced in this season nor are there any game tropes that indicates some sort of setting that relates to MMORPG survival. It\u2019s simple with established mechanics such as the Familia, groups in the story with specialized skills including item crafting and monster hunting. So in essence, the series almost has a slice of life-like tone at times. What it sets differently apart from some adventure is mostly the relationship building. To be quite honest, there\u2019s perhaps far too much of it. Bell and Hestia\u2019s relationship makes up the core of the show. While some episodes doesn\u2019t exclusively focus on this, it still ultimately communicates the message to the audience that the pair is inseparable. Unfortunately, Bell treats Hestia more like a close friend than a girlfriend. And this becomes a source of annoyance for Hestia. It can also be a source of annoyance for the viewers as it shows how dense he can be. Romance is subtle as we don\u2019t really see much development except on casual levels. Despite this, the show often transits between relationships and fantasy adventure. What I do find disappointing is that the focus is too much on our two main characters. Even as a prominent character in the show, we don\u2019t learn much about Aiz from this adaptation. There\u2019s little we see from her background but only her personality on the surface. Similarly, her guild mates are often trying to impress her (both guys and girls included). It\u2019s paltry in the end in terms of characterization. On the other hand, it\u2019s nice to see that Bell can make friends outside of his Familia such as Welf, a blacksmith who made his armor and a member of the Herme Familia. In this way, it shows how Bell interacts with other characters that are not so close to him while allowing the audience to see his other characteristics. \\n\\n\r\nBased on the light novel, I am on most parts satisfied with the adaptation. While it\u2019s not frame by frame faithful to the source, it captures the most important parts. These include the magical contents such as the various items that are shown. Skills and abilities that Bell learns are also introduced such as the Fire Bolt. In the background, there\u2019s a considerable amount of world building. In fact, the world fiction of the show is one of the features that is very noticeable. The supernatural creatures that exists in their world are crafted to make them look real. While it isn\u2019t unique compared to most fantasy adventure stories, DanMachi attracts appeal to any fan who wants to see how their world functions. From dampy dungeons to enchanting forests, this show exhibits an attractive appeal to fantasy. It even has a good amount of explanation for how stats and skillsets work including limitations to adventurers\u2019 levels. The comedy can sometimes feel a bit of a hit or miss but on most parts flows well with the story. It can also mislead viewers sometimes as some episodes that are seemingly indulged by humor turns serious with the buildup and execution. For such a goofy title, that\u2019s saying something.\\n\\n\r\nJ.C. Staff is behind the wheels to operate this show. What you see from the preview is what you get. The artwork retains a fantasy atmosphere with its elegant world. There\u2019s careful texture that decorates the world of Orario with what it has to offer. The dungeons is still the most prominent feature as the show creates its features to look legitimately menacing. At the same time, it also display a good fixture of concrete detail. These ranges from the various monsters to the magical elements that are displayed throughout the show such as Bell\u2019s abilities. Fans who wants to be serviced will feel pleased at times because the show does show a bit of skin. These include Aiz\u2019s partially broken armor, Hestia\u2019s outfit, or even the inevitable bath scenes. It\u2019s also noticeable that character designs for the series puts a lot of emphasis into the female characters. All the gods and goddesses are designed to look beautiful or seductive. In the case of Freya, she also display a bit of yandereness with her expressions. However, the character expressions is a bit silly for its own good at times. This is mostly coming from Bell especially in the first half of the show that makes him react more like a kid than an adventurer. His puppy crush on Aiz brings this out the most. On the other hand, who can forget about Hestia\u2019s jealousy when she sees Bell hanging out with a girl?\\n\\n\r\nSurprisingly enough, DanMachi\u2019s soundtrack matches very well with its consistency. If there\u2019s any first impressions, soundtrack should be one to name especially for its battle oriented OST. The extensive fighting in some episodes as well as the thriller-like feeling of dungeon conquests flows quite well with the intense soundtrack. It brings a heavy feeling and even bit of realism of what being part of an adventurer is like in the dungeons just by the sheer music too. The OP and ED theme songs are more lighthearted. And in general, most of the humorous and slice of life scenes has a more relaxing feeling. Finally, there\u2019s the voice mannerisms. Hestia is a big of mixed bag. Her voice sometimes sounds like a spoiled brat while other times shows a very caring friend. Aiz\u2019s soft voice makes her one of the more calm characters; a bit of contrast to Bell\u2019s personality. And then there are many other characters with a wide dynamic range of voice expressions. The ones that stands out the most are the goddesses such as Freya while others\u2026well, not so much. Bell would fit into that category as his voice matches mostly as a teenager.\\n\\n\r\nSo what does DanMachi really try to appeal? If it\u2019s a fantasy and adventure story, then that\u2019s a success with its fantastic world fiction and mechanics. When it comes to characterization though, that\u2019s more of its Achilles\u2019 Heel. It does make up for it with concrete relationships especially in the case of Bell and Hestia. Other times, the show tries to capitalize on Bell\u2019s adventure by presenting us his improvements. Now I do have to say that the comedy feels a bit repetitive while other times, the story\u2019s consistency feels blend. As a 1 cour show, expect certain elements of the original source to be omitted or changed. Still, DanMachi is a story that shows how fantasy can be fun. It may not feel original but it has a lot of reasons to make us think of its title.",

            "content": "All right Lion Tamers. We look at another anime. This time, I found one I actually like.\r\nIt's called \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\", what a mouthful! Translation is 'Dzun-ge would be wrong I'll seek a meeting to sound day', I swear that's the Google Translation.\r\nThere is a short name some use \"DanMachi\", don't ask me I have no idea. Google Translation is 'Dan-Machi'.\r\nA lot of the time; most of us get caught up in the story, or the music, or the dialog, or the artwork, or the characters. \r\nBut then there is the forest, hiding in all those trees. AndDanMachi is one of these shows, that shows us that sometimes the forest is more important than the trees.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nI'll discuss the Anime's specifics in a moment, but I want to have a word about the meanings of things. Sometimes Anime has a meaning that shines far above the actual artwork. DanMachi is one of those rare shining lights.\\n\\n\r\nFor once, we have a show that stands up and shouts to the highest mountaintops.\\n\\n\r\nThat our faith in our fellow Man, is more important than the impending threats, the suffering that is a consequence of standing up for our friends, and loved ones. That courage in the face of enemies, in the defense of our true friends and loved ones, speaks louder than any fear.\\n\\n\r\nAnd the fact that no one else sees it, isn't the same as if it never happened at all. Things that are important in our life, are not, unless we are willing to suffer to protect them. Things that are important, has nothing to do with the property we own, or the school we go to, or the stores we frequent.\\n\\n\r\nThe valuable things are those items we carry with us for our entire lives, that enrichen it, and make the days we live in the future, seem richer for knowing those things.\\n\\n\r\nAll of that leads us to DanMachi, and a little fellow that would not surrender his belief for temporary freedom from fear and pain. And because he stood up and fought to protect what he held dear, his faith in the strength of the friendship and love of his fellows; his fellows responded in kind. \\n\\n\r\nIn other words, those things many would find a weakness in his character, was exactly the forces martial'd, to bring about the friendships he gained. These friendships and loved ones were a direct consequence of his behavior. All of these people that centered upon him, as a compass point; were not there to form a harem, or a club. They are friends and neighbors, their behavior paid for, by his offering his spirit of neighborhood to his fellows.\\n\\n\r\nFirst.\\n\\n\r\nThe spirit of neighborhood, and fellowship are not weakness; they are an enormous strength. When we forget that, we give a heave-ho to our own lives within the context of our own way of life, without safety, without friends, without community. But most of all, our neighborhoods become embattled contests for survival, and the grace of a civilized culture is the victim.\\n\\n\r\nBell has two character traits that are all to rare in the description of a male hero: charity, and mercy. He gave of himself, in the name of his friends, and they became his neighbors. What is a neighbor, but a person who stands with you, when your sense of community is threatened?\\n\\n\r\nWhat does it mean to be Human? Does it mean we are all born Human? I don't believe that. Being Human is to decide to operate by set of principles that define what it is to be Human. Being a Human Being has nothing to do with biology, or procreation, or how we look. It is defined by how we believe we should behave among our fellow Humans.\\n\\n\r\nThe fact that many try to gain our faith in themselves, as if all Men deserve to be trusted as if we were all Human, is a deceit of the highest order, a con-game. Especially when non-Human Homo-Sapiens walk among us trying to get the results of these values from us, without trading in kind. These are liars, cheats and thieves.\\n\\n\r\nIs it any wonder that the motto of the U.S. Air Force Academy is \"I shall not lie, cheat or steal; or tolerate anyone who does.\"? Those who do, don't stay at the Academy long.\\n\\n\r\nThe little female character, Miss Arde, is a case in point. She had been beaten, kicked, dropped into terror, mistreated in so many ways; that she had lost her  faith in her fellow Man. But just as in real life, it only took one true faithful spirit to teach her that not everyone had to live as she had. She realized what she was doing wasn't living; she had sold her soul to pay for existence.\\n\\n\r\nAnd because of it, she mistrusted Bell's motives, even to betraying him because he was an easy mark. True Humans usually are. Until Miss Arde realized that it was the very things she thought of as weaknesses, that were the very causes for Bell's decisions to defend her when she least expected it.\\n\\n\r\nWeakness? Lost promises? Can't relate to people of the same stripe? I don't think so. Bell is a symbol of all that is good in Man, and needs to be nurtured for its own sake.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n\\n\r\nNow I can talk about the basic production of DanMachi.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime has a wonderful story, that covers an enormous amount of back-story and premise in 13-episodes. I would have appreciated more episodes, to give more depth of history, but this Anime was adequate in this regard, for what was offered.\\n\\n\r\nThe artwork was very good, even having some parallax artwork in moments where Bell or some other characters are walking down a street, or images of large panoramas are described. This is 'J.C. Staff' at its finest.\\n\\n\r\nThe music was, for once, something I could sink my teeth into. Catchy tunes, with fine melodies. Singing that is worthy of the name. Harmonies that work together with the voices, to make something that is pleasant to hear. While I would have preferred to have music that also had import to the show itself, after all, we are dealing with an alternate universe, with Gods who walk among the ordinary gentry. And the basic soundtrack was also appropriate to the moments in the story.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were interesting, each one a three-dimensional personality. Even the girls were varied, and while they tended to be way to cute for real life; still all bounced off each other (no pun intended) as people would in a real town, with real neighborhoods. There is nothing unusual about a girl finding herself interested in a boy who has a history of treating other people with dignity and respect. And this happened quite a few times. Rare? Never. Many girls become women who marry such boys, who grow up to be good men.\\n\\n\r\nThe only thing that began to not jive very well is that even though the beginnings of the tale centers on a little God named Hestia, who pairs herself with her one and only Adventurer, in an old deserted non-Greek-God Worship Church; as they developed in their community, and became somewhat richer, they stayed in the rent-free squatters life-style. Never to be improved upon, as they could afford more and better. Everything in their lives were old, hand-me-down and discarded by every one. Including the building itself.\\n\\n\r\nOne has to wonder about that. And then there's the debt to be paid, by Hestia, for the knife Hephaistios created for Bell. But these items are for another season. If there ever is another one. This show is one of those that deserves another season. After all, we still don't have a motivation for the actions of Freya. This is not a weakness, it just needs some more episodes, to place Freya on center stage. Something that was never done, in the interests of developing the rest of the plot. This is not an error. It is an author's license.\\n\\n\r\nWith all of the above, I finish this review of a short, flawed, but otherwise excellent offering. Slickly written, with comedy, pathos, heartfelt emotions; and a soaring set of principles that is all too rare.\\n\\n\r\nI give DanMachi a solid 9!\\n\\n",

            "content": "As I finished this series and went to go adjust my anime list, I had a look down at the reviews, and saw that people were all over  the place with 'Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka', or as I'm going to call it, Dungeon, and I figure that I might as well give my input on it. Now be gentle, as  this is my first review, a. \r\nStory:\r\nOne of the weakest points of Dungeon.\r\n I felt like the series tried to start with the angle of Bell, the protagonist, following after his grandfathers words to go find agirl in a dungeon, but it quickly loses most of this focus, only being briefly mentioned throughout the rest of the series. The separate story arcs themselves were also nothing special, with the usual Lose-Train-Win or the classic Lose-Remember your friends-Win. Its a tried and tested method, and while not executed particularly badly, I'm probably not going to remember the story after a week. Unyieldingly average.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nIt looks good. most of the time.\\n\\n\r\nIn a world of magic, all the effects were done pretty well in my opinion, and the monsters were not bad, albeit very clich\u00e9 , but where it really stood out was in the big, important fight scenes, where everything was moving smooth as silk, and you really couldn't help but enjoy watching. Although, some scenes look pretty bland, and all the gore they tried to put into it deducted from the whole feel, as its not done as well as the rest of the series.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\\n\r\nActively Terrible.\\n\\n\r\nThis is where I feel all the contriversy around this series stems from: the characters. Ill go through a few examples. Bell Cranel: the main protagonist, and from the looks of things possibly the most pandering character I've ever seen. A pure hearted naturally talented god of women. If you thought Kirito was bad, this guy is on a whole nother level, hes a god damn otaku wet dream. He puts up with abuse from anyone, always gets the girl, and saves the day at the last minute, and with almost no character development! After the second episode, I could pretty much tell how the rest of the series was going to go, and I wasn't far off. Everyone is tailored to make Bell seem like a god amongst men. Girls with dark pasts confide in him, and he solves all their problems, people abusing him, only for him to show them the error of their ways and turning them good. Almost no-one in the show has any real personality that dosen't try to make Bell look cool. And once you realise that for yourself, if you don't stop the series there, you're just going to give up on seeing any development at all.\\n\r\nI could also talk about the excessive fan service, and how in my opinion hampers the overall series, but I'm sure someone else has talked about it with more eloquence than I can.\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nIt's dumb fun, but I can see why people don't like it.\\n\\n\r\nI've pretty much covered anything I needed to say, but as a closing statement, let me say this, If you're a fan of deep characters, and a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, stay away. Even If you do want to watch it, if you don't like the first episode, it doesn't get better. If, on the other hand, you like super op characters pulling chicks with bigger chests than personalities, ala Sword Art Online, you might get some enjoyment out of this.",

            "content": "***contains trace amounts of spoilers and mild profanity, please consult your doctor before reading***\r\nI've been seeing opinions that this anime is a worse version of Sword Art Online and I must strongly object. In fact I'll argue there're some significant improvements over the posterchild of everything wrong with anime. \r\nFor starters the adventure aspect received proper attention, SAO had barely any fights with monsters or dungeon crawling, most of it resolved around the mc being a harem king, doing a detective game and numerous other activities that introduced absolutery nothing of value to the main plot. In DanMachi it actually resolves around the adventure andfighting! All the other harem-esque nonsense exists but the main theme of the anime is actually explored, they got that part right at least (or right-er anyway). \\n\\n\r\nSecondarily, people's motivations actually make sense. In SAO despite having a common interest of escaping the dungeon player rivalry was intense, and some people even resolved to perma killing. Considering bosses don't respawn it made the drama both absurd and pointless, that hatred for beta testers was just ridiculous. In here however the ones who advance deeper in the dungeon get the edge over other familias, more money, better equipment; occasional cooperation exists but it's driven mostly by pragmatic gains. Shanty town in the lower dungeon set absurd prices to rip-off adventurers passing by, but in a situation of need everyone teams up against a common enemy. Different familias can join forces to take on a boss but it doesn't change a fact it's a competition among the gods, even if driven by nothing more than vanity of being better (likely allusion to greek gods being fickle douchebags that toy with human lives for their own amusement). Behaviors follow logic patterns, nakama nonsense exist only in minimal amounts, and that already is a step forward (or rather reverse from a step backward, eh?).\\n\\n\r\nShallow characterization is an obvious flaw, but hey, at least the author bothered to equip his heroes with some. That party that dumped the monsters on the the protagonist did so to protect their own wounded, and they felt guilt for it later. Human behavior and moral choices, something that SAO can't do.\\n\\n\r\nAccusations of taking misogyny up to new levels are incorrect. The levels are quite standard (no one said it's a good standard) and in some cases there's improvement over Demonspawn 2012. For example the elf chick, she has her own reasons for going back to the dungeon, the regret over her lost party members. She assists the albino lab rat on occasions but it's driven by the need to prevent another tragedy where she failed previously, not because the mc is \"attractive\". See? Actual character. The Sword Princess remains the strongest fighter throughout the whole series,  even when the mc tries to catch up to her armed with godlike growth skills,  still remains vastly inferior. No excuse for lack of personality but it's worth noting. And the goddess Freya that enabled the growth as well? Playing with whitehair boy for nothing more than fun, turning his desperate struggle for survival into a pass time joke activity. \"Let's traumatize this kid by putting him into extreme mortal danger, motivate him with a possibility of heavy humilation in front of his loved one, so I can orgasm to my sadistic fantasy later.\" \\n\\n\r\nThis is where we arrive at a suprising conclusion: if anything the show is heavier on the misandry side. The male protagonist is a worthless unsympathetic nobody (as in \"so beta it's revolting\"), and the only reason he can reach the top is through love. Power of love is a retarded plot device on it's own but the really bad thing is the resulting implication - without love he's worthless. Or more simply, the only reason he's ascended from a pathetic loser state forever doomed to be an unremarkable peon, into a S-rank hero is because of a girl. And even then he can only get his rear end whipped a little less than before by the top player. Getting a level up? Only because Freya made special effort for nothing more than maniacal egocentrism, incidentally arranged through her male henchman with a personality of a wet dishrag, and a few cases of accidental manslaughter (adventureres that got rekt by the pet minotaur). Something banal as updating stats? Not without a loli sitting on your ass.  Superpowerful weapon? Woman smith doing a big favour on a pity credit basis. Learning magic since he had zero chance of overcoming the hurdle on his own? Female mercy, and someone is going to miss that book but the chick is cute so screw moral implications of property theft. The little furry girl that tried to scam and murder him for purely immoral reasons? Forgiven without a blink. Because why bother having personality or rationality, that'd just be insensitve. The planned joke of mc being a damsel in distress unitnentionally becomes an offensive stereotype itself, talk about hilarious irony :) \\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, the position of all time worst title remains secure. DanMachi suffers from many of the plagues of modern anime (idiotic overpowered doormat mc, horrible writing, pandering, wish fulfillment etc) but nowhere does it fall below the Unholy Abomination 2012. At the very least it succeded in belonging to the adventure/action segment, and in some cases it's made noticeable improvements over the One Which Must Not Be Named (Without A Lot Of Criticism). If there's anything DanMachi truly excels in is that it hates it's male characters much more than the female ones. Not that pushing one extreme into the other is an improvement in the subject, but it shows we're dealing with a quite different type of bad show. Not worse, just a more unique type of bad.\\n",

            "content": "Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? Pfft, it's the best way to pick up girls! \r\nMore commonly referred to as DanMachi, \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka?\" is a fantasy, action, adventure, romance and, to some extent, comedy anime. The tags aren't inaccurate, as these themes are visible throughout all twelve episodes. After watching each episode weekly as they were released, I've come to that conclusion that DanMachi is deserving of around a 7/10.\r\nStory: 6\r\nDanMachi's main story line is decent. With plot twists every few episodes, it's safe to say that the main story is pretty excitingand definitely drags you into continuing the series. There are some brilliant moments of tension and the story changes its side character focus every so often, which keeps things fresh. At the start of the anime, the story shows a lot of promise, with an amazing RPG-style fantasy world being shown. However, this is exactly where it falls flat. I found myself asking questions about the world as the anime went on... \"Why is there a massive dungeon tower in the middle of the world (that's extremely reminiscent of the one in Sword Art Online?\" \"What other towns and cities are there?\" \"Why did the Gods choose to live with humans?\" \"Who says what the Gods can and can't do?\" \"Why do people get exp. like in a video game?\" \"Why did people start going into the dungeon in the first place?\" \"What do the magic rocks that monsters drop even do?\" \"Who put the monsters in the dungeon?\".  I could go on for ages. Point is, they presented a wonderful and interesting world and explained nothing about it. To me, this detracted from the story greatly as I was unable to immerse myself into the world due to the fact I was constantly saying: \"B-b-but that doesn't make sense! Why?\". I can only hope that this is elaborated more upon in season two.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 10\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi's artwork and animation is stellar. The character designs are all incredibly lovable and unique, especially the Goddess, Hestia. The weapons, armor and monsters are all terrifying and very well designed. If you were looking for flaws in the animation, you would not find any, with action and fight scenes that are so very clear and fun to watch. The style of the world is just simply awesome, my favorite part being the backstreet alleyway in the city. However, the only drawback with the overall art is that it bears shocking resemblance to Sword Art Online. I understand that it's from the same studio, but it's as if they didn't even try making it different.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is good, the battle songs and tavern music definitely add to the feel of the world and help you become more immersed. The opening is catchy but kind of weird and doesn't really fit the anime if you ask me. The ending is the same really. It seems somewhat out of place at times, especially when there's an intense cliffhanger and then it suddenly plays all cheery and upbeat. Kind of ruins the cliffhanger-y mood. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8\\n\\n\r\nOne good aspect of this anime is the array of vibrant and lovable characters it presents. With each character being unique and incredibly well designed, it's somewhat hard to find many faults with the characters. Hestia in particular being just so damn cute and hilarious. However, the main issue I have with the characters is with the protagonist. Bell is a pretty normal kid in terms of personality. However, that's all he is- he's an average kid trying to win over a girl. There's nothing unique or entertaining really about his personality and DanMachi relies on side characters for its comedy relief and bizarre traits. Some side characters even have dark and intruiging back stories, with development being shown in some!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\\n\r\nDespite huge drawbacks with the story, DanMachi's animation and lovable characters make it a pretty enjoyable watch. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7\\n\\n\r\nAs mentioned slightly earlier on in the review, DanMachi bears striking resemblance with the older, more popular Sword Art Online. In fact, even so to the point where some characters' faces look identical and the main character has the same voice actor. In short, if you disliked Sword Art Online, it's pretty likely you'll dislike this too. However, the vice-versa rule applies here too! If you enjoyed SAO, then you'll enjoy DanMachi. Althoguh, that's not to say it's a carbon copy. It does have its unique aspects and is a must watch for any adventure/RPG anime lovers out there.",

            "content": "With an absurdly long title such as, \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" your first inclination is to think that the show is trying too hard to pander from just the title alone. With Romance, Fantasy, Action, and Comedy spliced in with an element of Harem, your anticipation going into this will probably sink into apathy. But fret not my dear friends, this anime, shortly titled DanMachi, actually has much more to offer than your prototypical otaku bait anime. That is if you think a story is essential in anime that fit this description.\r\nWhen I say otaku bait, Imean the classic stereotype of a protagonist who is relatable to your average Japanese teenager, a sexy loli girl with a beautiful petite body who sticks with him thick and thin, and a plot that owes itself to another shonen show's popularity in similarities. In which case, the shonen show DanMachi wants to emulate is Sword Art Online. In DanMachi, a boy, named Bell-kun, who craves to become a great adventurer to prove himself to be a strong warrior in the eyes of so many people by leveling up his attributes to accomplish this feat. Does that sound familiar? Thought so. However, DanMachi is set in an actual fantasy world, not an MMO. So it is a fantasy interpretation of Sword Art in some fashion.\\n\\n\r\nFor those who might be discouraged by this comparison I mentioned, I assure you that DanMachi isn't just another clone for Sword Art Online. For one thing, the plot itself is not of the same magnitude of Sword Art Online. DanMachi's plot is somewhat barebones and can easily be summed up in a sentence or two: \"Boy wants to be an adventurer to overcome difficulties in life. With the help of his sexy Goddess sidekick, he will be able to achieve this goal.\" That's pretty all there is to it. By the time I was halfway through it, I was hoping that there was more to it than just this fundamental premise. By the time the last couple episodes have gone through, there wasn't that much to go on than just that.\\n\\n\r\nThat's the only big gripe DanMachi has going for that keeps it from being great. Still, with all that is said and done, there many admirable qualities to the show that can add up to an outstanding experience. The first one to mention is the characters Bell-kun and Hestia. Individually and together, they add a lot of great hilarious and impactful moments from their dialogue and actions. It becomes evident from the excellent chemistry they both create whenever they are both together on-screen, whether they are fighting various monsters together or happily having a lovey-dovey date together, at least to Hestia's perspective. Bell-kun himself may seem like a weakling of an adventurer with a soft, calm voice but he proves himself worthy to rival some of the better shonen protagonists you typically see. It also helps that he has a very likable personality that puts him in a comfortable position for us to root for him in his journey.\\n\\n\r\nThen we have the one and only goddess herself, Hestia-chan. I mean, what can you say about the bootylicious, big chested, and genki archetypical loli that hasn't been said already? Well, I will tell you one thing that can be added into those three categories: Awesome. Why should this title be mentioned in the same breath as her name you may ask? Most of it has to do with how her personality ranges in all sorts of hilarious and adorable ways that make her very expressive. These expressions make you feel an attachment to her when she is acting serious, humorous, or just all around flirty with Bell-kun. Not to mention that her voice actress, Inori Minase, gives it her all in creating a wonderful character with her remarkably expressive voice. It also provides a delicate balance between her wild and joyful nature and Bell-kun's quiet and gentle personality that makes their camaraderie even more exciting and hilarious to watch.\\n\\n\r\nBesides our two main leads, the rest of the characters are, unfortunately, not up to par with these two. The only supporting role that I can remember liking was Lili, only because she at least had something that made her distinctive from the rest of the cast. That something being that overly large backpack of hers that doubles her small size, go figure. The rest of the supporting cast can be encapsulated into one word: boring. It all comes down to how the writers put minimal effort in making the supporting cast at least somewhat enjoyable so that it doesn't seem like the only thing carrying the show is our two main leads. All they come down to is them making semi-funny jokes and get involved in fight scenes with Bell-kun or Hestia; which, to DanMachi's credit, are very well done.\\n\\n\r\nHere is where another of DanMachi's strong points starts to bloom. If you thought shonen action shows fighting has gotten tedious in recent years, you'd be right. However, DanMachi manages to set the bar up pretty high with the amount of great tenacity and flair it gives to the action sequences with the monsters and other characters. What helps is how great the animation flows through these sequences with nice fluid movements with the characters and how they use their weapons in combat. There are the occasional \"cutting corners\" in animation, but not to the point where it becomes jarring. Even outside of the action, the animation leaves a strong impression with how well detailed it shows off its medium-sized budget.\\n\\n\r\nNot only does the animation work wonders, but the art design also leaves a solid impression in DanMachi. Not just with the character design, but also the design of the world itself. The world is your general fantasy world with a few new things added that you may or may not have seen before. The backgrounds have a subtle elegance to their artistic influence, from the massive scope of the mountains to the urban-style design of the city that our main characters live in. Character designs are quite colorful and eloquent in how beautiful they look, especially Hestia. Even if you have no taste in petite girls, Hestia will no doubt raise a few eyebrows, and maybe raise a few other things.\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi was surely a surprise for me to experience this Spring. Where it lacks from a story and mostly character standpoint, it succeeds in providing a fun action/hybrid anime with its stellar art and animation department and a great duo from Hestia and Bell-kun with their fantastic chemistry. It managed to tickle my action and ecchi bone enough for me to say that it was a worthwhile adventure to take part in. As far as experiences go, this is one where the journey itself is the fun part while the end of it makes you want to yearn for more. For me at least, I want more Hestia-chan in the future. Please?\\n\\n\r\nGrade: B",

            "content": "Danmachi (not typing out the show\u2019s title) was a show that frustrated me.  There are the seeds of something good in this show, but unfortunately, it falls into a bad pattern of pandering and bad characterization that left me pretty cold after a few episodes once I got a better feel with what the show was going to be.\r\nI took a shot on this one, as I watched a couple fantasy anime and this popped up on my recommended list and showed a decently high rating.  To be fair, this show isn\u2019t the worst in this genre that I\u2019ve seen, and there aresome good points.\\n\\n\r\nThe art and color is pleasing.  Danmachi has a pretty nice art style.  Some of the animations and facial expressions of certain characters aren\u2019t the best, but in general, the quality is serviceable.  Many of the battle sequences are pretty exciting and well done enough to be entertaining to watch.  I think that the sound and voice acting is on par with the average show too, and doesn\u2019t feel out of place.\\n\\n\r\nThe world itself and the town feel like a decent roleplaying setting, perhaps something out of a pen and paper roleplaying game world, and you can get the feel of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish here.  There\u2019s a good amount of material that could have been expanded on to make the viewers more involved, and is one of many huge missed opportunities, of which there are many.\\n\\n\r\nDanmachi has a lot of problems, most of which have to do with the issue of shallowness in all aspects that need to be fleshed out to make a show good.  \\n\r\nThe biggest failing is the world building.  Danmachi takes a lot of shortcuts and just expects the viewers to take for granted what\u2019s going on in the world, as not much about it is actually explained.  Some of the fogginess may be planned to be explained in a season two, or with reference to the light novel, but really, not explaining more about the world early on doesn\u2019t give any context for character motivations.  Why be an adventurer?  What\u2019s the allure?  What the hell is the tower for, what are the gods doing and why are they involved with adventurers at all?  Is this the only part of the world where adventurers can ply their trade, where do all the fantasy races come from, etc.  The show just expects you to accept all as presented without much hint to how the world works, and in a fantasy setting, understanding these things is important.\\n\\n\r\nAnother big failing is the characters.  The biggest problem with most of the characters in this show is that they are poorly developed and in many cases, their motivations are not easy to follow given what\u2019s going on.  Again, most of this could probably be resolved by providing more context.  \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s hard to dig too deep on the character failings without spoiling things, but the main protagonist Bell is about the perfect example of a Gary Stu as I\u2019ve ever seen.  I have an extremely hard time with this character because his plot armor is so ridiculous that nothing feels desperate or urgent, even if that\u2019s what the action is implying.  At no time watching this show do you feel that he is in serious danger, or won\u2019t pull something out of his ass at the last minute, and that\u2019s preposterous with what\u2019s actually going in front of you.  There were a few scenes where the deus ex machina is so ridiculous that I rolled my eyes.  Or the love interest saves him, for some bizarre reason that I can\u2019t fathom, more on her below.  I also understand very little of his motivation or background as it is very limited.  He seems like an inoffensive self insert protagonist that every girl drools over just because.  While he does work hard in the dungeon, as I mentioned, nothing ever feels urgent, and his rapid progression plot point feels like a huge cop out as it diminishes his hard work and cheapens the character quite a bit.\\n\\n\r\nOther characters beyond the MC aren\u2019t written much better.  The main love interest that the MC is pining after is about as wooden a character as I\u2019ve ever seen.  I get that they\u2019ve written her to be a super powerful, stoic beauty archetype, but you expect there to be some hidden depth that you get a glimpse of here and there that may spark the MC\u2019s interest, but aside from looking like a blonde-haired model, there\u2019s nothing I can see to spur more than a passing interest in her.  I\u2019m also unclear as to why she seems to want to be Bell\u2019s guardian angel and pull his ass out of the fire.  It\u2019s really hard to read anything from this character other than she\u2019s this world\u2019s all powerful sword master who takes down raid bosses by herself, which is a little ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\nThe character that shows the most depth, oddly enough, is the fan-service poster girl of the show, Hestia.  She\u2019s a little too attached to the MC, her chest is bouncing all over the place and she\u2019s a little too much of a clingy jealous girl clich\u00e9, but you actually get to understand more about her motivations and character than just about any other character.  She\u2019ll actually make some sacrifices so her charge can go out and try to impress the stoic girl without a personality.  Her motivations are a little silly, as the MC doesn\u2019t do much that I think would warrant affection from her, but you understand that she\u2019s got her reasons.  Beyond the pandering, she\u2019s seems to be the most sympathetic character in the show, and the one that I felt was actually the most heroic oddly enough.  While I don\u2019t think doting on the MC is worth her time, I understand why she\u2019s doing it way more than I understand why any of the other characters are acting the way they are.\\n\\n\r\nTo wrap it up, it\u2019s a show that passes on the technical and does provide moments of entertainment, but it\u2019s really hard to like and enjoy the characters as they are written pretty poorly and there\u2019s no real adversity that ever feels dire.  The world itself is hard to get into as they don\u2019t explain much of anything, and you\u2019re really left wondering why anyone is doing what they\u2019re doing.  If you\u2019re bored and like fantasy shows, you could do worse than Danmachi, but I don\u2019t think this show should be scored as high as it is, as there is a lot that needed improvement. \\n",

            "content": "Overall score: 6.2/10\r\nThe world of DanMachi (short name for the Japanese title of this series) is interesting. The system that's used in this world is in accordance to what Family you belong in, as it determines how you're going to go on adventures. If you are in a family with a lot of people, then it's likely that you'll be going in dungeons with multiple other individuals. For the main character, since he is the only member in his Family, the Hestia Family, he goes on adventures alone--and that played a big role in his development throughout the series. \r\nAlthough DanMachi is enjoyable, and althoughI was interested in its world (as I am a fan of Greek Mythology), I personally did not get more interested in its story and characters until around half-way through. A big part of it is probably because I look for character development, how the characters are involved with the story (even if they are not the main character), and if it's set in a fantasy world: how the world factors into their development and involvement with the story. In other words: I had some issues with its execution (such as what they chose to include *coughs: the harem-like element* and what they chose to NOT include: such as some of the characters' backstory and development--although it was mostly due to having to cover the story in only 13 episodes), but I still enjoyed watching it--as each episode made me want to watch the series until the end, to the least--despite how it actually does end. \\n\\n\r\nThe animation of DanMachi is nicely done. I like how most of the fight scenes looked, and the scenery that was used in the episodes. It really gives you a good feel as to how the world is like. \\n\\n\r\n***(Spoilers ahead! Read only if you've finished watching.)***\\n\r\nI hope there's a season 2 for DanMachi, as I would like to know more about the Myth that Hermes was referring to at the end. He said something about Zeus, and if I'm correct, Bell being related to him--more specifically, his grandson. If so, that explains why Bell was able to level up so quickly, and grow at such a fast pace (although, admittedly, the knife that Hestia gave him helped as well). However, why Freya pulls strings to put Bell's life at risk (in terms of what she hopes to achieve from that--aside from wanting to see how fast he can develop) still remained unanswered... \\n\r\n***(Spoilers section over.)***\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the world and animation of DanMachi is something to look forward to while you're watching the show. However, it might let you down if you're looking for character development and explanations of certain unanswered questions you may have. If you can look over that, then, go ahead, give it a watch.  \\n\\n\r\nRecommended to anime-watchers who likes the genres of: adventure, action, and fantasy. \\n\\n\r\nYou're welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.\\n\\n\r\n***\\n",

            "content": "Also known as DanMachi, Dungeon is an anime about .. girls. \r\nYes because when I finished this anime I realized how many of the characters were girls .. and how many fell in love for him. \r\nAND I MEAN IT . I think Kirito was just overcome by Bell. I can say for sure that any girl in a 1 KM radius would fall in love for Kirito. But Bell just goes beyond that with his 100 KM radius. \r\nHe gets everything that he wants. A loli, a hot chick, a hot elf and even a fucking god with nice tits. Jeez man this guyis awesome ! \\n\\n\r\nNow seriously .. this anime gets stupid because of this. He does nothing whatsoever but still every girl in the town falls in love for him because .. reasons. \\n\\n\r\nAt a first glance, this anime looked a lot like SAO. The worlds are similiar, the characters are similiar .. but later on this anime actually develops a nice story that I admit, wasn\u00b4t expecting for. \\n\\n\r\nWith the first 3 eps of this show, I was thinking about a crappy Harem action rommance. In the end, there was actually an Harem but the action turned out to be good, as well as the main story. \\n\\n\r\nThink about an MMORPG(massive multiplayer online role playing game)  (world of warcraft for instance,). You see that feeling of developing your own character, getting him stronger with new items, upgrading his stats, learning new abilities .. DanMachi has the same feeling for me. I felt like if I was playing a game where Bell was my character, my avatar. \\n\\n\r\nThe world of DanMachi reminds me a game and that is really nice ! I loved that aspect. As the action moves on you actualy get attatched to the character so much that when he develops himslef it feels like you are the guy behind him controlling the character. \\n\\n\r\nThe adventure, the goal of being the best player in that game, that's our dream when we play something .. and you will share that same dream with Bell .. that's why I believe that if you like games, this anime will be really entertaining for you. \\n\\n\\n\r\nThe art and sound both are fine. Personally I liked some of the tracks used in some intense situations but besides that not really stood out. \\n\\n\r\nAbout the characters .. well you have Bell who is the most typical hero out there and the rest are just some girls that like him. Yah that's it. Some of them get some brief development but I really never cared about them. They are not interesting nor original. \\n\\n\\n\r\nBut the characters are not the biggest problem. So far no second season has been announced and that's worrying me. If we don\u00b4t get a second season then this rate will be much lower. The anime doesn\u00b4t end ! It needs a second season to end the story. \\n\\n\r\nIn short. This anime doesn\u00b4t have that quality in terms of character develop. It doesn\u00b4t even have good characters in the first place .. only boobs. But .. no matter what the others say about how crappy the characters are, I still found that the world where they live in is really interesting .. it really reminds me a game and I love games so :D .. \\n\\n\r\nIf you like games or simply an anime with some action and boobs then I reccomend it. If you are just looking for a nice action / romance anime then .. turn away this is not your place. I really believe that there are anime much better than this one out there.",

            "content": "Ah, role playing games.  The common theatric in a role playing game is you, the player, controlling a little avatar of yourself as you explore the world and level up your skills, making yourself the best adventurer out there.  So, to encapsulate that idea, we have Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, or \"Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon?\"  in the Spring 2015 season to tell us this.  Let's start our journey!\r\nStory (7.48/10): Danmachi as the shorthanded way of calling this show is, takes place in a fantasy realm, a world where Godsand Goddesses (of actual mythos names for gods that exist within our world) have come down to earth to be amongst their children, sealing off their divine powers in the process.  Here, the people are given blessings by their gods and goddess, given power to do magics and \"level up\" like general RPG style manner and become a member in their familia, going down in a dungeon in order to fight monsters, loot them, and sell them so they can buy more stuff and become stronger, simple RPG mechanics.  Here, we follow the story of Bell Cranel, a beginner adventurer that becomes one just so he can meet girls (hence the title of the show).  Here, he is chased by a deadly minotaur, and is heroically saved by a blond beauty known as Aiz Wallenstein.  And from there, our story begins.\\n\\n\r\nThe structure of Danmachi is very reminiscent to a standard RPG, where our main character, Bell, starts off at a very base level and slowly makes his ascent up to become stronger and stronger, gaining new equipment, skills, and abilities along the way.  The show really puts emphasis on the growth of the main character as you go by episode to episode, which is nice to see, as you can observe the progress of our main character grind, quest, party build, and improve as the series goes along.  For the most part, the series focuses mainly on Bell and his party, with a group of episodes devoted to each of the three members, with of course, most of the development devoted to Bell.\\n\\n\r\nIn addition, the show does boast some harem-like aspects that depending on your view of harem, can influence how you enjoy this show.  Cause in a show like this, characters are slowly fed into importance, giving the viewer more and more important and non-important characters to view and know.  And when you have a show that involves a weak little boy trying his love luck in a deadly dungeon, he's going to be meeting some lady friends along the way that will undeniable fall for him because he's nice.  \\n\\n\r\nLike good fantasy anime, Danmachi puts slight emphasis on world building, detailing the different parts of the world of Danmachi and explaining the kinds of places and the set of rules that the series follows as you go along.  World building is essential to any good fantasy anime on account of the fact that every anime of this category follows different rules, rules that need to be explained to the viewer, or risk being considered garbage on account of poor explanation to the kind of place we're viewing.\\n\\n\r\nBut there are a couple things that I feel lacking with the show.  For one thing, there are several points the feel completely forgotten or are virtually unexplained.  Not everything in Danmachi is properly detailed completely, which leaves some gray areas in unexplained plot.  The biggest example of this is with the show's alluded villain who does cause some ruckus for our MC to solve, taking about 3-5 episodes of runtime, but her motives and her actions just don't seem very clear.  In addition, in comparison to the source material, there're some missing parallels and some decently important scenes that just never made it to the animated version. \\n\\n\r\nAbove all, I felt as though the show's ending was really kind of a smack to the face, dousing the viewer with a pretty hefty character trait that vies for something of a second season in order to explain that, or something of that sort.  The reason for that is because the show doesn't really...end.  It says \"fin\" at the end of the show and it feels like an ending, but there's so many plot points that just simply aren't resolved.  Bell doesn't get the girl (well, he kinda does, but it's not official, so I'm not calling it.), the motives for all of the characters are far from clear, and the show just kinda drops this huge thing at the end, and...that does not sit well with me.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  RPG-style story that works\\n\r\n+  World building\\n\r\n-   Plot holes/lack of character motive explanation\\n\r\n-   Rushed\\n\r\n-   Pretty frustrating ending  \\n\\n\r\nCharacters (7.64/10): The characters for Danmachi are varied, to say the least.  Like an RPG game, the anime showcases many races from what you would see from any given fantasy world, including normal humans, animal-like humans, elves, dwarves, etc.  \\n\\n\r\nBell Cranel is our main protagonist in this series, aka the character who thanks to sheer luck, is also a bit of a harem king in some strange aspect.  As a thief/rouge type of character, Bell is a knife wielder with light armor with an oddly high speed/dexterity stat.  At the start of the series, Bell is a bit of a crybaby/wimp, being unable to pull himself up to the level of being a proper adventurer on account of his Level 1 status, and his chronic fear of minotaurs.  As I have mentioned before, the series goes along with Bell's growth as he stacks up numerous accomplishments to make himself be recognized as a proper adventurer (if not a little but OP all things considering).  As a result, Bell is a nicely developed character, as he's not too too rushed and he develops over time at a nice pace.  The only issue...is also his chronic fear of the females.  In Harem King terms, Bell rather than being perverted, is the nervous kind, leading him to be reluctant to even try to get close to the girl he's fallen for, leading to some frustrating (yet hilarious) running away scenes to the point that not only do characters notice this behavior, but Bell himself does too.  (It's...kind of annoying.)\\n\\n\r\nAnd then we have Hestia, the featured goddess of the Danmachi series.  Now, unlike her real world counterpart, Hestia is not a modest woman of the hearth who swears herself to perpetual virginity, but rather a poor goddess wearing a tattered dress who's loli sized with large breasts that thirsts for Bell's love.  (Quite an opposite, ain't it?)  For the most part, that's really all there is to her character.  She's very clingy (territorial even) when it comes to the only person in her familia (Bell), and acts very childish and throws tantrums every time Bell is in her eyes \"unfaithful\" or something like that.  While she is actually a pretty fun character, giving off a sense of comedic feel for the show, she doesn't really actually have much development in her personality, leaving her to be stagnant in that regard.  Her character revolves around Bell's existence, so she has no real development parts herself.  She really just serves as a mascot for the series above all.  Hell, if you type in \"boob ribbon\" on google, you'll get pics of Hestia's dress because of how scarily iconic that blue thing under her chest is now.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd then to round out the trio of character mentions, we have Aiz Wallenstein, the girl that Bell wants to shoot for to test his luck in the love game.  In terms of character, Aiz is that cool, silent girl with the oddly adorable blank face who's slightly airheaded.  Likewise with Hestia's case, she doesn't appear all that often, which really saddens me a bit because while her character revolved around Bell to some extent, she still had enough room to be more interesting and overall be a better character, not that she's not already a decent character already, but it's nice to have a little bit of development.  \\n\\n\r\nSide characters in Danmachi are twofold, the characters that hang around Bell, and those that are outside of our MC's circle that come to know who he is and the kind of fast progression he has in the series.  For the two characters Lili and Welf that belong to Bell's party, each one of them develop a small story for each of them, gaining the character development for the series aside from Bell.  They share a lot of focus from the show, which in turn, makes them into better characters that get backstories and character development.  As for the other group, the characters that belong there are for the most part, cast members that bring more life into the world of Danmachi, featuring people that see Bell from time to time on occasion, other gods like Hephaestus, Hermes, and Loki, other girls like Syr and Eina, and Freya...  \\n\\n\r\nAdmittedly, the biggest issue I have with the characters is mostly with Freya.  As the character who seems to be the premier villain for the show, Freya really doesn't do anything.  Because there're some missing details in the show, a lot of what Freya does canonically, doesn't actually get shown and further makes her a little less involved with the show period.  She doesn't really have much of a purpose and that really bugs me because I feel like she actually does more than what she is shown to do here in the anime.  (Admittedly, J.C. has a history of cutting corners.)\\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+  Good character development\\n\r\n+  Good main cast\\n\r\n+  Lots of races  (This is a personal positive)\\n\r\n-   \"Villain\" character didn't really seem to do all that much \\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound (7.44/10): In terms of art, the style that J.C. staff went for is a very standard looking style in this day and age.  There's nothing really standout about it aside from the fact that it looks decent nice, so generally, I would say that the show's appearance really isn't all that noteworthy.  \\n\\n\r\nOn the other hand though, the action scenes that the show showcases a lot are very fluid and nice.  It is rather smooth and the nice addition of blood spraying everywhere when a monster or character gets hit is nice, as it shows the battle progress that has been going on.  \\n\\n\r\nAnd since this is a harem show, there's bound to be some ecchi, so here's the obligatory ecchi paragraph that I do with a show that has a great deal of fanservice.  For the most part, the fanservice isn't all that obvious.  However, because Hestia exists, we have some...ahem, interesting physics that go around this series.  And because of Hestia's design, expect quite a few scenes like that from time to time.\\n\\n\r\nIn terms of sound, the Danmachi's OP and ED are good tracks, with a whimsical OP and a cheerful ED.  Would I say they're memorable?  Yes, I would agree that to an extent, they can be considered memorable.  Are they masterpieces?  Not really, but they're pretty fun songs nonetheless.  In terms of music in the anime itself, there really isn't anything that's worth mentioning cause there isn't anything that I can actually recall hearing specifically.  \\n\\n\r\nOverview:\\n\r\n+ Decent animation\\n\r\n+ Good battle scenes\\n\r\n+ Memorable OP and ED\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Enjoyment (8.32/10): As a fan of RPGs and harems in general, Danmachi was a show that I knew for a fact suited my tastes in anime.  Sure enough, I was right.  Overall, my thoughts on Danmachi aren't really all that significant for it.  It wasn't a show that had any thought provoking themes, it had flaws but not any grave ones that hampered the show a staggering amount, and it was overall, fun to watch.\\n\\n\r\nDid I like this anime?\\n\\n\r\nYes I did.  It really showcased the RPG element that it was based off of with Bell getting new gear and weapons, leveling up to get stronger, and getting to tougher areas, which really made the show very appealing to me.  The characters were also quite fun seeing as how I'm a fan of MC's that are strong but not TOO strong (still kinda OP at the end though...), and how the overall feel of the show really gripped me into the story at times.\\n\\n\r\nWhat didn't I like about this anime?\\n\\n\r\nMy biggest issue with this series is mainly with the personalities and screen time that a good chunk of the characters get.  Hestia herself while great because of her obsessiveness over Bell, did get irritating at times, Aiz was great but didn't get featured as much as I would've liked, and Freya was just kind of...not there for 90% of the series.  Plus those set of lines thrown in by Hermes at the end REALLY pisses me off.  You don't end a series by putting in a crap ton of information that can allude to a season two, and then end it with a giant \"fin\" at the end, that's just not right J.C.!  \\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend this anime?\\n\\n\r\nIf you're a fan of RPG fantasy games like I am or you're looking for something fun to watch, I'd say Danmachi fits the bill pretty well.  It's not a perfect series on account on some of its glaring issues and use of fanserive, but it's a fun show, but far from a masterpiece.  A good show for a marathon on an afternoon of relaxation.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.50/10",

            "content": "DanMachi is a show that doesn't try to be much of anything other than a decently entertaining watch to pass the time (and to drum up light novel sales, but that's another story). \r\nThe story is nothing to write home about. To try and make it seem like DanMachi is doing something original with the players getting trapped in a video game premise, because for all intents and purposes, the real world IS the video game. Granted, it is fairly interesting seeing simple gaming terms such as leveling up and skills being name dropped in a setting that isn't actually a video game, but itstill doesn't make it any more original. I really do like the setting though. It isn't that much more special than your typical anime fantasy setting, but it coincides well with other plot points such as the gods and goddesses. \\n\\n\r\nThe actual plot is about as simple as you can get. Our main character, Bell Cranel, wants to become a hero and get stronger so a girl who was much stronger than him at ep 1 will respect and fall in love with him. No seriously, that's it. You really can't get much more of a paper thin plot than that. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are actually worse off than the story if you can believe it. Bell Cranel has many noticeable character flaws, but to his credit, there are some things done to alleviate a few of his problems. Even though he is extremely overpowered after a while, and a bunch of stupid powerful skills and weapons get asspulled out of nowhere to make him ever more powerful, the simple fact that he starts off with basically nothing makes him a little better off. He and his goddess, Hestia, have little to nothing, and his determination to get off the ground and get stronger makes the whole \"become a hero\" plot thing have more humility and humbleness. Unfortunately, there isn't really anything to alleviate his massive case of harem syndrome, where almost every single female (keep in mind most of the cast is female, probably to drive home this sole fact) has at least a crush on him. It's silly and unrealistic, but there isn't much you can do with a harem to begin with, so I won't harp on it too much.\\n\\n\r\nHestia was the talk of the town in the anime community for a while with her character design. Apparently combining big boobs with the loli stature and a boob ribbon makes for a riveting character. She does get some decent development early on with her earnest dedication to help Bell as much as she can, but loses lots of screentime after the halfway point, making her character feel fairly insignificant as time goes on.\\n\\n\r\nOther than that, there is an incredibly large cast of characters, and many of them have little to nothing other than their standard sole character trait, but I'll quickly explain my thoughts on some of the more prominent ones. \\n\\n\r\nI think they went too far with Lili to the point where I couldn't reason with her actions even though they were explained. I get her lack of trust, but it doesn't make sense to me that she would still try to actively hurt Bell after how honest Bell was (Bell was stupid about the situation too, but it kind of comes with the territory with characters of his nature). \\n\\n\r\nWelf's whole thing with magic weapons didn't really make sense.\\n\\n\r\n Quiet characters can make some of the best characters if written well, and Aiz wasn't interesting. She was just plain boring. Ryu was a little better off, but not by much.\\n\\n\r\nFor the most part, the art looks like typical J.C. Staff fare. That's not really a bad thing, it just has that very soft and faint look that a lot of there shows have. The animation definitely has it's high points though. There weren't many, but there were a couple of fight scenes were really well choreographed with great use of camera work. Bell's fight with a minotaur was easily the best part of the whole series because it not only utilized those elements well, it also created perfect tension. I mean, you know Bell is gonna win, but it certainly doesn't hinder your show to give him a losing perspective from time to time, now does it?\\n\\n\r\nEven though the show doesn't try to do much, and also has a great deal of flaws, I still managed to enjoy it for what it was. Even though the story and characters were weak, the simple fact of it being set in a fantasy world with game mechanics and some good fight scenes makes even the most mediocre of shows such as this still bearable. Call me a pleb if you must, but sometimes I just can't help myself. I still wouldn't really recommend this to most people unless you are like me and just like the idea of RPG anime.",

It doesn't claim to be something very unique or groundbreaking, nor does it attempt to be. So rating it low just because you wanted it to be something it is not, when it never claimed to to be that, is absurd.\r\nIt's a fantasy action adventure comedy with fanservice, and it does its job well in that department. Sure, it has a clich\u00e9 good guy main character, and most characters are clich\u00e9s as well, but thatdoesn't necessarily make it a bad anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is decent and the pacing of the series is good. The animation is good and the music is okay. The sense of being in a fantasy MMORPG world is its main unique selling point for me. The journey of the main character and how he discovers himself while making allies and friends along the way is what I like about the anime.\\n\\n\r\nIf you're looking for a serious thought provoking anime, you're looking in the wrong place.

            "content": "This review is for the ENTIRE season!!!!\r\nINTRO: The story takes place in a world called Orario. In this world a popular spot to travel and gain high status is by entering and conquering levels within a dungeon. This dungeon contains an assortment of monsters where adventurers, which are the people that embark in these quests into the dungeon, go to defeat these creatures to gain access to their droppings, which in this case are shards. These shards are used to craft magical items and weapons, and can also be exchanged for currency. Some of the residents of Orario join Familias, which are clans ruled bya diety. The adventurers are ranked by a letter level system, which allows them to gain experience, therefore becoming stronger and gaining new abilities. \\n\\n\r\nSort of sounds like a RPG, but in this case, it\u2019s their real life.\\n\\n\r\nPLOT: The story revolves around a young boy of the name, Bell Cranel. Unlike the rest of the citizens of Orario, this boy comes with a unique set of skills that are later unlocked as the plot progresses. He is the only member of the Familia Hestia, as a result, he has to work harder when questing in the dungeon. After an incident in the dungeon, a world known adventurer of the name, Aiz Wallenstein, has to come save Bell. After being saved by Aiz, he falls in love with her and vows to become as strong or stronger than her, so that he may be the one to save his loved ones.\\n\\n\r\nThe plot mainly revolves around the aspects of maturity, strength, integrity, and passion. With Bell never wanting to give up and setting aside his failures and embarrassments, he makes new friends that join him along his adventure to have him seek the glory he so much deserves. Conquering dungeons and defeating monsters stronger than him, Bell creates a name for himself, as a result bringing fame and new enemies.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION & SOUND: The animation for DanMachi is superb. It is vibrant, colorful, friendly, and down right awesome. The music never lacks either! Every single scenario, whether goofy and fun, serious and passionate or a battle amongst adventurers and dungeon monsters, the original soundtrack and fluidity of the animation make it come to life.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS: DanMachi comes with a set of generic and unique characters and personalities. \\n\r\nI may find it difficult not to like Bell, but he sometimes can get on your nerves. I blame the na\u00efve tendency the author chose for him, aside from that he is marvelous main character. It might have taken some time to show his true potential, but believe me when I say that it is worth the wait! There is also Hestia, a loli Goddess with the body of a grown woman! While being a sight for sore eyes, Hestia is an energetic and amazingly kind and supporting Goddess to her Familia. She takes up the role of supporter within a few episodes and it makes her relatable to real life situtaions, but despite being mature and dependable, she is also a jealous and somewhat lazy Goddess. Her love for Bell makes it a fun and friendly venture through this series. Welf Crozzo is a straight-forward and honest person. Lili has a double personality where one shows off despising herself and the other is cheerful and positive. Aiz is caring and supportive. So a unique cast in certain, but generic in aspects of, \u201cwe have seen this before\u201d. \\n\r\nDon\u2019t worry, it hardly disturbs the progression of the plot and character development. This might be me, nitpicking.\\n\\n\r\nCONS: I have very few problems with this anime in general, but with this being a review, I must not be biased and address the issues I had when watching it. I felt some of the battle scenes could have a dragged an extra episode. Towards the end where Bell and company are fighting against the level 5 dungeon monster that appeared on the 18th floor, it seemed too rushed and the montage of still-framed battle scenes took away from the emotional rush I had felt during Bell\u2019s battle against the altered minotaur and the level 5 monstrosity. I also didn\u2019t like Bell\u2019s childish approach to the females\u2019 affection towards him. I wish he had more of a confident personality and took advantage of openings, because at this moment, sure he is in love with Aiz, but I felt that there could have been a change in affection and he would have gained new feelings for other female characters, due to the lack of interaction between he and Aiz.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL: I will give this anime an 8/10. This anime gave me a lot of excitement. It had me wishing the week we go by because it would always leave you in a nice cliffhanger. The character development and plot worked smoothly with each other and backed themselves up, never leading us to a dead end. It never dragged and keep it\u2019s momentum at an all time high. It ended how it started, amazing.\\n\\n\r\nCheck out my channel for the same review, but with added scenes and music from the anime. :]\\n\r\nwww.youtube.com/projektbaka\\n",

            "content": "(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)\r\nI think it is pretty typical for people to have a role model. It might be someone who is always around us, like a family member or a close friend. Or it might be a celebrity or athlete who, while not having direct impact on another\u2019s life, manages to affect countless others by simply being. For me, it is my father. He provides for his family, he works extremely hard, and he always, always wants only the best for his kids. Something simple he does that I hope to replicate is, during Christmas (we call himMr. Christmas because he gets so into it), he wraps the base of the trees around his house with green lights and the branches wrapped in red and white ones, so that they become trees of lights rather than simply trees with lights. He is someone I will never fail to look up to, and will always aspire to be. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? is actually a rhetorical question, with it instead focusing on this kind of inspiration, providing its audience with a less than stellar anime.\\n\\n\r\nSTORY\\n\\n\r\nDungeon (the shortening of choice from here-on-out) stars Bell Cranel who has just recently been recruited into the goddess Hestia\u2019s \u201cFamilia.\u201d One day, he is saved by Aiz Wallenstein, a legendary woman both in beauty and swordsmanship, which inspires Bell to become someone of her caliber.\\n\\n\r\nThe show finds some success in its theme on inspiration through the use of role models. Here, in Dungeon, people look up to (or down on) others as a means to assess their own prowess because the benchmarks for what is strong and weak are defined by the people partaking in the tower runs, arena battles, and tavern visits. So the anime depicts these kinds of scenarios to demonstrate how someone becomes better due to the way another acts or carries themself. Bell looks up to Aiz, so the latter goes about training the former; after witnessing Bell\u2019s impressive abilities, members of a guild push themselves harder; and Hestia, seeing her precious family member work so fervently, causes her to do the same, laboring herself to support him. At the same time, the anime also looks at the darker side of inspiration, namely obsession and revenge. Half the reason why the events of the anime take place are due to outside influences caused by a being who, for better or worse, is infatuated with the young lad. In other words, she is so taken by him, so inspired by whom he is and what he can do, it causes her to unleash a rampaging goliath and an extraordinary Minotaur that disrupts the everyday flow. There are also segments where Bell becomes the target of undue hate, turning into a kind of anti-role model. In these moments, people become inspired to conspire against him because of his trustworthiness and status where they trap him with monsters and kidnap Hestia, respectively. Inspiration is normally good, but can often times be used for bad intentions, with the anime covering both handily enough.\\n\\n\r\nDungeon begins to suffer when one looks beyond the theme that is woven throughout. Most notably is the anime\u2019s complete lack of world-building. There are many aspects to the world that are presented: a leveling system, magical spells, a huge tower for questing, a banking system, armors, weapons, varying classes, special abilities, diverse races, a political game of godly proportions, etc. Yet nothing within this list is properly explained despite the anime relying on such facets time and again. Not taking steps to flesh out the setting \u2013 especially one steeped in fantasy and fiction \u2013 makes it unnecessarily difficult for the audience to be engrossed by the show that needs to make its world distinct and, to an extent, understandable.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also a glaring issue with the anime\u2019s attempt at a harem. Now, a harem is, like any \u201cstory-telling\u201d element, not automatically a negative so long as the execution of it is noticeable. In Dungeon, the harem aspect serves little purpose outside of detracting from the narrative and its goals. One major problem associated with the harem is how it reduces the authenticity of the \u201cromance\u201d being established between Aiz and Bell. It is clear through the anime\u2019s events that these two are the staple couple, so when more and more women are added to the mix, the most important relationship is weakened. The harem also does not influence what happens at large; besides being used for the same jealousy joke, this aspect of the anime does not affect the fighting that occurs or the direction of the plot. A possible reasoning for having the harem in the first place is because it would seem to follow its own theme of role models. That is, the women look to Bell as someone worth striving for. Unfortunately this has more to do with affection rather than inspiration, since the girls are not necessarily looking to be like him but rather be with him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, the theme of inspiration is explored nicely enough but the lack of proper world-building and the misused harem bring the entire package down.\\n\\n\r\nANIMATION\\n\\n\r\nAs if to continue with the anime\u2019s difficulty in crafting a believable world, Dungeon missteps once more when it comes to its art. Again, the problem is foregoing \u201cexplanation,\u201d or in this case variety. The dungeon-tower that is investigated daily starts to blend together after a certain point with the same, boring rock formations and color palates. The main city is no different; outside of the bank and the tavern, very little of the area is explored besides what is seen in an intercity scuffle. The most prominent location is Bell and Hestia\u2019s home, but even there it is a bed and a table only.\\n\\n\r\nDungeon does manage to do well with its fight choreography, showcasing easy-to-follow battles and a plethora of combinations between many of the different characters. The character designs are likewise well-composed, with Bell looking like the innocent boy he is portrayed as being and Ryu\u2019s elven robes signifying her beauty both of body and swordsmanship.\\n\\n\r\nActual animation also manages to remain above average throughout the season. Facial expressions are quite detailed, as are the movements of the characters both inside and outside of the battlefield. Bell\u2019s fight with the Minotaur was particularly impressive in this regard.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS\\n\\n\r\nOne of Dungeon\u2019s biggest problems is not setting up an appropriate antagonist. The person poised to take this role was Freya, the woman scarily obsessed with Bell, but not only is she never looked at in-depth after her introduction but she is so far away from the happenings \u2013 she uses pawns and tricks to do her bidding \u2013 that the anime makes it inherently impossible to develop or at the very minimum characterize who she is. By not having an antagonist, it confuses the audience about what Bell is fighting for and, more relevant, who he is fighting against. In this scenario, it becomes \u201cBell versus the world\u201d which introduces even more faults. As has been established, the world of Dungeon is not provided, meaning making it the main adversary is silly since, like Freya, nothing about it is known. Along the same lines, this kind of thinking does not fit with the show\u2019s theme on inspiration. The setting might be seen as something that inspires people to fight for or protect it but Bell is never depicted as doing this. Instead, he is more concerned about the other inspirations in his life, with the world being more or less an afterthought.\\n\\n\r\nArguably the strongest character of the anime is Liliruca. A young, cat-like girl of small proportions, she had grown up to despise the humans that wronged her. Similar to her fake ears, she would come to establish a fa\u00e7ade that hid her vile behavior behind the kindness and sweetness she regularly dished out. She would steal, she would lie, and she would deceive anyone around her to get her way, even Bell, the first human to show her the empathy she needed. This should not be taken lightly; he was not exempt from her antics because, as it was shown, it was a deeply-rooted issue that manifested in her past and continued into the present, which made her conclude that the future would likely hold the same outcome. It is not until she completely betrays Bell, is left to die by her other harassers, and is eventually saved (both physically and mentally) by the boy who she wronged for so long, that she breaks down hard. She bawls, weeping over the terrible actions she took and crying from finally finding someone who truly cared for her. Seeing her move from despondency to elation, from child to adult, due to the inspiration she received from Bell was wonderful to witness, making her the best character of the show.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the cast is, unfortunately, placed on a lower tier. Welf is given an episode of his own, but like a lot of the cast members, there is little given about him as well as no development to speak of. Aiz falls under the same troubles; besides her exceptional battle prowess and emotionless nature, the anime spends no time on her actual person, which is odd considering how much of an inspiration she is to Bell. Speaking of the main lead, Bell sits slightly higher character-wise, but not by much. Initially, he is perceived as a coward, as someone who cannot help himself. It is this ridicule from others that sparks him to become better. Not as a person but as fighter because the rest of the anime has his stats leveling up as opposed to his actual self. He has hardships in the form of fights but he remains the same, happy-go-lucky Bell from start to finish.\\n\\n\r\nThere does exist some symbolism that reflects the characters \u2013 Bell has \u201cfirebolt\u201d to match his fiery passion; Welf\u2019s \u201cwill-o-wisp\u201d ability, that stops enemy spells, coincides with his refusal to work on his own craft; and Liliruca can morph into a bunny like how she use to \u201cmorph\u201d her outward self \u2013 but it is not enough to make up for the lack of execution that nearly every character faces.\\n\\n\r\nSOUND\\n\\n\r\nDungeon\u2019s opening theme starts off alright but quickly devolves into a less-than-stellar track. The vocalist does not seem to have the power to back the song, with the actual music being produced going every which way in terms of beat and tone. The background singers do not help either; they are more annoying than supportive, detracting the listener from actually being able to hear the piece. The ending theme, on the other hand, is nice due to the slow build-up, resounding trumpets, and catchiness that it incorporates. It is a fun piece that captures the (usually) up-beat nature of the anime.\\n\\n\r\nThe rest of the soundtrack is par for the course. Nothing is immediately noteworthy, with most of the pieces fitting the atmosphere in place. That is, many of the tracks use flutes, guitars, and pipes to give it that adventurous and slice-of-life feel. There are also standard piano pieces for the sad times and triumphant, adrenaline-filled pieces for those fighting moments. It is an okay OST overall that performs at an appropriate level.\\n\\n\r\nVoice acting for Dungeon is somewhere above average. A special shout-out is deserved for Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Bell for his on-point screaming.\\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT\\n\\n\r\nAlthough I criticized the anime for having a harem where none was needed, I still liked that aspect. As a romance aficionado, watching as all of the women blushed or fought over Bell was usually enough to make me happy. However, I would have liked to have seen more progress between him and Aiz since it felt like their relationship was tossed on the wayside despite the general importance of it.\\n\\n\r\nI was actually a fan of Hestia as well, boob-string and all. She was pretty much there for comic-relief, what with her silly faces, overreactions, and protectiveness of her \u201cchild.\u201d She, like the majority of the cast, did not add much beyond her superficial characteristics, but she was still fun to experience over the season.\\n\\n\r\nBeyond the harem and Hestia segments, there was not much else I found myself particularly liking. The battles were fine, except the final one; it seemed too all over the place with unexplained details, such as the weapons being used and the offhand comment about Bell being Zeus\u2019s descendent. As for the other characters, I cannot say I was particularly fond of them, either. Many of them are attractive or funny but do not have the same impact that Hestia managed to bring about, so characters like Ryu or Aiz are cool but do not have enough surrounding them to make them worth remembering.\\n\\n\r\nWhile the show\u2019s theme on inspiration is nice as are parts of the art it presents, there is not enough story- and character-wise to make the anime worthwhile. And while the harem aspect is fun it ultimately prevents the show from accomplishing what it set out to do. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? That is still a question up for debate. But at this point it is clear that, if anything, the anime needs to pick up the slack for any continuations.\\n\\n\r\nSUMMARY\\n\\n\r\nStory: Bad, theme of inspiration through role models is there, but the high focus on the harem and the low focus on the actual world hurt it\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: Good, boring art style, nice fight choreography, nice character designs, above average actual animation\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Bad, Liliruca is good but the rest, from Bell to Welf to Aiz, cannot pull their own weight\\n\\n\r\nSound: Fine, bad OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, above average VA work\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: Fine, Hestia and the harem antics were fun, but not much else was\\n\\n\r\nFinal Score: 4/10",

            "content": "Score: 6.4\r\nFirst thing's first, if you haven't already watched an anime in the VRMMO-type category (including SAO, Accel World, or Log Horizon, to name a few) then watch one of those first, to see just about everyone else's perspective.\r\nArt: 8 - The character and enemy models generally aren't the greatest, compared to anime that came out a few years before it, but the environments and effects are done well enough. I like that the character models are somewhat differentiated.\r\nSound: 8 - I'm not the best judge of this category, but the intro song is alright and the sound effects match the action well enoughthat I suppose it deserves an 8/10.\\n\\n\r\nStory: 4 - Here's where the anime goes wrong. Just about everything that's done here is a clone of any number of other anime. There are many shots of a tower in the distance, but instead the story focuses on a dungeon, which goes down. Not very logical, now is it? The workings of this anime are similar to VRMMO-type anime, where there are levels and respawns and such, but it never explicitly tells you that they're in a VRMMO. Instead, they tend to take matters very seriously and present this as the real world, just with goddesses everywhere. They actually get some of the lore mixed up, as at first they were showing off some gods as goddesses (ex: Hephaestus), so I thought \"I guess they just wanted to be consistent,\" but then they introduced us to Hermes, a male god. This anime has a lot of missing backstory (why are there walls? Are there any other towns, etc.) and left a lot of things to be resolved in the second season, which I suppose is alright. Hopefully that season or an OVA or two will explain the story better. For right now, it just drops the viewer in, expecting them to understand everything that's going on.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 4 - The characters in this anime are very cliche, they fulfill the typical harem roles, that is to say, one alpha and a dozen soulless betas. Other than a few main characters, and perhaps Ryuu, the characters have no personality. In fact, one of the characters (Aiz Wallenstein) is a clone of Mashiro Shiina from Sakurasou, just a pro fighter instead of a pro artist. The characters in this anime are one of its weakest, if not the weakest, point.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 8 - I like this anime. That is because I play games first, watch anime second. If you are not like me, then you will likely be annoyed this anime exists. There is sometimes too much fan service (such as bouncing boobs in the beginning of every episode), and there are quite a few cliches, but overall it's okay. I watched it in a marathon, and wouldn't mind seeing a season 2 to tie things up.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6.4 - Unoriginal ideas, but a few good points make this a decent show. If you like games and/or VRMMO-type anime, then I'd say watch this. It's not the best, but it satisfies.",

            "content": "Alright so now that the old post had been removed, I feel that it's my fault and i should've updated this anime review but this time I will be so critic.\r\n*Spoiler-free* (Includes general overview of the story)\r\nStory:  8\r\nWhy 8 ? That would be because of the expandable content of the story and I really love how the anime is adapted to a video game enviroment where gamers will remember how amazing it was to play and farm for hours in dungeons and meeting new people, then I realize that most of us quit after being hacked/scammed. Now furthermore, I realized this story isn't verystable when it comes to how it moves on and progresses. Like it starts off with a blow then it settles for a while then it skyrockets then lands smoothly. The ending impressed me cause it had hints for a second season which is very very ANTICIPATED by me and I would really love it.\\n\\n\r\nArt: 8 \\n\\n\r\nWell, there's nothing so so unique about the art of the anime. To be honest, it's an anime catered around males due to the art funneled towards sex appeals of women. But what I didn't like is that the anime could have contained more effects in battle like the ones we see in video games, however battles are intense.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\\n\r\nThe opening started with an amazing beat that reminds me of something however when it started the thing just went wrong !! Besides the opening and ending, the anime could have used dubstep in some situations , don't get the wrong idea the anime added music and tones that provides a mood.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 9\\n\\n\r\nOne of the main protagonists, Hestia, is loved by everyone for her being tooo KAWAIII and lovely. Sometimes it makes you feel, Why don't girls like her exist ? Well the other protagonist, Bell Cranel, is rather the dreamer and is very unique but isn't like every other anime protagonist (Too Overpowered) and is balanced yet he must have something in him or else he wouldn't be chosen as the protagonist.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9\\n\\n\r\nI loved loved loved and I repeat I loved the anime so much. I wake up on midnight my timing to watch the latest episode. Why you'd ask ? The anime had everything. An amazing blend of Comedy,Romance,and Superpowers. More over, it's very fun to watch because the jokes are too original and has some sort of men humour and also some jokes only women would \\n\r\nunderstand.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8 \\n\\n\r\nIf you were to criticize an anime too much, you'd never be able to enjoy any ... Just go with the flow, it's an anime you won't regret having a look. Thank to \"DanMachi\" I want to watch Sword Art Online just to see similar content to this.\\n",

Wtf are these Jap morons thinking of coming up with such title, that conflicts the anime/novel's plot?Ok, so did the MC guy picked up any girls in the dungeon??????Ans....NOOOOOO! In fact it wasn't him who picked up them girls, rather it's the other way around, we saw Hestia making him her first Familia member,  we saw Liliruca who tricked her way to the MC guy's heart, Ryu Lion wasn't even part of the MC guy's harem, the MC guy's moment with  Aiz Wallenstein, for the most part occurred outside of the dungeon and so on and so forth, so the story category of this anime.......(up) was so poor in almost everything that for the most part it relies a lot from the MC guy's relationship with his sponsor, Hestia. Ar (up)t, well considering that Hestia in her petite size is one cute loli whore, Aiz is pretty much the quintessential hot tough girl and Lion is one damned hot elf that very hot and it's all good, never mind the limited fanservice. Sound (up) I just don't have much to say about the VA's and the anime's ost, so a mediocre it is.\\n\\n\r\nOn the character category(up)...ok since its all about the MC guy, Bell Cranel , the thing about him was that he very much a typical adventurer who has some potential to be great, but the annoying part about him was how stupid is he when it comes to romance, also the way he was portrayed was that he was made to have a suppose relationship with Aiz, but the role of Hestia was a purposely assigned character to simply kept the MC guy in her grasp, which adds to my annoyance. As to Aiz  Wallenstein, I just can't figure out as to why her character prevents her from competing for the MC guy's affection, it was such as waste that she wasn't in the last episode that would have added to the anime's action genre, also it was quite odd that her character was suppose to be with the MC guy, but instead the MC guy was made to have a loli romance and I'm referring to Hestia and Lili whom is the only one competing for the MC guy's affection. Let's not forget the other female character's like, Eina Tulle, Syr Flover and  Ryu Lion who were suppose to be the MC guy's harem members but were not, pretty much they're more of an ambiguity than anything else, so pretty much the character category is as poor as poor. But, the enjoyment factor (up) was pretty decent despite of mu annoyance with the MC guy, so in an overall sense(Up) it was still all good to be watched, thought it can use a little more fanservice in it like some Hestia panty shots, but that's just me. PEACE!  \\n\\n",

In fact, the first thing we see is an amazing swordswoman kicking the ass of a minotaur in order to save Bell. \\n\\n\r\nThe series is set in a world where gods and goddesses descent from heavens to join humans, giving up their divine powers and establishing \"familias\", guilds in which  adventurers join and receive the blessing of the god or goddess of that familia. Bell is part of the Hestia familia, which is one of the poorest of all, as he is the only member of that guild and the \" headquarters\" is just an old, tiny church.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were the best part of the series. Bell is far more interesting than other characters, as his motivations are more human and feel natural. Besides, his powers actually have some kind of explanation, ome that goes along with the setting. And his relationship with Hestia is amazing! And yes, she's the boobilicious character that has appeared everywhere, but, to my surprise, that disn't define her character. The fan service was not a main part of the story, and that let Hestia and other girls feel like interesting characters with stories behind them, being two examples Liliruca and Ryu.\\n\\n\r\nThe animation was impressively good, being solid throughout the series. The battle in the middle part of the series one of the best of the year.\\n\\n\r\nThis is series I'd like to call the middle point between Log Horizon and SAO, as it has the characters and development of the first and the well done animation that define the second. This is a series I'd recommend to anyone looking for well done characters and relationships, and amazingly animated battles.\\n\\n\r\nDon't miss it, and I hope that it gets a second season!\\n",

            "content": "This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)\r\n[Synopsis]: In the city of Orario lies a labyrinthine structure of floors called the Dungeon to which adventurers and craftsman journey from far and wide in attempt to make a name for themselves and explore the mysterious Dungeon. Adventurers partner up with gods and goddesses to form Familias in order to better vanquish the monsters of the Dungeon and form guild-like communities with one another. Bell Cranel (Matsuoka, Yoshitsugu), the sole member of the Goddess Hestia\u2019s (Minase, Inori) Familia, is a fledgling adventurer with aspirations of love and heroism. Along with his goddess Hestia, he strives tobecome a strong adventurer so that he can fulfill his dreams\\n\\n\r\n[Characters]:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters were a minor point of strength for DanMachi due to its fairly large recurring cast as well as the small quirks and abilities exhibited by each character. The show didn\u2019t focus too much attention on the development of characters outside of Bell and his companions and so the side characters came off a little flat however their basic traits and designs worked well enough to keep them interesting and occasionally memorable despite this. At the same time however, the show offered up a great deal of fan-service and many of the characters, especially the more uninspired members of the cast, frequently showed up for no real reason beyond this point which somewhat cheapened this element within the show.\\n\\n\r\nBell Cranel, the protagonist adventurer of the show, is good-natured and exhibits most of the traits you would expect of the action show protagonist. One thing I will say is that he has quite a timid disposition \u2013 especially around women, however this somewhat sets him apart from the more typical shounen leads in that he gives him a good place to start from in the development department as well as an extra point of comedy and interest. He is amiable to nearly everyone he meets however also proves fairly thick-headed to any romantic interests exhibited by other members of the cast in typical fashion for a show with harem undertones. He has legitimate development throughout the show however only so much as can be expected in its 13 episode length and therein doesn\u2019t change drastically but rather in more subtle ways.\\n\\n\r\nHestia, the lonely goddess who inducted Bell into her Familia after failing to recruit others, is extremely protective and caring of Bell and works hard in all that she does in order to better help him in his quest to become a strong adventurer. While she, as a goddess and head of a Familia, has some plot relevance as a character, she mostly occupies a comedic role within the show. She is often jealous of other women that try to get close to Bell and can be quite petty in how she brushes them off and covets Bell however at the end of the day they have a good relationship and her affection for him is genuine beyond that of a comedic dynamic. One of the real problems with Hestia \u2013 and this is a problem that I see elsewhere in the cast as well, is that she exists almost purely for the sake of comedy and fan-service however the show, while cashing in on these aspects, attempts to paint her as a more legitimate figure. This approach doesn\u2019t quite work for the show and by the time it wanted me to take the character of Hestia seriously, I simply couldn\u2019t and anyone that was able to was most likely swiftly undermined by another gag or a crotch shot.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a good deal of somewhat interesting characters elsewhere in the cast and some probably more so than the main duo at times as those close to Bell also receive character insights and development. There are antagonistic presences in the show but no great overarching enemy which needs to be defeated \u2013 despite this the show avoids feeling overly formulaic in this aspect and the obstacles Bell must overcome are not so straightforward in their depiction yet the show still exhibits a pretty predictable course of events.\\n\\n\r\n[Art/Animation]:\\n\\n\r\nI feel that the first thing to talk about in this section are the wonderful designs from Yasuda Suzuhito \u2013 his style is conveyed well in this adaptation and each character feels quite visually unique without feeling outlandish amongst the other members of the cast. People that have enjoyed his work elsewhere would do well to watch the show if only for this reason.\\n\\n\r\nThe character designs aside, the animation of the show was consistent throughout and was played up for the more important scenes in exciting fashion. There were a couple quality drops here and there infrequently but never during a key moment and not so often that they would become distracting from the scene or setting. As the show deals primarily with venturing into the Dungeon, I would be remiss to not give some critical attention to the monsters that dwell within. They weren\u2019t all that creative or even innovative, featuring mainly things like minotaurs and corrupted beasts however overall they felt pretty par for the course and at least each represented somewhat of a formidable threat and in that way avoided being truly dismissable.\\n\\n\r\n[Story]:\\n\\n\r\nThe story, while not necessarily a strength of the show, was done well enough and primarily succeeded in its minor character introduction arcs and it\u2019s finale. The story itself is more or less what you would expect from the premise and so the fact that nothing drastically different and more complete grows out of it should come as no surprise. The end goal of picking up girls and of becoming a hero are a bit abstract and so the show doesn\u2019t work so directly towards these things \u2013 choosing to build itself up to key moments and at other times meander about in a more comedic and laid back manner. At the end of the day the show is about adventure and so the lack of a more typical core story doesn\u2019t really hurt the show. One of the negative things I will say about the plot is simply that it felt like the 13 episodes adapted up until a point in the light novels and then ended. This is not to say the show arrived at a good conclusion and didn\u2019t have a thrilling finale, simply that the ending does not leave the viewer with a feeling of completion or full on closure due to it\u2019s source material being on-going.\\n\\n\r\nBetween Bell\u2019s initial escapades and the introduction of his companions and acquaintances the show features primarily action and adventure however will have the odd episode occasionally which is more comically inclined and so someone who can enjoy both sides of the show will ultimately enjoy it more however the show does not forget itself so much to lose its audience who is more interested in the world and the Dungeon. The actual system at play within the world is quite reminiscent of the classic MMORPG elements found in shows like Sword Art Online and so DanMachi is often compared to them for this reason. I think the show does enough for itself to at least stand out differently than its similar cousins however at the end of the day, there is monster looting, guild-like communities, and a protagonist voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu. Despite these similarities, one should not base whether or not to watch the show on their previous enjoyment or lack thereof of things like SAO because DanMachi is ultimately a different show and goes about things differently. The only reason I would give for someone avoiding the show on this topic is if the viewer in question had a problem with the system of things that SAO originally tried to capture and not because of any other qualms about the show.\\n\\n\r\n[Music]:\\n\\n\r\nThe music was definitely a strong point of the show and worked well with the show\u2019s intense action scenes and occasional monologues. The soundtrack was never exploited in a way where I felt that the show relied on one or two songs too heavily and so the music felt fresh and exciting throughout.\\n\\n\r\n[Final Thoughts and Rating]: \\n\\n\r\nComing from the action/fantasy/comedy genre I think it is fair to say that the show aimed to be fun and I think it achieved that. It didn\u2019t take itself seriously enough to be a full-blown action show however it certainly had its moments and even a majority of the time was spent in that way \u2013 it kept things light while still investigating darker themes which I felt worked well for the show. The plot may have come off as a little stereotypical and overly pandering to the interests of it\u2019s audience but I don\u2019t think these things had the power to ruin the show.\\n\\n\r\nWhile I may have enjoyed a few characters such as Ryu and Aiz, the majority of the cast came off as pretty bland however not quite forgettable because of their individual abilities and the way the show chose to highlight these minor intricacies especially near the end. While the show attempted to offer a wide range of characters whom I could invest myself in, I was only able to do so with a select few because of characters like Hestia who trivialized the rest of the cast and mainly furthered the show\u2019s harem dynamic.\\n\\n\r\nRating: 6\\n\\n\r\nI gave DanMachi a 6 because at the end of the day it was enjoyable and had some awesome characters and action scenes and whatever qualities within the show that weren\u2019t enjoyable or where\u2019t aimed at me were not enough to completely outweigh what parts I did enjoy. It wasn\u2019t as good as a good many other action shows and I don\u2019t think it did anything particularly innovative however if I had to summarize whatever praise I have for the show, it would be that it offered up a fun cast of characters (regardless of their shortcomings) alongside a well established and quite typical action/fantasy story.\\n\\n\r\n[Recommendations]:\\n\\n\r\nI would recommenced DanMachi to any fan of great action sequences and the more typical shounen action show dynamic. It did these things well on top of providing mediocre to decent comedy. Fans of SAO would feel right at home watching this however at the same time, those who disliked SAO I feel would be safe giving the show a shot despite its similarities. Those interested in the romance or the harem elements of the show would perhaps find enough content to sate themselves however I would warn that the show doesn\u2019t explore the romantic side of things all that much though it does have more romantic comedy than I thought it would.",

            "content": "DanMachi is a perfect example of a successful formula applied in a very unoffensive, reasonably executed, and acceptable style. This is not a series that pushes any boundaries, or tries any original techniques. It is just a good series to highlight the state of Anime in mid-2015. It's not going to be winning any awards, but you could certainly do much worse.\r\n- Story -\r\nThe first term that comes to mind with DanMachi is \"formulaic.\" Not in a bad way mind you. It is a fairly nice formula, employed fairly effectively. The story is interesting enough that you don't want to toss it. Sure, it's thestandard \"becoming a hero\" plot presented so blatantly that the series full on lampshades it. There's no suspense, and nothing to foreshadow. The hero is always the nice kid, he always has to overcome a challenge, and he always wins. The only real good thing to say here is that the story doesn't try to stick out. It takes you through the paces, shows you the scenes you would expect, when you would expect them, and then gets out of your way.\\n\\n\r\n- Characters - \\n\\n\r\nFortunately the characters are a bit stronger. They are relatable enough that they don't feel artificial. Each of the main characters gets the obligatory story arc, with the obligatory story about how they are actually really good, but how they haven't been able to rise to their potential. All in all, they're fun little stories with satisfying resolutions. These certainly aren't the qualities of memorable characters, but they never really hit any sour notes either, which leaves a decently satisfying experience.\\n\\n\r\n- Art - \\n\\n\r\nThe one area where the series stands out is the art. J.C.Staff was in good form with the art direction this time. The characters are unique and full of personality. Each certainly has their own style, and range of expressions. All the motions are really smooth and dynamic, and it's clear that a lot of work went into making them seem alive.\\n\\n\r\nI think they could have done with a bit less of the fan service, but I suppose it's to be expected with this \"RPG Game\" genre that's been popular lately. My only real complaint in this department would be the backgrounds.  There are a lot of boring caves and reused scenes for interiors. The few vistas the series treats us to are not particularly expansive or appealing. Fortunately these elements are played off in a way that puts the characters center stage, so I won't ding them too hard on it.\\n\\n\r\n- Sound -\\n\\n\r\nAnother strong, arguably the strongest area, is the sound direction. The musical score marches the feel and direction of the anime very well, and the orchestral rendition through the entire series give it a nice, uplifting feel. The sound effects are also top notch. You can always expect to hear a fair bit of atmosphere, while the actual primary actions are always sharp, and never blur with the rest of the sound. The voices suit the characters, and the performances are very professional. Unfortunately given the somewhat shallow story you never get to see the actors put to the test, but I won't count off for that.\\n\\n\r\n- Overall -\\n\\n\r\nIn all I think the series is fairly enjoyable. It's a nice series to watch if you have a few hours here and there, and you don't have anything more pressing to do. It won't load you up with heavy concepts and stories, and it won't be too cheesy that you turn away in disgust. Just a nice safe middle ground. There are even nods to other popular series interspersed throughout, and it's a fun challenge trying to recognize them. Give it a try if you simply want a light series for casual watching. Maybe watch it in between marathon sessions of deep, emotional, complex stuff to clear you palate.",

Whilst there is some fanservice, it really isn't as bad as I thought it would be. \r\nThe story itself is simple and treads a fairly familiar path of a young adventurer who starts of weak but has hidden potential quite apart from a kind and moral heart. The beauty of the storyhowever lies in how relatable the characters are and the chemistry of the leads. With simple stories, it is not just about the premise but the execution that counts - to that end, the main characters are just a lot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nIn general I don't really care about art and sound unless they are exceptionally good or bad. In this case, they serve the series well in making us care for the characters and enjoy watching them develop and grow.\\n\\n\r\nWhilst this anime is not lifechanging nor particularly thought provoking, it does it's job of holding your attention and providing entertainment throughout the series with no real flaws or particular disappointments. Perhaps the only downside is the short single cour ending leaving a feeling of lack of completion. I sincerely hope that there is a second season because this feels like a 2 cour anime at least to allow an opportunity for some resolution of plot points.\\n\\n\r\nIn summary, don't let the poor written reviews or your pre/misconceptions about the title and style of anime put you off.\\n\\n\r\nIf you watch it, the vast majority of you will enjoy it's light hearted style and have a fun time watching it. I know that I certainly didnt feel that I wasted my time watching this series and can recommend this anime if you are looking for a charming series to fill your time with!",

The spectrum of anime appeals to quite a few niches and for the one DanMachi is shooting for it does an excellent job.  If you take anime seriously you might call this show a guilty pleasure.  If you've seen every anime comedy/action trope a hundred times across hundreds of similar anime and still findyourself laughing and appreciate it when it is well done then DanMachi is an anime I feel executes that well.\\n\r\n     I enjoyed this show the same way I enjoyed Prison School, just as something light-hearted, with likable characters, a healthy dose of fan service, some intense moments, a main character who isn't a whiny bitch, and plenty of laughs.  For what it is, DanMachi did a great job as far as I'm concerned.  No it's not Brotherhood, Steins;Gate, or whatever you feel is the apex of anime story telling but it doesn't need to be and accomplishes what I feel it set out to be.  As always there's no accounting for personal taste.\\n",

Gods (from several mythologies) basically have given up their powers and come to live among mortals.  Each god can form a \"familia\" (read: gang/guild).  The world is presented as a town with a multi-floor dungeon attached.  Character and enemy abilities are presented as if this were a video game, however the world is NOT set in a video game.  The story follows a boy who joins (and is the only member of) the familia of the goddess Hestia.  Thegoddess is in love with him, although he kind of just ignores that fact.  The story is about the boy getting a remarkable skill *exp plus/Super growth* after he gets saved from a near-death encounter with an OOP monster in the dungeon.  From then you watch him grow and try to make it through the dungeon while being sabotaged by *parties you will learn about*.  \\n\\n\r\nI will keep this short.  It's an enjoyable show.  The characters are fun to watch.  The world is interesting (although not fully explored) and you keep wanting to learn more about it.  The main is pretty standard (gentleman, earnest, shy with his feelings, wants to get stronger), and that doesn't bother me.  Several of the battle scenes are drawn very well.  The comedy is light hearted and sometimes slightly perverted.  There are obvious fan service shots, but not nearly as heavy as an ecchi show might be.  Plus the main is pure/innocent so the show never gets lewd.\\n\\n\r\nAll in all it's just fun!  Do you like to see a new world get explored?  A main character grow and meet interesting characters along the way?  Well animated action?  If so, just watch this show!  Ignore all the haters.\\n\\n\r\nGiven I'm a huge gamer so that might influence how much I enjoyed the show.",

            "content": "Was there some kind of intentional ironic humor in calling the story \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" This guy is not, by any stretch of the imagination, \"picking up\" any girls in the dungeon. Is \"pick up\" is someone's incorrect translation? Was it some false advertising to try and sell copies? I can only guess.\r\nIt's effectively a Sword Art Online clone.\r\nThis story rips off Sword Art Online down to a vanilla Asuna clone called Aiz. There\u2019s a tower with levels to clear. There's even a fight with a horned beast copied right out of the Aincrad Arc.\r\nNow thateveryone and their mother has established that this is a Sword Art mimic, as it's pretty blatant, let me try and summarize the comparisons between Kirito and Bell. Why? Maybe you liked Kirito, and you were recommended this because it's a Sword Art imitation. Maybe you want to be entertained by another Kirito, so let me start by assuring you that at least this is NOT Kirito.\\n\\n\r\nUnlike Bell, Kirito was not a typical harem beta male. He had his own little charming personality and was actually fairly charismatic, confident, and smooth around females. That\u2019s the one thing you could at least respect about him. Every female in the show wanting him inside them was kind of justified. Unfortunately it went too far to the point he became an annoying Gary Stu, too perfect, always winning at everything.\\n\\n\r\nBell is almost the opposite extreme, personality-wise. Bell is not charming. He's not charismatic in any way. He's just generic, oblivious, nervous-around-females harem lead #4123. Every interaction with women is predictably cringe-worthy. Every time he wakes up in Aiz's lap he screams like a girl. Every. Time. There's an episode where he wakes up in her lap and literally barrel rolls out of there in terror. There's another episode were we have this sequence:\\n\\n\r\n*Wakes up in Aiz\u2019s lap*\\n\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cAAAAAAAAHHHHH\u201d\\n\r\n*Wakes up in Aiz\u2019s lap*\\n\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cAAAAAAAAHHHHH\u201d\\n\r\n*Wakes up in Aiz\u2019s lap*\\n\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cAAAAAAAAHHHHH\u201d\\n\\n\r\nThis isn\u2019t funny even as a joke. And I\u2019ve lost count of how many times he has apologized to a woman for no reason. I am emphasizing this because it really is that irritating. It\u2019s boring. It\u2019s not interesting. Why characters like this appeal to anyone is beyond me. I\u2019ve never met anyone like this in real life. I guess they\u2019re all in that weird country, Japan.\\n\\n\r\nAnd yet every female without exception creams for him. Unlike with Kirito, it's for no reason other than him being a self-insert for the Japanese male audience. Because the girls are creaming for him from day one even when he\u2019s still a weak nooblet.\\n\\n\r\nWriters of fiction in this genre can\u2019t seem to create a unique character or one with any depth. I'm tired of this. And if you are too, I suggest avoiding Danmachi, or whatever it\u2019s called, and anything like it.\\n\\n\r\nBell is just another kid who soon gets convenient plot device power-ups. He wants to be strong like Aiz, so he can become a hero and hopefully eventually maybe get between her legs\u2026 Or at least that\u2019s the general gist of it. We can\u2019t be entirely sure that this kid is even aware of where babies exactly come from. We can at least assume his hormones are active. So he gets a plot-device-special-ability-haxx with some pretentious Latin name. This special ability causes him to level up fast due to him being thirsty for Aiz. I wish I were making this up. Kirito's plot device haxx were pretty bullshit too, but nowhere near this bad. This is like the writer isn\u2019t even trying.\\n\\n\r\nMaybe this might seem like an attempt to be inspirational and something like \u201cfighting for your dreams even if it\u2019s hopeless\u201d or whatever. But lazy plot devices like that cheapen this theme and strip it of any real meaning. What makes a story about personal struggle inspiring or entertaining is the uncertainty, the suspense. It\u2019s the fact - or at least the convincing enough illusion - that they might very well fail and lose all they hold dear. With cheap haxx and free power-ups like this, there is no uncertainty. There is no real suspense. The writer has pretty much guaranteed that the protagonist will get what he wants in the end. Everything else, every fabricated struggle is just a formality.\\n\\n\r\nNow let\u2019s compare this and Sword Art with regard to the plot. They shoehorned in RPG elements like experience points, stats, and levels. The story\u2019s world is not a video game though, so I can\u2019t think of any reason for the writer to add those things other than to blatantly emulate Sword Art or .Hack or whatever else.\\n\\n\r\nI don\u2019t even feel a real sense of urgency in Danmachi, even though it\u2019s not a game. Most of the time, no one is really forcing the adventurers to risk their lives in the dungeon. And there is not even a mildly compelling antagonist other than some one-dimensional sex goddess who also wants Bell\u2019s dick for no reason.\\n\\n\r\nAnd lastly it\u2019s not even an entertaining trainwreck, losing any semblance of reason halfway through and becoming \u201cso bad, it\u2019s good.\u201d There\u2019s nothing creative about this. It\u2019s a straightforward, predictable tale about naive little Bell. He will spend half the time mindlessly grinding in the tower so he can become a \u201chero,\u201d get the girl, and do something with her like kiss her on the mouth or have sex or something. He will spend the other half apologizing to females for existing. It\u2019s a video game you\u2019ve probably played before. It's a harem you've probably watched before. I\u2019m not sure why you wouldn\u2019t get tired of playing/watching it, but whatever floats your boat\u2026\\n\\n\r\nThe reason I just spent a few paragraphs to comparing Danmachi to Sword Art Online is because it\u2019s an imitation (or maybe a parody? I honestly don\u2019t know at this point. Here\u2019s my general feeling after plowing through this due to morbid curiosity: \u201cnotsureifsrs.jpg\u201d). Therefore, comparing them is the best way I know how to tell a potential viewer whether they should bother with Danmachi. So there you have it: a poor man\u2019s, or rather, a homeless man\u2019s Sword Art Online. If that appeals to you, go for it.",

            "content": "This is not a bad show, but it's also pretty much the epitome of standard harem fantasy. It has everything: a generic \"nice guy\" protagonist that is randomly given ultimate power, a bunch of female characters enamoured with him for variably shallow reasons, a purely serviceable setting and plot. It's visually appealing and relaxing to watch, just the same way as those trashy isekai shows are, but I don't think it does anything fresh or brilliant enough to deserve much of the praise it gets. \r\nOn the bright side, there are some really cool elements in the setting that are mostly yet to be explored- the pasts of most major characters, the role and real powers of the gods, the nature and function of the titular dungeon are all more or less blank slates. The first season mostly focuses on Bell himself and personally, I find him to be an extremely dull and forgettable lead. The supporting cast is better, but none of them really get a chance to shine and their backstories are established only on a very superficial level. Everything in this series lacks depth, which is often the case with 13-episode shows trying to introduce a grand setting and a lot of characters, but the solution for that is simply to not focus on so many things at once and Dungeon has yet to stumble upon the definitions of \"restraint\" and \"focus\" in its dictionary.\\n\\n\r\nI also have to note that I'm not really into harem anime and this probably affect my enjoyment to some extent - harem tropes are very strong here, even though the show doesn't go overboard on fanservice and the protagonist is not the most clueless one out there (but is still way too much on the \"embodiment of good\" side of things). \\n\\n\r\nIn the end, I don't regret my time with Dungeon, but I'd also warn against picking it up if you're looking for anything more than mindless entertainment. There's nothing new or particularly compelling here - just a fun, simple adventure story, like dozens of other lighthearted fantasy anime. Maybe the second season, coming this summer, will expand on the formula and turn the show into something slightly more interesting - for now, however, it's just that - a well-produced, but generic harem series.",

            "content": "Video Review is up on my Youtube Channel, but here is the written review.\r\nStory - 5/10\r\nTo keep it simple, I\u2019m going to refer the show as DanMachi since the title is shorter. A long time ago, gods from the heavens decided it was time for them to have some excitement in their life, so they went down to the world, to live with the inhabitants below. Now this world has a place known as the Dungeon, where creatures when slayed by Adventurers, drop shards which can be exchanged for many things in the world. Bell Cranel is one of these adventurers, and goes on theseadventures in the dungeon in order to improve himself. He\u2019s not trying to pick up girls intentionally, but he does think the stronger he gets he\u2019ll move closer to the girl he looks up to, Aiz Wallenstein. Accompanying Bell, is his goddess, Hestia who helps him with his stats and management. The show really has nothing to do with picking up girls in a dungeon, but more of an underdog story to reach your goals.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is rather generic to begin with. A protagonist goes out of his way to challenge himself in order to improve himself, to get those around him to notice him. The big overarching problem I find with DanMachi is that the world that the story takes place, needs a better explanation. After doing some extra research, yes the world they do live in is real, just with RPG elements. They don\u2019t explain how this came to pass, you\u2019re just going to have to accept it\u2019s a real world with RPG elements. And that feels like a cop out, they already explained that gods came into the world, why don\u2019t they expand on that, besides came down onto the world and lived with the residents. The plot overall is average, it\u2019s nothing special, but it\u2019s not bad. It just really needed to work on its lore, and it doesn't help that the story is kind of generic.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 6/10\\n\\n\r\nBell Cranel is our main protagonist of DanMachi, and he literally fulfils the job criteria of almost a lot of protagonist in this type genre. Is he weak, but\u2019s gets stronger as the series progress? Yes. Is he a nice guy? Yes. Is he a somewhat good looking teenage boy? Yes. Does He attract a lot of girls along the way? Yes. And is he oblivious to the obvious surrounding girls who want him already? YES. Now to be fair I like Bell as a protagonist, he\u2019s not douche as the title would've suggest him going to dungeons to pick up girls for his own enjoyment. I do like how the story centres around Bell, and we get to see him really grow as the series went on. But perhaps the reason he grows a bit slow is because he\u2019s completely na\u00efve and trusts everyone despite how they look.\\n\\n\r\nHestia is Bell\u2019s goddess and he is her familia. Apart from being the character for her iconic blue ribbon and tone of amount of fan service, she is fulfils the role as the main female protagonist. She has an obvious thing for Bell, and gets overly jealous for all the girls he obliviously attract. As the series go on, there isn\u2019t really much development for her character other than the fact she starts off worried about Bell, but starts to have more confident in him later on. So it\u2019s a shame for a character with that much hype to be underdeveloped, but then again she was hyped for ribbon.\\n\\n\r\nUnfortunately, the main cast aren\u2019t all that interesting compared to their supporting cast. Each supporting cast character has a purpose, as they all play a role in levelling up Bell. Each supporting cast character backstory is interesting enough for the time it was shown and they are important to the storyline. Aiz, is Bell\u2019s driving force to become stronger. Lili, not only being Bell\u2019s supporter, helps him grow as a leader. And Welf Crozzo, despite his many appearance in the opening and ending, only shows up for the last 4 episodes, shows to be the Big Brother type Bell needed to help him move forward. Because they are supporting characters, they get their fair share enough of screen time. However as for a general overview of the cast, I must say it\u2019s not a very strong cast, sure they all fulfil their role and are interesting in some way, but there wasn\u2019t really anyone you could delve very deep into. There wasn\u2019t really anyone that caught my eye.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation and Sound - 9/10, 6/10\\n\\n\r\nHere is where DanMachi shines brightest. The animation for the fight scenes in DanMachi look incredible. It is well animated and well-polished, it moves smoothly and looks clean. What I like about the animation is that we get enough of it to be well entertained, it doesn\u2019t go by quickly, but at the same time it doesn\u2019t drag too long. The art design is clean as well, and it really fits that bright fantasy world setting. Each character has a unique design, but that being said unfortunately I find the monster designs kind of generic. They come in range of typical fantasy creatures, with very generic looking designs and they give them red glowing eyes to signify it\u2019s a monster, but this only applies to the common monsters, I do like the designs of the Boss Monsters, they look cool. Throw those in with the amazing fight scenes and you have an epic animated sequence.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the soundtrack of DanMachi, all I can say is it does its job well. It\u2019s a fantasy genre so expect something to mesh with it. You get a lot violins and pianos here and there. There is even a good accordion for the bar scenes, which is really nice to have in the fantasy genre. It really makes you feel like you were in that fantasy world. However all I can say is that I didn\u2019t find anything outstanding in the soundtrack, even for the epic fight scenes, the soundtrack for it didn\u2019t sound suspenseful enough for it, it should\u2019ve been more intense to add as if the protagonist was going to lose, but it was very quiet. For the opening and ending songs of DanMachi, they are catchy with cute sequences to go along with them.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI\u2019ve seen many shows like this before. It is rather typical and generic. It\u2019ll have to do something special to really get my attention, however the story is rather basic and the cast of characters aren\u2019t all that interesting as a whole, individually their fine, but there need to be more from them. The most enjoyment I got out of the show was watching the action scenes and incredible visuals, which is where I think the anime shines. You feel so immerse the world because looks good, and filled with nice colours. And as a typical fantasy lover, I do enjoy this type of show very much. The show besides the concept and title, isn\u2019t really breathtaking as a whole. \\n\\n\r\nVerdict - 6.5/10\\n\\n\r\nFor the story of DanMachi I give it an 5, as I believe it\u2019s an average story at best, it\u2019s been done many times and don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s pulled off well and was evenly paced, but it\u2019s so generic you most likely seen it many times. Plus the whole lore behind their world vaguely explained. \\n\\n\r\nFor animation and sound I give them a 9 and 6 respectively. The Animation is incredible to look at, it really depicts the fantasy world very well. The action scenes looked good and the designs of characters and boss look good, it was just the common creatures that were lacking. The soundtrack does a decent job of fitting in with the fantasy theme, but it was really lacking anything special. But the opening and ending themes were catchy and cute though.\\n\\n\r\nThe Characters of DanMachi get a 6 from me, as they are generic, but without them the story wouldn\u2019t be nearly as good as it could\u2019ve been. Each character had a purpose of helping Bell grow, but that is all there is to them. There wasn\u2019t really any character that stood out from the crowd. No one was really special.\\n\\n\r\nFor my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 7, as I have seen many depictions of this type of genre before. The story is really basic and the characters are lacking a spark to them. However I enjoyed seeing the world that was created, through the visuals and being a fan of the fantasy genre. I wished they explained more on the world, as that was something I found a bit confusing, seeing how everything worked. But I got enough dose of action when it came the fight scenes, as there was plenty of them and they were paced.\\n\\n\r\nFor the overall score after rounding it all up I give DanMachi a 6.5/10. It has basic plot and a generic set of characters who have their moments. The soundtrack is nothing special, but it\u2019s the animation that pushes it forward. The depiction of the fantasy world and the action scenes were the best thing about the series. I recommend this anime to fantasy fan, as the world is gorgeous to look at, but for the rest there have been many other shows that have been done better.\\n",

It was a concept i could relate to pretty easily.\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\\n\r\nThe art was stunning, it was bright, the outfits didn\u2019t get boring, and the character designs were all very cute. The color were vibrant and the action scenes transferred smoothly, making them quite enjoyable. I do have to say some of the scenes in the opening didnt quite work with the music\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\\n\r\nThe first opening hey world by yuka iguchi is a very bright and upbeat song and I believe it matched the show very well, I personally really enjoyed it and yuka`s voice is very beautiful.\\n\\n\r\nthe ending song right light rise by kannon wakeshima, i didn\u2019t like quite as much as the opening song but was still very good, it matched the mood of the anime and the animation went well with song.\\n\\n\r\ncharacter:\\n\\n\r\nIt starts out pretty slow paced but picks itself eventually. I really liked the characters they interacted well together, and the first few episodes were really enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nI really like the characters in Danmachi, bell shows obvious physical and mental growth and his personality is adorable. Hestia isnt a standard type, either which is something showing variety in her personality, however i do not think hestia had enough screen time, especially since we know almost nothing of her back-story.\\n\\n\r\nI did fine that as i continued the show they started throwing in random side characters, taking away alot of space for character development regarding the main characters. Some didn\u2019t even last for longer than one or 2 episodes or only had one minute of screen time an episode. I feel like this time could have been spend on showing maybe a bit more back-story of the main characters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\\n\r\nI think overall Danmachi was a very enjoyable show, appealing to both anime and gaming audiences. Funny with still a decent storyline\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\\n\r\nNow this show had a lot of controversy when it aired due to the fact that it contained a lot of fan-service and the story was lacking in some places, personally i think you should just enjoy the show for what it is  a light , fantasy anime that will give you a few laughs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n-celeena",

Bell was the main character, and around him were many girls who really loved him and worshipped him. (Harem) which I didn't see \"Harem\" in genre.\r\n2. Bell's personality is annoying and uninteresting, he is just pathetic, always being sorry for everything and a real coward.\r\n3. Bell is OP. To avoid spoilers, I'll just say he's really OP. \r\nFrom reasons 1-3, I'll rate the characters with a rating of 5\r\n4. Interference in every interesting scene. Whenthere's an interesting scene between Bell and a girl, it always has to be ruined, making it into \"Comedy\", well some people may like it at least.\\n\r\n5. There isn't a story line or developing plot. The anime just \"happens\". Characters come every some episodes, adding to the count of the girls more girls and make it more Harem.\\n\r\nStory will get 3.\\n\r\n6. Opening and ending were boring and uninteresting. Well, as far as I know, openings should be cool and make the watcher want to watch the anime. \\n\r\nWell, not this time. I've heard the opening and ending and then I'm every episode I skipped on the opening.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack wasn't really good and not noticeable. \\n\r\nSound: 5\\n\\n\r\nArt will get 7 since it was OK. I have seen better arts in other anime but this wasn't THAT worse.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 6, since the concept was good and some fights really happened, it will get 6.\\n\r\nBottom line: I do not recommend this anime.If you are looking for action, don't watch it, but if you search a coward young man with many ladies and baths, go for it.",

            "content": "The only reason I picked up this series because of the name, I was still new to anime at the time so I didn't really know what was considered \"good.\" I didn't know much about anime or knew any friends that were into it at the time so I just kinda picked up random series that I thought sounded interesting and in doing so I ended up stopping on a series called Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? I don't really have to explain why I thought this sounded cool as i'm pretty sure anyone reading this review foundthe title to be pretty  \"interesting\" to say the least.\\n\\n\r\nI really didn't enjoy this anime that much but I also didn't hate it. It wasn't god awful but it certainly wasn't that great. It kind of reminded me of SAO but if SAO's main male wasn't edgy for the sake of being an edgy annoying basta... Sorry I really don't like him but anyway back to this show. The main character's not totally unlikable as he never really made me totally want to hit him but at the same time he wasn't interesting at all.. He was just stale, he wasn't all that funny he wasn't relatable of likable at all but at the same time he wasn't arrogant or anything, he was just... nothing. As for the rest of the characters, I can only consider one the slightest bit memorable and that's the Goddess, Hestia. The only reason I consider her memorable is because of her... personality, she seemed more like a main character than Bell, she actually seemed to somewhat have a personality and we got to see her relationship with the other goddess' and god's, she was actually pretty likable and we got more of a backstory to her than with the actual main character Bell. she set up all the the jokes for the most part and made this show go from a complete train wreck to a decent anime. She certainly wasn't the best character in terms of development but allot of people do find her to be the most likable character in the show.\\n\\n\r\nDespite what this title says this series doesn't have much to do with \"Picking up girls in a dungeon\" sure he gets allot of girls and stuff but the premise of the show isn't picking up girls in a dungeon, it's such a click-baity title that i'm surprised it's not the title to a YouTube video. The art work was pretty basic in terms of todays standards and the fight scenes were mediocre a best. The only real way i'd ever recommend you watch this anime is if you want to just learn about Hestia or just stare at her... Personality, but even than you can do that on lots of other \"sites\" and get a better story than this one. It's not bad but it's also not that great, not to mention there's only one season so if you do decide to give the series a shot i'd just recommend reading the Manga, I have never read the manga so I can't really say if it's all that good but I have heard it's about as good as the anime.",

            "content": "(TO MAKE MY ALL MY REVIEWS WELL ANALYSED AND FAIR, I WATCHED THE WHOLE SERIES TWICE AND LIST DOWN THE PROS AND CONS IN THE SECOND TIME) \r\nIs it wrong to pickup girls in a dungeon? Never found the answer, not eager to keep searching.\r\nSTORY - 4/10\r\n(Evaluation for the quality of the story of this series is made void of other factors, like the artistic value, sound and characters)\r\nWe can all agree that a story is what makes an Anime worth considering or not. When it comes to this series, honestly, the story is so mediocre, that you'd confuse it as an adaptation of achildren's storybook. It was a combination of simpleton thinking and unnecessary over-complication. What I mean by this is that this anime on one hand is so simple that you'll say it's cliche every 5 minutes or so, but on the other hand, is so complicated that you can hardly understand what is going in a particular scene.\\n\\n\r\nThat's why I'd say this Anime is an adaptation of a 5 year old's imagination. It's a cliche story of a boy who is a loser working hard to become a hero to impress girls and in the end succeeds in doing so. Somewhere along the way, I asked myself, \"am I watching an Anime written by a Sword Art Online fan?\"\\n\\n\r\nThe pacing was obviously rushed to the point that the climax didn't develop more than 2 episodes and the ending got everyone saying; \"That's it??\" The lack of exposition and proper development of the settings in the Anime made it hard to follow the plot. I swear I asked myself \"What is Hestia doing? Why are there weird symbols and stuff?\" almost every episode.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is overall quite disappointing but I guess it doesn't completely ruin the enjoyment of the Anime. (I'll explain more below) If you are the type to watch Anime based on the quality of the story, don't bother with this series. If you're going to watch this series, expect many plot holes (like the explanation of how the universe in this anime actually worked), a rushed climax resolution, and a disappointing ending. \\n\\n\r\nART - 8/10\\n\\n\r\n(Evaluation for the artistic value of this series is made void of other factors, like the quality of the story, sound and characters)\\n\\n\r\nThe art was very good in a sense that the setting felt realistic enough for you to experience and indulge the events as they are happening. I actually almost forgot that the story was bad because the Animation was good.\\n\\n\r\nThe Victorian-esque setting worked and anybody would be convinced that the story would've taken place in Victorian times. It suited the premise of the story and it helped compliment the adventure. The art was enough to make you react to it (like the realistic depiction of blood made me uncomfortable since I suffer from Hemophobia) and is quite memorable. The character's designs were perfectly suited to the target audience (younger audiences) where the colours and curves of the characters are exaggerated to give a youthful and sexually attractive feeling. This also made the characters look suitable in accord to their traits and personalities, and they were unique enough to make you able to distinguish their behaviors just by their looks. The animation panels were fluid and consistent enough for anyone to overlook any minor changes or fluctuations. The backgrounds however, were nice, but not special. It wasn't breath-taking enough to make me pause the video and say, \"wow\" thus I couldn't really rate the art higher than 8 for this reason alone.\\n\\n\r\nIn a sentence, I would say the art is good enough to make you keep watching even if you hated other aspects of the anime (story, characters, etc.)\\n\\n\r\nSOUND - 6/10  \\n\\n\r\nFirstly, let's talk about the opening theme. Any fan of ecchi would expect the theme to be joyful youthful and sound a little bit enticing (if that's the best word to describe it), and well, that's more or less what you get from this series. The theme isn't bad enough to deserve being skipped every episode, but it's not special enough to earn a spot in your Itunes playlist. In fact, give yourself a week and you'll probably forget what the theme was like.\\n\\n\r\nSecondly, the OST. It is not special, not enjoyable, but not trash. There were some tracks that aided in the development of the story, and didn't overpower the plot, but some scenes lack the track to make it feel emotional and strong. In other words, the background music won't make your heart beat faster when the scene is supposed to make you feel excited, but isn't trash enough for you to consider muting the video.\\n\\n\r\nThirdly, the voice acting. (BEAR IN MIND, I WATCHED THE SUBBED VERSION, THEREFORE MY THOUGHTS WILL BE BASED ON THE JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS). I had no problem with the voice acting. In fact, I guess it was to a certain extent good enough for you to believe that the voice actor was actually the Anime character. The voice actor for the main character even made it believable that he is somewhat innocent and just wanted to be a hero. All in all, I must say, the voice acting was fair enough to merit the sounds of this Anime a score of 6.\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER - 4/10\\n\\n\r\nThis is another aspect where I had quite a problem with the series.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character was probably the only one I must say deserves to be glossed over. After all, he's a young boy entering adolescence, obviously he'll be quite impulsive, unstable and to a certain degree quite the pervert.\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters however, where your typical set of girls. Ms Perfect, Ms Pervert, Ms Powerful, etc. The characters are so cliche that you wouldn't even bother remembering their names. Their development wasn't good either. It was rushed and quite illogical. For a perfect heroine who has everything she wants suddenly feel pity for a boy who's being picked on for starting from the bottom, it felt like a stretch to me. I didn't see the coincidence in the bar (this is where their relationship started to develop) to be believable and realistic. It sounded like the producer wanted to force the main protagonists to get along for no apparent reason. The backstory and exposition behind the characters were too rushed to the point that the character's motives isn't something you figure out from the events, but rather it is something directly told to you. They are definitely not special and memorable, so you wouldn't even remember their names. Not even the main hero, in fact. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT - 5/10\\n\\n\r\nOkay, let's be fair. Good story and perfect character development isn't everybody's cup of tea. Some may prefer blatant fan service and simple humour. I took that into consideration. Throughout the series, you will not run out of fan service, and if that rocks your boat, hey, great! The girls in this anime will keep you entertained! \\n\\n\r\nBut in a holistic evaluation, not even the fan service was enough to compensate for all the shortcomings of the series. The story will definitely annoy you at some point and the characters will fade away from your memory faster than you know it, and this will make it quite difficult to enjoy the series to the max. \\n\\n\r\nThat being said, this doesn't mean this Anime is completely unwatchable. To a certain extent, the adventure was exciting enough for you to keep rooting for the cute little hero. Even if you may get bored along the way, isn't that what the fan service is for though? You will somehow get through this Anime without gouging your eyeballs and cursing the kami, that's for sure.\\n\\n\r\nVERDICT = MEDIOCRE\\n\r\nOVERALL RATING = 5.4/10 \\n\\n",

The plot is good and I really like the whole RPG theme they added even tho it's not a legit game like SAO or /Hack. The characters are really cool and every single one of them has enough screen-time to get to know them well, not like many other animes these days that only focus arround the MC and barely use the other characters. Some fight scenes are really damn epic, like Bell's fight against the OP Minotaur... Damn thatshit was rad.The only bad thing I see about it It's how the the last episode finished in a huge cliff-hanger and It had a lot of plot holes.

            "content": "There came a time when humanity had to ask itself an important question: Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon? \r\nMaybe what humanity should have asked was \"Is it *possible* to pick up girls in a dungeon?\" For the protagonist, it might just be the other way around.\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nUnfortunately, this is one of those action/adventure/romance shows that scrapes the surface of action, adventure, and romance, but doesn't really go all the way in any of these categories.  Though I must admit I found myself wrapped up in the plot and interested in the storyline and potential romances, I alwaysended up wanting just a bit more of everything.  \\n\\n\r\nWhat bothered me the most was the harem going on, because even though there was clearly a girl Bell liked and wanted to end up with, things kind of just... fizzled out and every single chick in the series ended up falling madly in love with him. While this tends to be the case with a lot of romance/action shows, it is frustrating to have zero romantic closure in a show. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 9/10\\n\r\nLet's talk about character design. Because it was good. All the characters were attractively drawn, the backgrounds looked awesome, and the art matched.  It was some good art. Not particularly unique, but I have zero complaints. \\n\\n\r\nSound:6/10\\n\r\nThe opening for the show was fine. The music was fine. Nothing really struck me as memorable, and I never found myself saying \"wow I like this music! It really fits!\" But all in all, it was okay.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nOur protagonist, Bell, begins the series as a weak hero who often times has to be rescued by the very girls he wishes to protect. I know this turns a lot of watchers off, because frankly, watching someone try and fail to be awesome is kind of disappointing. But fear not, potential watchers! Actual character development occurs, and Bell's determination ends up paying off in a very satisfying way.  To be honest, Bell is a bit of a bland character in that he has very strict morals and seemingly no flaws other than that he's 'too nice,' which is sort of a running trend with noble heroes these days. That beings said, Bell is still a very likeable and interesting character (he's just a bit predictable.)\\n\\n\r\nThe other characters (AKA all the girls in love with Bell) don't seem to be very developed.  Honestly, while they are all interesting and they help add to the story, there is only one female character I can think of who actually had a decent back story (and she was probably the only one who wasn't head over heels for the protagonist.) The rest of them were really all there just to 'like Bell.' I was most disappointed with the girl that Bell likes the most, because she seemed to be the flattest and most two-dimensional of all.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7/10\\n\r\nI did not enjoy the romantic part of the show. But I enjoyed every other part. The action was interesting, the adventure had me hooked, and I laughed a few times at the comedy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nJust a fun show to watch to pass the time.  I thought it was good, but it didn't change my life or anything. A little cliche can't hurt you, and all in all, it was a good ride.",

The main character is the weakest link, since he is just the hero as designated by the plot, he goes into the dungeon as every other adventurer, but because he got an special ability which lets him level up fasterhe becomes stronger. Thus he has no admirable qualities to set him apart from the rest, he was just chosen.\\n\r\nPlot: it is generic, but competently executed. There is a half thought mystery thrown into the mix, which it's not develop in the 13 episodes, one of those read the manga animes. The whole harem aspect it's the worst part, the love interest is determined very early on, so you know the rest have no chance. This results in a series of female characters with no purpose.\\n\r\nAnimation: the color palette is an intriguing choice. It is very bright, and it contrast very well with the darker parts of the dungeon, but at the same time is very artificial, almost takes you away from the story. In the end, it's so bright an unreal that makes it hard to take serious the more dramatic aspects of the plot.\\n\r\nConclusion: an enjoyable anime just to pass the time, but it's very shallow. The ending is no ending at all and to know how the story will progress you have to read the manga, but I was not engage enough with the show to want to read the manga.",

There was a bit of suspense at one point which led to nothing really. Also, it could probably need a second season.It tends to get a bit boring. Of course, we see the rise of a hero; from a weakling to struggling to be powerful, fighting.

            "content": "*SPOILER FREE =)\r\nAlright!!! For the sake of being concise, I'll refer \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" to the popular alias - \r\nDanMachi\". Let's get in to it!\r\nSTORY 6/10\r\nThe story of \"DanMachi\" is set in a fantasy world in the town of Orario. Orario has several dungeons where brave adventurers go to gain glory and riches. There are several families which are led by gods/goddesses who have come down from the heavens to be with humans and interact with them. This is where our main characters, Bell and Hestia come in. The story is really about Bell's dream tobe stronger and a hero.\\n\\n\r\nHonestly, the story is pretty simple. Nothing fancy but it's good.\\n\\n\r\nART 8/10\\n\r\nThe fantasy setting is animated beautifully and the animation is strongest in the fights . This is shown when the creatures are destroyed and the production studio has paid close attention to the textures and details so points there. The colors are bright and it adds onto the fun adventure feel to anime which is always great.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8/10\\n\r\nThe opening is pretty good and has a fun vibe to it along with the ending. The OSTs are very well done in DanMachi. We hear casual fun OSTs with the comedic moments and laughs but the music in the fights are impressive. It has a dark and suspenseful tone to it with the viewer getting more tense alongside Bell and Hestia, especially in the last few episodes. The voice acting is amazing! Yoshitsugu Matsuoka voices Bell with a lot of skill and displays all sorts of emotions with him - happiness, shyness, excitement, frustration, fear and of course the humor. I love Bell's voice in the scenes with Aiz because Matsuoka does this hilarious yelp of embarrassment which will have you laughing like crazy. Another star voice actor is Inori Minase who voices Hestia. The tsundere and teasing romantic characteristics are captured perfectly with Minase's voice. Hestia has these moments of jealousy when she sees Bell with other girls and her voice absolutely shines in these moments where Minase expresses the emotions perfectly. \\n\\n\r\nCHARACTERS 9/10\\n\r\nBell Cranel is a 14-year old boy who has big dreams of being an adventurer. He's very shonen-esque but has very likable qualities to him. He was raised by his grandfather and has always seen excitement in life. In the beginning, we see he tries to join different families so that he can enter dungeons and finally be an adventurer. Unfortunately, every family he approaches quickly rejects him and sets him off with discouraging words. He struggles and he shows emotion of how hard it is to achieve these dreams. This is one of the wonderful things of Bell. He is very relatable. We see he is constantly underestimated and laughed at, making his dream to be a hero less achievable when no one believes in him. ENTER HESTIA\\n\\n\r\nHestia is a goddess who has the appearance of a pretty young girl. She has no followers in her family and is seen as a failure in the heavens. After she sees Bell, she notices the consistent rejection from each family and follows him. She grabs his attention and asks if he wants to join her family. This bond is very well done because of the similarities between the two characters but also their chemistry and incredible faith in each other. Hestia may seem like the typical fanservice type of girl at first but her energy and humor make her one of the shows strongest points. Despite being a goddess, she works very hard and stands against the discrimination to see Bell achieve his dream. She shows romantic affection and teases him throughout the series and it is very heartwarming to see the two in every scene.\\n\\n\r\nLiluca is a little girl who Bell defends in an alleyway after seeing her bullied by other adventurers. Both her parents were adventurers but were killed, leaving her alone to fend for herself in a world full of danger. She gets herself into trouble and relies on thievery in order to pay off debts and survive. Despite her efforts, she is constantly looked down upon and suffers physical and mental abuse from adventures, making her hate the idea of adventurers completely. Bell tries to help her and makes her a supporter with him in his dungeon adventures. However, Bell becomes a victim of her thievery and Liluca thinks only of her own survival. Liluca's character really highlights Bell's kindness and his ability to see the best in others as demonstrated with him still accepting Liluca as a friend. She is confused with his sympathy after being kicked around for so long. Liluca becomes close with Bell and joins the group in their quests as well as being a romantic competitor with Hestia, adding to the humor. Liluca is an okay character. In the beginning, it's irritating to see how many times she's tricked Bell and it's irritating to see her in the battles. I can only think of her screaming \"Beru-Sama\" but her backstory is good.\\n\\n\r\nAiz Wallenstein is a young girl who is hailed as the \"sword princess\" for her impressive swordsmanship and her performance in dungeons. She saves Bell in the first scene of the anime and serves as Bell's love interest throughout the show. Aiz presents herself as a quiet, understanding, and caring individual. She felt responsible for putting Bell in danger and trains him to be a stronger adventurer. She's a strong girl and represents Bell's resolve and dream. He wants to catch up to her and prove that he can be a strong adventurer. \\n\\n\r\nENJOYMENT 9/10\\n\r\nDanMachi is really fun to watch. The world is a joy to see and the anime captures the fantasy feel very well. The characters are super entertaining and have some of the best chemistry I've seen in anime. The fights are exciting and the music+animation only adds to the greatness. One of the most enjoyable anime I have seen.\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL 8/10\\n\r\nThis anime is a fun enjoyable experience. It'll make you laugh and you'll really connect with the characters throughout the show. I strongly disagree with the comparisons people have drawn concerning SAO as I feel the completely opposite emotions with both. This has a really nice balance of action, comedy, romance, and saddness which is great, especially for a 13 episode series.  I'll just say I loved this and I highly recommend it to anyone!!\\n\\n",

            "content": "\"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\", the question that has been asked since the beginning of the mankind. Those were also my father's last words before he went on a long quest, a journey to pick up girls from the dungeon. Sadly, it has been 15 years now and he never returned or the girls that he was supposed to pick. \r\n-Everyone used to say bad things about my Father, and I think they still do that he left his family behind to pick up girls from the dungeon, but I don't think he did that I believe himin that he would leave us for such simple reason, there's gotta be some kind of mystery a real authentic reason about the illuminati \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls \". I always wondered why is it wrong, what makes it wrong? From the Early Men times, men have been trying all sorts of techniques and unique ways to woo women. Now that I think about it, Early Men used to live in caves and caves=dungeons, there gotta be many scenarios where our Ancestors would try to pick up girls from the caves they used to live in, but why is that? Does our Ancestors knows something that we don't? There is something enigmatic about \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" I think the revelation will answer the true existence of mankind, the answer to universe and everything. Wait a sec....I think i have figured out something if you think about the Japanese title of this anime which is \"Dungeon ni Deai o Motomeru no wa Machigatte Iru Darou ka\" that has exactly 46 letters and if you subtract it by 4, then you have the number \"42\" which is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy number 42, and the \"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything\". OMFG, does the Japanese knows something that we don't? Do they have a way to talk to our Ancestors? It is no wonder why they always come first when it comes to tech advancement. \\n\\n\r\n-I think, I will continue to watch this anime for the Centillion time to figure out every mystery this anime has to offer and I believe you guys should do the same too because the true answer that I have achieved after so many decades of discoveries is it that, no, it is not wrong to pick up girls from the dungeon as you might not be prepared for the aftermath. I think my father had already figured out the answer which is why he was sounded so sure to go on a journey, some mishap must have happened in his Quest.",

            "content": "I can understand why this show gets the hate it does, but I think some of it is undeserved.\r\nStory wise there is a strange collision of mythos that actually works some how.  A few bits to highlight:\r\n- Hestia is an odd interpretation, though some of it fits. Classically she is the Goddess of hearth, home and family, so here feelings towards Bell kind of fit, but she's also classically under a vow of chastity.  She's also one of the oldest in the Greek pantheon, so really she should get more respect from the other deities.  She is a somewhat non-confrontational Goddess, lacksthe kind of domain specific skills that the others have, and is generally less well known, all of which fits her character in DanMachi. \\n\r\n- Hephaestus... I'm not going to say much on her other than that there is precedent in relevant mythology for Gods to switch sex for fun. \\n\r\n- Freya, being a Norse Goddess, is tricky.  I don't think she's classically as mean as she's being portrayed here, but she is a patron for love, sex, war and death, so it's not a huge leap. \\n\r\n- The tower. Comment was made about it not featuring much, which is wrong.  That is the tower of Bable, Old Testament biblical mythos.  Apparently in this world the consequences of building a tower to the heavens was different.  It's visited often as the dungeon appears to be under it. The dungeon goes down (not up like in SAO) and is likely an allusion to the Labyrinth of Daedalus.\\n\r\n- The general portray of the deities as fickle troublemakers is pretty consistent with their original stories.\\n\\n\r\nAs an establishing season it's not terrible, but it would have been nice to have had more information about Bell's first skill. \\n\\n\r\nThe art is touch less complex than some anime, but it's still pretty good and consistent.\\n\\n\r\nSound I have to heavily mark down just for how many times a slightly whiny \"Bell-kun!\" \"Kamisama!\" is heard.  Could make a drinking game out of just that.  Otherwise it's not bad, the opening and closing songs are pleasant (though they don't grab me quite as much as some others have) and the BGM stays in the background properly.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters... That's where it gets tricky. The harem aspect is painfully over the top, particularly since he makes it clear he's only interested in Aiz.  Having so many of the female characters inexplicably throw themselves at him actually gets in the way of the story... Although I suppose that is somewhat realistic. \\n\r\nThe lack of solid male characters is also disappointing, they're mostly shown as weaker fighters than their female peers and/or as chauvinist jerks. The few exceptions are kept in the background.  This will hopefully be balanced out as the story progresses.\\n\r\nMany characters are suffering from trope overload, though they do at least seem to have some personality beyond that.  I'm willing to write that off as a necessity of establishing their identity and purpose in the plot even though it could have been done better. \\n\r\nHaving Hestia be a loli-big-boobs is definitely a fan service choice, somewhat redeemed by the fact she knows she's well endowed and makes light of it.  It's also justified for her to have those boobs, considering her position of Goddess of family.\\n\r\nBell demonstrates depressing amounts of naivety on many occasions, particularly regarding his skill slots. This may frustrate you. \\n\\n\r\nThat pattern continues through the series, a lot of apparently pandering choices and tropes that start to get deconstructed or explained but aren't fully satisfied before the end of the season.  This is a show that could well get better as it goes on, assuming it doesn't crash and burn first.\\n\r\nSo essentially, Season 2 will be the make or break season for the anime.  Hopefully it gets that second season. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I enjoyed the show... It's just silly enough that you can ignore the flaws and enjoy it as a comedy, assuming harem isn't a deal breaker for you.  Just try not to look too hard for some deeper meaning or moral tale, I'm not sure there is one yet. \\n",

You will be finding yourself constantly asking questions of the details that have been missed, but I believe the author main focus is the action and learning to grow up. Hopefully once season 2 hits, we'll get to main story of what's happening. \r\nThe art is definitely outstanding compared to most anime out there. The action scenes are extremely well done and they don't blur out like most anime when it comesto quick action scenes. It will show every detail of fighting of when they fight from dodging to attacking to casting magic. I would seriously only watch the anime instead of the manga because the manga doesn't justify all the actions that is happening in the anime. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, I really did enjoy this anime as it was something new and the author tries to start something new that isn't part of the main stream. I would easily recommend this anime to any friends who are into action and adventure. Can't wait for season 2. \\n\\n",

            "content": "I really didn\u2019t expect anything from this show when I started watching it, only deciding to give it a try because of wanting to try as much of the new shows as possible. I was surprised that this show ended up becoming one of the more popular shows of the season, it just looked like one of those shows that would be mainly overlooked. But of course, this is anime, where fan-service, harems, and overpowered protagonists are all the fans care about. But putting aside popularity aside, let\u2019s talk about if the show is any good.\r\nStory + Characters\r\nThe show is very simple. There is adungeon filled with monsters. Adventures go into the dungeon to fight and kill the monsters with magic and sharp objects blessed by the power of gods and goddesses. And the story focuses on one such adventurer, Bell.\\n\\n\r\nNow, I really like Bell. He\u2019s your typical shonen protagonist, a bit sheepish, very na\u00efve with all the females falling in love with him, and he\u2019s a generally nice guy, wanting to help and protect his friends while being willing to forgive those who hurt him. Despite the fact that his character really isn\u2019t anything new or unique, he\u2019s the type of person I really want to root for. I want to see him get stronger, to overcome his foes.\\n\\n\r\nI really liked seeing him become respected as the show went on, overcome difficulties that seemed impossible. Yes, he does have quite a bit of plot armor, and he\u2019s a bit overpowered, which did hurt the show, but not as badly as it could have. \\n\\n\r\nWe also have the goddess Hestia who is the leader of Bell\u2019s famlia, of which Bell is the only member. At times, I really liked her. Bell and Hestia really do care about each other, will to whatever it takes to help one another, and this makes their interactions really cute. Unfortunately, Hestia is in love with Bell, and she gets jealous easily, which leads to some really cringe worthy moments. They really should have either left romance out completely, or just developed the romance between Hestia and Bell without hinting at the feelings the other girls had for him; as it was the harem elements really hurt the show.\\n\\n\r\nAll the other characters had something that made them interesting. From the elf who works at the local restaurant, to Lili, a girl who joins Bell as a supporter, they all have a little bit of back story that gives them depth. My favorite character is the god Hermies, but he doesn\u2019t really play a role until the end of the show.\\n\\n\r\nLooking at the plot here, it really feels very generic. Pretty much all the story elements here have been done before, so if you\u2019re looking for some revolutionary anime, you\u2019re not going to find it here. The genericness is something that holds the show back, but it also helps the show in a way. A lot of anime, especially of the adventure genre, try to tell some grand story, aiming for the peak of anime greatness only to fail to handle their story right and become a mess. Instead, this anime chooses to stick with something generic, but executes it in a way that\u2019s a lot of fun.\\n\\n\r\nDespite the fact that Bell is an overpowered protagonist, it never feels like he\u2019s the strongest. His power may grow faster than anyone else, but there are a lot of people who are still way more powerful than him. Bell does get a number of moments to shine on his own, but there are also times where despite his strength, he\u2019s not able to overcome his obstacles without the help of others.\\n\\n\r\nDespite its generic nature, I found the story interesting. There were enough different conflicts to keep me engaged. Sometimes it was a monster in the dungeon that Bell had to defeat, and other times it were other people he had to overcome. Another thing I liked about the show is how it was able to contrast Bell\u2019s na\u00efve view of the world with the dark pasts and actions of some of the characters. The themes of what it means to be a hero are strong here, as this is Bell\u2019s motivation for wanting to get stronger. Again, this is something that\u2019s been seen elsewhere numerous times, but I still like what it added to the show.\\n\\n\r\nOf course, despite the fact that I did enjoy this show, I can\u2019t look past its problems. Due to the nature of the show, you know that Bell is going to be the hero and save the day. So any battle he\u2019s in with at least something at stake, you know he\u2019s going to win.\\n\\n\r\nThe fan-service and harem elements really hurt the show as well. They were oftentimes very uninteresting, and just seemed to be taking up time until something more serious happened. Some could say that they added comedy, but I didn\u2019t find it funny at all. And really, the romance didn\u2019t go anywhere by the end of the show. Sure, some friendships were developed, but the romance could have been taken out completely and nothing would have been lost. As for the fan-service, did having Bell fall into a lake filled with about 5 naked girls really help the show? I get that they were trying to have some lighter scenes before the end of the show, but they could have done this in better ways.\\n\\n\r\nAnd speaking of the end of the show, it\u2019s really not over. The final episode worked as a good enough season finale. The battle was epic and all, and it resolved that arc nicely, but it also tells the viewer there is much more story to tell. Now, will the rest of the story be animated? Possibly, with the popularity the show has gotten a second season wouldn\u2019t surprise me. But I have to hold the fact that the story is incomplete against the show.\\n\r\nOverall, the best word to describe this show is generic. It does well to keep the viewer entertained most of the time, and it doesn\u2019t take itself so seriously that it falls apart, so those are both plusses, but there isn\u2019t anything great about the story. It\u2019s good at being okay, which is more than I can say for a lot of other shows that came out this year.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation + Sound\\n\\n\r\nThe animation here is okay. The show looks pretty good for the most part, there weren\u2019t any times where it was so bad it hurt the show, or if there were, I didn\u2019t notice them. The action scenes were where the show could have really shined, but these were too short lived for the most part to really have any impact. The most interesting thing visually about the show was the final battle where everything had a red tint to it. This really added to the intensity of the scene and the danger the character\u2019s faced, but at times it made it hard to tell who was who, and since a lot of minor characters were involved in this battle, it made it hard to follow.\\n\\n\r\nMusic wise, this is another case where the show is pretty good. The battle scenes had intense music that helped. The actual sound effects felt off at times, especially with the explosions from fire magic. \\n\\n\r\nThe opening here is cute, does a good job of introducing the show, and even foreshadows some of the big moments later on in the show, which is all I ask for from an opening. Skippable if you want to get right to the episode, but not a bad opening at all.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Thoughts\\n\\n\r\nThis show is one of those shows that was good to watch on a weekly basis as it comes out. It\u2019s one that you\u2019d watch just to watch anime. It\u2019s a generic, but fun show, and if that sounds like what you\u2019re looking for, then this anime is for you. I really can\u2019t see this show\u2019s fame lasting much beyond the time it was airing, but it was fun while it lasted.\\n\\n\r\nScoring: \\n\r\nStory: 5.5\\n\r\nCharacters: 5.7\\n\r\nAnimation: 6.5\\n\r\nSound: 7\\n\r\nOther (Excessive Fan-Service): -0.1\\n\r\nTotal: 5.76 (note that categories are not weighed equally)\\n\\n\r\nRating: Worth Checking Out\\n\\n\r\nOther Suggestions: Attack on Titan, Show by Rock\\n",

Yes it's a harem comedy, but I love the RPG aspect. The combat sequences can be quite intense, and the visuals are quite appealing.  It was very well animated and the music went very well with everything. Bell can be a frustrating character sometimes, and Hestia's high-pitched whining can grate on one's nerves a bit,  but overall, it is a fun show and I really hope for a second season. I am abit disappointed that the show was only 13 episodes long, but it leaves me anticipating (and hoping for) the release of season 2. Will definitely be checking out the light novels and Manga as well.",

            "content": "\"Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon?\" or Danmachi (For short) is a new anime that follows the trail of Sword Art Online and Log Horizon as a brand new series that takes on the \"MMORPG anime\" with a few unique twists. How unique? just barely at all actually.\r\nSTORY:\r\nThis anime does not have a real story. The plot hinges entirely on one thing; \"I am the protagonist and I want to get stronger\", that's it. It is absolutely the most clich\u00e9d thing you could possibly imagine. However, a clich\u00e9 exists because of a trend, and a trend is formed becauseit works. In this case we have a terribly mediocre story that serves as the backdrop for the events of the series which allow for character interactions (We'll get to that), world-building, action and comedy. \\n\\n\r\nA simple meal well prepared can be very enjoyable, even if it is unimpressive. That is my best non-spoiler summary for the story.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nART:\\n\r\nMuch has been made of the waves created by Goddess Hestia and her breast-ribbon, but I will not lie, I did not even notice it until I finished watching the series and read someone's review where they could not stop talking about it... I thought the art was serviceable , although I had a few SAO flashbacks, primarily in a couple of the supporting female characters. But these are minor qualms, the overall style and establishing shots of the city and deep levels of the dungeon are beautifully drawn with great detail and (occasionally) intense imagination. \\n\\n\r\nHowever, as with the rest of the anime, it reaches far but only hits the mark a few times, though in my opinion these few times are enough to raise it above mediocrity. The worst one can say about the art is that it is not unique enough. It is however, memorable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nCHARACTER:\\n\r\nAnd here we reach the core of the series, there are two main characters in this anime; Goddess Hestia and Bell Cranel. They are both very stereotypical and clich\u00e9d characters to the absolute maximum. Bell Cranel is the typical shounen lead with massive sex appeal to the female characters, extreme drive to \"Get stronger!\" and an absolute pure heart, basically a straight arrow with no edge to him whatsoever. Goddess Hestia is the typical female lead that fawns over Bell but gets ignored. \\n\\n\r\nIndividually they are awful characters... but what really saves it is that they have fantastic chemistry. This is what we call an emergent property in that the result is something greater than the sum of its parts. Hestia and Bell are an adorable couple with a very believable friendship. In a world with goddesses, demons, monsters and magic, the chemistry between the two main leads grounds us in a very human element; The emotional support and mutual belief that these have for each other.\\n\\n\r\nThe friendly support characters include a Sword Princess (Ain Valley-naniga), a very small pseudo-furry girl and an ill-included late game addition, a blacksmith. Of these three main support characters, two are extremely poorly developed and one has a surprisingly decent arc. They do their job in that they fill the background of what is entirely Bell and Hestia's story. Nothing more nothing less.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nOVERALL:\\n\r\nHere is where I will probably blow your mind ... but not really because you already saw the overall score. This is a great anime, it is very simple, very clich\u00e9d and predictable like you would not imagine. But as I said in the beginning, a simple meal, well prepared can be a very enjoyable experience.\\n\\n\r\nThe action, when it really kicks into high gear, is fantastic. The animation is fluid during the major fight sequences and the soundtrack works beautifully in conjunction with the fight choreography (Ex: The Minotaur fight). The chemistry between leads is believable and fun, the pace of the story is brisk, and the drama is kept firmly at bay throughout barring a couple of establishing scenes which are very brief.\\n\\n\r\nBasically it is a light, enjoyable, short anime that knows exactly what it is. Like eating ice cream along with a couple of strawberries, it looks good, it tastes good, and although you know there is very little substance to it, you will still find it enjoyable. It is not a substitute for a full course meal but it was not trying to be. I highly recommend this, but let it be made clear that this is not a substantive anime, it is fluff, it is popcorn, it is light. That is all.\\n\\n",

It got stucked in my head for thinking because the story is left unhandled, well I hope they make a better adaptation next time. Let's start then.\r\nStory 7/10\r\nThe story is great, I like it. I admit I like this kind of story. At the first, MC is alone and finally met with his new friends, and then he try to be stronger and reach someone stronger than him. It will happened here. Well, the story wasn't bad, and wasn't good either. But it makeme pretty disappointed because it left me with no clue about why Bell have an abnormal growth?, why the Goliath appeared and attacked them?, or where the fuck is Aiz's party? Is they already left the dungeon? When? I just got no clue about it tho, so I think the story is pretty bad, I wish they make something better next time.\\n\\n\r\nArt and Sound 9/10\\n\\n\r\nI like this part from anime, the art is nice and enjoyable. The sound is great, the OP and ED are great and very enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 7/10\\n\\n\r\nI like the MC actually, he pretty strong and he like to adventure in SOLO mode instead making a party to help him. But what he gonna do is easy to predict. I wasn't bothered anyway, I also like the other character, but I must say I really hate Lili. She is the most annoying in this story, she almost make me drop this, such a waste. The character wasn't bad too, it fulfill my expectation of the character, so my hope isn't too high or too low.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\\n\r\nDanmachi wasn't bad anyway, it just that they not put a lot effort into this. If they gonna make 2nd season, I hope they make it better than this one. But overall, this anime is very good, I recommend this to you who want the MC is  overpowered and he is surrounded by girls with big boobs because he saved them before and they fall in love with him. The title is also suck, I dunno why but I feel it so suck.\\n\\n\r\nFeel free to give feedback if I wrote something wrong in the comment section or you can PM me already, so see you later.",

            "content": "After looking at MyAnimeList, I decided to read the reviews on \"Dungeon Girl\" just to see what other people thought. After seeing a large amount of the low overall ratings, I thought that there wasn't enough credibility where it was due.\r\nI will avoid including spoilers in this review, but I won't deny the fact that this is my first review and I also won't deny the fact that I am a huge gamer, which probably influences the reason why I enjoyed Danmachi as much as I did.\r\nStory : 8\r\nThe story of \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\" takes place in avideo game setting, where \"adventurers\" join a \"family\" belonging to a god(the gods referring to Greek mythology, e.g. Hestia, Hephaestus, Hermes, etc.) Unexplained as it is, there is a dungeon area where it becomes apparent that these adventurers journey to battle against monsters to earn money and gain experience. However, their statistic boosts(strength, agility, vitality) will not take effect until they return safely to their \"family's god\" where the god will then boost their stats. \\n\r\nThe first thing people will compare this to is the popular anime Sword Art Online, but I want to refrain from comparing to other animes. In my perspective, Danmachi has a unique storyline the fully met my expectations. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7 \\n\r\nNo, I'm not rating this based on all the fanservice contained within this series. The quality of the art in my perspective is above average if you take into consideration how much art capability has progressed over the years. Furthermore, I won't deny that the costumes of each character appealed to my tastes.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 8\\n\r\nIn hindsight, I'm actually giving the sound aspect an 8.5. I enjoyed the voice actors emotion placed into the characters, the sound effects during all the battle scenes, etc. I genuinely enjoyed each of the soundtracks.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 7\\n\r\nI found each character having a very unique setup, although I don't know how to explain it, but unlike most characters from other series, they're too focused on the main character Bell Cranel. Of course, he's the main character, but they all revolved around him in a way that I didn't extremely enjoy and I'm unsure of how to explain it. :x\\n\r\nI won't deny that the humor that was incorporated into each character legitimately made me laugh at the appropriate scenes though.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nCompletely biased opinion right here, but the unique plot line was my type of anime right here. I enjoyed it enough to watch it again, the day after I finished it. The comedy was fantastic, the action was great, and I loved every single moment of it.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8\\n\r\nI'm restraining myself here cause I know that this is a review that I'm proposing to others, yet in my own perspective. \\n\r\nOverall, I gained a lot more enjoyment compared to what I initially anticipated with this series.",

            "content": "The title is a cute hook, which fails to deliver, because the protagonist doesn't actually pick up girls in a dungeon.\r\nI didn't expect a whole lot from this, and I wasn't disappointed -- there wasn't much to it.  If I were a lot younger, I might have liked it, but now I need my stories to have more depth.\r\nStory (5/10): Here's your generic RPG story. It has enticing aspects, like the gods from various pantheons have descended to this vaguely medieval fantasy land and formed guilds, so-called \"familias\" to further their specific interests.  Since I love mythology, that idea made the anime tempting,but alas it doesn't do much with this.  Yeah, Hephaestus is a great weapons smith (and a girl), but Loki (also a girl) mostly throws drunken parties.  Hestia, Greek keeper of the heart, home, and domesticity, who is our protagonist's patron goddess doesn't show anything much of her roots, and neither do the other gods.  And why does Hephaestus have an eye patch?  He was lame, not half-blind in Greek myth. Hestia, surprisingly, doesn't even have a proper familia, our protagonist Bell is her first and only follower.\\n\\n\r\nAdventurers who seek divine blessings trawl the dungeon in search of magic stones and dropped items that can be acquired by fighting monsters.  There's a system for gaining stats, skills, and levels, but the gods don't actually seem to be running this. The gods also have no say over the dungeon and are in fact not allowed to enter it.  Maybe the dungeon is running things; it does seem to be sentient at times. Not a bad story by any means, but it has no depth; it feels duct taped together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter (4/10): Bell feels largely like the insert character for a harem anime, which this one sort of is; he's naive and dense, but well-meaning and a nice guy.  There isn't much in-depth development -- sure, he starts out as a bit of a coward and overcomes that, and we even see him work with Aiz to become a better fighter, and he powers u a lot faster than is apparently normal -- but somehow I never felt a single thing that brought me closer to caring about his fate.  I didn't root for him (or against him), not to gain more power nor to win his fights nor to hook up with one of the girls who compete for his favours.\\n\\n\r\nHestia is not quite the big-boobed airhead she seems to be at first; she's actually a hard worker and tries her damndest to give Bell whatever she can so his adventuring can be successful.  He doesn't even notice how hard she works, he's that dense.  She sees the two of them as a romantic couple, he doesn't.\\n\\n\r\nLiliruca becomes Bell's \"supporter\", and I like what they've done with the standard, disposable NPC hireling whom everyone treats like dirt -- they gave her a backstory, and she gets an actual character arc complete with redemption.  If only she hadn't started out being a callous bitch who left Bell to die, I could have warmed up to her.\\n\\n\r\nThere are other characters here, but you know, I am already tired writing about this.  Pretty much every character arc is tossed away anyway after giving us some backstory to whet our appetites.\\n\\n\r\nThe thing that keeps this from being a true harem is that Bell's admiration is basically directed at only one person, Aiz Wallenstein, the Sword Princess, champion of adventurers and so far out of his league it isn't even funny.  Aiz is also completely stoic, even when Bell falls into her breasts. \\n\\n\r\nArt (6/10):  Character design is ok, a bit simple, nothing fantastic, but most are easy to tell apart.  Too much big boobage for my taste.  Background art is nice, but again, with few exceptions (the 18th dungeon floor), not special.  The animation is where this show shines -- some of the best action scenes with excellent choreography I've seen in a while.\\n\\n\r\nSound (5/10): OP and ED standard.  I liked the BGM quite a bit.  I might try and find the soundtrack so I can say something more substantial about it.  Voice talent is fine, nothing stands out for me.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment (5/10):  Lukewarm, flat sodapop.  All the ingredients were here for making this a really good story, with lots of injokes for RPGamers, an interesting premise with enough variation from standard RPGs to potentially make this superb.  And yet I didn't feel a thing.  I didn't root for anyone. I wasn't at the edge of my seat in the fighting scenes, even though they were so well done.  The entire thing felt paper thin -- something I could have enjoyed as a preteen but not now.",

            "content": "So, this tends to get compared to Sword Art Online.  I think that's rather an unfair comparison.  Where Sword Art Online is an uninspired dumpster fire where I can sum up every single character in three words or less, this show at least has characters with some recognizable traits, and while none of them are particularly the most fleshed-out or original I've ever seen, none of them succumb to outright cliches, though they definitely are all very familiar tropes.  I found myself smiling at the characters' antics, and while I only really laughed out loud twice, I never really found myself cringinglike I did so often with the dialog and character interactions in SAO.  I give SAO a 2 at most on my most generous day, and came to that conclusion four episodes in, and since I give this show an 8, I'm going to cease comparing them together now because, like I said; it's just not a fair comparison.  The differences between the shows comes in small ways, but small changes and slight variations are all it takes to take a dumpster fire and turn it into a campfire, something you can toast marshmellows over without running for the hills for the stench.\\n\\n\r\nThis is no luxury resort of a show, but it's like a good camping session in the woods with your friends, to continue the analogy; you might hold a few fond memories afterwords, and while it'll never compare to the much more polished vacation experiences, there's a sort of \"every-day fun\" value to the time you spend on it.  You have to be particularly cynical and easily-dismissive to give this show a score to indicate that it's actually bad, in honesty, and I think a lot of the lower scores given are given in rebellion to its popularity in relation to its overall quality rather than in actual critique (I could be entirely mistaken, of course), but I found enough aversions and inversions of cliches into workable tropes, enough appeal in the art design, and enough in the simple but digestible plot to find the overall experience a fair net positive.\\n\\n\r\nPart of my own enjoyment comes from my own biases; I love anime that adapts cultural elements outside of Japan into its setting and does it well, and surprisingly enough this show actually pulls that off rather nicely.  Again, not the deepest lore or anything, but it is very much its own thing in the right areas.  I actually would probably drop the score by two points if it was just another example of an anime fetishizing Japanese culture, because that is a cliche that has long worn out its welcome.  I normally dislike 'every girl wants this guy just because' shows, but at least this show provides some believable explanations for why they do (for the most part, anyway, there's two examples I can think of where it wasn't really explained at all, but they were minor characters, anyway, so...whatever), and not every girl is all over him, anyway.  In fact, there's only really two that are, and with one of them it's played off more like a puppy-love crush (I'm not referring to whom you think I am referring to, in all likelihood; the analogy is unrelated to the character) than outright adoration.  The one character who DOES throw absolute adoration at Bell, the protagonist, is Hestia, and to be fair, in the context of the show, that makes perfect sense...and frankly, I found her adoration of Bell to be adorable in and of itself.\\n\\n\r\nMy own score might be a point or two above what most people will give it, and that is entirely understandable, but given I've seen some absolute crap (SAO, Asterisk War, Naruto ((The filler episodes anyway)), G Gundam, etc.), and some absolute masterpieces (Madoka Magica, Gurren Lagann, Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bebop, etc.), and a bunch of stuff in between, I'd like to believe that I've got a fairly good range of reference to draw from, and if you look past sheer surface value and compare this show to its contemporaries, there's enough here that is its own thing.  Nothing stands out in particular, alas, but then again, nothing here offends the senses or sensibilities, either, so while this will inevitably end up in the discount rack of my memories, it's never going to go into the trash or bargain bin, either.  Take from this review what you will.",

And we both enjoyed it quite a bit, we really did. It was aesthetically pleasing to the eye and we got a good laugh of out of it for the first few episodes.\r\nThen when it hit about episode 3, we started noticing animation errors or noticing that the same soundtrack was playing in the background again. Events became predictable (not that they weren't already, but we were ableto ignore it because of the fun we were having) and the charm of it quickly began to wear off.\\n\\n\r\nAs we approached the finale, we started watching it more as a chore, we wanted to at least see it through to the end. And overall, the finale was just not satisfying enough for us to not feel watching this anime was a waste of time. Sure, we'll remember what the character's designs were and what their personalities (or in Hestia's case, assets) were. Even if some of the RPG elements in a functioning fantasy world seemed enticing at first, we'll probably never rewatch it, or recommend to anyone.",

            "content": "I will preface this by saying I went in with no hope whatsoever for this show and merely for the purpose of being entertained. Given its name and notoriety for fan-service, I expected something along the lines of Konosuba, but that would fall far short.\r\nNow for my opinion (for what it's worth). First off, I WOULD NOT CALL THIS A COMEDY. I remember shouting this at the t.v. at one point, while in the grip of powerful emotion. There are some funny moments. However, there are some major feels about halfway through. \r\nI've read a lot of reviews about boring characters. Okay. There are afew who remain one-dimensional the whole way. However, I actually got invested in several (and I'm a bit of a snob!) Like most anime, there is a theme of wanting to get stronger. But there are also themes of forgiveness that were very touching.\\n\\n\r\nNext I want to address the plot. Many have expressed boredom. I don't know what you want from a show, but I found the first half of this one to be very interesting. And not necessarily for its world, but for its character interactions. Now the show does seem to devolve some after the halfway point. The first half of the show is really why I rated it as high as I did.\\n\\n\r\nAll this to say that I don't think this is a bad anime. Are there boobs? Yes! But what anime doesn't take a moment or two to focus on that anymore? I did not start feeling distracted by the fan service until the very last episodes. However, if you are looking for a really good laugh like in Konosuba, your time might be best spent elsewhere (like on Konosuba!) \\n\\n\r\nSide note:  If you end up liking the show, there is a spin-off series about Ais Wallenstein that is also fairly entertaining. It runs parallel to this show but from her perspective and answers a few questions you don't even know you want answers to. Not the best plot and the fan service gets stepped up, but enjoyable all the same\u2014especially if you are a completionist like me.",

            "content": "So lets jump right into this. This was another very popular anime that only had 13 episodes, and the show suffers greatly for it. There was a second season announced in Feb of 2018 which could see the light of day by the end of 2019 but thats 3 years after the airing of the first season and I cannot judge whether or not its existence will add to the end of this animes story since it isnt out yet. My review is also excluding the movie and the single ova that were released after the end of the 13th episode since the ova ismostly fan service. \\n\\n\r\nThis series lacks solid pacing or character development due to its rushed nature of 12 episodes which is a shame since there are real possibilities with the realization of the main characters lineage at the very end of the season. Also there are entire plots that are hinted at but never fleshed out at all since as flashes to future antagonists and the realization that whole characters motivations rest on plans of characters that we are never introduced to. \\n\\n\r\nCharacter wise if you love the idea of characters in a classic rpg dungeon crawler setting similar to Sword art Online then you have some things to enjoy here. The show also incorporates the idea of Greek and Roman Gods as guild leaders for the human characters which sounds awesome in theory but isnt really used in a fun way. These god characters usually just stand around and talk/plot their own agendas/look cool and barely resemble the gods they are based upon. The main character is a basic flat shounen character who is oblivious to the physical advances of literally every female character in the show simply because he is a shy, innocent main character boy. He also receives powerups as needed for the plot and features abilities far beyond every other character except his silent and reserved crush who we barely get to see fight throughout the series and are merely told of her exceptional battle prowess. In fact I would argue that the lack of creativity witht he plot and characters is probably this shows greatest shortcoming. This show loves classic anime tropes which by itself is fine if you use them in an interesting way which this shows slow pace and lack of character development really struggles to accomplish.\\n\\n\r\nOn the flip side the big redeeming points of this series are when we get to see a few devastating, blood splatter inducing attacks on labyrinth monsters and.....Hestia. Hestia is the goddess figure of the main character and is actually in the show a considerable amount which is great because her design is very cute and I personally found her to be hilarious in most of her dialogue but I could easily see other people finding her annoying. Hestia is one of the best waifus in my book though which probably skewed my score up from a 6 to a 7 to be honest.\\n\\n\r\nSo in summary we have here an underdeveloped plot with underdeveloped characters in a fantasy rpg world with greek/roman god characters sprinkled in. we also have solid production values and sound design mixed with some decent action pieces when they get going plus one of the best waifus in all of anime right now which skates this season 1 by as a 7.",

            "content": "Decided to make my first review on this anime.\r\nThe title of this anime had me hesitating right off the bat, but I found myself enjoying this anime more than Log Horizon in the end. Like some animes, this is one that you have to get a few episodes into until you reach the good part of it. \r\nStory 7/10\r\nAt first, we have a young white haired boy that wants to become stronger. He gets attacked by a minotaur and is saved by the \"Sword Princess\" Aiz. Our main protagonist Bell Cranel falls in love with her. The anime follows out with these two parts ofit for a majority of the time. With this you have all your other characters pushing him along their way with their own ideals and personal opinion. I personally disliked that this took up so much of plot with Bell becoming almost obssessed with becoming stronger to the point I couldn't stand it. Although there were parts where I found extremely pleasing to watch, its shine was dulled by the overdone screen time the \"supporter\" Lili had with her own personal problems and waters down the anime to having just a good story. On a more positive note, there were some enjoyable fights happening unlike some stories that could care less to even bother. I especially enjoyed the extensive ones which I won't spoil any details on. On episode 12, I probably had seen about the worst fight with Bell just getting tossed around. I was hoping for another possibly epic fight, but we have some magic caster that can just go invisible and beat up people. The plot was pretty predictable but enjoyable if you don't pay really close attention to every detail. You probably will hate it if you want a more serious and less heavy smashed fan service anime. The ending will be a hit or miss for some of you. For me, it was personally a huge miss because how predictable and unsatisfying it was. Overall, there were some good fights that weren't a waste of time, but some had me going \"why?\" \\n\\n\r\nArt 8/10\\n\r\nHere we have a pretty standard art with nothing special to it. It looked consistent and had a bit of a dark color to it throughout, but no wow factor. Everything seemed to be in pretty decent proportion most of the time except for when the heads were oddly shaped in a few cases. Therefore, a solid 8 fits well.\\n\\n\r\nSound 9/10\\n\r\nThe sound to me was crisp most of the time. Backgrounds noises fit well in most occasions and nice background music wasn't bothersome to the point I ever really couldn't ignore it. Sometimes I found myself enjoying the music all together.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6/10\\n\r\nPrepare for a wall of praise and criticism. This is the biggest flaw of \"Is it Wrong to Try to Pick up Girls in a Dungeon?\". There were 3 characters that I never really wanted to ever smash their face in the entire time, and that's  Hephaestus, Welf, and Aiz. Welf has a pretty mysterious background and we learn some interesting things about him. He isn't overly annoying and has a few odd ideals, but that's what makes him a good character unlike the other open book ones. Also he isn't a huge chick magnet like Bell with everyone not caring if he sees them all naked. I just wish he got more screen time. Aiz, my favorite character, is some apparently overpowered princess with a sword that is attracted to Bell in some weird way that I found myself laughing at. She always has her wow moments and beats the crap out of Bell by barely doing anything. Overall, she's just an interesting character that keeps everything from being completely retarded and in chaotic. I just wish that she wasn't so stupid sometimes. Hephaestus was another cool character that got about close to ZERO screen time. Every other character is just downhill from there. We have Hestia, which is supposedly a goddess but seems just more like a loli punch in the face fan service in her clothes that look like a kid cut up with scissors? She's annoying and clingy which makes sense why only Bell is in her familia. She also just adds fuel to this harem. Bell has his good sides and downsides. He has a great composure as the main to be our central protagonist, but it's more of the obsessive girls around him that ruin him. I feel like if you take them out of the equation, it could be a better anime all together. (Except for those people that just watch for the fan service..)  Bell is also retarded in a way like Aiz, but in a way more outgoing and naive way. He trusts everyone and loses just about everything, then says \"Oh well, it's ok!\" like nothing ever happened. Also, he is way to overpowered like your Kirito in Sword Art Online. I mean we have a lv2 kid who can destroy everything just because he has the skill to overcome any situation. To keep this from being too long I'm only going to touch on one more poor character out of the load. This may hint to spoilers a bit. Be warned. Freya is some goddess that is obsessed with powerful adventures. She dresses in skimpy fan service packed clothing for some random creepy reason and watches Bell through her magical ways. I could say a crystal ball, but I'll leave it at magical. The authors tried to add her in as a kind of foreshadowing effect, but never do anything with it. I can call this a failure of suspense and a failure of a character all together. If the characters weren't done so poorly, this anime could be a strong 9.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 9/10\\n\r\nThe concept of giant dungeon MMORPG was portrayed extremely effectively with a pretty decent and standard lore in this shounun. If you're a gamer like me, you'd be drooling over this anime if it were a game. Who wouldn't want to have a world where you kill monsters in a dungeon (with who knows how many floors) to make a living and power up as a game? You gain completely random stats based on your ideals and character. Occasionally, some episodes lacked luster and defines harem, but good ones left a lasting effect for me to completely tolerate any little bits of filler while I tried to process what just happened. If you're not a fan of RPG games or don't care about that, then I don't recommend watching.\\n\\n\r\nOverall 8/10\\n\r\nI can give a solid and respectable 8 for this anime. If we didn't have such annoying characters ruining the actual depth of the story, I could (again being said) give a possible 9. The last major part that weighed me down on this brimming with potential anime was the final fight. I feel it was too straightforward because of Bell's skills. He's gotten boring to watch because of how unstoppable he is now. I would have much rather seen Aiz take that fight on over Bell. We never really got to see her have a major fight, but some other badass moments with her blowing up a minotaur in Bell's face, causing him to panic like a baby without a bottle.",

            "content": "Listen up son!!!\r\nThis anime is good, so good in fact that it prompted me to create an account on Myanimelist just so that I could write this review. Now, I won't pretend to be some sort of anime sommelier or connoisseur, but on purely based on that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you finish an anime, Familia Myth (lets call it that, it's shorter than \"is it wrong to pick up chicks in a dungeon) is up there with some of the very best anime that I have ever seen. Here's why:\r\nStorywise, this anime is good, not fantastic, but not average either. Obviously withthis sort of anime, the hero is never in any real peril (or at least you know he isn't), but the way this show convinces you that the situations and events are gonna lead to Bell's untimely death is fantastic! This is largely what contributes to that sense of satisfaction at the end of each episode, and indeed the end of the season. Another nice aspect with the story is the way it plays with the RPG theme, I know others have said this, but it really does emulate that feeling of discovery when you first pick up a game, like you are enjoying the story vicariously through Bell. OH THE ENDING IS SO GOOD JUST WATCH IT (stereotypical but good). \\n\\n\r\nIn terms of characters this anime is also pretty darn good! Aside from Bell being the sort of stereotypical fairly plain hero personality-wise, the rest of the characters are all pretty cool, and are developed really well. The two criticisms I have are: One; Hestia is kind of weak as a character and fairly useless throughout, but in the second last episode she almost makes up for it, and Two; Welf could have been developed a bit more, and he was only present for a short while, but hopefully if there is a second season this could be resolved. Also Aiz and Bell's relationship could have been developed a bit more, but it was good aside from that. Overall characters in this anime are pretty strong, with a good showing of strong female characters (RYU FOR THE F****** WIN!!). \\n\\n\r\nCharacter design was excellent. It was nice to see a main character that didn't just have black hair for once, digging the white on red colour scheme for bell. Lilli was also darn, really fit the supporting character image well! Oh also the fanservice was pretty tasteful (if you can even call it that) for an anime which has a girl with white sheet vacuum-formed to her breasts on the poster, and it never really obstructed the story's progression, which is always a plus, so points for that.\\n\\n\r\nSound design was actually flipping cool, this is definitely one to watch with a good pair of headphones on. A special mention goes to the ending theme song - holy crap it got me pumped for the next episode every time, and really added to the sense of enjoyment! \\n\\n\r\nSpeaking of which, in terms of enjoyment, this anime is up there with the best, each episode was really fulfilling and felt like it was contributing largely to the story's progression (also pacing was really good). THE ENDING HOLY SHIT THE ENDING - ok I have literally just finished watching it, so I am still full of those end of season feels, so I may be slightly swayed in favour of this anime, but seriously the ending was good. Just go watch this anime, please?\\n\\n\r\nAnd there we have it, the end of the review. Overall This anime is really good, go watch it. I really hope it gets a second season!\\n\\n",

            "content": "For generations the question has been asked, over and over again, \"Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon\". Truth be told I went into this show not knowing what to expect, seeing as how depending on the answer to this question, my life, the world even, could fall into ruin. For real though, this show doesn't really bring anything new as the sole purpose for its creation is to pander to the easily satisfied masses who are more likely to watch a fan-service show filled with swords and magic than a psychological thriller. This show falls into the still growing genre knownas 'Not Sword Art Online', a genre of anime that follows in the fart cloud left behind by their great predecessor SAO. While some have managed to at-least create a more interesting environment, none have really pushed any boundaries. Now I look over all the reviews and see low scores, and in fact I agree with them for the most part, however you will notice that my score is significantly higher than the majority of the reviews, and that is because while a bad show, like SAO I found some enjoyment in Danmachi. I'll try to keep it short and sweet. So without further ado, let's get on with my criteria and the scores given in each section.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 6\\n\r\nCharacter Development: 5\\n\r\nLittle no interesting characters, and to put the cherry on top, there was no real character development aside from Bell powering up which doesn't count. Bell follows the trend of somehow being the protagonist, the desire of all women on earth, and yet also the most undesirable and normal individual. This is most likely in order to appeal to those at home who have no social life and feed off of anime in order to feel as if they've accomplished something in life. The only character that I liked, and only reason why I gave improved marks in this area is thanks to Lili, the only character with an interesting backstory, as well as the only character who goes through some form of true character development.\\n\r\nPlot: 5\\n\r\nPacing: 5\\n\r\nThe story is like the vanilla ice cream of anime, there is nothing special about it, literally nothing. Hero is weak, for some inexplicable reason he has the ability to grow stronger faster than anyone else, he becomes the strongest, and then fights to save everyone. The great Demolition_D commented on this show, and I couldn't agree more, it\u2019s basically \"Sword Art Online: fat fucking titties addition\". The show isn't even well paced, it jumps around too much, granted that it\u2019s in order to get us to the action faster, it doesn't hurt to slow down at times and just have an interesting conversation about the world they live in (and I said interesting, that doesn't include any of the BS they talked about in the show).\\n\r\nMusic: 6\\n\r\nArt: 8\\n\r\nThe music was okay, kind of sad that the music is one of the qualities making sure this show doesn't get a failing grade, usually in my reviews the music's grade is lower than the total, however this show was bad enough that its lack luster music was helping compensate for its atrocious, well everything else. The art was outstanding though, however with the amount of money they had to animate it, it better damn well be pretty, I wasn't about to sit through an ugly show that also had no story.\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 7\\n\r\nTruth be told, I am a simple man, it doesn't take much to make my stupid brain smirk or smile, and while that is both a good and bad thing, it allowed me to enjoy the show a lot more than most people did. Would I re-watch it: no. Would I recommend it: no, I'd sooner recommend SAO than this, however that's just exchanging a pile of crap for a slightly smaller pile of crap.\\n\r\nFinal Verdict: 60/100\\n\r\nAnd when it all comes down to it, the answer is yes, yes it is okay to pick up girls in a dungeon.",

            "content": "In short: Fun, kind of light anime that has a cute main heroine. The story isn't amazing, the protagonist isn't something admirable, there's not very much development but is still enjoyable if you like a bit of fan service and just cute scenes.\r\nNow for the full review:\r\nStory 7:\r\nThe world it's set in is very interesting. It's very RPG like except instead of logging out at the end of the day or being stuck inside some virtual reality, it is reality. Being able to choose a god/goddess then having stats to level up was quite interesting. All in all, the world was very interesting. \r\nUnfortunately, despitethe interesting aspect of the world, the story falls short of any actual development. The protagonist, as usual, has some amazing unique trait, in this case, he levels his stats faster. And judging by the title, you'd suspect that the series has something to do with the protagonist with picking up girls in a dungeon... which really doesn't happen given the fact that the guy tends to run away from girls and blush at their slightest movement. \\n\\n\r\nAfter several eps, what we have is: guy is saved by girl who becomes love interest, then very little happens between them until the recent ep. Also, the reason for why he is dungeoning is not explained except for a few hints that it may relate to his grandparents. Bell-kun (the protagonist) supposedly grows with every dungeon run but we don't really see/know his progress other than whenever his goddess tells him/us as all his combat action consists of is hack and slash. He does gain a new power at some point, the ability to cast fireballs but then he hasn't really shown it since that episode.\\n\\n\r\nThere is also the case that he gains an amazing knife that would probably equate to legendary or epic in terms of WoW quality except we also don't know what it really does besides us being told that it is legendary/epic, but becomes worthless when outside his hands.\\n\\n\r\nIn conclusion, not very much story has developed other than largely character introductions, which isn't really story.\\n\\n\r\nArt 9:\\n\r\nThe art is pretty nice and consistent, I didn't really notice anything jarring. The art style also allows for the characters to be cute.\\n\\n\r\nSound 8:\\n\r\nIt would be a 7 if it were not for Hestia's voice actor. She fits perfectly with the attitude/character of Hestia and I cannot help but love her voice alone for it. Typically, Hestia has a very normal female voice, being not excessively high pitched cute-esque. But she is also able to change the tone of her voice to suit the current situation as well.\\n\\n\r\nMusic-wise, there wasn't really anything that made me inspired or thrilled like AoT. It was just average.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter 6:\\n\r\nThis is largely caused by Bell as everyone's screen time is quite minimal.\\n\\n\r\nBell - The largest problem with Bell is that he's so clich\u00e9d with his voice choice and attitude that you could easily copy him into another harem with scared/shy protagonist and it wouldn't feel any different. Bell is the typical male protagonist who gets a harem of girls pretty much by simply existing. His love interest is kind of interested in him which is explained by that she feels responsible for almost getting him killed. \\n\\n\r\n--Lili is interested in him because he's so nice despite everything he did to her, which also brings up another fault of Bell is that he's too nice. When Lili and he first met, he gave her an equal portion of the loot despite it being unheard of, which means that Bell really has no idea what he's doing in dungeons besides hack and slashing.\\n\\n\r\n--Hestia is interested in him because he's the only member of her familia and also because... who really knows.\\n\\n\r\n--Syr is interested in him because he patroned her workplace that one time and because... who really knows as well.\\n\\n\r\nTo top it off, he doesn't really seem to notice their feelings but does get shy when they do perform some ecchi stuff to him.\\n\\n\r\nOverall, I don't even think Bell knows what he's doing besides hacking and slashing inside a dungeon everyday.\\n\\n\r\nHestia - Her character is quite cute and attractive but we don't really know what kind of purpose she serves in terms of being the goddess of Bell. In fact, we're not sure what the gods/goddesses are really for besides inheriting their old powers from before they came down to earth(or whatever). \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment 8:\\n\r\nThere are times when it becomes so cheesy, so clich\u00e9d that it's just a cringe-fest and most of these revolves around Bell's character. Otherwise, the lighter side of the story and more everyday interaction is quite fun. \\n\\n\r\nOverall 8:\\n\r\nIt's not an amazing anime, but it does have its appeal. This is definitely an anime for those who enjoy more ecchi/comedy type of genres and is definitely a turn off for those who want deep character interaction as well those looking for a developing plot, which this anime is missing both of.",

            "content": "After seeing \"Sword Art\" i had lost all hope in watching an anime that involved gaming characteristics(as of 2010's on).My main problem with \"SAO\" is that it was rushed through,therefore making the actual anime shit.The games themselves were not a bad concept though,however alot of people get these two mixed up and rate \"SAO\" high instead of rating the game concepts.When \u2018DanMachi\u2019 was announced i didn't know what to expect,hell i didn't even know what kinda anime it was going to be.The name alone kept my attention for months until it actually aired,after seeing the first episode i still wasn't all that sure about it.Howeveri continued to watch it and was hooked by the end of episode 2.After watching all 13 episodes i have to say that my faith in gaming anime has been restored.It does have some what of a simple story for now but its really hard not to enjoy,making it an individual standing out from the crowd.Plus it's gradually easing through the story not being rushed.The characters are unique enough that you may find yourself attached to some of them by the end of 13 eps (Witch is pretty good considering some animes have 20+ eps with no good characters) .The way the gaming characteristics are is truly unique and entertaining,\" Omori Fujino\" really stepped outside of the box when making this.As far as the graphics go J.C. staff did an excellent job.Now alot of people are saying stuff like \"big boobs every where\" but honestly they must watch nothing but gradeschool anime girls(they may fall over dead if they watch something like Ikki tousen).In \"DanMachi\" there are quite a few female characters(MC  and non MC) that all have different size funbags(as desert punk would say).I guess people just can't use peripheral vision anymore.Anyways with all that being said i would have to say \"DanMachi\" may very easily end up being a timeless classic like \"Cowboy Bebop\" in its uniqueness of course.So if you haven't seen \"DanMachi\" i highly recommend that you do.",

            "content": "First review, blah blah :3\r\nStory: 7/10\r\nThe story for DanMachi is fairy simple, and a lot like other animes we've seen, most notably Sword Art Online. Adventures, such as Bell Cranel, ascend the different floors of the dungeon, encountering different monsters, and occasionally floor bosses.  The story itself could be much better, however it most certainly isn't bad.\r\nArt: 8/10:\r\nThe art is actually pretty good. In my opinion, the fight scenes were very smooth and enjoyable to watch. The monsters are dark and sinister, the dungeons themselves very scary-looking. There's fan service on the female side, but it's not that bad.\r\nSound: 7/10:\r\nNone of the tracks particularlystand out as being amazing or note-worthy. The opening for this series is decent, but the ending isn't great.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 7/10\\n\r\nThe main character for this series is Bell Cranel, so I am going to focus on him quite a bit here. It seems to a lot of people that every girl, or almost every girl, is attracted to Bell, and I've seen quite a lot of people call it a harem due to it. This is wrong, however. The only two female characters that really seem attracted to bell are Hestia and Lily.\\n\\n\r\nAside from that, almost all the female characters think Bell is cute/adorable.\\n\\n\r\nBell himself is actually quite a bit softie. It's a flaw that Bell perhaps may not recognize, but despite that, everyone recognizes him as being one. Bell has to overcome this flaw himself, as him being soft isn't due to the show's writing being bad in any way. Aside from Bell, the characters don't get too much depth in them, aside from a bit about their background and why they're doing what they are.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10\\n\r\nDanMachi is a really fun anime to watch. While it may have its flaws and tropes every so often, the writing and other aspects eclipse a lot of the negatives, and in comparison to other similar anime series, for example Sword Art Online, you'll see that DanMachi not only has better writing, but is more enjoyable as a whole :)\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 8/10\\n\r\nIt's a very good anime. If you are a fan of SAO, Log Horizon, etc, I highly recommend that you give this anime a shot!",

            "content": "To all the guys out there, it can be really annoying if you flirt with a girl while playing MMOs, especially in a dungeon. Never ever try to pick up a girl in a dungeon and here is why: Enjoy reading my review on the anime Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?/ Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka? (This is even longer than \"Beautiful Bones\" \ud83d\ude11\ud83d\ude11).\r\nPlot & Story Line \ud83d\udcad\ud83d\udcdc\r\nNow where should I start when it comes to this anime? It is an action, adventure, fantasy, romance anime produced by Genco in 2015. It hasa rating of 7.88 and is quite popular in the anime world. I always tried to avoid watching it because I thought it was just another mainstream, fantasy anime with a MMO-like setting without any actual story. But I was so wrong! \\n\r\nIs it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is a story about Bell Cranel, a very enthusiastic young  adventurer who makes his living by selling crystals he gets from killing monsters in the dungeon. He is the one and only member of the Hestia family formed by the goddess Hestia. In a world full of other large families and strong adventurers, Bell is trying to get stronger and become a great adventurer just as his late grandfather was. Soon, a very exciting, funny and moving story begins that becomes better episode for episode. \\n\r\nAs said in the beginning, the setting of the story seemed too mainstream and is in fact something you've probably seen before, but the makers still made it unique. It is the story that carries a lot of excitement. It starts off as a simple story but becomes more complex episode by episode. As more characters are introduced the story becomes heavier and definitely more interesting. The thing about this anime is that the story is actually carried more by the side characters. They are always the trigger for the happenings and events that our main character, Bell goes trough. His story, on the other hand, is still in the center but with a lot of question marks. Thing is, those are not plot holes but something we'll have to wait for in the second season. Watching the anime you slowly get to see the larger picture that is Bell's life and his past. I must say this, in the beginning I didn't think that I'd love it so much, but it was the end that made me fall in love with this anime. An exciting story gets an amazing and logical (not a typical non-sense) plot-twist that gives you answers to most of your previous questions but creates a lot more. \\n\\n\r\nThe genre adventure is just right for this anime but action is also an indispensable part of the description. The fights, powers and skills were just the right thing for a fantasy/action fan like me. The fights are thrilling and unforeseen, whereas the powers are just magical. They really contribute to a better story and entertainment of the anime. You enjoy every second of the anime always wanting more and more.\\n\r\nNow, despite a little bit of harem and fan-service going around in the anime I pretty much enjoyed it. The story also carries a lot of humor with it and some really funny moments that make my laugh really hard. As for the romance, there are some romantic but mostly funny scenes that are all part of the little harem around Bell-kun. Still it is enjoyable and doesn't actually ruin the story in any way. Moreover, I though about the perfect match for Bell the whole time and I just hope it won't become another \"I love Emilia\" thing in the end. \\n\r\nIn the end I'd like to mention the very moral of the story. No, it is not the answer to the question Is it wrong to try to pick up girls in a dungeon, that is just a nice metaphor for the excitement and fun the dungeon offers. The moral is to always believe in ourselves and never compare ourselves to others. We are all unique and the heroes of our own stories, so why the steady wish to become a sidekick of someone else's?  \\n\r\nIn short, if you want a funny, exciting adventure that will boost your self-confidence in just thirteen episodes this anime is a thing for you. Also if you're a fan of a lot of magic, action and fantasy be sure to give \"Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon\" a try. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters \ud83d\udc69\ud83d\udc66\\n\r\nAs said, all the characters in Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon contributed to the story. The makers really put a lot of effort in the development of personalities of each character. The three characters that I liked the most and I wanted to see more about were definitelly Bell, Hestia and Lion. \\n\r\nNow, Bell is reminds me of myself in some points and that is probably why I liked him as a character. Always seeing the good in people, always looking from the more beautiful side, Bell is a dreamer who is working hard to achieve his goals. And one more thing about Bell, he is the first over-powered MC I didn't hate instantly. Hestia is an adorable and impulsive little goddess. She hasn't that much of a special personality but is sweet and caring. I hope we'll find out more about her and her past in the upcoming season. \\n\\n\r\nThe character I liked the most is a side-character that is probably always forgotten, Lion Ryu. The reason I liked her so much is her past. She has a really dramatic past but deals with it in her own way. She is a strong, independent young woman that is always on the side of justice and the weak. I loved her personality and especially her wind-powers. She was just amazing. \\n\\n\\n\r\nAnimation & Style \ud83c\udfa8\ud83d\udcfa\\n\r\nThe animation of  Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is amazing. Bright colors, amazing backgrounds and beautiful settings. I especially loved the character design. All characters have something special and have a really unique design. The style is typical fantasy like and I loved it. \\n\\n\\n\r\nConclusion \ud83d\udccc\u2705\\n\r\nTo conclude everything, I'd say that  Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is an anime for almost everyone. Despite its mainstream setting it has a really intriguing plot and a moving and exciting story. The characters are not the best one's I've ever seen but at least they don't ruin the story. The animation and style are on point. So, if you want an anime with a good story to make you laugh and just relax for about 6h  Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon is an anime for you!",

            "content": "Is it Wrong to Try and Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, or shortened to DanMachi, which I'll be using to refer to it, is yet another entry in the long list of 'game world' shows that have popped up in the time after Sword Art Online really popularized the genre. DanMachi certainly doesn't do much to separate itself from the pack, but it does have a charm to it that makes it extremely enjoyable. Perhaps its the relief that it's not a isekai that makes it so easy to watch, or maybe it's the simple wholesomeness of Bell and his dream of chasing afterAiz. In any case, DanMachi just seems to exude charm.\\n\\n\r\nGod, intros are hard to write, anyway, on to the technical side of DanMachi. Nothing in DanMachi is going to blow you away visually, there are some nice effects and CGI uses, but nothing awe-inspiring. The character designs are interesting and cute, but definitely don't land in my top-tier design ranks. If DanMachi excels anywhere, its in its color palette. The bright color design really plays into the show's cute lightheartedness, which gives it a comfortable feel visually. Audially, DanMachi is really generic too. I can't name a single song or sound effect that I really loved, but I can't say that I hated it either, which kind of encapsulates my entire thoughts on DanMachi. I did get really annoyed at the Goliath's roar sound like the 20th time it played, but that's a somewhat strange complaint.\\n\\n\r\nFavorite Character: Aiz Wallenstein\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of strange, Aiz being my favorite character. Usually, I'm not the biggest fan of the kuudere trope, but for some reason, it worked for Aiz. Maybe it was more because of Bell's relationship and fascination with her than Aiz herself, but I'm thinking that's not the case. I think I just liked her growth as she interacted with Bell. You could see her emotionless front fade with every encounter she had with Bell and, to be honest, it was kind of cute. She probably also benefited from me just not liking Hestia or Lilli very much, since they were just the jealous harem tropes, honestly. Shout out to Ryu and Syr though, they were pretty great characters too.\\n\r\nSo what holds DanMachi back? Well, I think just followed the generic route way too hard. There was like three total episodes of actual dungeon crawling and RPG-like character progression total. Approximately three episodes where it actually played to its strength and followed a somewhat unique line of thought. In fact, I'm sort of waiting for an anime to follow that kind of path period. Other shows, like Sword Art Online didn't really focus on its RPG side, No Game No Life isn't really that kind of show, maybe Log Horizon is a little different, but I haven't seen that yet. Oddly enough, the one show that I can think of that focused the most on its progression in the game is Konosuba, which definitely wouldn't be the first thing that springs to mind for a lot of people.\\n\\n\r\nI mentioned already that I didn't really like Hestia that much and that may have been the only strong feeling that I really felt about this show. DanMachi is just so average that it didn't even elicit any real joy or disappointment. I definitely enjoyed watching it and laughed on occasion, but I can see myself forgetting that I watched it in a few months, honestly. I'll tune into season two whenever it's supposed to air, but I just can't help but feel as if DanMachi missed quite a few opportunities to really make a name for itself in the vast sea of isekai game world shows out there.",

I was turned off from the anime based on the title and didn't give it a shot until I was browsing through anime descriptions and read it without reading the title. In comparison to Sword Art Online, I will say that this anime is Sword Art Online done right.\r\nNow, the anime in of itself does have the typical fanservice of a harem series. However, that doesn't make this anime deserve a 2 ranking. If you watch theseries, you will see that the anime by and large shows strong and independent women. The characters who objectify women in the show generally turn out to be weaker male adventurers and are dully punished. The majority of characters in the show tend to respect and treat female companions well. If anything, I feel the anime does a reasonable job of using harem anime aspects primarily for the comedic effects.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the main character being special, unlike Sword Art Online, he's not overpowered and relies heavily on his party to survive. He is saved time and time again by other characters and unlike SOA, the supposed strong female characters remains strong instead of falling head over heels and abandoning their character. In many ways he is like the villager character in Fire Emblem games that starts weak but levels up stats faster.\\n\\n\r\nIf you don't like anime set in fantasy/video game worlds, then this show is not for you.",

Striving to become a hero is very generic and a little disappointed, but he acts like a hero people want to see. So for character, not very complex but leaves a decent amount of mystery about him.\\n\r\nAiz - She is the envy of all, strong and beautiful, but with something missing. Her character development needed explanation and are doing so with the second season. \\n\r\nWolf Crozzo - His character was a disappointment. Blacksmith famous for magical item creation, but will not create them. They very lightly touched on his past and could have gone more in depth with him. Answers were just thrown at us.\\n\r\nAlf - has a very complex past and would like to see her more if they did decide to continue the series. Maybe somehow join Hestia's familia somehow?\\n\r\nSo there is character complexity but they didn't do a great job of going in depth with them but it was only 12 episodes!\\n\r\nFor a light novel anime I would give it a 12.

            "content": "DanMachi\r\nOur love is a journey starting at forever and ending at never :)\r\nStory\r\n~The genres of DanMachi are: Action, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Romance~\r\nDanMachi tells a story about a boy named Bell Cranel who is striving to be the best adventurer. In the town Orario is a place commonly known as \"Dungeon\" where many adventurers come to fight monsters and use the loot they get to make a decent living. Together with his goddess Hestia, he works really hard to fulfill his goal, meeting several friends along the way, and growing up as an adventurer, as well as a person.\r\nThe people of Orario city join familias whichoffer services such as dungeon crawling and item crafting. It's a sort of guilds/clubs that you can find in MMORPGs mostly.\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi has 13 episodes which means that the story is moving very fast, and the story isn't told in the best way. It's really interesting, but it feels cluttered into 13 episodes, as if somebody tried to rush the synopsis.\\n\\n\r\nThe point of the story is that you always need to have a goal in your life, no matter how hard and impossible it is. After all, that is what makes it a worthy goal - worthy enough that you devote your life to it. Also, you should never try to do everything on your own. Don't carry the burden by yourself, there is always somebody who can help you and take a piece of it. Don't close up, somebody will come sometime for sure. ^_^\\n\\n\r\nCharacters\\n\\n\r\nIn DanMachi we have two main characters.\\n\\n\r\nFirst MC is Bell Cranel. Bell is a 14 year old boy with white hair and red eyes. He likes to wear light armor and uses a dagger as a weapon. He is a kind, shy, and easily intimidated. Throughout the story he doesn't change at all. He does what he believes is right, even if it costs him more than it's worth. He cares about his friends, especially his goddess Hestia. He has a special relationship with her because she took him in and offered him a familiar when he needed it the most. \\n\\n\r\nSecond MC is Hestia. Hestia is a goddess also known as \"Loli Big-Boobs\" representing her stature and body (she is small and has big breasts okay? Fanservice OP). She is very energetic and kind. She sees potential in Bell so she tries her best to support him in his goal. She is hard-working when it comes to helping Bell but in truth she is lazy  and a glutton, which makes most other deities dislike her. She made Bell her first member of familia and granted him \"God's Grace\" a.k.a. her blessing.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi is made by studio J.C.Staff. That means the art style is similiar to that of: Toradora, Kaichou wa Maid-Sama!, Shokugeki no Souma etc. Characters are done well, even thought it's not the best to be honest. MCs are done well and few other support characters. The rest of characters look boring, and their expressions seem to vacant for the situation.\\n\r\nThere is also way too much fanservice.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sounds\\n\\n\r\nOP and ED are...meh. I didn't mind it but I don't feel like listening to it again either. It's just average. The sounds are done really well though. The grinning, grunting, sighs and sounds of desperation are...realistic. I was really surprised by how well they are done. I haven't seen many anime with that good sound effects. They are amazing :3\\n\\n\r\nSummary\\n\\n\r\nAll in all, DanMachi is a cute anime, with a setting that I personally am a sucker for (dungeon crawiling). I'd call this a less serious version of Sword Art Online, with much more fanservice.\\n\r\nTalking about fanservice, there is a lot of it here, so if you like fanservice, you will love this anime. I didn't because there was too much of it and it was unnecessary. Time spent on that fanservice could've been spent on making the story more immersive.\\n",

It may not be Champloo or Steins;Gate or even Grimgar, but you're allowed to like it. Not every anime needs to be an exercise in critical reflection.\r\nThere's a lot of people comparing this to SAO and if you liked SAO you'll probably like this too. But by no means is that an insult. If you like Magi, you'll like this too. If you like RPG and Game type anime you're in for a nice time.\r\nThe protagonist is kind and in no wayobnoxious. He's not moody or overly immature. He exists in a world in which he's not totally OP and encounters real challenges. Female characters don't suddenly become useless when he shows up. It's a nice, fun show with just enough drama to keep you going. There was definitely a part where I was saying \"don't worry there's other episodes, he can't possibly die\" followed by \"OH MY GOD HE MADE IT\".\\n\\n\r\nIf you're not into semi light-hearted, floor clearing, fantasy rpg anime then avoid it. But I for one quite liked it and hope you all give it a shot.",

It is Shounen after all.\\n\\n\r\nIt takes its time for a very profoundly executed, very emotional sub-arc in the first third of the Anime, which is not common in the genre.\\n\\n\r\nThe characters are very archetypal, but done in a sincere and endearing way,\\n\r\nand realistic enough to not be complete stereotypes.\\n\r\nThe most stereotypical stuff is done for comedic effect, mostly.\\n\\n\r\nThe main character in particular is very simple, but he has clear character motivation.\\n\r\nAlthough a simple one, he has a reason to fight and to grow stronger.\\n\r\nSomething that is sadly often missing from MCs in Shounen battle anime lately.\\n\\n\r\nThe title of the anime is a little misleading, because the Harem aspect of the anime is very underplayed throughout the whole season.\\n\r\nCompared to other Anime I would subscribe that label to, here it too is used mostly as comic relief.\\n\\n\r\nI saw Danmachi compared to SAO a lot, and it certainly has a lot in common setting-wise.\\n\r\nIf you have seen the first season of SAO, you can imagine this as being similar to the first half of the first season.\\n\r\nIt is however not as much of a power trip as that one.\\n\r\nAlthough the MC in Danmachi has become fairly strong by the end,\\n\r\nhe is still leagues below most of the Characters he hangs around with.\\n\\n\r\nSince I enjoyed this Anime way more than I expected I would,\\n\r\nI would recommend anyone who likes the genre even a little to watch it.",

Yes I did enjoy Overlord and like Gun Gal Online. \r\nThis show is nothing amazing or original, the show is simple and sometimes seems like there wasn't much development and people just stick on. I binged this show in 2 or 3 days and I enjoyed it honestly.\r\nThis show falls into the its not that good but you can enjoy it in a binge. The environment is not all that unique except its not an other world its their world. \r\nYou know now a days not many anime's aregood and the best ones are just above okay.  I have struggled to find good animes the past few years and most of them have just been cont. of other shows that are already good. This show is about average and is not one of those good animes this was just kinda fun to watch. \\n\r\nPeople criticizing animes and I really think it is great and alot of the time authors wont improve unless you tell them what they made sucks. The show has much to improve on and for character development of some key players you needed a whole other season on the Female Knight Ais, who saved Bell.\\n\r\nThe way of the show is a quickly built harem around a 14 year old with a pery granpa who raised him and died. He is innocent, nice, and well liked and cared for by everyone. The jokes are not necessarily fresh common boob jokes and pervy jokes. This show needs a lot of work and the only reason I gave it a seven was because I enjoyed the show enough to watch it through usaully i leave anime that really annoying and dumb after the first few minutes. \\n\r\nI will say this to end as this show doesn't need a through review about loli, neko, or opai,but i dropped this show the first time it came out. I was annoyed by the early and direct boobs in face early start to the show. I am no fan of that genre \"Boob in Face\" but i watched it this time not being surprised or amazed i mussed out but only watched it because i was in the mood for some magic anime and crunchyroll is having a give away so i was like why not. So don't watch this show if you can't enjoy it its not the best and very generic but its a show you watch while waiting for new ep of steins gate 0 or Legend of galactic heroes",

            "content": "That one anime with an extremely long name, what is deemed by many as that notorious over-hyped SAO copy, aka \"DanMachi\", is an rpg/mmo sort of anime where the characters all have stats and abilities unique to each person and follows the growth of the extremely kind, driven, and passionate MC known as Bell. The premise of the series and the main character are nothing especially unique and new but that does not take away from the series. \r\nEverything about DanMachi is, at the very least, decent. I would say the most lacking components are the story and the sound. The story was certainly rushedin certain areas due to the fact that this season was a promotion for the light novels. As per usual, much content from the original source gets cut out in the animated adaptation. As for sound, the OP and ED were okay, they weren't especially memorable or catchy to me but that is just my personal opinion; the music for the relation building scenes versus the action and hyped scenes certainly did their job.\\n\\n\r\nWhat stood out most to me from \"DanMachi\" was the awesome quality in art and style. When all other aspects of a show are good, even greater animation can turn an average show into a memorable series that allows the viewer to really become immersed within the world presented. \\n\\n\r\nI won't lie, I do enjoy me some \"plot\" here and there, and DanMachi doesn't disappoint in this regard; however, if you refuse to watch a show or will only watch a show if there are scantily clad girls or mandatory bath scenes, then please try and look past that going into this series as there is much more than meets the eye. Only you can really be the judge so why not give it a shot?",

            "content": "This anime is one that is considered generic, full of harem and boobs, but from my perspective most of those people didn't even see the anime. \r\nStory:\r\nThe story isn't developed. This season is just some kind of introduction, so it has nothing else than the growth of an unknown weak adventurer into a heroe. Still the reason why I give the story a 7 is because this premise is good enough but with no second season it achieves little.\r\nSome of the biggest insults agains this anime is the typical: Generic SAO clone, which this anime isn't if you bother to watch both animes. First, thisanime, which is an introduction as I said before achieves the goal of telling the story of an adventurer as an adventurer, not as nothing else. What I mean is that this anime tells you about the adventurer himself, not the plot around him, at least as for this season.\\n\\n\r\nArt\\n\\n\r\nThe art was pretty good, I can't really say anything more in this aspect. The fights were also animated awesomely and the characters look good.\\n\\n\r\nSound: I didn't really paid attention to the sound, but I do know that the anime never had a single time in which the music was bothering. At the same time I can't remember an awesome song, so that's why the 9.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter:\\n\\n\r\nThe characters in themselves weren't developed, aside from Bell, the protagonist which is developed, but not significantly, since the anime is just an intro for a possible next season. I have no problems with the characters being done as they were. \\n\\n\r\nThe characters are well drawn, even though some people have issues with Hestia because she has boobs. A problem would be if those were just shown all the time leaning against Bell's face or the camera, but that's not a problem with this anime.\\n\\n\r\nHarem:\\n\\n\r\nThe anime doesn't have exactly a harem as most people think of. At the first 2 or so episodes the anime looked like it would be just a harem story, but is quickly abandoned the idea. Yeah, in the later episodes there were some harem-ish situations, but they were just like 3 scenes and a pervert scene.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Getting this together I think that 8 would be a good score for this anime. The main problem is that this NEEDS a second season or for the viewer to want to read the novels. If there's not second season planned then this will just be a NO for anyone who doesn't plan to read the novels.",

I normally don't really care about the actual action itself I always think about the consequences of the fight for example if someone's going to beat the army general and win the battle or something. This fight scene though I was enthralled by everyone and I don't really know why.\r\nTo be honest though the ending didn't really wrap anything up it opened upsome more questions specifically about who Bell is and what the god's have to do with the dungeon.\\n\\n\r\nSome things about the characters, I think that all the characters are quite good when you get rid of some of the females obsession's with Bell. Bell is a bit clich\u00e9 as a main character but I'm a fan of that so It's ok, Lilly has quite a nice background to her and i think they made a solid character with her. Aiz is a strange character and they didn't elaborate enough on her I thought so she's kinda just Bell's trainer/idol/love interest?, the rest of the character I thought were fine I liked Welf too he was interesting to find out about.\\n\\n\r\nI didn't pick any flaws in the animation in fact I thought it was pretty good, some of the particle effect's looked great, the music was good, they managed to set the mood quite well and the OP and the ED are catchy but not enough for me to look for afterwards.\\n\\n\r\nOne thing to look out for which is pretty obvious from the name of the show, fan service, it's there but honestly I think it's at acceptable levels the only thing that really bothered me was the silly rivalry between Hestia and Lily.\\n\\n\r\nI really do think this show needs a season 2, Gods be just that it's not like countless other season 2's that just fail on all accounts.\\n\\n\r\n8.8/10 (Last fight scene boosted this by about .5)\\n\\n",

I enjoyed the storyline, the characters, and the fun that they created, although it is a fine anime if you just want to laugh a lot.\r\nIn the second part, I will tell the bad parts which disturbed me quite a bit and why I had to give 6 to it in the end. The story is fine, the characters are fine, but the fact is that there are too many freewires left unfinished. It feels like the story is incomplete, also the relationships between few characters are left so open, that it disturbs me quite a bit\\n\\n\r\nSo in conclusion, I wished to give 9 or 10 to this anime at the begining because it was a lot of fun and it also captivated me with the story and the main characters love and attitude towards Aiz, but in the end I felt like I got no real story, just harem and nothing more... The only thing that still make me think between 6-8 is the fun and the laugh that it made. \\n\\n\r\n[SPOILER ALERT]\\n\r\nBell's was the main power of Bell through the story, but is he in love with Aiz in the end? It feels like he's just running away from her, not even trying to date her or something... Even after the training she gave him, he is keeping distance. Also Hestia seems to have Bell a bit like a slave not as a familia member by not letting him to go out with no girl... well at least Lili spices it up a bit, but as long as Hestia gives him everything and keeps him the over-powered seems like Bell doesn't even care if he'll be with Aiz or not.",

But i guess with the skill he had, it works. \r\nReally i had fun with this series, and i demand a season 2with the new information we got at the end.

            "content": "Hate Reading? Video Review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdfRyQTAiC8\r\nIs It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon? Also known as DanMachi for short.\r\nThe anime at first was torn to shreds by nearly every person online calling it Sword Art Online Giant Titty Edition. But I will hands down say that this anime had better pacing and story progression than Log Horizon who people swear by for some reason but bash on this Anime???Anyways I'm going to get first to the heat of the debate, a lot of people bash that this anime copied the floor level idea and RPG idea from Sword Art Online. Thosepeople though fail to realize that Floor Levels weren't an idea created from Sword Art Online, but in fact this idea has existed long before SAO's existence. Almost every Dungeon Crawler RPG has floor levels, I mean just look at Diablo, it's pretty much fighting on different floors with increasing leveled enemies per different dungeon/floor. The truth of the matter is that people keep comparing DanMachi to SAO when in reality the anime shows have totally different premise.\\n\r\nLooking at the broad picture Sword Art Online is an anime based on being trapped in a MMO similar to Guild Wars 2 or WOW with different sections devoted to different tasks like Villages, Dungeons, Main Quests, etcetera. On the other hand, DanMachi is an Anime based on the what if the world of a game like Guild Wars 2 was real and not a game. So in that perspective DanMachi is closer to the source of material than Sword Art Online. DanMachi is the real answer to what would life be inside a game rather than pretend to be trapped in one. With that said I love both of these anime shows, but I think it's an unfair comparison of the two seeing that they are looking at the same thing but in totally different perspectives. \\n\r\nNow let's actually talk about what the anime is about, the story takes place in Orario a fictional world which contains monsters in all sorts of forms. In the story certain individuals take on the role as Adventurers who visit the dungeon to defeat monsters and take their shards. The shards can be used to craft magic items and are also used as the world's currency. Adventurers join groups called Famiria and each Famiria is serves a resident deity. Now I understand this is a lot to take in, but basically an Adventurer joins a Famiria to make adventuring easier and there deity can help tell them how they have improved after training at the dungeons. It's important because you need to know when you can move up a floor so that you as an Adventurer don't get killed. Also in a Famiria you can meet others to help make leveling up easier, and also get your back if you get rushed by to many enemies. \\n\r\nThis particular story follows Bell Cranel, a solo adventurer under the goddess Hestia; Hestia is Bell's deity. Bell is at the start the only member of the Hestia Famiria, but he works extremely hard each day to improve his abilities. During the beginning of the story while Bell is still fairly new as an Adventurer a high level monster escapes a higher floor and Bell is nearly killed but he gets saved by Aiz Wallenstein. After this he pretty much fell in love with her but throughout the story he is mocked on how he was saved by a girl, and he wants to prove to himself and everyone that he can surpass Aiz, and not be saved by her all the time.\\n\r\nOf course first off I'd love to tip my hat off at the story because the progression and overall pacing is just so good. To add on the plot never got too deep but from where Bell started to where he wanted to get through you see a wimpy kid grow into a true Adventurer which honestly felt nostalgic to me. The show in general felt like an actual hero adventure, almost as if I was reading a book about a fairy tale hero. \\n\r\nThe Art and Animation was splendid, nothing to ground breaking but nothing fell flat and everything popped. The most notable thing I can say about the Art is that the world felt like a world I'd want to be in. The fight scenes were so good as well, well animated and drew me in with suspense wondering what would happen next and once again felt like a true story about an adventurer.\\n\r\nThe characters were just awesome and though they didn't explain the background of every character the main cast of characters did get a back story which were also amazing. You saw what the other characters went through so you knew where they were coming from rather than just being plain ol' support characters.  The best part is that this anime pretty much set some amazing ground work because its story, characters, and world. The one that I want a little more story of is Hestia who despite being a major character didn't get much story. I'd also like to know how and where the deities come from.\\n\r\nThe music was perfectly suitable for this anime, the opening theme really helped describe the anime, adventures, struggle, and above all friendship which everyone knows is the perfect combination of a heroic anime. The ending song feels just so adorable, with a Chibi Hestia running followed by all the other characters but all I can really say is that it's amazing. The anime in general screams Adventure, Friendship, Struggles, and Happiness! Although there are some kinda dark moments in this anime it was still the right balance for something like this.\\n\r\nBut before we get into the review I do want to mention one of the major gripes of the anime which is it's slight harem roots that it shows. It doesn't get to the extent of girls falling all over him but there are some ecchi scenes that pop in here and there, and it isn't as overly exaggerated as some people make it out be, I'd say Nisekoi put the girls in more awkward situations than this Anime does by a long shot and Nisekoi is amazing!\\n\\n\r\nNow onward to the review!\\n\\n\r\nStory - 9 | Astonishing!\\n\r\nDanMachi's story was superb and much better than what I was expecting. I will admit that I came in with extremely low expectations. I had heard the worst from a few reviewers online, so I was honestly expecting total garbage with overly done ecchi scenes like Sakura-Kiss status. So once I started I got hooked, I didn't see an anime this good coming until the summer or later, and honestly I'm glad it came when it did. Spring brought new anime shows that just weren't that good honestly, not terrible but many didn't give me incentive to continue watching. This anime's story was amazing, it felt like I was on adventure the whole way through! However, the only thing I can say bad about the story is a small gripe that screams season 2. We learned a lot about the characters, the particular location of this world, and of course how this world all works and functions. But the one thing that is missing is exploration, they never really travel that far from where the anime starts, and no it isn't bad but I just wish this anime could've been 24 eps with more adventures ahead but this is more of a desire than gripe one could say.\\n\\n\r\nCharacters - 10 | Unforgettable!\\n\r\nBefore you lose your mind, a 10 doesn't mean perfect because there is no such thing as perfect. That aside this anime has unforgettable characters especially the main character in the Hestia Famiria. What I mean by unforgettable is that the background story, personality, and how the character was introduced were all a good mix. None of the main characters ever blended into the background or felt like there were there for only support. The story didn't only center around Bell despite him being the main character which allowed the characters to have existence outside of Bell's sight so that you saw the struggles that not even some of the other characters in the anime saw. You kind of knew more about the characters than any other character which felt quite nice. When something would happen that would affect a character you knew it before anyone else and were wondering how things would play out. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters and I hope a Season 2 can only help grow those characters and explain other things that the show didn't get enough time to explain.\\n\\n\r\nArt/Animation - 9 | Astonishing!\\n\r\nFirst above all I want to say that everything in the anime felt perfectly fit for each other, the background and characters felt as one in the same world and everything felt colorful and popped out well. The animations were extremely good but not silky smooth like some other anime shows are starting to do now but this anime wasn't a slouch either. The best way to say it is that it's an anime that feels perfect and right together in Art and Animation, I think what makes the Art and Animation feel like something higher than a 7 or 8 is how good they complement each other. I just wish the animations could be a bit more silky smooth like we are starting to see lately on some shows cause this anime could've jumped to a 10 depending on how much of the anime was buttery smooth. But the anime as it is now is still beyond average, but something about this anime makes me want to demand more so I could just be picky.\\n\\n\r\nMusic/Sound - 8 | Amazing!\\n\r\nThe voice actors and music do its good on the anime, everything felt like a beautifully wrapped package of nice voice acting with an amazing OST to back it up. The fight scenes had music perfect for the moment that kept me at the edge of my seat, and the moments that admired the scenery were partnered with nice background music. But above all the Opening and Ending songs were good, they felt silly and wacky but showed a side of the world that not many shows like this would ever show. You saw an Adventurer also enjoying his daily life with the people he cared about and the music helped emphasize that alongside with Action, Struggle, and Friendship!\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - 10 | Unforgettable!\\n\r\nWhat can I say about this Anime that I haven't already said, the characters are amazing and have their own back stories that actually hold up and this gives the characters recognition from just a typical support character and helps amplify towards how you feel about that character. The Art and Animation complement each other and help bring the world to life by making not only the world pop but the characters too and making them not seem transparent and feel more real. The OST helped bring the most intense moments to life with heart pumping songs and assisted in catering the most real moments with soothing music to help empathize with the current scene. But of course above all the story had a point A to point B, which took me on an adventure of a life time with amazing characters in an amazing world and all I can truly say is that A and B are not the only letters in the alphabet so I hope a Second Season can take me on more explorations beyond just the world we got to see and help expand the characters even more!\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 9 | Astonishing  [Exact Rating - 9.2]\\n\r\nA perfect anime doesn't exist but this is close enough to that for me, the story, characters, ost, and art was just up to par with everything I consider amazing and honestly this anime is what I'd personally consider the best way to start Summer's amazing line up of 2015 anime shows. If you want an anime that will take you on an adventure in a world where a zero becomes a hero and you want watch him slay cool enemies alongside probably some of the best supporting characters in a long time than this anime is definitely up your alley. While this anime isn't a Sword Art Online clone the few similarities are the story progression and the sense of adventure both of the anime shows carry. I think the one benefit is subtracting the love interest from SAO that this anime doesn't take as seriously, yes the character acknowledges a girl but the story never becomes about the romance between characters which while I don't mind, SAO kind of centered the anime around the relationship between Kirito and Asuna while in this anime is stays more faithful the point A to B and the adventure and struggles between that. Summing up the anime, I'd say it's best to ignore all reviews and come in with a clean mind and judge for yourself what the anime is but don't be surprised when you find yourself giggling, laughing, and going over the edge of your seat on the action scenes.\\n\\n\r\n(I apologize if there are any typos)\\n",

In other words no stops today\r\nStory: 8/10 The story started slowly about a small town guy trying to be a big adventurer with a Harem line. I knew when this anime will become Harem Anime cause \"Experince\" But sometimes seeing a week guy becoming strong is good afterall as nearly all the anime that are like this start with an overpowered MC. So \"Credits\"\r\nSound: 8/10 Although the OP made me sleepy everytime I listen to it. It kept up with the fights, dangerous events and fun events so all good I guess. . . . . .\r\nCharacters:6/10 The MC character development was pretty good but all the characters in this anime were not fun at all = were boring for me. The MC was good but everyone depended on him when the final episode came + Harem for the MC. (The hell did this come to) Someone really needs to write a good mediveal battle story without any harem but just romance.\\n\\n\r\nAnimation: 7/10 Pretty good. I again liked some of the scenes cause of the animation and the cute chibi animation in the ED was good. No more comment for this here\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 9/10 Only thing that made me give it a 9. There were a lot of funny scenes cause of the immature MC with some girls.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: Did I Like It? 50% Yes. Should You Watch It? If You Like Seeing MC becoming strong from training, will power, and getting experince then this anime might be for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 7.6/10\\n\\n\r\nPersonal Note: Can not be watched infront of your parents cause of the ecchi scene that pop out every now and then.",

The noise you hear while they are fighting is basically ear wrenching the crackling and hissing is not needed. There wasn't a lot of character development, maybe for 5 characters which considering the amount of characters isn't really great. None the less I did enjoy the battle animation and fighting in general but the story is where I draw the line, the title of the anime is \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" Which is an interesting title but it has nothing to do with the story,not once does the main character ever pick up girls in a dungeon, in fact the girls usually pick him up.

            "content": "I can never understand why things that are super generic and follow see through paths are so popular. Is it because it reminds them of something they love? Does the story pump you up even though you can see the outcome? I don't know but I wish I did.\r\nThe only thing going for it is it's setting. In this make believe land there is a dungeon that goes down many floors (Atleast past 60) and in each level of the dungeon there are monsters that anyone can go in and fight. The only reason to fight them is to get them gems they drop andexchange them for gold and maybe curiosity as well. It follows they idea of being in a game but this time its not actually a game just whats natural in this world. You raise your stats and develop skills that allow you to go deeper into the dungeon and obtain larger gems.\\n\\n\r\nThe charcters are generic and mediocre. The main charcter Bell is a weakling in the begining and then set in front of obstacles that prove his strength on the way to what he dreams for himself in the future. Lili the supporter of the party that Bell leads collects all the gems making it easier for the gold outcome the be larger and she provides a development for Bell in the earlier episodes. Crozzo is a blacksmith that Bell unintentionally runs into when looking for a new set of Crozzo's armor. These two create a deal and partner up to take hold on the lower levels that need larger partys to face when low level. Hestia is Bell's godess and provides care for him. All of the god's and godess's look to create Famillias a group of adventures they care for and send into the dungeon. She is a charcter that is either loved or hated. I personally dislike her attitude and personalitly. It ruins the atmosphere of the show and it seems she is there to create some comedy. Wallenstein is one of the strongest fighters in the lands and Bell's love at first site. She is basically a charcter there to provide movement for the story. She is considered an idiot except when it comes to fighting which she excells at.\\n\\n\r\nThe artstyle is bland and simple. There is nothing amazingly good about it. I didn't notice and signigant drops in quality while watching and and it stayed around a average mark during the whole series. The same for the sound. Opening and Ending were both alright nothing amazing considing others of this season and the soundtrack didn't stick out either.\\n\\n\r\nI enjoyed it enough to finish it. It wasn't anything amazing and reminded me alot of SAO. I wouldn't be suprised about a second season even though it was't annouced. Overall the show was OK. It could be worth a watch if you enjoy video games or SAO. If looking for a romance as strong as the one in SAO it is not here so don't expect developement. Watch at you own pace and drop it if needed. This show is a not need watch. \\n\\n\r\n-Scores-\\n\r\nStory:6\\n\r\nArt:6\\n\r\nSound:6\\n\r\nCharacters:5\\n\r\nEnjoyment:6\\n\r\nOVERALL:6\\n\\n",

The animation, fight scenes and voice acting were all very well done. If nothing else, this anime is enjoyable when you don\u2019t really think too much about what you\u2019re watching. 2/2\r\nDid the anime accomplish what it was attempting to do stylistically? \r\nDanMachi on a stylistic level did not take many risks or do anything that I\u2019ve never seen before. It accomplished its role as asemi-RPG inspired anime, but did nothing along the way deserving of praise. 0.5/2\\n\\n\r\nWas the anime mostly original?\\n\r\nIf I was going to describe DanMachi, one word I would definitely never use is original. DanMachi almost serves as a 13 episode experiment to see how many clich\u00e9s one anime can fit into a season. You have your insert-yourself male protagonist who inexplicably has incredible luck with the ladies, cheesy RPG game-esque setting, big breasted female characters with little substance, fanservice galore and unstoppable OP main character with almost no character flaws. 0/2\\n\\n\r\nDid the anime rely too much on filler content?\\n\r\nDanMachi this season is 13 episodes in duration, there were no recap episodes or episodes that otherwise seemed to branch from the main narrative. 2/2\\n\\n\r\nWould I recommend it to others?\\n\r\nI certainly would not recommend this show to people looking for a cerebral and thought provoking anime. If you\u2019re looking: for nicely done fight scenes, well-endowed women, a God-like main character whom everyone seems to like and not much in the way of substance in between; this is the show for you! 0.5/2\\n\\n\r\nTotal score: 5/10",

Also for a short series, I was never really bored, it was for me, like discovering a new MMO. I liked the angle of living in an RPG world without being \"trapped\" in a game, the world itself is a game, but that's how it always been. I don't know what else can explain why I liked this anime so much, story-wise I was so intrigued by discovering the setting and how the world of this anime works (like howit would work if it were an mmo) that I wasn't even concentrated in the story. I loved seeing new high-level zones, combat, analysing what kind of classes there would be, professions, new beasts, etc. I felt integrated in the world itself out of my curiosity. Outside of that, radically speaking, I really don't know why I memorize this anime so much.\\n\\n\r\nIn short, it's an better version of SAO, with loli oppai.\\n\\n",

            "content": "Is it wrong to pick up girls in a dungeon? Evidently not, because our MC sure picks up a lot of them there and everyone thinks he\u2019s a total saint.\r\nI can\u2019t really blame them though; it\u2019s hard not to love Bell despite his denseness. He\u2019s a pure and real kind MC done well, and his struggles in the Labyrinth feel real. He isn\u2019t immediately OP and fails a lot initially. He acts consistently kindly and it feels natural. \r\nHestia is an awesome character, and just plain adorable. She does become a lot more yandere-like later in the series, but always puts her family first regardless.And it\u2019s not the idea of Bell she likes, she actually knows and likes him as a person and a friend. You can tell he cares for her deeply too. Their Familia relationship is sweet and at the beginning brings a warm fuzzy feeling to your stomach just watching it. \\n\\n\r\nOut of the supporting characters: Lili has some decent development in just a short couple of episodes. A sweet kid on the whole, but toughened up by a hard life. She just wants someone to show her a bit of kindness, and really Bell\u2019s the perfect character for that. Aiz doesn\u2019t seem to have much to her besides her power, although she does get a bit more screen-time after a while. Quite a monotone and boring character nonetheless. Stalker Freya is just plain cringey and totally unnecessary for the plot \u2013 a lousy character who adds absolutely nothing to the anime. Syr also seems unnecessary \u2013 I can\u2019t really find anything to say about her one way or the other. Eina is quite a nice character but there\u2019s not much to her either. Hephaestus is good, but not in much. Welf is fine but still pretty generic. \\n\\n\r\nLet\u2019s face it, we\u2019re only here for Hestia and Bell, although Welf, Lili, and Aiz are all necessary as plot devices. There\u2019s a fair amount of fan-service but it fits with this type of anime.\\n\\n\r\nWorld building: not much seen besides the dungeon, in fact not much is even explained. We\u2019re just thrown into Bell\u2019s life, and at this point we don\u2019t actually need much exposition to understand the story. Less is more.\\n\\n\r\nOp is typical, not great and not terrible. The brushing the teeth scene is fantastic \u2013 such strong family vibes. Makes me grin every time I see it. Rest of music and ed are fine too.\\n\\n\r\nThe ending felt a bit rushed \u2013 all of a sudden everyone\u2019s using these phenomenal powers? It just felt like they were trying to show off how cool everyone is, but wait! They couldn\u2019t be as cool as Bell! So let\u2019s make them all op and then make him even more op. That will show everyone.\\n\\n\r\nWell, Hermes\u2019 speech at the ending is a good set up for a season 2. It will be interesting to see how the backstory impacts the future. It is a bit unoriginal and the story would have been fine without it, but I still didn\u2019t expect it. \\n\\n\r\nIt\u2019s a fun watch, but nothing beyond that. If you liked Magi but wish it had a less focussed plot and added a harem, then you\u2019ll probably like this too. Another classic adventure series. XD\\n\\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "The series starts with a narrative that gives some insight into the world of DanMachi, explaining the source of the powers that people possess. Some of the story elements are from RPG's like the level up system. \r\nThe system is used in many contexts in the show to signify not only character growth but status in their society, as in a ranking system. Though it has been used in other stories like Sword Art Online, or Log Horizon, unlike those series this series incorporates it into their world as a fundamental part of the social structure. This is the case with the Gods and theirroles as well, as they seem more like rich patrons at times who fund various people who are part of their 'Familia' or Family. \\n\\n\r\nThis becomes very apparent when we see the Hestia Family, consisting of only Bell Cranel and the Goddess Hestia, who live in an abandoned church. Being a small Family they lacked the wealth of the larger and well established Families.\\n\\n\r\nBell Cranel is a very enjoyable character, being presented as a young naive teenager with dreams of romance and adventure, a kind heart, humble and honest demeanor. \\n\r\nAfter falling in love with Aiz Wallenstein he strives to become stronger so as to be closer to her. \\n\\n\r\nAiz appears as a mysterious young women, and is later revealed to be the 'Sword Princess' an extremely powerful sword user, as well as one of the highest level adventurers mentioned in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThough I liked that the writers tried to present her as being mysterious I did find her character to be too mysterious. She is very expressionless, and seems somewhat detached. Her lines through out the anime are few and far between, and her character is developed probably the least through the series. \\n\\n\r\nMainly the story focuses on the adventures of Bell, and his interactions between various other characters he meets. Lili a small hobbit like girl with a charming personality, but whose dark past influences her motivations. Welf a young passionate blacksmith, and most importantly the relationship between Bell and Hestia his Goddess, who is infatuated with him, and his boyish charm. \\n\\n\r\nThe art in the anime was done very well. A bright pallet, well drawn characters, with well done action scenes. They did well in presenting a fluidity to Bell's motions, and fire effects. I thought the eyes to be very expressive, though Aiz again is an exception. The character design was also varied as non of the characters really look alike aside from a set of twins who are part of Aiz's Familia. \\n\\n\r\nThe sound of the anime really brought depth and power to the scenes. The crunching of the gravel and rocks under the hooves of a Minotaur, and its howl. The voice acting in the Japanese anime was spot on and brought life to the characters. Bell was soft spoken as was Aiz, and I would suggest if anyone did wish to watch the series to watch it in Japanese, as I find English voice actors to be atrocious and far less skilled then their Japanese counter parts, lacking the ability to convey emotion. \\n\\n\r\nThe series hints at an overall plot, but does not really delve too deeply into it. This is primarily a character driven anime, following Bell and his perspectives, as well as a few others. Though I did like the fast pace, it seemed at times that they wanted to cram too much content into each episode, and after reading some of the manga I realized that they left a good portion of the story out to do so. Not important elements, but enough that it may make the anime appear to lack depth in some areas as some of the parts fleshed out in the manga, are left undone in the series. \\n\\n\r\nThough it has qualities of a harem it really doesn't go too far into that realm, nor does it have many scenes that could be described as being ecchi. The few times they use them are humorous, and help reveal the shy nature of Bell, but they are not a large part of the series. The romance in the series is not really strong either, we get a sense of the affections numerous female characters have for Bell, but he doesn't seem to be that interested in most of them, again except for Aiz, whom he has an unreasonable infatuation for, yet the series never really tries to establish a solid relationship between Bell and Aiz, only hinting at a mutual affection. \\n\\n\r\n Though it does share similarities with other anime, one should try not to compare it.  I found it better then Sword Art Online as i enjoyed the main character more. Though Bell does become very powerful I find that it was done well enough to be consistent with the themes of the story, as the overall theme is about a boy who wishes to become a hero. \\n\\n\r\nOverall I found this anime to be quite enjoyable, and have watched it several time. If you like fast paced series, good action, and decent characters then this should not disappoint. \\n\\n\\n",

            "content": "Alright, here it is. If we were judging based on the title of a series alone, this would be it. The competition is over. Peak degeneracy. And even in theme, this series is pretty degenerate. But that doesn't stop it from being a pretty decent show. It is a show with pretty bland characters and an average story that is really just dragged across the finish line by its presentation, and particularly its sound design. And that isn't a bad thing.\r\nIt turns out being a reasonably good watch, but it is lacking an identity. I still have trouble placing what this show tried to achieve.For instance, it could be an action show, but the monster art sucks and the action direction isn't good either. It could be a character development show, but most of the characters are just harem members. It could be a plot show, but nothing really gets explained. It is just easier to talk about this in segments. So let's dive in.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Rating]\\n\r\nStory: 4\\n\r\nArt: 7\\n\r\nSound: 9 \\n\r\nCharacter: 3 \\n\r\nEnjoyment: 5\\n\r\nOverall: 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Story: 4]\\n\r\nThe premise is that this guy, Bell, wants to be with this girl and get recognized as a hero. And stuff happens. It is very simple, which is fine. Probably good, even. A lot of the time, that's just how life is. There is no need to begin with something that is only confusing, so this series starts off with a simple premise with the intention of ramping it up later. Really, the story does a decent job hitting beats and setting up important climaxes that resonate with the audience. Of course, it has its fair share of issues.\\n\\n\r\nOne major issue lies with Bell's character. More on that later, but his design in terms of the world is broken from episode 1, and it makes it hard for the audience to get on his side. \\n\\n\r\nAnother major issue is the constant promise of depth in the story, without it having come to fruition. There are many characters and world mechanics that are just big question marks. What is the connection between the gods and the adventurers? Why are they sent down from heaven? Why does the dungeon exist? Why is Bell significant to this? None of these questions get answered or even explored in the run of the series. Yes, it is the first season, but this is not how you build an engaging plot.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Art: 7]\\n\r\nI have a difficult time evaluating the art. Most of the time, the character art looks pretty good! The design could use some work, but the character animation is livelier than most. The background work ranges from good to average. The direction is mostly standard but it looks good.\\n\\n\r\nHowever, a big hurdle for the series is the action. The monster art sucks, and pretty consistently. This is a big pain for the show. Sure it isn't Log Horizon bad... but it is pretty bad. Sometimes the monsters are CGI, and they look awful, and sometimes the monsters are just drawn poorly and not well-realized. The prime example is the silverback. Beyond this, the directing seems to have a hard time actually showing the action and instead relies on quick cuts and effects to engage the viewer. This drags the action down. Sometimes the action can get by on its level of spectacle alone, but this generally is not well-animated and cannot even hope to reach the level of something like Gurren Lagann, the ultimate spectacle action piece. \\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Sound: 9]\\n\r\nThe sound design is the shining star of this series, and its not close. It feels like most of the series is scored moment-by-moment, which, while I do not expect is the case, is a magnificent feat. The is music playing very often, and it always seems to fit with the mood of the series and drastically improve the watch quality. The sound has interesting effects for objects and movements that are usually forgotten, which adds an extra layer of immersion to the production. Small pitfalls are the voice acting, which is only fine, and maybe the bass on some of the boomy sound effects. Still on the fence about that. \\n\\n\r\nBut, really. Without the sound, I think this series goes nowhere. Just having the proper sound actually improves the narrative itself. The saving grace --\\n\r\n and really the spiritual essence -- of the series itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Character: 3]\\n\r\nMost of the characters are throwaways, are unexplained, or just disappoint. Let's just get into it.\\n\\n\r\nBell. A hero/leader character. That's all fine. I've seen plenty of these types of characters that I like. But Bell is average at best. Let's see how it all stacks up. Bell's tragic backstory is that his family died and he is too weak to join a familia and be with the girl he has a crush on. I'm fine with backgrounds like this. Look at someone like Deku from HeroAca. While not really one of my favorite characters, his backstory is pretty similar and he is at least a character I can resonate with. Where does it all go wrong for Bell? He is sad because nobody wants him and nobody is there for him, because he is weak. But at the same time, literally EVERY WOMAN IN THE ENTIRE SERIES, THE ENTIRE WORLD, WANTS TO HAVE HIS BABIES. Right from the start, too. Before he even unlocks his true chick magnet potential. Sorry, but this is such a strong inconsistency. It creates the huge divide in what the backstory tells us Bell is and what Bell actually is. And do to this arrangement, we have a hard time connecting with Bell as he improves or slays big baddies, because it doesn't mean as much. \\n\\n\r\nThen there are the role players. Most of these characters are throwaways. Some of them get decent development and are sort of interesting... but mostly not.\\n\\n\r\nThen there are the mobs. This happens often in anime, where the mobs have a drastically over-the-top sense of morality. For instance, the mean enemy adventurers in this series. Their portrayal is so simple, brutish, and unfeeling that is completely pushes the audience away from trying to understand this group as characters. That just isn't how people are in the world. Same with the droves of women trying to get with Bell. That just isn't how people are, and to misunderstand that is big blunder.\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Enjoyment: 5]\\n\r\nThis is a very, very easy watch. Sure, there is a lot of stuff going on that isn't too memorable or interesting. But there are plenty of exciting, triumphant moments, too. The slow points are bearable. Most of this, maybe all of this, is due to the sound design and OST work. It can't be understated. Realistically, the action sequences are rarely strong enough to support an action series, the characters and rarely strong enough to support a drama series, and the plot is too undiscovered to support an adventure/thriller series. But good sound work can do so much to subvert these issues.\\n\\n\\n\r\n[Overall: 6]\\n\\n",

Although, I have the same impression that it will be focused on fan service, moe, etc. Given that it shows in the art but as I saw the anime. I like how the anime is set to a different scene. As I watch many anime, I find it predictable that there have been always this festival or some common setting. Moving to that, at least the main protagonist tries to become stronger in each episode. Somehow, this anime is inspired by a game like characters are have level or classified. The seiyuu and theme song are fine. For fansof online games, maybe you will like this kind of anime.",

            "content": "The reviews I've seen for this anime have made me mad! Ahg! Full of fanservice? What? Maybe it's because I just got done re-watching some of Monster Musume, (Which is like all fan service). I don't get how people could say DanMachi has a lot of fan service! \r\nThere is a bit. But to say there is a lot is freaking crazy. \r\nThen there are the people saying it's full of cliches. As if that's a bad thing! It doesn't matter if something has cliches. It's the way the story is executed. And DanMachi is wonderful in execution. Some of these scenes brought me totears! And that isn't exactly a common occurrence for me. I could name the anime that have made me produce flowing tears on one hand! \\n\\n\r\nCliches are wonderful when they're done right. They can bring comfort due to their familiarity. \\n\\n\r\nBut it didn't even occur to me that it might have cliches until I saw people talking about it in reviews... \\n\\n\r\nThe video game setting has been becoming more common recently, is that what they're talking about? I love that sort of thing. And DanMachi is a special case, I love how it cuts out the reality portion and just gives us the game world. The main character isn't even a person from our world sent to their world. If anything that makes it not a cliche, or at least I would think so. But no. \\n\\n\r\nThis is one of those anime where the main character seems to have girls fall for him left and right. But come on, given everything that happens in this anime their reasons for liking him at least feel realistic. They range from hardcore love to small crushes and I understand each of them. \\n\\n\r\nIt doesn't feel forced like the girls in SAO did. \\n\\n\r\nNow, on the surface, it does seem like he's oblivious to their affections. But I don't know, I'd give them a point here and admit it was a cliche. But there's just something about Bell's body language that makes me think he knows what going on, he's just not sure what to do with it so he's trying not to focus on it... If that makes sense. \\n\\n\r\nIt's not so much a spoiler without the contexts. Or at least I hope not. But there's a scene where two of his closest friends. Hestia and girl No2. (let's make it vague so it's even less spoiler.) start fighting over Bell. He runs off to get away from their bickering for a bit and just outside he pauses to listen. He knows, there's no way he doesn't know. \\n\\n\r\nNot with that smile. \\n\\n\r\nBut enough of that. I don't watch these anime for that. I watch them for the fantasy worlds.\\n\\n\r\nI love all the small details that make the world feel even more real. I love the factions and the goddesses, I love the dungeon. It reminds me of a Playstation one games I started playing last week. Azure Dreams! The dungeon in DanMachi is a lot like that one. \\n\\n\r\nIn case you haven't heard of it, it's a lot like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon with a fantasy theme. I wouldn't be surprised if the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon games were inspired by RPGs like this. But I honestly wouldn't know. I might be into this stuff but the information around themis a total blank for me. lol\\n\\n\r\nI just play and watch 'em. haha.  \\n\\n\r\nA lot of video game anime have at least some connection to the real world. Some game anime take a lot of time away from the game world to be in the real world. Like Recovery Of An MMO Junkie! Hardly any gameplay was shown aside from standing around talking and sitting in a tree. \\n\\n\r\n(\u256c \u00d2 \u2038 \u00d3) WOW, That's like SOOOO exciting. NOT! \\n\\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I actually liked that anime. But I don't like it as a video game anime. It's trash as a video game anime. \\n\\n\r\nSometimes we see some fighting, especially at the start, but it's sooo unsatisfying compared to the stuff we see in DanMachi. \\n\r\n(\u0482\u2323\u0300_\u2323\u0301) But that's because the game isn't the main focus in that anime, it's the romance that they're interested in. They should be giving attention to both but they hardly try. \\n\\n\r\nWhen I watch a video game anime I want to actually see the VIDEO GAME! DanMachi gets that, it gets it so much that we don't even have a real world to take away from the video game world. \u03c3(\u2267\u03b5\u2266\uff4f)\\n\\n\r\nImagine, gamer friends, imagine if the world of a JRPG was a real place. That's what DanMachi explores, and it's great. That in and of itself might not be so rare, but an anime that takes place solely within a world of a game without a connection to the real world, without the main character being whisked away there, as far as I've seen is. \\n\\n\r\nIt's nice to have this kind of anime play out this way for once. I'd love to play a video game based on it. I'd love to see even more of this world. It isn't just some guilty pleasure anime. Not for me, it isn't. \\n\\n\r\nFor me, it's an inspiring story about a boy who lost everything and wants to become stronger. A boy no one saw any potential in until a goddess who understood how he felt gave him a chance to prove himself. \\n\\n\r\nEvery episode we see him fighting harder and harder to grow and to change and when we see him succeed it feels deserved. He isn't another OP anime character who out of no where has these god-like powers and one hits everything. \\n\\n\r\nHe's a guy who works for everything he has. He's a character that won't give up no matter what and it feels so good when he finally wins. Because we watched him work for it. \\n\\n\r\nthat's something a lot of anime forget. It takes effort to be the best. Sure, it can be fun to watch characters who are already the best take control of the situation and win. Like Shiroe from Log Horizon. He was an expert with the game before him and all the other players got trapped there. He's great, but wasn't anyone else curious about what it was like for him at the start as he was learning the ropes and improving? We don't get to see that side of him.\\n\\n\r\nBecause Bell is a new adventurer we get to watch him work his way up from the bottom.\\n\\n\r\nI don't get the hate. And I don't get how the hate managed to get upvoted to the top of the reviews. it's ridiculous. \\n\\n\r\n\u00af\\_( \u25c9 3 \u25c9 )_/\u00af But at the end of the day, every anime is a sack of shit or a masterpiece to somebody. It just happens to feel nicer when more people agree with you. \\n\\n\r\nStill, a seven score isn't half bad~! And a 7.83 at that! That's practically an eight.\\n\\n\r\nThis anime might have some bad reviews up at the top, but the score shows me it's far from being underrated. It would be too sad if that was the case.",

            "content": "This is one of the greatest animes I have ever seen. I have no idea why this anime is being rated so low and it pains me to see such a masterpiece being underappreciated. Sure, the quality isn't breathtaking and it seems like a simple enough story. But I assure you if you give it a chance you'll be begging for more. \r\nI've never written a review before on any anime. I like to think of myself as a lurker not really investing in any show and for the most part sticking to western tv. But every once in a blue moon I like tosettle down and heal my aching lonely heart with a little good old fashioned harem/romance. Don't judge me... or do, I really don't care.\\n\\n\r\nThat being said, let me lose my sh*t on this one.  I'm a sucker for gods. I don't care for your everyday anime gods, but the Greeks knew their stuff.  This anime has that feel. Raw godlike power, but also relatable.  Instead of flaunting their gifts the gods have sealed away their divinity and now live like humans, immortal but feeling and thinking like us.  This alone would call for a 5 star review but it gets better.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance is perfect. A Goddess falling in love with a human is only a background story going on. Giving us men a chance to focus on the battles and ever increasing strength and power of the seemingly weak main character. Although this isnt a harem it still has several similarities with them. There is almost no other male characters that have a chance and therefore is completely stress free and relaxing to watch.  Really enjoyable and smooth going down. Like a nice bowl of pudding.\\n\\n\r\nThe Goddess is ironically ungodly cute and although all the deities seem to be female even when logic would refuse to let that happen, it only seems to add an air of light heartedness.  With my 15 second attention span, my normal refusal to watch anything with subtitles and my crippling depression from too many cringe videoes on youtuve and a minor obsession with memes, I was STILL able to binge-watch the entire series. \\n\\n\r\nSimply put, there is NO insestual themes, no \"panty shots\", no cringe material to mention. I can't find fault with this!  I am a firm believer that anime is a sin against humanity.  Full metal alchemist, shuffle, Hellsing, and a few others are the exception. But this?  This is the Jesus to the world of evil. THIS is where God laid down an anime to take the sins of the others and say \"look here! Not every anime is a lifeless demon possessed, will to live taking, soul tainting, work of satan. Behold! I give unto man my son/anime to forgive and lead the way!\"\\n\r\nThat, is what I see when watching this work of heaven. It's like looking into the eyes of Harambe for the first time. Pure bliss!",

            "content": "A lot of people can't avoid comparing DanMachi to Sword Art Online. I can see where people recognize the similarity on these two. But the character progression better suit me, it always find a way to entertain you. Admittedly the fan service is jarring, but it does it most of the time to deliver a comedic scene which is fine by me.\r\nI come into this series expected to be entertain, not mesmerized. And I was entertained no doubt. DanMachi gets to the meat of the story all the time and didn't bother with filler, which is great for me. The story is cliched I agree,but it does it without trying to be something it isn't.\\n\\n\r\nDanMachi doesn't need to have amazing animation, yet on certain occasion it delivers on ridiculous amount of detail. Yes, on most scene it is just powerpoint slide level of animation, but when the scene requires it, the animation can be memorable. That being said, the background art is disappointing. Filled with dull colors and quite frankly if you put the characters on different background used it doesn't make a difference.\\n\\n\r\nLook this is an alternative to SAO which I find to be more enjoyable. If you find it important to always have story that leaves you pondering, characters that you can relate to, or any intellectual art you crave.. Go back. If you are looking for an entertainment while the next FMA is being made. This should be on your list.",

            "content": "Adapting Fantasy Light Novels into anime seems to be a current trend nowadays, and is a trend that has produced some extremely divisive anime in recent years. A lot of them mostly seem to involve either overpowered protagonists or an RPG like world. And a lot of them seem to be shameless cash grabs that act as an effective way to advertise the light novel. Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, or DanMachi which I\u2019ll be referring to it as for the review, doesn\u2019t follow these trends, to a certain extent. The biggest difference between DanMachi and some ofthe other shows that have come out during the post SAO boom is that it knows how to write a decent protagonist. \\n\\n\r\nUnlike most protagonists in this genre that are almost always overpowered teens (they\u2019re that way because of the impact a certain black swordsman had on the industry), DanMachi\u2019s protagonist, Bell Cranel has the audacity to be something that these other protagonists aren\u2019t, an actual character. Bell starts off as just another adventurer in the bustling city of Orario who also lives in his guild (alone) with his goddess Hestia in their run-down church. He seems content with his daily life until he meets a swordswoman that saves him from a Minotaur in the dungeon. He learns that she is one of the strongest warriors in the world and is a part of one of the strongest guilds. He then strives to get stronger so he can eventually be on the same level as the swordswoman (Aiz Wallenstein), who he has also fallen in love with. Even though it\u2019s simple, the story doesn\u2019t set out to be anything more than it is. It\u2019s a story about someone who wants to get stronger and do better so he can impress someone who is on a higher level than he is. Through his journey to become stronger, he begins to impact the people around him and gains new allies all with the goal to get on the same level as Aiz and her guild. You see him succeed and gain new abilities all through the act of training and never giving up. One of the best aspects of the show is how the only way he can get badass skills is by facing off against tough opponents and monsters. He actually has to TRY to get more powerful, unlike our favorite black swordsman whose progress we see off screen. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the best parts of the show happens in Episode 8 where Bell fights against an enemy that would have been a challenge for even the strongest of adventurers and succeeds. From his struggle, he attains his own personal skill that helps with his overall growth as a warrior. This fight scene shows how much Bell wants to get stronger so that Aiz can see him as an equal. His determination is relatable and admirable, especially since we see how far he will go just so that he will achieve his goal. \\n\\n\r\nThe importance of goals for any protagonist in any form of media is something that I feel is overlooked. A goal is essential in making good characters and a good story. A good example of this is comparing Big 3: Naruto, Bleach and One Piece. Naruto and Once Piece both have a goal that the main character wants to achieve throughout the whole series. Naruto wants to be the Hokage and Luffy is searching for the One Piece. These are both goals for the characters to achieve that also make room for how the story progresses. Naruto grows a lot throughout the series before he becomes Hokage and Luffy is still searching for the One Piece, which involves traveling the world and going on an abundance of adventures. Then we have Bleach, where the series protagonist, Ichigo doesn\u2019t have a goal that spans across the whole series other than protecting his friends, which is more situational rather than a plot point. After the first big arc of Bleach, the story keeps recycling old ideas and keeps the same main villain, all because that is the only way for Ichigo to grow, just by fighting stronger opponents and getting new powers. Because Naruto and One Piece have goals for the characters to achieve we see physical and mental growth as the story progresses. This point is more a part of Naruto since it\u2019s a better example of this compared to One Piece. While this may have nothing to do with DanMachi, I made this point to stress how important goals are to any type of fiction, and how much of a good thing it is that DanMachi has a good goal opposed to shows like SAO, Grimgar and The Asterisk War. They\u2019re not needed in everything of course, but they certainly help with shows like DanMachi, especially with creating a likable and relatable character. \\n\\n\r\nOne of the main reasons that DanMachi was ignored or written off by a lot of anime fans was not the fault of the story but the bland characters. While I do like his growth and effectiveness as a protagonist, Bell is also an extremely bland protagonist, personality wise. He\u2019s the generic nice guy that attracts all the ladies, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s just that it can be a problem since that archetype has been done to death in every single type of entertainment. It\u2019s the same personality trait that every protagonist of these kinds of shows have and it can get annoying after you\u2019ve seen a bunch of them. He does get a bit more confident near the end of the series and really shows his worth during the final few episodes of the series where he saves his unconscious party members from the dungeon, while still injured. It\u2019s times when shit hits the fan that Bell really shines and they also happen to be my favorite moments from the show. \\n\\n\r\nThe other main character in the show is Hestia, the goddess of Bell\u2019s guild. While she is the typical fan service character that is attracted to the protagonist, she never really comes off as annoying and her affection for Bell seems more genuine since they share a heart-warming bond with each other. Her jiggling tits can be distracting in most scenes and the fact that Bell seems completely unaware of her affection can get annoying, but that\u2019s more of a problem with the story rather than the character. The other sort-of main character is Aiz Wallenstein who acts as Bell\u2019s love interest and goal of the series. Going with the main theme of lack of originality, Aiz is the typical emotionless but curious badass swords woman character. While don\u2019t personally have a problem with these types of characters, they appear so much in these types of shows that it feels like they\u2019re all carbon copies of one another. For what this show is, she\u2019s fine and fulfills her role nicely, but her generic archetype seems like wasted potential especially if a little more effort was put into writing her as an actual character rather than a blank slate that\u2019s good at fighting. \\n\\n\r\nMy main problem with shows like this, and DanMachi especially is that if a little more effort was put into writing good characters, the shows wouldn\u2019t be hated by so many people. If Bell was more entertaining and Aiz was interesting, I wouldn\u2019t be here complaining, but the sad truth is while the story is simplistic but effective, little to no effort was put into writing good characters which brings the show down a lot in my opinion. It\u2019s the wasted potentional that bothers me the most, but that\u2019s more of the author\u2019s fault rather than the anime itself.\\n\\n\r\nOne of best parts about the characters is that they are all portrayed nicely by their respective voice actors. While I\u2019m more familiar with Dub actors rather than most Japanese seiyuu (I only really recognized Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who voices Bell), I can still say that every voice actor does an excellent job in their role. As for which version you should watch, since I watched this show subbed I would recommend that version, and I only say this because the dub is handled by Sentai Filmworks who don\u2019t have the best dubs. The soundtrack was decent if a bit forgettable, which isn\u2019t as much a problem since it worked well within the show and was far from terrible.\\n\\n\r\nAny show done by J.C. Staff (which is one of my favorite studios) always has great animation, and DanMachi is no exception. Every fight scene in the show is fast, fluid and enjoyable to watch and was one of the main reasons that the fight in Episode 8 was such a memorable moment. The character designs were also nice to look at including the main character, Bell whose signature white hair and red eyes are a nice addition so that he can be easily recognizable unlike every other black-haired teenager that is in almost every show now. The city of Orario is also designed nicely. It\u2019s a good sign for any show if the viewers would like to live in the world that they\u2019re watching, even if Orario is like every other fantasy city, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, especially with a show like this. \\n\\n\r\nDanMachi is the kind of show you\u2019d watch either to kill some time or if you\u2019re looking for a fun, enjoyable adventure show. It\u2019s let down by blandly written characters which can ruin decent story. Despite its flaws, it\u2019s still worth watching and is one of the better fantasy Light Novel anime to come out in recent years. If you want a light story with a little bit of fanservice, well animated action and a lot of heart, DanMachi should not be overlooked.\\n\\n\r\nFinal Rating: 7/10 \\n",

            "content": "Fun anime to watch with a couple of problems that tend to annoy me a fair amount.\r\n~~ SPOILERS ~~\r\nSo a couple things i would bring up is \r\n1. The character starts to get really powerful. The entire goal for the MC is to get as powerful as a very high level person.  Named Ais. She is as far as i know she is the most powerful person. Yet what took her a long time to get to where she is now the MC is able to get some giant ground in just a month or two. He is really powerful and it tends toget annoying in all forms of media. Including this.\\n\\n\r\nHis goal is to get more powerful than Ais. I would really like in the end if he has to face that he can't get as powerful as some and the Ais person still remains more powerful. I probably didn't explain this as well as i wanted.\\n\\n\r\n2. There is one of the most annoying things anything can have. A Harrem. If i remember their our 3 or 4 love interest. Harems are annoying and pointless. You will always get one character that certain audiences like more than an other but it will obviously never happen between them. There is also  never a time when the MC actually confesses his love to one of the women and they go out. Harems our one of the worse things in Manga or Anime.\\n\\n\r\n3. Finally. This show does not know the term Consistency. We have a MC going through tons ton crap and fighting all these high level enemies within a couple hours. He finally escapes. A couple days later after he is healed and rested he gets into a fight where the enemy is invisible. The enemy is the same level or lower and is able to destroy the MC with punches alone. This doesn't make any sense because he was just fight tons of Minotaur's little ago and now he can't even take a couple punches in a not to the death duel between him and another person with weaker gear. \\n\\n\r\n~~ SPOILERS OVER ~~\\n\\n\r\nOverall it's a fun show to watch and i also get the feeling when the show was green lit to be made that the producers sole purpose was to go and make what SAO should've been. The parallels between this and SAO is kind kind of weird. We have the same Voice actor as Kirito ( How ever you spell his name) Duel wielding swords and overpowered character. Only thing missing is for this MC to be a total asshole.",

I don't feel satisfied by the ending and like I said. The characters really needed to be worked on during the show. I also really want to know what happened after the \"end.\" So, overall. It's decent but really not enough content to keep some people happy.",

            "content": "Okay, Let me start off with this is my first review of an anime and I HAD to start on this one... \r\nThe Story is a typical weak main character that is loved by all (expect the bad guys) and works super hard to get stronger. Now, I have to say the setting is great.  I loved SAO (Sword Art Online) and this setting was no different, adventurers going into Dungeons and leveling up and obtaining higher level powers.  I found it interesting with the addition of the Gods and Goddesses, which was refreshing.  \r\nArt was good, typical is my opinion, nothingmore to say.\\n\\n\r\nSound - loved the music is was fun, intense at times and allowed the viewer to be enticed by each scene.  \\n\\n\r\nCharacter - Now, let me preface this with it was only a 13 ep season...\\n\r\nthe character development could have been existentially better.  I'm a sucker for the weak character growing and becoming popular with everyone when he shows just how powerful he can become.....but there NEEDED to be more. There are a number of anime that have this story line (and I love most of them!) but this development to me needed something.....extra to make this first season better.  The cliff hanger wasn't there for me; there needed to be another extra bite for me to keep wanting the second season. I will wait for the second season, but not on the edge of my seat.  \\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment - I loved watching this anime. I was looking and watching and waiting at every event and turn waiting for the next development.  \\n\\n\r\nOverall - Like I stated earlier I love this type of genre and will never stop!  It's a very predictable story line, but that doesn't stop it from being great! If you're into character development then you might be disappointed, but remember this is MY opinion and everyone likes different levels of development.  So to end my first review....good anime, I wish there was something else to add to the excitement of a second season, still a good watch, so set some time aside and watch it!\\n\\n\r\n-No_way_bro_",

            "content": "Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\r\nThe art style in this show is absolutely beautiful. It is very modern, and why shouldn\u2019t it be, as it came out just last summer. So not only does it look fantastic from an art standpoint, but from a emotional aspect, this show will pull on all of your heartstrings as the people endure hardship and trial after trial, the emotion is their eyes and their faces is so real and strong it takes the show to a whole new level. This with the pretty frequent use of blood, but not gore, shows thedepths of what each character is going through and how difficult things are getting. The differences in character design are pretty significant as well, the use of a multi-race culture made for some interesting, albeit generic, characters. Fanservice is pretty abundant when it comes to some of the main characters but that doesn\u2019t exactly mean bad, it is not over used and it is only readily apparent in the story in a few episodes so I wouldn\u2019t let it stop someone from watching it. However, I caution those who want to image search this show, because things can get raunchy fast.\\n\\n\r\nThe sound design and the music in this show are absolutely phenomenal. Both the opening and closing songs are catchy and the animation that goes with them is clean and clever, it really shows how connected all of the characters are. That being said, even the music used in battle scenes is fantastic because it invokes a real feeling that demands to be felt in that time. Now, I may have already been feeling that, but at the same time I cannot deny that it magnified the emotion 10x. Moving away from music, the sounds that we hear when things are happening are something that I don\u2019t hear very often in shows; the breaking of the rock being split, the differences in the punches thrown, it was so satisfying, and sometimes rage inducing to hear what I\u2019m seeing and takes me that much deeper into this world.\\n\\n\r\nThe story is not something to be written off. In fact, it is refreshingly original. While there are a few unanswered questions, as to how the system that they live in came about, but these are questions that when we are dropped into the middle of the life for these people we will have for sure. The whole story with the Familia and how each adventurer has a place in life and a Goddess to follow, it is something I haven\u2019t seen done before and I like to see it done this way. All in all we meet the aspiring adventurer Bell Cranel who is on the verge of death by a monster that should have been nowhere near where he was. But at the last moment the Sword Princess, Aiz Wallenstein, steps in and cuts the Minotaur in half, covering Bell in blood. He screams and runs back to his Goddess Hestia who realizes he has gained an ability that means he has fallen in love with Aiz without even realizing. Then as the series goes on Bell is working to catch up with Aiz, showing his unconditional kindness to people that do not deserve it, and beating every odd put up against him, this is extremely important because he, wants to be a hero, he wants to save the girl, he wants to protect his friends.\\n\\n\r\nFirst, the title of this show made it seem like Bell was going to be this salty guy trying to pick up all the women he could find, however I was presently surprised to know that Bell was actually an underdog who can\u2019t hardly talk to a girl he likes, outside of his Hestia. We do learn later on in the show where the title comes from, but that is better left unsaid. Even as the show would go on and on I felt that he was kind of a wimp, but I loved his determination and his spite because it is a drive that I also share. Now I\u2019m not trying to become a fairy tale hero, but I know that when I want something to happen, then I get it done. When the main characters are in distress and you see the absolute lowest of the low that humanity can take to get what they want, it makes my stomach churn and tighten when we watch people that are clearly deserving getting beaten near death, and you want to scream into the darkness of the cave \u201cBell! SAVE HER!\u201d While it might not always be a girl alone, it still is how a person like me would react. Or when Bell would be the one under attack, the show makes you hate the attackers so much for being cheap and being completely consumed by jealousy and their inferiority to Bell. But after this entire scene Bell still shows the kind of grace that I strive to have. This is a show that sparks emotion both good and bad and I love it when a show makes me feel this way. The characters are memorable and their relationships are fun to watch play out, even if some lead to just dead ends or are forgotten. It is the type of show that makes you want to take a plunge back into an RPG, and be a hero again. Sadly only with a spinoff series following the Sword Princess on the horizon, we might not see much of Bell Cranel in the future. Still the show makes me want to be that hero, but more than that I would strive to be better than a hero, but to be an Argonaut.\\n\\n\r\nOverall Score: 9.9/10",

But the action i found to be enjoyable, i found myself rooting for bell and the blonde swordsman. but my favorite part is the setting, i loved SAO, i loved tower of druaga, i basically love any anime that's about dungeons, monster hunting, and actually having your skills as numbers. Considering the title, and the other reviews, it seems to me that the other reviewers were expecting something completely different when they started watchingthe anime, completely ignoring the title. It isnt about the action, despite it being enjoyable, it isnt even really about suspense, or plot, despite myself seeing it all in it, this anime is a love story, everything else comes second. Maybe i have low standards, my review could also be biased because this is my favorite genre, but i want a second season.",

The title should have been an immediate red flag saying \"DO NOT WATCH THIS\" but for whatever reason I ignored it and found that, hey, it turns out the title is really misleading! This isn't about picking up girls, it's about a kid trying to become a hero! What a relief. It's a shame it didn't continue to surprise me by being really good.\r\nI will say to this series' credit, it's got some of the best visuals of anything I've ever seen. The animators did a fantastic job on DanMachi, kudos tothem. I admit, there were some points where I thought this was going to end up being a great series, but it always fell flat for me. The story was decent for the most part and the characters were generally okay (I liked Bell but nobody else's character really got a chance to develop by the end), but the pacing was terrible. Some episodes it felt like way too much was happening, and some episodes it felt like nothing was happening. Then the finale comes around, no spoilers here but it just felt like a total cop-out. I didn't get the sense that anything was happening for any real reason besides \"it's the finale and we need a big exciting climax!\"\\n\\n\r\nIt seemed to be setting up for a second series, and I would be surprised if there wasn't one, but I don't think I'll be watching it. I didn't dislike DanMachi by any means, but it was rarely anything more than \"fine\".\\n\\n\r\ntl;dr DanMachi is not bad but it's not particularly good either. If you're thinking about watching it, I wouldn't bother.",

            "content": "Danmachi as I'm gonna call this ridiculously titled anime very quickly falls into the overused sorry plot of overly optimistic young boy who refuses to ever give up on anything or anyone overcomes impossible obstacles for no apparent reason outside of being the protagonist in an adventure/harem anime. I noticed a number of other reviews touch on this as well and to put it simply it's because it's true the plot is sorry and lazy. This series breaks no ground whatsoever but for this seemingly monstrous flaw what is quickly and easily over looked is that it refines and prefects everything* else.\r\nWhere this series reallystarts to shine is it's attention to detail, from the venders to the environment nothing is just there for the sake of convenience. The armors differ in style from character to character and any wall or building may be broken in the heat of a fight. It borrows a nearly exclusively from the RPG level progression and crafting systems where there are guidelines for what each person should or shouldn't do if they wish to stay alive buying better armor and equipment is vital to progressing.\\n\r\nThe combat is beautiful and rich where frequently the weapons are knocked out of characters hands or broken in battle but as apposed to leaving themselves wide open while trying to regain their particular weapon it is far more likely that a character will try to take an enemy's weapon and kill him with it. The fighting is also quite bloody as them protagonist is regularly soaked from head to toe in blood both his and monsters, which provides a nice contrast to the clean polished visuals of the often cutesy cast. \\n\r\nThe series also does the GetBackers thing where most everybody starts off as a rival or enemy and later becomes an ally true the mindless goodwill other the lead character. Which is also where the harem element sets in nearly every girl falls for him though it doesn't seem as contrived as in most anime as he is an inherently adorable individual. As he slowly gathers other party members they take on more intense foes though more of the fights are won through teamwork or dumb-luck than an overwhelming power. It's since of comradery is the gem at the core though every character has their own purposes for adventuring and their own setbacks which lead to mistakes and weaknesses in the groups. It's that which gives it so much of it's dynamic and that which leads it to be more than it appears.\\n\r\nIt;s not about what this show does that's new that makes it good as it does nothing new but it refines all of it's elements in ways that are normally overlooked that make this show great. I loved it and would recommend this to anyone.",

However, this only pushes him to become stronger. It is interesting to watch as Bell becomes stronger and defeats stronger enemies. Each episode will leave you excited for more!\r\nThe art was amazing and very nice to watch. The character designs are all unique and polished. Each one has a specific style and flare!\r\nThe characters throughout theseries kept up the excitement and kept the story fresh without flooding the series with unnecessary backstories.

            "content": "I'm not exactly going to join the chorus of haters whose reviews are flagged more useful than this one, but I can't hold the line against them either.\r\nThis is what should be an inspiring story of heroism and personal growth that's marred by stupid cliches, creepiness, laziness, and a virgin-killer sweater.\r\nThe TL;DR is that this story fails at the most fundamental level: TELL ME A STORY!\r\nBell is not as bland and featureless as most harem heroes--of course, neither are most harem heroes. They're just all meek and mild and can't say no to anyone, which gives the impression of being bland and featureless, while inreality they're doormats who hurt everyone by being blandly nice to them. Bell adds to this a ridiculous painful shyness around the woman he actually likes (you can tell who that is because it's the only woman with whom he has basically no relationship to speak of). I don't mind that lots of women are interested in him; in a world of jerks, he's actually a nice guy, and he's doing some pretty impressive things. It's not unrealistic that this would get him some attention. Of course the women would want to talk with him; of course the men would see him as competition (though let's be honest, a lot of the women would see him as competition too). The issue is that he has no idea of how to talk to people. So he doesn't talk to people. So the charm ought to wear off pretty quickly, like when you see that cool guy across the room, go up and talk with them, and it turns out they're boring.\\n\\n\r\nThe other flaw with this characterization is a certain scene involving napping in which our Nice Guy acknowledges a previously totally unrecognized creepy side, and somehow has an internal struggle about whether to act on it. Please. NOTHING in the rest of this man's characterization would suggest he would even consider acting on it. And at the very least he's intelligent enough to know that it would be social suicide if he did.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, the harem is awfully frustrating. There's maybe three, four characters that have more pronounced crushes than passing interest. And that's what they are--crushes. They just want his attention (or possibly his money and free labor...). But the squabbling, led by everyone's favorite Clingy Jealous Goddess, just gets tedious, and becomes an excuse for a lot of pandering to the viewer that feels cheap and insulting. And enough with the fan-service. We have a freaking Internet, if I want to watch cartoon boobies I can go find actual porn.\\n\\n\r\nLook I am all about the love triangles/polyhedra. I will ship a furniture documentary if I think that ottoman really loves the sofa and you can show me why they belong together. But there's gotta be some actual romance there. Nobody involved in this seems to have a motivation other than competitiveness and attention-seeking, and I don't really care which lunch table Bell sits at. Relationships founded on \"I really need attention and you're enough of a pushover that you'll endlessly provide it\" are as unsatisfying to watch as they are to be in.\\n\\n\r\nWhat else... the vast majority of the conflicts have entirely too low stakes. I mean we use all the shonen battle anime tricks to try to raise the stakes--monsters power up, become invincible, smash things, rocks fall, swords break, speed-lines happen, special attack names get shouted, etc. But none of that matters, because no one watching this has the slightest bit of doubt that Bell will prevail through his Magic of Prevailing or whatever the excuse is this episode. None of it is earned through hard work (other than a stubborn dedication to the ideal of Best-ness). We get a couple training scenes but there's never the impression that he's actually working hard for this. And more importantly, none of his victories are ever paid for with sacrifice. He doesn't have to give up anything to become greater than what he is. Where's the drama in that?\\n\\n\r\nThe worldbuilding--it's fine. I mean it's stupid, and a little cringey to hear people explicitly talking about someone's level, but I'll roll with it if there's a good story. There just isn't.\\n\\n\r\nAt the end of the day, this is 13 episodes of what really could have been a training montage on the way to the actual arc of the story. What is it Bell wants to do? Impress a chick? Build a familia? Save the world? Get elected dog-catcher? NOBODY KNOWS. So we're stuck watching him grind out levels. And the show becomes \"Is it wrong to screw around in a dungeon trying to get enough exp and geld to be better able to screw around in a dungeon some more?\"\\n\\n\r\nI would be happy to watch this if there were a weighty choice between a couple plausible romance interests with earnestly developed relationships. I'd be happy to watch this if Bell's victories came at a cost. I'd be happy to watch this if we were moving toward something. But Slice of Life of your favorite JRPG is better done with Let's Play videos.\\n\\n\r\n...all that said... real S2 when?",

            "content": "So, this is my first review on this site.  I've done some personal write-ups on my personal blog before but this anime convinced me to post here.\r\nOverall, I loved the story.  I literally planned to casually watch this as a filler type series while between Photoshop assignments and work.  Instead, I ended up binge watching this straight through in one day.\r\nThat's how much I loved the story.  However, the ending made me feel very \"wtf\", as I do not read manga.  After watching this series I can only say that this had to be aimed at people reading the mangato continue the story, because everything built up in the last episode then it ended so frigging abruptly.  Unfortunately I cannot say why in this review without giving spoilers, and the rules to the right here say not to do that, so I will leave it at that.\\n\\n\r\nTruly this is an outstanding anime.  And literally the only possible complaint I could find on it was indeed the fact that at the end it seemed to not have any \"wind-down\", like what happens with friendships/etc.  I did get excited at first because the way it ended I was like, \"Oh, cool, there has GOT to be more episodes or a second season\", but from what I understand the second season is pretty much a repeat of the first season but now we're looking at it from another character's perspective.  No other episodes exist besides those two seasons.\\n\\n\r\nWith that said, I still give the story, art, sound, character and enjoyment a solid 10.  Because that is truly my experience.  Overall I gave an 8 because the sudden end without closure sent me wailing on Google Searches for a season that's just not out there.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are looking for a great anime based on gaming with some romance involved, you will love this.  Despite the sudden ending, which again is probably attributed to the fact that I do not read manga, this is an outstanding show.  In fact, watching it has made me decide to subscribe to an MMO I haven;t played in forever, so on that note I sign off and say thanks for the awesome show.",

Everything in this anime is simply terrible. The characters' development are mediocre, and you can't even enjoy the series quite well as everything inside it sucks. Perhaps the only good thing is this anime was Bell fighting the minotaur... Nothing else.\r\n     By watching Sword Oratoria, I tend to think even more than I already thought before, that Ais Wallestein shoulda been the main protagonist. Seriously, I don't readthe manga or stuffs like these to see if Bell Crannel's story can actually be far interesting, but if it's, it was poorly adapted. I think the company would have earned more if they started the anime with Wallestein's story, as it is way more explained, and far more developed than this sorryful excuse of anime. I had dropped it long time ago, and I regret myself cotinuing it. I'm sorry if I'm being too harsh, but perhaps even Yosuga no Sora has more story than this, and I'm not even kidding.\\n\\n\\n\r\n     If you want to watch something interesting related to this, go watch Dungeon ni Deai: Sword Oratoria. It is supposed to be a side story, showing what was happening to Ais whilst she wasn't near Bell Crannel. But it's far, far more interesting, and the story is way more developed and explained. I never thought I'd been writing about an anime saying it's original content is surpassed by a side story, but in the case of Dungeon ni Deai, it is. Enjoy yourself with it, and not this sorry excuse of anime we have here.\\n\\n\r\n      PS: However, even so, Sword Oratoria has some flaws as well. Firstly some unnecessaries yuri scenes, and secondly, it develops well only from episode 04 onwards. But even so, give it a shot! I bet you won't regret.\\n\\n",

Almost every female character has a crush on bell and it kind of seems cliche'd and the MC has a mysterious ability that allows him to become very strong in the limited amount of time.\\n\r\nWhen I watch an anime I naturally envision myself as the MC , naturally( although overrated ,) I loved the anime. \\n\\n\r\nIt is pretty obvious that the creators havent given us the last and there is still more to come, depending on the rest (if it will come,) the anime cannot be satisfactorily critiqued.\\n\r\nThe antagonist is apparently the goddess of beauty(I didnt acre enough to remember the name) and she plays a rather subtle role in the anime. There are ties and backstorys that need to be said, and they didnt focus on Hestia's or Aiz's past.\\n\\n\r\nIf you enjoy the girls falling in love with the MC and the MC becoming stronger very fast and becoming the hero then this is the anime for you.\\n\r\nI like that sort of thing and therefore loved it.If I enjoy an anime I tend to overlook even the obvious faults.\\n\\n\r\nIt really does need a second season for it to fully emerge .\\n\r\nIn a nutshell , this anime is not everyone's cup of tea, but it can be pretty sweet to some who enjoy it.\\n\r\nYou should really think before you start up on this or you might regret it later on.\\n\\n\\n\r\nOpinions to improve my reviews are welcomed.",

The overall atmosphere is generally light and often comical; the anime is at its best when it's showing us more of the world, the dungeon, or the family mechanics.\r\nAlthough the setting is excellent, the main character is disappointing. Like so many other shonen anime, the main character is unfairly amazing, and is worshiped or loved by a growing array of followers. Perhaps the main character is redeemed by hisnaive but pure desire to be an Argonaut.\\n\\n\r\nIf you are interested in RPGs, classical mythology, and lighthearted enjoyment, I recommend this anime. If you are looking for challenging characters and thought-provoking plot, look elsewhere.",

            "content": "DanMachi is a fun anime.  There are not long or deep narratives to wrap your head around.  You don't even have to really watch each episode to know what is going on if you jump in the middle of an arc.  It is easy to dislike the show for what it is, a cliche harem adventure anime with cool stuff thrown in, a recipe for enjoyment.  For me personally, that is all I need to consider an anime to be good.  If you delve into character developments so long and convoluted that you have to take notes like you arein some kind of lecture hall, you are looking for the wrong kind of show.  \\n\r\nThe story is what any pure adventure story should be, the kid wants to be the very best to achieve greatness.  Throw obstacles and more goals in his way to create a sense of character development and you have a sturdy framework that fight scenes and boob jokes can be attached to. \\n\r\nThe art is great.  The characters have a wardrobe that changes often and each character's equipment was cool and well put together. I personally would love to cosplay as Bell if I had the time to put to it.  The city are full of meticulous detail.  The art for the dungeon definitely was focused on key scenes and the final episodes however. I wasn't as impressed by any special details or work put into the dungeon where most of the show took place.\\n\r\nThe soundtrack is excellent.  I liked this soundtrack better than almost any other anime for mood setting and general ambiance.\\n\r\nThe characters are plain.  I cannot argue that.  If you want more character development in the anime and it is the only reason you don't want to watch this, then just 'head cannon' the hell out of it.  I personally like to imagine Bell is dealing with more inner struggle with the girls he is stuck between and is realizing that Aiz may not be what he is looking for. But I do admit the fact that every girl in the anime wants Bell is quite annoying and one of the reasons I often dislike an anime.\\n\r\nIgnoring some of the random oddities that make me shake my head at times, I can enjoy this show more than almost other I have seen.  I can sit down after watching something that truly made me feel unwell (ecchi harem anime recommended by a friend) and remember that there are some anime that are just fun to watch.\\n\r\nIn the end, I wish there was more DanMachi to come, but I know this is just another show for some easy money.  I enjoyed this show greatly and re-watch it often when I am in the mood for some adventure.",

Yes the anime is cliche, but it makes it work. The main character is not a three dimensional character at all and most times it seems like he falls under the cliche category hero, but through this you'll find yourself adored by his selflessness and awkwardness. The females he encounters are the opposite. I find that once you look deeper and past the boobs, you'll find characters that have motivation for every single one of their action with their charactersbecoming more and more intricate as their histories are unveiled. No this is not a perfect anime, but it was an entertaining one.",

Overall if you're looking for something simple to watch with a good bit of light fan service this is fine.\r\nThe story is fairly confusing in a meta way because it blends elements of a more traditional fantasy (gods, heros) with the RPG style story (hunting monsters for crystals which are valuable).  From the actual story itself this is quite simple and seems to be mainly a way to provide the bland characters something to do.\r\nIt's a typical story of some newbie who is destined to be the best of the best, and the girls who worship him.  Theharem aspect is middling strong, and our MC is the typical bonehead who can't seem to tell that he has a dozen or so women panting after him, although at least we don't get entire episodes devoted to just the harem fighting each other.",

            "content": "So because sb (Tallon) recommended it I'll try to review this show from my perspective. People expecting a well written review, please go on.\r\nThere are many animes where you could say you're not really sure how to rate the show, in a good or in a bad way, but I think DanMachi is special at this.\r\nTo start with the basics:\r\nOn the one hand we have too much ecchi in this show, in terms of boobs and some fan service scenes like the typical bath thing, or struggling who's getting the main char and \"pressing\" his arms over this (they should've added harem as tag). Thebackground story of many side characters is left aside even though it would've made sense to show why they're acting the way they're doing and not only showing a short retrospect at best, leaving some very potential characters who could've told a nice story in the dark.\\n\r\nWe also, beside this described fanservice have \"goddes\" Hestia, which will, I guarantee it, get on your nerves as soon as you've passed half of the story.\\n\\n\r\nOn the other side we have very nice couple, consisting of Aiz and Bell. Bell, the main protagonist is drawn out okay, and believable as the person he's shown to be. Aiz's background is never shown during the whole 13 EPs, but I really started to love her as a person, though you never get to know what's really going on in her mind. Aiz seems to be an airhead at least for romances, because every time things like dates are mentioned she's asking what's meant. I think she would've been a good main char.. (you see the problem ?)\\n\\n\r\nThe problem with the love story here is that this annoying little brat Hestia, always interferes, when there would be a chance to progress like visiting a god damn town together. Though Hestia itself is presented as a 14 year old brat which is supposed to be a god, with cup size D. So besides them congratulating each other about their progress, there's no real thing that, thanks to Hestia, could happen or really develop.\\n\r\nSo the love story never really settles down, what's left then ?\\n\r\nOnly the progress in getting better in skills and strength, and a never really explained god, level and dungeon system.\\n\r\nEven those gods, sticking to the facts, *shouldn't* use their powers on earth, and you're never getting to know why their even existing or for what they or their powers are good.\\n\\n\r\nIn the end I've to ask JC Staff what they wanted to present here.\\n\r\nA love story ? Well it never really develops any further. A story of progress ? Or the kind of plot that pops up during the last 2-3 EPs and some new characters, besides a grand \"villain\" who's never explained or shown doing more then laughing.\\n\\n\r\nAt this point I've to compare DanMachi with SAO, I'm sorry for people of both sides, but this has to be done.\\n\r\nSAO and this show are delivering a rank up and skill system in a fictional world, though DanMachi's world is real for the chars. Both are having a fighting couple and both are rushing in terms of their story.\\n\r\nDanMachi also shows very good fight scenes and does it even better then SAO, because pain is existing in this world and shown as such, making it easier to feel for the characters. The main couple in DanMachi is also older then in SAO, at least I would guess so according to their way of acting and things said in the show, while SAO shows 16 and 17 years old teenagers, I can't really feel with that good.\\n\r\nSo there are some things DanMachi really does better then SAO. Even more the fact that the main hero isn't better or getting better by interfering with the fights of the heroine, leaving her in the dust, but by letting him trying to catch up.\\n\r\nBUT SAO has A: a finishing love story, B: a finishing storyline besides and C: throws more light on the side characters (I'm judging based on SAO I, I've dropped II halfway.)\\n\r\n(24 EPs SAO vs 13 EPs DanMachi, I'm sorry JC Staff that you got only granted that much for the show!)\\n\\n\r\nConclusion:\\n\r\nSome very well drawn fights, a growing up story, too much ecchi and some annoying characters. Mixed with some poorly drawn out side chars and an unknown point of what the show really wanted to deliver.\\n\r\nFor one part I would watch a second season, hoping for more Aiz and Bell, but being honest and honest to myself this show kinda f*cked up midway. I would still recommend it, but don't expect too much.\\n\r\nProbably, if you're reading up the information on MAL (there seems to be more information about the world, origins etc), the show simply would've been better with more EPs, not trying to stuff all of this into 13 episodes.\\n\\n\r\nI really would've wished for that, the idea, setting and especially the couple has some potential, which *could* be kinda fixed with a second season.",

But i wont get into detail here, The Story  plot is Incredible MUNDANE, the character development is worse than Guilty Crown, if you can call it Character development. There are a FEW interresting characters but the story that evolve around them makes it so outright BAD. I mean, if you complete the series you would think, \" is this it ? \" it felt like almost nothing has happended at all, and people overhyped it ALOT. I felt like i got cheated when i watched it. The interresting part of the series likecharacter skills and dungeons dont have allot of focus at all. barely any if.  The Art is pretty fairly acceptable though.

Low brow mindless entertainment. It is not trying to be intelligent. You will not find highly interesting well developed characters. You will not find a massively innovative story line. Quite simply because these are not needed to accomplish its target.\r\nDnD is meant to be mindless fun entertainment for a young to middle-aged audience with at-least a tentative knowledge of MMORPG\u2019s and at this I think it Succeeds. Yes theStory is goofy, the characters partly feel like they have bean lifted straight out of Sword art Online and the entire show is caked in Fan service. But for some this is exactly what is needed to relax and wind down between more serious shows.\\n\\n\\n\r\nVerdict:\\n\\n\r\nComment: Decent-Good Low brow filler. \\n\r\nPros: Well animated, Decent Voice acting (original), entertaining\\n\r\nNeutral: bland Characters, World is basically an MMORPG, Fan service \t\\n\r\nBad: Predictable plot, Plot armour is a thing, plot conveniences galore\\n",

            "content": "his is a world like in games, like in Log Horizon but instead of players from earth, we have a full pledge non player characters with thinking capacities, like any normal human beings. Not only is there monsters, goblins ogres but there are gods in the mix. Did I mention there are elves as well? Yup, it is a complete ingredient classic fantasy and as a fan of that, there is no way I'm going to let that series by, though I'm kind of late to start.\r\nBut above all else, I like the tournament like challenges that every adventurer has to take, by level, asthey go up, monster's ferociousness goes with it. It becomes super duper difficult, and only the strong and tested go there, and it's shown that many die as they try this.\\n\\n\r\nI also liked the music, open theme and close theme, and sound effects, and the animation is clearly better than average. I'm not that a professor in sounds and animation but there is that much difference in which the ordinary could tell.\\n\\n\r\nAs for the characters, well.... What could I say, the hero's character lack imagination. It is similar to the many characters that's been done over and over. And it is one of those annoying type. The one that stammers when explaining, allllll the time. I get that you have to show and it's one of his character, but it doesn't need to span minutes, I should guess he'd calm down from that point when he stammered. He is a coward. He knows this and the girl he likes knows this. But he faces them when friends and himself are endanger or are in the corner, or when he wants to prove himself. Though I kind of debate the reason for him wanting to be strong landing in the romance's field, I think that could happen. He is a kid, young and immature, so it may be normal.\\n\\n\r\nsince as per plot, adventurers must be under a god/goddess to gain power. And so at some point, a goddess, whose elementary size body with unproportionate boobs make her a likely one, found this boy, and thus begins their adventure. A lot of promise for the hero, being recognized, and etcetera.\\n\\n\r\nIt's kind of dumb. There are parts, important situation, where characters just go unthinking, when the solution is so obvious. Why would she not give this to fight that? And after a realization/decision/outcome that we so obviously know would happen, there is a high tendency that some would be bored. I did so I just fast forward at some part, and that is the fail of the series. At the later part, last quarter of the series, there was no movement, it was all the same, fighting, fighting, witnesses, narrator. Perhaps that's just normal since it's a part of the adaptation, not the whole story, and so they stick at the climax part that would fit on a 13 episode series.\\n\\n\r\nBut all that is not the worst, it's those part where characters just so happens to be there, that part where it's just an accident that he/she 's there. And every time that happens, automatically, I'd think what are the odds?? huh...\\n\\n\r\nStill, I'm a fan for worlds that revolve around the classic fantasy, with elves and magic, and that kind of tipped the scale for me in finishing the series. And it's not like the plot is bad. It is interesting. Though I think not all would think this be good. (obviously...)\\n",

Your typical fantasy dungeon anime, with a very very predictable plot and actions done by the characters. The MC is so spoonfed by the author. Many characters appeared at last minute, but Ais Wallenstein who appeared in the first ep didn't even appeared on the last ep. Wtf. And also, the dialogue of all characters are so cringy.The \"comedy\" scenes are so drag and messed up. It is an anime made for kids. Your typical cliche harem shit. Your typical soft-hearted MC with a very strong power which he himself didn't even knew about it. Your typical kid anime where the villains turn to the good side at the end. Your typical kid anime where nobody dies at the end and of course, the MC takes the spotlight by showing something flashy and taking the last hit of this so called Boss. And oh, I forgot, your typical kid anime where the MC is hurt or losing hope and some flowery words make him woke up or become stronger. Piece of cornshit. The actions are so shit. Its just all slashes and everything die. For god's sake. I can't even watch the whole series straight without interruptions. My brain can't keep up with everything messed up with this show. So boring and cliche af. The OPs and EDs are so bad. I don't even know why this anime is so popular in Mal when all it has are giant boobs harem with a spoonfed MC. Its just a poor anime for me. To compare this, I hate SAO and konosuba, but Sao and konosuba are way better than this. Can't score 6 because my \"6\" are animes that I dropped. I didn't drop this, so my score would be \"7\". The only thing I like is the character design of Bell. The rest? Just meh.",

It threw all those chances away.  I like isekai as a genre, and I like its tropes, but there's just too much shit here.  \r\nIgnoring fanservice, which isn't a plus or minus inherently, the core flaw of this series is pacing.  Everyone has seen the same tropes before, in series following very similar story arcs to this.  But each episode drags out these tropes to an agonizing degree.  At some point, everyone knows exactlywhat's going to happen, but before they do the show should already have gotten the entire event over with.  It doesn't.  It drags and drags and drags.  \\n\\n\r\nInter-character interaction could have been deep, even in the limited plot.  The best known character (who everyone just calls loli bigboobs because who can be assed to remember her name?) actually has some depth.  Not a ton, but more than any other character in the series, and many other characters in many other series.  One would imagine this means she gets more time in the spotlight, doing things and moving plot along.  But nope.  Gotta drag out that one getting-ready-to-hit-something frame!",

            "content": "This was great~ tbh, I started watching this bc someone dared me to, and i seriously thought this woulnd\u2019t be the kind of anime I\u2019d like at first. Apparently, I was wrong~\r\nBasically, this anime is like an MMO except turned into real life! It\u2019s cool! I also really like Bell\u2019s design~! Normally, in an anime like this, the protagonist is a dark-haired kid who\u2019s rather boring-looking and starts out as ordinary Gary-Stue but ends up becoming the best of the best. The hairstyle is commonly the same, too! Neat and slightly messy. Bell has white hair, red eyes, and a hairstyle that\u2019s more unique! Stillhas a slight clich\u00e9 touch to it, though - yk, that messy part of his hair. He also does have the same ordinary-becomes-extraordinary and Gary-Stue kind of character, but for once, it feels like that ordinary-becomes-extraordinary part actually has enough reason! Maybe it\u2019s cause I haven\u2019t watched enough anime like this, but it\u2019s a nice change~! Really, for once, the reason wasn\u2019t sheer extreme determination. Partially, yes, but it\u2019s like this anime acknowledges that even determination has its limits! Also, Bell IS a Gary-Stue with the common traits (excessively kind, pessimistic, humble, has a harem, relatively shy, etc) but I definitely like him~! Oh! And not to mention, he seems to be deemed as an ordinary and/or cute kid! It\u2019s a lot more understandable for the girls to like him, haha, since he\u2019s that cool and kind and seems like the kind of character that would look cute to others.\\n\\n\r\nOk, enough about Bell\u2019s character. I also personally dislike/hate the title. It makes Bell seem like a hoe! And makes the anime sound like a bad harem anime! At least make the girls part of it singular! A much better title would be Familia Myth, sheesh.\\n\\n\r\nI also don\u2019t like how off-track the anime tends to seem in terms of Bell\u2019s determination to get to Aiz\u2019s level. Sure, the anime\u2019s about his adventures, but his main motive is literally to get to Aiz\u2019s level the entire time. Yet, there are times where he doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s caring for it at the moment. How comfortable Bell seemed to get with Aiz during training, too... that was pretty uncomfortable to watch. How can someone go from \u201cintense and uncontrollable fanboying at the mere sight of his crush\u201d to \u201ci have a huge crush i can easily act normal around\u201d in just a matter of an hour or two? However long it was? I\u2019m also not fond of Hestia\u2019s character... she\u2019s really just a big-boobed loli brat who\u2019s too non-murderous yandere over Bell. Not that I hate her, tho, I actually like her fine. I also like how realistic the society is! It\u2019s not an incredible lot, but somewhat, which is definitely good! Or maybe its just me being tired with SAO\u2019s.\\n\\n\r\nBlah blah blah... basically, this anime has its own set of clich\u00e9s as an action adventure harem anime, yet is slightly more unique than several others of its kinds. You should give it a try!",

            "content": "Hey this is my first review! I just thought I'd chime in and make a review for this anime, as seeing some of the highlighted reviews I think they're highly unjusitified and I'll be explaining to you why.\r\nFirst of all, I'll give my personal experience with this anime. (I'll try and keep this review as spoilers free as I can.)\r\nQuick note: For the people calling this anime a lewd fest and saying it's all about big boobs and heavily sexualized you couldn't be anymore wrong. I hope if you're looking to start this anime you read this review because it might convince you to blockout the petty reviews that are so harsh on the anime for all the wrong reasons. \\n\\n\r\nStory: So the story for me never actually became stale nor boring. There was only two episodes for me that had irritating pacing, but thankfully they're towards the start of the series and they aren't really that drastic a.k.a it's nothing worth getting upset about in my honest opinion. Honestly the plot was consistantly on point. I'm extremely picky with the plot with an anime as I like to know if I'm just wasting my time or not, but the plot kept getting better and better. The story is very solid and introduces more and more each episode, it's never repetitive and gives you a breath of fresh air every episode you watch. I don't want to throw salt into SAO watchers, but this is honestly what SAO should of been like. This is the plot SAO should of stuck with; you die, thats it. I'm glad to see another anime carry the legacy of an 100-floor level styled anime and really make it work. \\n\\n\r\nArt: I'll keep this short and sweet, but I'm a HUGE sucker for this type of art-style. It's so smooth and clear I honestly throughout the entire series had no issues with the animation quality. Animation quality never decreased it stayed consistant throughout the entire seires in my personal opinion if not got better in some of the future episodes which is quite rare for anime I must admit. \\n\\n\r\nSound: Oh boy the sound. The soundtrack for this anime is honestly a gem. I felt so immersed by the soundtrack and I didn't get bored of it at all. For me sound is one of the most important aspects of an anime as I want to feel the impact of certain scenes and I honeslty can't grasp any sort of emotion in specific scenes if the soundtrack isn't on point and for me personally this anime delivers. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: Alright so this is where it gets a bit intresting. The characters that get introduced are intresting and always have something unique about them. The main protaganist Bell Cranel is very likeable and he's honestly grown on me so much. His character development isn't over-rushed nor super-slow. I feel like they convey a lot of thought into these characters in this anime and you'll come to like them all. The reason this gets an 8 in my honest opinion is because I feel like they're taking an exteremely harem route in this anime. I don't have an issue with harem in anime; but (SPOILER ALERT: they shouldnt make the protagnist fall in love with the femlae main character and then push it aside.) I could be wrong seeing as Season Two has been anounced and it could take away the harem vibe, but we'll have to wait and see.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: There was never a dull moment in this anime. There was no 'barable' episode, every single episode was different and stood out to me. I binge watched this within a single day thats pretty much how much I enjoyed this anime. It's not complicating and It's not too simple. If you're looking for an anime you feel like you could binge watch, this one is for you.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: This anime is basically a improved, more intresting version of SAO Season 1 and manages to not over-rush things like SAO did and actually gives the characters the character development they needed. It honestly has beautiful scenary and amazing character design choices and if you just honestly look past the parts with the sexual tension/teasing it's so great cause it isnt even a huge apsect within the anime and people find an excuse to dig at it. This anime and SAO have a simular plot like as in you die in the dungeon you die thats it. Also theres a tower to climb which has 100 floors in both animes. Only issue is that this anime actually paces it well and SAO goes overboard and rushes through tower levels, which to me is so messy. \\n\\n\r\nOverall, YES WATCH IT! I promise you, you wont regret it!",

            "content": "A great anime with a second season coming. DanMachi has character and heart, as well as the right amount of fan service. On a serious note, this show really is enjoyable to watch. Bell is a really good mc, as he is neither really weak nor really strong, he isn't literal god on earth (like Kirito), which is a good thing. You're able to see him both win and also fail miserably, allowing him to learn from his mistakes and gradually improve. He also has a kinda harem thing going on where it seems like every girl likes him, however I find it funny ashe is too oblivious to it that he only focuses on wanting to get with Aiz, the strongest girl on the planet, who is totally out of his league and he also gets extremely embarrassed around. With these girls loving him, there's also bound to be some fan-service around. Luckily, it's not too in your face that it makes the show insufferable, it is a decent amount without going too overboard.Comedy in a show like this is a bit of a double-edged sword as it could either go poorly or extremely well. Luckily, this show does comedy well. It strikes a fine balance between comedy and drama, able to be both funny and serious on a dime. I got a lot of enjoyment out of watching this show and I really look forward to season 2.",

            "content": "Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou Ka or \"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\" is one of my favorite guilty pleasures. First off, the story isn't very strong and is more focused around separate adventures than a main plot. The art is above average with well animated action sequences. The soundtrack fits the fantasy world setting well. And the characters aren't anything special.. BUT! Even though the story isn't anything special, as a fan of the fantasy genre, I freaking love this anime. It has an excellent and entertaining RPG setting which reminds me of Dungeonsand Dragons. This similarity is shown best through the stat sheet tattoo embedded in the back of the main character Bell Cranel who's main goal is to level up and become a stronger adventurer. While watching this series, I found myself being sucked into the fantasy world due to my love of the RPG elements included in the series. Each battle sequence is done extremely well and at points even feel emotional due to Bell constantly being pushed to new limits. An excellent representation of this would be Bell vs. the Ninth Floor Minotaur. Each fight is adrenaline pumping and unforgettable. I even found myself re-watching episodes just to some fights again. \\n\\n\r\nSo overall, is the anime worth watching and who is it for? This is a must watch for those who enjoy the fantasy/RPG genre. It doesn't do anything too special, but what it does is done right. Also.. I didn't really mention this in the main review, but if you enjoy fan service.. this anime has plenty.",

La trama en s\u00ed se desarrolla en \"el calabozo\"; que no es m\u00e1s que distintos pisos, como si fueran distintas cuevas, donde los que son bendecidos por alg\u00fan Dios, van all\u00ed a luchar contra esos monstruos para conseguir las gemas que esconden, y con ello, ganar dinero. En concreto, la historia se desarrolla desde el punto de vista de Bell Cranel, el \u00fanico bendecido por la Diosa Hestia.\r\nExiste el manga, yla novela corta, que es de d\u00f3nde ha salido la historia inicialmente. Para todos los gustos y colores. Es una historia que no tiene p\u00e9rdida. El elemento c\u00f3mico es la Diosa Hestia, con sus intentos de conseguir a Bell para ella sola. Sin embargo, Bell est\u00e1 centrado en Aiz, la mejor aventurera del calabozo. Desea llegar a ser como ella, y por ello se esfuerza como el que m\u00e1s para llegar a conseguirlo. La verdad, es que si analizamos la historia, transmite unos perfectos valores. Bell tiene un objetivo fijado: Llegar a ser tan bueno como lo es Aiz, y lucha por ello. No se queda parado esperando a que la Diosa Hestia se lo consiga. Sin embargo, recibe su ayuda. Le proporciona lo que necesita, para hacerse cada vez m\u00e1s fuerte; le dice sus estad\u00edsticas, en que ha mejorado desde la \u00faltima revisi\u00f3n, y que tiene que subir. El chico sube r\u00e1pido. Y por el camino va a haciendo distintos amigos que le acompa\u00f1an en su aventura.\\n\\n\r\nLa verdad es que recomiendo bastante esta historia, tanto si es la novela ligera, como el anime. Son bastante fieles entre s\u00ed, por lo que no importa cual sea el que veas.",

            "content": "DanMachi... yet another anime based on a fantasy world where dungeons are traversed as characters try to level up and become \"heroes\". Amid all the \"fan service\" stuff, which really isn't that much to be honest, DanMachi is quite a good show that delivers even with subject matter and plot that has been well traversed. \r\nThe appeal for DanMachi, and it's real charm doesn't come to fruition until about the middle of the season. The first few episodes are some what goofy, a little cringe. We are introduced to the world of families, guilds, parties, dungeons, gods and goddesses, monsters, and the characters that aretrying to live in this world. The set up is simple, yet all over the place. There is no large exposition, no be explanation of everything that exists in this world, and frankly, it doesn't need any of that. The story focuses on the ascent of Bell Cranel from zero to hero and it was a great journey. \\n\\n\r\nAt first Bell and his goddess are sad to watch and kind of annoying, this only lasts for a few episodes however. As we get to see how weak Bell really is, this is the moment it all begins to turn around. We get to see Bell get stronger and stronger and it really is amazing. His growth isn't just reserved for him however. As he gets stronger, the story gets better, more people decide to join him, he is no longer a sorry boy for us to look down on, but a hero we can stand behind.  \\n\\n\r\nThe story does progress quite rapidly, so I can understand why it is a bit absurd to see such a jump in Bell's abilities, but it doesn't make it any less fun to watch. The animation is quite amazing really. The fighting is immersive, it almost made want to throw a punch or two as I was watching. \\n\\n\r\nThe music is really complimentary and fitting as well. It feels like fantasy music and really amps up the moments as well. The series was really adept at making the big moments as large as possible while also making the slower quieter moments enjoyable.\\n\\n\r\nThe laughs come every now and again to fill the gaps  with enough action to keep you going from week to week. I had originally dropped this anime because I thought it would be a harem, funny, fan service oriented anime, but it transitioned beautifully to an anime full of action about a kid who just wants to be the coolest hero around.",

            "content": "Besides  the cover art I had no idea what to expect from  this, I didn't even read the description. I saw a standard looking Sshounen protag and a loli large \"plot\". But I decided to watch it anyway. It turned out pretty average. Average everything, except girls, and that is what makes the show bare able. \r\nStory: 5/10\r\nIt is strung up a lot like an \"stuck in an MMO game\",  only they are not stuck in an RPG. The world they live in, Osario, is a lot more like Monster Hunter than an MMO, but it is still very much like agame world. They level up, gain new skills, and form parties. The only new thing that this show adds to this formula is that gods exist in this world, and they form guilds of Hunters to try and become the best guild. Early versions of this show, like Log Horizon and SAO, and Konosuba from this season did this well. You can add this to that list. Though it is very average,  the changing of mechanics in  this show is fun. I like the actual monster hunter game and seeing a similar game is fun. The gods was also an interesting and new concept. \\n\\n\r\nArt: 7/10\\n\r\nLike a lot of J.C.  staff works, this show has decent art with  very good effects. The characters and backgrounds are nothing special, but all the effects are quite good. The monsters as well all look quite cool, especially the large monkey in ep.3.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 7/10\\n\r\nBesides the protag, all the voice acting is quite good. Inori Minase was very good as Hestia, Yoshimasa Hosoya always does well, and Haruka Tomatsu was one of my favorite performances in  the show even if she had a small role. In general however, I do not like Yoshitsugu  Matsouka. Kirito was already a boring character and he just made it worse. Here as well he just makes a shounen protag worse. He's okay when he just plays a high schooler( EX. Natsuki from Nijiiro days), but in any role where screaming is very prominent than he is never good. The background music here was one of the few times I actually payed attention to. Though I can not name any of the tracks, the very calm attitude of most of them was good. The OP/ED on the other hand were very forgettable. \\n\\n\r\nCharacters: 8/10\\n\r\nBesides our standard, dense shounen protag, everyone else in the cast is quite good. Hestia was funny, Aiz did not care, Lily was adorable, Welf reminded me of a chuunibyo, Ryu was a funny yandere, and Eina was a great older sister. As usual,  the best part of this Harem was the girls.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 6/10\\n\r\nEcchi is not one of my favorite genres, but when it is done well it is at the very least bare able. Though a lot of this show is just average, there are some parts, like the acting and characters that were quite good. Though the main character was a standard one, the others made it bare able. I usually do not like Loli's  but Hestia  is indeed the \"Bestia\". \\n\\n\r\nOverall: 7/10\\n\r\nBetter than most ecchi's and \"Stuck in a video game\" shows, Danmachi as most people call it is a show I can recommend if  you like either of those genres. If not, there is nothing that makes this show a must. Watch it if you want, but there is no need.",

            "content": "I see that Danmachi (Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka) is getting a lot of harsh reviews from people, so I thought I would include my own thoughts. I loved this anime, a perfect little story that is very cute and funny.\r\nPlot score: 7\r\nA lot of people are talking about how this show is awful, but I think the story is actually pretty good. There is clearly a lot going on that isn't fully explained, but it is pretty nice to have that mystery. The story clearly goes deeper than any of the characters really know themselves, which is likely whythe viewer is also kept in the dark about certain things. It is basically set up like a video game-style story, and something about that is just fantastic really.\\n\\n\r\nArt Score: 10!\\n\r\nI'm a big BIG fan of this art style, the monsters and characters are all really well done, the scenery and complex dungeon are done beautifully and I can't find a single fault with this art style, in my opinion.\\n\\n\r\nSound: 10\\n\r\nJust listen to it, really really listen to it and you will see that it is very well done.\\n\\n\r\nCharacter: 10\\n\r\nThe main characters and their relationships are very well explained and the development of each character's personality and connection with others is quite well done. Background and secondary characters even have a depth you don't get elsewhere. Some make the claim that the women in this story inexplicably fall in love with the main character, but once you really look at what the main character is and what he stands for you will see that he is charming in his own way.\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment: 10\\n\r\nThe combination of so many amazing things, a unique story, amazing art, perfect sound effects, and great characters, is truly a recipe for enjoyment. I almost never review anime, but this anime is easily in my top 10. It is very memorable, yet you can still rewatch it and gain new insight into the plot, characters, or their relationships.\\n\\n\r\nOverall: 9\\n\r\nThe only reason I give this a 9, is because I put the \"Story\" at 7. It really doesn't deserve a 7, in my opinion, but I can see why many people wouldn't like this video game-esque style of story telling. Since there isn't really a second season yet, (hope it happens) we are missing quite an important part of this story, yet another reason why I've decided to reduce it down to 7. If you're a fan of game plots, you will likely love the story as much as I did. While there are large breasted women, I feel that simply adds to the story and the development of the main character's personality more than it detracts from the story in favor of fanservice. \\n\\n\r\nI highly suggest you watch this movie if you're a fan of video games, action/romance, and underdog stories.\\n\\n\r\nSo, in short: 10/10 personally, 9/10 for most, and 1/10 for people who fail to read into the anime enough to fully understand and appreciate what has been done here.\\n\\n\r\nKeep your ears perked for the ending, the reveal there is very understated and almost an aside, but it truly shows why the main character is what he is and is essential to understanding what is going on.",

            "content": "Warning possible Spoilers\r\nThis show was a pure example of why adventuring can be really fun, but it can also be very dangerous if you don't watch yourself so make sure to bring your busty loli goddess for a little help.\r\nDanmachi is set in the city of Orario and the young adventurer called Bell Cranel along with his goddess Hestia are having trouble getting by with the kills Bell makes in the Dungeons until suddenly an encounter with the Swordsmen called Ais Wallenstein gave him new hope on being an adventurer.\r\nNow despite this show not having a very heavy story it was still very enjoyable towatch, it was fun and interesting seeing Bell get stronger and more experienced in the dungeons plus experiencing the dangers of being an adventurer since it isn't all fun and games there are dark aspects to being an adventurer and it was interesting seeing Bell overcome these problems.\\n\r\nIt was also fun seeing the relationship between Bell and Hestia since he is part of her familia, but she wants Bell to be more than just her familia member plus it was hilarious seeing the antics these two get into.\\n\r\nEven though this is a comedy most of the time there are a lot of serious moments which were pretty epic to watch like when Bell was fighting a possessed Minotaur, when Bell and his group were trapped in the dungeons and had to reach a safe zone by evading a huge boss or even the final battle itself were all epic moments in the series that were very entertaining and thrilling to watch.\\n\\n\r\nNow the characters were funny and pretty interesting since some characters had some pretty dark backstories.\\n\r\nBell Cranel the male MC is a likeable character because despite being weak when it comes to fighting early on he does slowly develop his powers and unlike most protagonists his powers aren't OP and there are plenty of moments where was in danger and needed others to help making him a teamplayer, he is also a kind and protective person especially when it comes to Hestia and his other teammates, however he gets easily intimidated by stronger foes which makes him do so rash decisions at times, but these moments are very few.\\n\r\nHestia the female MC is a Goddess and the head of her familia, she is a really funny, but caring character since Bell is the only member of her familia and that she has a crush on him she is very protective of him since she worries that whenever bell goes into the Dungeons she thinks he might die if he isn't careful, however she does get jealous of other girls flirting with Bell since she flirts with him herself hence why she dislikes Ais since she has caught Bell's eyes, but other than her jealousy she is a very funny character to have around.\\n\r\nThere is also the other members who join Hestia's familia like Lili who is a catgirl that has been under the command of other familias, but she has an extreme hatred for adventurers which is understandable since she is heavily abused by her adventurer teammates until she meet Bell which changed her insight on adventurers which inevitably made her form a crush on him which made Hestia jealous of her, she is a useful person collecting the items and crystals from dead monsters that the others kill.\\n\r\nThe other familia member is Welf who is a blacksmith that was originally part of the Hephaistos familia until he swapped familias he used to create magical weapons until he realised that people mainly used them to show off so he quit until Bell came along and showed him how useful an adventurers weapon is which gave him new insight, he is also a bit of a joker and becomes good friends with Bell very quickly.\\n\r\nThere are a few other characters like other familia members like Hephaistos who is a friend of hestia and it was fun watching these two argue from time to time.\\n\r\nAis Wallenstein is the weak link in the character section mainly because she isn't really given much character develop other than she is a badass which isn't enough for me to like her or have interest hell her other party members seemed more interesting which is why I hope they improve her character in the Sword Oratoria spinoff.\\n\\n\r\nThe Artstyle was pretty good I liked how the floors in the dungeons changed the more you go down and the place where Bell was lured into a trap by Lili looked pretty creepy and looked unnerving too, but there were areas like the safe zone which had crystals to light up the area that did look pretty amazing plus some of the magic effects like Bells firebolt attack or when all the adventurers worked together when fighting the giant monster at the end looked epic as hell. I liked the look of the world too even though it seems like what most fantasies would look like I thought it was a pretty interesting world and had a lot of different and colourful characters within it.\\n\\n\r\nThe comedy was well done and had me laughing most of the time like when Hestia and Loki were having a tantrum and started picking on their breast sizes or when Bell had an awkward situation with Ais and curved into a ball and ran away was pretty funny too. There are also a lot of moments where there is fanservice and we all know why Hestia fits this area too well, but that didn't put me off since i liked her personality (and figure), there was a few other moments too like the scene where Bell without much of a choice and Hermes spy on the girls taking a bath which ended up being a pretty hilarious moment.\\n\\n\r\nThe action was also pretty good too a lot of the battles that Bell and the others were in looked very life-threatening and I was on edge most of the time since the foes they fought looked very powerful and they mostly won on the very edge of death so the show nicely splits the action and comedy very well.\\n\\n\r\nOverall I thought this was a very fun show to watch true there isn't really much of a story here, but it really does shine in all it's other areas like the comedy, action, it's fantasy setting and the characters were fun too so if you're someone who does like a good fantasy anime then this is something to check out.",

The story is plain, lack of actions and a bit too slow for me. The characters are just so-so, just like any fantasy anime where the main character is underestimated guy, but super kind, super hard-working, loyal, naive, attracts many girls and at the end he's the one who'll be the hero. And the support character (Hestia) is a very CLINGY goddess, who is actually a nice girl, but meh...she's too annoying. I kept watching this anime, kinda hoped that there will be an event thatwould surprised me and made me think \"ahh, so this is what's it all about\" because it seemed there are many people who liked it. But, it disappointed me because even until the end of this season, the story was just like...well, if you're a gamer, this is just like the normal days that you spent in dungeons; meet another gamers, joined a party and grinding all day long.",

            "content": "Whether you're interested in finding the answer to the show's rhetorical question or not, you may find yourself surprised with what the show is actually about: a fantasy world that uses RPG tropes and concepts as a part of the world as opposed to a virtual world with \"player's\" avatars interacting inside. The show treats nothing as digital, which is an interesting and refreshing approach that works surprisingly well. Sure their are tons of cute girls that fawn of the main but the show smartly makes that a sub-plot part of the show. The Ven Diagram between those who enjoy Harem anime and Fantasy-Action animedon't share all that much in common. The characters themselves and their motivations are solid enough and not annoying or eye-roll-inducing to make you care about these characters. The animation and action is helps to make moments as tense, humorous or dramatic as they need to be. While the detail in the world building is fairly thinner than most (at least in the first 10 episodes) it's because they show goes a show not tell approach. There is no intro/lore lesson about the ancient history and how the structure of the world and society came to be, mostly helped due to the fact that these concepts aren't foreign to us, the viewer, in the first place. Though what it shows isn't always captivating or thought-provoking, but clever and often real-world referential. Simple, fun, and (despite its flaws) I probably enjoy it way more than it deserves but it still deserves a skeptic's chance.",

Then I read a review in the OtakuUSA that convinced me to give a shot. And it was worth it. The character designs are a little ecchi but the plot and action make up for any shortcomings. I liked that our hero, Bell, plays an an average guy as opposed to a hero who\u2019s simply more powerful than everyone else. And that he cannot escape danger by simply getting/being more powerful than his enemies. I like the depth and backstory provided to each character. It makesthe characters seem real and personable. The action was tense and gripping with an actual sense of danger. They live in a world where journeys into the dungeon aren\u2019t safe; survival is not guaranteed. It also lacks my two least favorite anime clich\u00e9s: a high school setting and characters making bad decisions because the writers need to create conflict. As much as I enjoyed this series, I do have one complaint, and that\u2019s the character of Hestia. Her feelings for Bell seem purposely undeclared by the writers because she\u2019s designed to be cute and buxom; ergo no straight man would reject her if she confessed to them. And since Bell is straight, he\u2019d say yes if she did, so she doesn\u2019t. So she overly protective of him when he\u2019s around other women which reminds me of brother complex (my third least favorite anime clich\u00e9). It just seems like there was half a dozen better ways to handle this unrequited love part of the story but they followed the curved line to circumvent the issue.\\n\r\nIn conclusion I loved it and would recommend it to everyone!\\n",

            "content": "I'm just going to refer to this as DanMachi. It's too long to type out the title every single time.\r\nDanMachi is an anime that suffers mostly from its length. The anime series only covers the first three novels, which barely even mentions the beginning of its overarching story. As a result, the story more or less just ends on a cliffhanger after the first story arc's climatic battle. It is more or less just about Bell Cranel wanting to become stronger. His early desire to rescue a beautiful woman and be loved by her is sidetracked immediately at the beginning. The result is that theoverall story suffers and we do not get to see a larger picture of events.\\n\\n\r\nThe art is one of the things I like about the series. They are fairly simplistic, but it works. There is quite a large cast of characters and best of all, they do not feel like copy paste, which tends to be a problem when there are tons and tons of characters. The backgrounds are quite beautiful at times and even though the characters spend most of the time in the Dungeon, there is enough variation to make it feel like they are not trekking through a cave all the time. \\n\\n\r\nThe biggest problem though is the length of the series. At 13 episodes, it is incredibly short and as a result, we do not see character development nor progress in the overall story. This is unfortunately all things that happen in the novels that take place AFTER where the anime ends. In the end, this is basically an anime that had to suffer because of its length. Had it been 26 episodes when we essentially start seeing the true conflicts between the Gods and the Labyrinth grow, the series would have been a lot better. Sadly, this is only available in the Light Novels and that is where you are going to have to go to continue the story.",

            "content": "Danmachi is pretty average overall, Its story follows Bell who wants to be a \"Hero\" as he levels up and crawls the dungeons.. And honestly that is about it..\r\nThe series doesn't give him any other motivation then \"I want to be a hero\" and I guess you could say he also wants to be as good as Aiz but that's basically the same as \"I want to be a hero\"\r\nThe characters are all pretty much generic, Even if Heistia is adorable she's still your \"Loli with big boobs\" character and Lilly is your \"Furry Loli with little boobs\" \r\nNo characters actually matter to the storybesides a few moments, The blonde elf from the tavern does more to advance the plot than most on screen characters. She tells him to get stronger he needs to go on his own \"Adventure\" telling him to find himself basically, Which gives him the motivation to push forward and defeat the Minotaur.\\n\\n\r\nThe show can be funny and have a great laugh but it fails horribly at romance.\\n\\n\r\nAiz the blonde girl that saves Bell is incredibly emotionless and honestly dumb. Every other female in the series has more character than her.. I'm not sure why she is so emotionless, I would say they were trying to make her ATLEAST likable to anyone and everyone.\\n\\n\r\nThe romance in this show is completely thrown aside every time is comes up. Every time there is a romantic moment they completely stomp on it by shoving humor in there so it doesn't become too heart touching for the children.. because it has its \"Harem\" of girls that love Bell it can't be too romantic with one otherwise the audience wont have anything to fight over.\\n\\n\r\nThe one thing that saves the show is its fight scenes. Ever fight is fun and entertaining to look at while also seems to have some sort of actual flow to it. The boss fights are the main reason I watch the show.. Every boss fight hypes it up from beginning to end and pays off extremely well, The sound track really backs up these fights and does great to really pump you up. Even the smaller fights are still great.\\n\\n",

            "content": "This happened to be the show I have my thoughts decently collected on, so I decided to write a review. Why did I decide to watch Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?? Well, the title was interesting. (Question titles are so alluring) . Secondly, I am fairly obsessed with this kind of fantasy genre(Not enough to watch SAO all the way through, but that is a different story.)  Danmachi has a voice actress I have come to like recently Inori Minase(for Rem of course) who voices Hestia in the show. Oddly enough she has a romance with\"Bell Kun\" Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who voices Betelgeuse in Re:Zero(let that sink in). Now, on to the review of DanMachi . (I decided to start with the good parts this time) \\n\r\nArt(7/10) \\n\r\nDanMachi has varying degrees of art quality. CGI is a pet peeve of mine because often it makes anime painful to look at. Danmachi has CGI good and CGI bad moments due to somewhat rushed work. Aside from CGI, DanMachi boasts some great fight scenes backgrounds and character design. Hestia even has her own Wikipedia page for her iconic ribbon. \\n\r\nSound(8/10) \\n\r\nI can't really complain here. The soundtrack is pretty good during key moments, but the OP and ED are pretty forgettable. Danmachi stars the protagonist man himself, Yoshitsugu Matsuoka who doesn't do a bad job voicing Bell Kranel. Inori Minase voices goddess Hestia and is pretty good for the role.  \\n\r\nStory(3/10) \\n\r\nWhy does Danmachi insist on making itself a harem? At first, Bell was only interested in Aiz Wallenstein with Hestia occasionally dropping hints of her attraction. Later in Danmachi, Hestia is full on obsessed with \"Bell kun\" and every girl(except Aiz) with more than 5 mins of screentime develops some kind of crush on him. I guess it's all in the name of the show though .Besides amassing a harem army, Danmachi has no other direction. When given characters like Lilliluka Erde and Welf Crozzo with interesting backstories, Danmachi kind of tosses their screentime to the side. As a result, arcs seem underdeveloped and unfocused. \\n\r\nCharacter(3/10) \\n\r\nThe main character Bell Cranel is bland, overpowered, and underdeveloped. His lines are the sound equivalent of sawdust. As for the overpowered part, I will try to keep as few spoilers as possible but most of his powers are handed to him on a golden platter. Bell is motivated by wanting to become a hero, but I just can't see any motivation for it. As for Hestia, she was pretty well developed but the writers decided to screw her up. She was a caring guardian figure at the beginning, but eventually became the obsessive girlfriend type who couldn't stand when any girl even breathed on her Bell Kun. Aiz Wallenstein was Bell's main focus and kind of mysterious. The fact that most things about her were a mystery seemed like a feature until it became an obvious crutch for the fact that the writers hadn't come up with anything for her character. She is a very powerful heroine, that is all. There was a lot of characters with good potential for writing stories with i.e Lilliluka Erde,Welf Crozzo,Ry\u016b Lion etc... all potentially great characters forgotten, marginalized, turned into harem food, or some irritating combination of the three. When a show insists on focussing on its weak link (in this case \"Bell Kun\"), it breeds malice within me. \\n\r\nEnjoyment(6/10) \\n\r\nIn the end, I would have given Danmachi a much worse rating if  there were not some parts I enjoyed about it. Danmachi had some great potential. Potential wasted. I enjoy the music, scenes, and some parts about the characters but I don't have high hopes for the second season if a second season is released.",

I think this works better for anime like these, but that may just be me. Otherwise we have our standard shonen harem setting: A boy who wants to be a hero surrounded by hot girls who want to mate with him. Okay,that desciption is a little unfair, as the world is built well in my eyes, but that's basically the premse of this show.\\n\r\n6/10\\n\\n\r\nArt:\\n\r\nI admit, the character design isn't the best around. It's not like they look boring or anything, but the faces aren't very imaginative. The good guys have the smooth faces, the bad guys are more angular. The fight scenes on the other hand look really amazing. This is one of the cases where I do not mind the use of CGI (which I am not a fan of). The battles are flashy and the movements are smooth. I think that outweighs the more mediocre parts.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nSound:\\n\r\nThe opening song has to be one of the dullest J-Pop songs I've ever heard used in an anime. Sorry, but that didn't get me in the mood to watch this show at all. The ending was a lot better, maybe that's because I'm a sucker for well placed wind instruments. The background music was fine. The voice acting could have been better in my eyes. There wasn't a voice that made me think \"I wanna strangle you until you stop talking\" but nothing memorable came out of it either.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nCharacters:\\n\r\nAfter decades of harem anime, we should all be used to bland, ignorant male leads at this point. Bell is no exception (but at least he's a pretty boy so it's somewhat understandable the girls like him). Hestia apparently is a love or hate character, depending on wether you support her ship or not. I actually saw her more of a mother figure for Bell (or is that just a surpressed fetish?). The rest of the cast was hit or miss. I liked Loki, Hephaestus and Welf for example, but Lili, Freiya or Aiz never really connected with me. The bad guys were incredibly bland, basically being assholes because they are...assholes.\\n\r\n5/10\\n\\n\r\nEnjoyment:\\n\r\nDespite all the criticism I expressed up to now, I felt well entertained by DanMachi. Maybe it really was the influence of KonoSuba and the comedic aspects of this anime that helped me not to take this anime too seriously. If you're looking for a dramatic take on this genre, you are looking at the wrong series. DanMachi is enjoyable on a popcorn cinema level. You are not supposed to think too deep into it, you just have to sit back and watch and hopefully enjoy.\\n\r\n8/10\\n\\n\r\nOverall:\\n\r\n6.4/10",

            "content": "This show is OK.\r\nJust OK.\r\nIt didn't impress me, but it kept me entertained for its run so I guess it wasn't that bad.  I'd watch it again if a friend really wanted to watch it with me, but I'd never pull it up myself.  I'm not sorry I watched it, but I won't recommend it.\r\nA lot of people have compared this show to Sword Art Online, but for my part, I watched this after KonoSuba and immediately thought \"oh, this is what that was a parody of.\"  So what does \"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\" (DanMachi fromhere on in the review) have to offer?\\n\\n\r\nIt has action, harem antics, and comedy mostly centered around said harem antics.  And that doesn't sound so bad.  It's at least a decent looking show, and both action and comedy are rather nice to have, and I'm not even opposed to harem antics.\\n\\n\r\nThere are a couple places, though, where it falls apart.  The elements of the show don't mix will.  This is a world where the gods of mythology, such as Hestia and Loki, have come down from the heavens to live among mortals and grant favored champions their blessing... which takes the form of being a player character in an RPG, apparently.  Maybe coming in from the west I have a different perspective but when I see a straight-up RPG-mechanics universe it strikes me as inherently farcical, yet here that aspect is played surprisingly entirely seriously.  It's a slight disconnect, but it highlights the most important thing I feel that DanMachi gets wrong: I never really know whether I should take it seriously or not.\\n\\n\r\nThere are shows where a disconnect between serious and humorous can work, but here the elements distracted from each other.  It was hard to laugh at Hestia's antics when the fighting takes itself deadly serious, and at times it was hard to get into the death, bloodshed, and trauma to be inflicted on some characters when coming off more lighthearted or playful elements.  If this wanted to be a serious show (well, work, I haven't read the light novels but I imagine at least some of this applies there), that would be fine -- drop or downplay the RPG mechanics, play the harem aspects with more emotional weight, and cut down or out the fanservice-style comedy antics.  If it wanted to be parodical, that would be fine too -- take some emphasis off the life-or-death nature of dungeon delving and the suffering certain characters go through.  As it is it's just muddy.\\n\\n\r\nThe other weak point in the show is the cast.  I don't hate them, there aren't any characters whose names I'll be cursing, but I think that they were overall... well, the on-site rating system says it all: Mediocre.  Bell is mostly a bland nice guy who's not comedy-stupid but isn't the sharpest tack either.  Supposedly he wants to pick up girls which could have been a really funny start for a character, but you'd think he'd notice the girls throwing themselves at him if he actually ran with that.  Ais Wallenstein is the tight-lipped (EXTREMELY tight-lipped) seemingly emotionless girl we're supposed to assume has a sweet core who really hammered home to me how I'm tired of the amount of play that sort of love interest is getting.  Hestia actually annoyed me.  She had some annoying moments but her clingy love interest act got kind of old kind of fast.  The supporting cast could be nice at times, but at times what seemed like a good bit of development could be thrown out, either by the arc being resolved too soon or the character who comes out of it not feeling like an outgrowth of the character who came before.\\n\\n\r\nThat said, was this a bad show?  No.  It was pretty to look at, the action was decent, and even the comedy had at least a couple hits.  I just have no desire to go back for seconds.",

If anything the main character is your typical dou*** who can't do much of anything right. The characters in this story are not developed well enough and the enjoyment only comes from laughter. The repetitive themes you hear will leave you either annoyed or excited that something might actually happen. The way this story is, you really don't go anywhere other than see corruption and complaining. \r\nWatch this if you want a fewlaughs, otherwise be ready for the repetitive (spoiler)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\r\nExplosion theme of nuisance played more than 50 times an episode....",
